Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third-largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

WATCH: UCP leads NDP ahead of 2019 Alberta election

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 per cent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 per cent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

Scandal brewing

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jeff Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

READ MORE: Pipeline politics to affect economy, two elections in 2019, economists say

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University.

Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

WATCH: Jason Kenney responds to Caylan Ford’s resignation from UCP race

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

“A week ago, I would not have thought there was much of a path to victory for the NDP,” he said. “Now I think there’s a slim path, which is better than none.”",Canada’s battered oil industry cheering for Alberta’s opposition party in upcoming election,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5079770/oil-industry-alberta-2019-election/

Alberta NDP leader Rachel Notley

Alberta’s NDP leader was in Lethbridge, where she announced a plan to add more long-term beds for seniors if her government is re-elected.

Rachel Notley made the announcement at a seniors centre in Lethbridge.

She said 2,000 new spots are in addition to 2,000 she promised – and delivered – in the 2015 election.

Watch below: NDP Leader Rachel Notley spoke on Thursday about what her party plans to do for aging Albertans if re-elected. Tom Vernon reports.

Notley said the $170-million investment ensures the new beds are added over the next five years and the existing ones are kept.

The leader said in addition to benefiting seniors and their families, the announcement means jobs for health care professionals.

She accused her chief rival, United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney, of wanting an American-style health-care system that costs people more.

UCP leader Jason Kenney

The leader of Alberta’s United Conservatives is promising a referendum on equalization if there’s no major progress on market-opening pipelines.

Jason Kenney says if he becomes premier the matter would be put to voters on Oct. 18, 2021 – the same date as the next municipal elections in Alberta.

The federal equalization program is meant to even out fiscal disparities between so called “have” and “have-not” provinces.

READ MORE: Why Alberta doesn’t get equalization payments

Despite its economic doldrums, Alberta remains a “have” province.

Kenney says Albertans can no longer tolerate other governments benefiting from Alberta resources while doing everything they can to block development.

He is also vowing to take Ottawa to court if a contentious federal bill on resource project reviews becomes law and to block energy shipments to any province that block pipelines.

Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel said if he were elected premier in the April 16 provincial election he would double the number of educational assistants in schools.

Mandel said a $230-million boost in funding would allow for the extra support in kindergarten to Grade 12 classrooms.

He said teachers need help as classes become increasingly diverse with children from different cultures, backgrounds and circumstances.

The Alberta Party would also create an agency to test students with possible learning challenges so they could get help as soon as possible.

Mandel made the announcement at Al Mustafa Academy in south Edmonton before heading to a rally in Calgary.

Alberta Liberal leader David Khan

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan said he would improve child welfare, education and justice for Indigenous people if his party were to win the April 16 election.

Khan said a Liberal government would create regional Indigenous child protection offices, run by Indigenous groups, to help keep children in their home communities.

He said there would be Indigenous-led revisions to the school curriculum and the creation of Indigenous language immersion programs.

READ MORE: Alberta election promise tracker — Where do the parties stand on the major issues?

The party would also require provincial courts to use Indigenous-based sentencing principles and amend legislation making juries more representative.

Khan also said he would work to get six new seats in the legislature specifically for elected Indigenous members.

Khan, a lawyer specializing in Indigenous rights and land-claims litigation, won the party’s leadership in 2017.

“Alberta Liberals believe there must be reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in government and society,” Khan said in a release Thursday.

“Indigenous Albertans face systemic racism and the consequences of Canada’s violent colonial past. Our plan will help addresses these issues.”

The success of the annual event is considered a bellwether for the Calgary-based oil and gas industry, as many of the sponsors who pay to have their company names on the 36 rigs competing in the 10-day July tribute to cowboy culture are energy industry players.

In the end, the results got a bit of boost this year over 2018, with bids totalling $3,285,000. Troy Dorchester, the 29th driver in the auction lineup, received the top bid of the night in a thrilling bidding war. Graham Construction came out the winner at $150,000.

""We have a great mix of new and returning advertisers who are now preparing to celebrate with us during our annual event in July,"" said Paul Kavanagh, chair of the Calgary Stampede Chuckwagon committee, in a release.

About 80 per cent of the canvas auction proceeds go to the drivers and the rest is used for prize money, safety and other chuckwagon initiatives.

Champion driver Kurt Bensmiller, who won the chuckwagon derby for the fourth time in five years in 2018, says the calling of an Alberta election on Tuesday created more uncertainty for an economy battered by recent commodity price volatility and slowing oilfield activity.

Alberta's NDP introduced controversial oil production curtailments in January and is investing in crude-by-rail capacity to fill a shortfall in export pipeline room.

Bids up slightly from last year

""I'm hoping with the economy the way it is, if we stay close to what it was last year or even the average comes up a bit as a whole, the driver group will be pretty excited about that,"" he said before the auction took place.

The top money bid last year came from Versatile Energy Services, Ltd., a private oilfield services company based in the resort town of Sylvan Lake in central Alberta.

Versatile president Kent Stormoen planned to be at Thursday's event but declined to make early predictions for results given the province's current uncertain times.

""The industry still isn't rolling like we expect it to but (the sponsorship) did help with the exposure of our company,"" he said.

""I think there's a lot of uncertainty with the provincial election coming now and the new federal budget that's come out.""

Stampede spokeswoman Kristina Barnes said Wednesday the number of bidders who pre-registered for the auction was around 130, a bit behind last year's pace.

The record year for overall tarp auction results came in 2012, when bidders pledged just over $4 million — including the highest bid of $300,000 by oilfield services firm Tervita Corp. At the time, oil prices were hovering above US$100 per barrel versus recent prices of around US$60 per barrel.","Stampede chuckwagon auction bids tick up despite oil prices, Alberta election call",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/canvas-auction-calgary-stampede-2019-1.5067125

Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties: Liberals ...","Regardless of who wins the 2019 provincial election, Alberta has been fundamentally altered by the results of the 2015 election and its aftermath.

This is one of the themes of Orange Chinook, a book I co-edited with my colleagues Keith Brownsey, Richard Sutherland, and David Taras at Mount Royal University.

In several chapters, the book highlights how the last provincial election brought to the fore a number of demographic and political changes that had been bubbling below the surface for years.

Alberta has a reputation as a conservative place, but a progressive evolution has been happening in its largest cities. The 2015 election also saw a breakthrough for women in politics, dramatically shifting what was once a male-dominated landscape. We witnessed, too, the rise of Indigenous activism, an undercurrent that is rising, increasingly, to the surface.

Many of these changes seem permanent, and the net effect appears to be the end of decades-long political dynasties that characterized this province for so long.

In short, Alberta politics is becoming more ""normal"" in the Canadian context.

Toward a two-party system

From 1905 to 2015, Alberta was unique in Canada. It was a province dominated by a single party.

Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties: Liberals (1905-1921), the United Farmers of Alberta (1921-1935), Social Credit (1935-1971), and the Progressive Conservatives (1971-2015).

Moreover, when the dynasty was finally defeated, it was never really a contender again. The once-dominant party often disappeared entirely.

Alberta PC leader Jim Prentice leaves the stage after election results came in on Tuesday, May 5, 2015, showing the NDP had won a majority, toppling the PC colossus that has dominated the province for more than four decades. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)

The 2015 election replicated this pattern. After their defeat, the PCs voted themselves out of existence when they merged with the Wildrose Party to form the new United Conservative Party.

But the situation is now different. If the UCP wins the 2019 election, as polls currently suggest, it's unlikely to govern for 44 years. And the NDP is unlikely to disappear.

Instead, Alberta is moving toward a two-party system, with the NDP on the left and the UCP on the right. With this structure, it more closely resembles the political landscape in other Canadian provinces.

Alberta has never had a party lose power and then come back and win another election. But that day is coming.

And the path to victory for any party, increasingly, runs through Alberta's largest cities.

The rise of cities

Rural Alberta had been the political bedrock of previous political dynasties, but the election of the NDP in 2015 was remarkable for its lack of a powerful rural minister in the vein of Hugh Horner, Marv Moore, Ken Kowlaski or Ed Stelmach.

The NDP, despite winning a handful of rural seats, was widely seen as ""the party of cities,"" as James Wilt describes it in one chapter of the book.

Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise, given the success of progressive candidates at a municipal level.

In the case of Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, Dave Bronconnier, Al Duerr, and even a young Ralph Klein could not be described as either fiscal or social conservatives. The situation was the same in Edmonton with Don Iveson, Stephen Mandel, Bill Smith, and Jan Reimer.

Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson and Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi share the stage at at the University of Alberta for the 10th annual Hurtig Lecture. (CBC)

The longevity of the Progressive Conservative dynasty at a provincial level masked changes that were already underway in Alberta's two biggest cities.

For Roger Epp, who contributed another chapter to Orange Chinook, the fiasco over the NDP's farm workers bill and some insensitive remarks about the carbon tax showed a government that was, in his words, ""post-rural.""

The 2015 election, in Epp's view, put the electoral stamp on a number of trends that had been occurring in rural Alberta: a declining population, the increasing encroachments of urban life, the loss of health and education services, and the rural way of life quickly fading.

Indeed, the percentage of MLAs from rural Alberta has been in a slow but steady decline as urban and suburban populations grow. As recently as 2001, less than half of MLAs came from Calgary and Edmonton. For the 2019 election, when the suburbs are included, it will be two-thirds.

And in both 2012 and 2015, rural MLAs were mostly on the opposition side of the legislature. If the UCP forms government in 2019, a majority of rural MLAs will be back on the government side. But this will not bring back the political glory days. Those days are gone.

So too, are the days of politics being a man's game.

Alberta steps into the future

When Alison Redford won the PC leadership race in 2011, the Globe and Mail carried a notoriously condescending front-page headline: ""Alberta steps into the present.""

But as Lori Williams shows in her chapter comparing the leadership styles of Danielle Smith, Alison Redford, and Rachel Notley, Albertans have had several women succeed in a hitherto masculine environment.

These changes are permanent.

It was Notley — not Justin Trudeau — who introduced the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canada.

Meanwhile the UCP, which had been mocked for having more men in its caucus named Richard than it did women, has nominated dozens of women to run in 2019.

The days of Alberta politics being so heavily male-dominated are over.

A final demographic change is the rise of Indigenous political activism.

Indigenous votes

Brad Clark, in his chapter of Orange Chinook, demonstrates the NDP was overwhelmingly supported by Indigenous people in the 2015 election.

In fact, there were three ridings that were significantly impacted by First Nations and Métis votes: Lesser Slave Lake, Peace River, and Wetaskiwin-Camrose.

The potential for clashes over energy infrastructure, environmental considerations, revenue sharing, and the constitutionally mandated duty to consult means future Alberta governments need to respond to Indigenous people.

There are those who believe that the election of the NDP was an accident and that Alberta is really an ideologically conservative province going back to the Social Credit days.

But is that true?

Politics in the new Alberta

The concluding chapter by Anthony Sayers and David Stewart — using post-election survey data from 2008, 2012, and 2015 — shows that notion is more myth than reality.

On most questions of political values, they write, ""stereotypes notwithstanding, voters in Alberta appear broadly supportive of a substantial role for the state with respect to government spending.""

This was also replicated by a spring 2018 survey for CBC by Janet Brown and John Santos, who co-wrote a chapter on polling in the book.

The chapter on the fiscal situation in Alberta, written by Ron Kneebone and Jennifer Zwicker, provides more evidence that Albertans are not particularly fiscally conservative. In reality, they say, we like high government spending and low taxes.

For decades, Albertans could get away with that because the gap between revenue and expenses was covered by rich oil and gas royalties. When those royalties decline, as they did in 2015, budget deficits occur.

Whoever wins the 2019 election will need to make some hard choices to address Alberta's fiscal situation.

The titular Orange Chinook refers to the winds of change that carried the NDP to victory in 2015. But chinooks can be temporary. We could see the government voted out of office in 2019.

However, as the sub-title indicates — Politics in the New Alberta — what we witnessed four years ago represents a much more durable shift than just a change of governing parties.

Which is why the border is unlikely to be a major election issue, after all.","Whatever their other troubles, the Liberals appear to have avoided an election-defining crisis at the border. Officials have contained a situation that only a year ago threatened to spiral out of control. And now a more durable solution to the problem of irregular border crossings may be at hand.

We still don’t know what might come this summer, what group of temporary U.S. residents might decide their odds of not being deported would improve if they came here rather than stayed there. And the fact remains this new stream of immigrants is now an entrenched fact of life.

But at least the federal government has stabilized the situation and is working with the Americans on an enduring fix. File the border issue, at least for now, under “could have been worse.”

Story continues below advertisement

Just to remind: Under the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the United States, the claims of people seeking asylum in Canada at border crossings from the United States are usually rejected, because the U.S. is considered a safe place for refugees.

In 2017, claimants began coming into Canada at places other than regular crossings, exploiting a loophole in the agreement. Somalis and then Haitians dominated the flow. Once detained by the RCMP, they claimed asylum, which meant they could remain in Canada while they waited for their case to be heard.

The hostility of the Trump administration toward asylum seekers turned a trickle into a flood. By the end of the year, the RCMP had intercepted 20,593 irregular crossers. And as 2018 got under way, the year-over-year numbers increased. Three times as many people made claims in April, 2018, as in April, 2017. This time, many of the crossers were coming to Canada from Nigeria by way of the United States.

Gradually, however, the government managed to stem the flow, in part by convincing the Americans to stop issuing visas to many Nigerian applicants. By December, the year-over-year numbers were down by a third. Last month, they were down by almost half.

In the budget released Tuesday, the Liberal government committed $1.2-billion over five years to improve border security and speed the processing of claims, along with legislation that aims to “better manage, discourage and prevent irregular migration,"" though there was no information on what that legislation may look like. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in Mississauga on Thursday that most Canadians continue to favour immigration, though he acknowledged the issue has become “politically charged.”

Anything might happen this summer, such as a new group fearful of being deported from the United States that decides to make their way to Canada. But for now, the situation at the border could best be described as chronic rather than acute.

And as my colleague Michelle Zilio reports, Canada and the United States are in talks that would modify the Safe Third Party Agreement so that police could escort people crossing the border to a checkpoint, where their application for entry would then be denied.

Story continues below advertisement

Will Canada and the United States ever conclude such an agreement? “I’ll believe it when I see it,” Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel said.

She remains unimpressed with a Liberal approach that continues to see hundreds of people crossing the border every month. The trendline may be down, at least temporarily, but the fact remains that there were only about a thousand fewer border-crossers in 2018 than in 2017.

“What they’ve done is normalize the situation,” Ms. Rempel said in an interview.

It’s a fair point. Canadians should never accept, as a matter of course, that customs and security forces do not have control over the southern border, that people fearing deportation from the United States can come here and make asylum claims by exploiting a legal loophole. That’s just wrong.

But if the situation is far from ideal, it’s also a lot better than it was.

The Liberals' 2015 election platform hung on a pledge to invest heavily in critical infrastructure, roads and ...","OTTAWA — Finance Minister Bill Morneau sprinkled a little government funding on nearly everyone Tuesday, including key Liberal constituencies — young people, women, and seniors — who helped deliver the Grits their victory in 2015.

In his pre-election budget, Morneau announced $26.7 billion in new spending since the fall economic statement — nearly all of the $27.8 billion in additional revenues the government brought in since the November update and is forecast to bring in over the next four years.

For young people, many of whom voted for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in droves last time and are now about to, or just starting to, pay off their student loans, Morneau announced that their interest rates would be slashed and a six-month interest-free grace period adopted.

For students taking time off to deal with medical emergencies, parental responsibilities, or mental health issues, the government said it would also offer up to 18 months of interest-free, payment-free leave.

Watch: Morneau discusses his spending plan

The Liberals pledged to spend more money to help encourage students to enter the skills trades, while also instituting a pilot program that would allow students to gain more international work experience.

For millennials concerned they'll be shut out of the housing market, the Liberals proposed the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporations help with down payments — a type of interest-free loan payable when the home is sold. They also announced measures that allow first-time home buyers who have saved in their RRSP to use $35,000, up from the current $25,000 towards their down payment.

The Liberals' gendered budgeting lens was noticeable in a new measure that allows couples who split to use the first-time home buyers plan towards a second dwelling, after the collapse of their relationship. Granting student researchers paid parental leave is another measure aimed at women voters.

Seniors, who public opinion polling suggests voted for the Liberals in greater numbers in 2015, received $1.86 billion — most of it directed at low-income seniors through a program that would allow them to keep more of the money they earn in part-time jobs without seeing their Guaranteed Income Supplement clawed back.

The Liberals also pledged $100 million over five years for seniors programs and promised to begin payments to Canada Pension Plan contributors automatically at age 70 to ensure that no one misses out on money owed to them.

For Canadian pensioners, such as those at Sears or Nortel, who saw their companies go bankrupt and their benefits vanish, the government offered to make tweaks to the law — giving courts a greater ability to review executive compensation and to clarify in federal law that if a pension plan is terminated its participants must still receive the same benefits as when it existed. The measures, however, are a far cry from what the New Democrats champion.

Another NDP priority that was ignored in the budget is the party's call for a universal pharmacare program.

The Liberals announced baby steps. A new Canadian Drug Agency would attempt to buy in bulk and lower drug prices, all the while setting up a national formulary. By 2022, an annual $500-million strategy would see the federal government assist with buying expensive drugs for rare diseases.

Mostafa Askari, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa, said he thinks the government has given itself some room to make a pharmacare announcement this summer.

""I assume that is the case. Whether they have the fiscal room or not, that is a different issue,"" he said. ""It doesn't look like there is a lot of fiscal room if they want to stay in their current deficit track.""

Some proposals are building blocks

Some of the Liberals' flagship budget proposals, such as the new Canada Training Benefit, also seem designed as building blocks towards a larger program.

The Canada Training Benefit offers Canadians aged 25 to 64 an annual $250-a-year credit, to a lifetime limit of $5,000, to put towards half the cost of taking a course. The program, which is planned to begin in late 2020, would guarantee workers the right to take time off to train with the knowledge that their job would be secure. Employees would also be allowed to collect employment insurance for up to four weeks that can be used over four years to help pay for everyday necessities while away from work.

""This is the first time in the history of our country where Canadians actually have training now as a right,"" Hassan Yussuff, the president of the Canadian Labour Congress, told HuffPost Canada. People won't have to wait until they lose their jobs to access training, he said. ""I think this will fundamentally change the psychology of how people view training and, more importantly, hopefully, take advantage of it.""

The budget is peppered with hundreds of millions of dollars of new money for veterans and their families, the arts, Canada's military, international development assistance in the Middle East, the fight against opioid addiction and other health measures, as well as research and development and another $554 million more to fix Phoenix, the federal government's problem-plagued payment system for public servants.

However, the Liberals want Canadians to know about a few more programs they plan to pitch at people's front doors.

Liberals make pledge on high-speed internet

The first is a pledge to bring high-speed internet to every part of the country by 2030. The Liberals have talked about this; they've already invested in bringing high-speed internet to rural areas; and now they say they'll do it, in three electoral mandates.

The second, to make good on their promise that Canada will be selling only zero-emission vehicles by 2040, the Grits are ponying up $300 million over three years to give Canadians who purchase an electric battery or hydrogen fuel cell vehicle a $5,000 rebate on purchases under $45,000. The Liberals also plan to invest $130 million over five years to deploy recharging and refuelling stations across the country — in urban and remote locations — so Canadians aren't stranded when they use their green cars.

Two other big ticket items reflect government priorities, electoral considerations, and a rare admission that the original implementation suffered from insufficient pick-up, or, in the case of measures for Indigenous, Métis and Inuit Canadians, insufficient money.

""What we've seen is we've not been able to get as many projects done in some places, places like Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, as we'd like,"" Morneau said, in explaining a one-time $2.2 billion top-up to municipalities to ensure that ""more [infrastructure] projects get done across our country.""

The Liberals' 2015 election platform hung on a pledge to invest heavily in critical infrastructure, roads and water treatment plants, for example; green infrastructure, such as expanded transit; and social infrastructure, such a daycare spaces and social housing.

Watch: Former budget watchdog Kevin Page weighs in on spending plan

Approximately one-fifth of the total budget, $4.7 billion, is new program spending for Indigenous, Inuit and Métis. It includes, for example, $739 million over five years, increasing to $185 million annually after that, to address repairs to vulnerable water systems, operator training and for other programs to ensure First Nations communities can have safe drinking water. The Liberals have spent $2 billion since 2015, but with the new money say they are on track to eliminate all water advisories by March 2021.

The Liberals are also pledging $1.2 billion over three years to implement ""Jordan's Principle"" to ensure First Nations children can access health, social and educational services they need, when they need them.

When asked if the Liberals' budget focus on reconciliation had anything to do with the backlash from Indigenous communities after one of their leaders, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general, voiced concerns about Trudeau's handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, the finance minister said no.

The Liberals have already spent $11 billion focused on Indigenous peoples and with this budget would be spending $17 billion by 2021, Morneau said.

""It's not a personality driven thing. It's driven by the fact we know that in this country we need to get this right. We've got a lot of work to do, and we're going to stay on it,"" he said.

Sean Kilpatrick/CP Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau speak as they walk to the House of Commons in Ottawa, Tuesday March 19, 2019.

One promise that is out the window — and has been since the Trudeau Liberals' first budget in 2016 — is the balancing of the books by the time the next election rolls around. The budget plans for a $19.8 billion deficit next year, which is forecast to fall to $9.8 billion by 2023-2024. The Liberals have planned for an annual $3 billion contingency cushion.

Morneau sidestepped questions about why the Liberals had made that pledge if they didn't intend to live by it.

""We believe that making investments in the middle class, it's the way to go,"" he told reporters.

The Liberals' Canada Child Benefit, for example, which costs more than $20 billion annually, has helped lift 278,000 children out of poverty, according to Statistics Canada figures.

Spending, or, as Morneau prefers to call it, investing, versus cutting is the wedge the Liberals are hoping to create against their Conservative counterparts.

""We're going to continue with the approach of investing in middle class Canadians,"" Morneau pledged Tuesday. ""We're not going to take the proposed approach of the Conservatives, the idea that cuts will lead to a better situation.""

Tories call budget an 'expensive coverup'

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and his finance critic, Pierre Poilievre, did not offer a substantive criticism of the Liberals budget Tuesday. Instead, the party accused Trudeau of engaging in an ""expensive coverup"" by using the budget announcement to distract from Liberal attempts to block Wilson-Raybould from testifying again at the justice committee.

The former attorney general testified at a Commons hearing last month that individuals in the Prime Minister's Office and in Morneau's office had tried to put pressure on her and her staff to direct the public prosecution service to offer a plea deal to SNC-Lavalin. The company faces fraud and corruption charges related to dealings in Libya.

Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, have denied any wrongdoing. Butts resigned in February, citing the need to defend his reputation. Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council Office, announced this week that he also plans to resign.

Last month, Wilson-Raybould resigned from the cabinet days after her allegations emerged in the media. Former Liberal cabinet minister Jane Philpott also resigned, saying she could no longer defend the government's actions publicly after hearing Wilson-Raybould's testimony, and had lost confidence in how the issue had been dealt with.",Morneau's Pre-Election Budget Targets Key Groups Who Helped Liberals Win In 2015,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/20/morneau-budget-election-2019_a_23696506/

For producing energy at the highest environmental, human rights ...","The provincial election will take place on April 16th and the leaders of the UCP, NDP, Liberal and Alberta parties were in southern Alberta on Thursday laying out their campaigns for voters.

Notley started her day in Lethbridge where she spoke at a senior’s centre.

She told supporters there that she is committed to providing good jobs, good schools and honest government.

She also put emphasis on public health care and promised to defend it.

“There’s a choice over who is going to be the Premier of Alberta and who, in fact, is fit to be the Premier of Alberta, me or Jason Kenney. Now I’ll say to you this, Jason Kenney, wants two Albertas and I, on the other hand, want to build one Alberta, an Alberta that works for everyone. Jason Kenney wants to give large businesses giant tax cuts and on the contrast to that, I want to make sure that everyone pays their fair share. Jason Kenney will privatize health care, I will defend public health care. Jason Kenney will stomp his feet and build firewalls, me? I’m just going to build a pipeline,” she said.

She told the crowd of supporters that if she is re-elected she will provide another 2000 new long-term care beds across the province.

“Funding these long-term care beds in every corner of the province ensures that seniors can age close to their homes and close to their families and in the course of doing that, we will also bring at least 1500 new people, frontline care givers, into those centres to make sure that folks get the care they need,” she said.

She said that Kenney wants ‘American-style’ health care and has a very different vision for health care in the province.

“His life-long obsession with American-style health care might work for the rich but will be devastating for every day families, every day seniors, every day patients,” Notley said. “There’s a way to make sure that doesn’t happen, by sticking with us.”

Jason Kenney held a news conference in Calgary over the noon hour and said the oil and gas industry has been ‘under siege’ by the Trudeau and Notley governments.

“Under the Notley, Trudeau alliance, we’re witnessing the hollowing out of our energy industry while an unprecedented energy boom is happening just south of the border. So this is not about oil prices, it’s about policy and it’s about politics, the politics of Justin Trudeau and Rachel Notley, the Liberals and the NDP who have always been hostile to the energy industry,” said Kenney. “Rachel Notley sold Alberta out to Justin Trudeau and all we got in exchange was a carbon tax and no pipelines. That’s what happens when you start as Premier with a view that Alberta is the embarrassing cousin that no one wants to talk about.”

Kenney said Alberta needs a government that is not embarrassed about how energy is produced.

“We’ll never again apologize for what we do. For being the great engine of economic and social progress in Canada. For producing energy at the highest environmental, human rights and labour standards on earth. We must never again apologize for the role that Alberta has played to share massively its wealth and prosperity to lift people up across Canada through our system of transfers and equalization,” he said.

He says if Bill C-69 becomes law he will direct the Attorney General to file a constitutional challenge to strike it down.

He responded to the NDP’s comments about his character and him not being fit to be premier.

“This NDP government has run out of fumes and they are desperate because they know they only have four weeks left. They are desperate to change the channel from the issues that matter to Albertans, jobs, the economy and pipelines. So all they’ve got is fear and smear and if you think that kind of language is too hot, just wait until the last week of this campaign,” he said.

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan announced his party’s indigenous Policy at a media event in the afternoon.

Khan says his party believes in reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and that his plan will help address some of the issues they face.

“We will reform a justice system that is often harsh and unfair to Indigenous Albertans,” said Khan in a statement. “We will add six new seats to the Alberta Legislature for Indigenous Peoples MLA’s. This will address the historic under representation of Indigenous Albertans in Provincial Politics.”

Political Scientist Lori Williams says a number of seats are up for grabs in Calgary and all parties will be fighting hard for seats here.

“I think that in the more, sort of, central urban areas, I think those are probably going to be hard fought because we know historically there have been liberals, NDP representatives, from the inner city more than from the periphery but I think that there’s probably a lot of deep debate that’s likely to happen in northeast Calgary,” she said. ""This controversy over the kamikaze-candidate is going to have an impact on Progressive Conservative voters, more moderate members amongst them. That combined with concerns about social conservatives might see them seeking votes elsewhere.""

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel was also in Calgary and held a news conference Thursday afternoon.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also provided a little for key groups such as millennial voters who backed Trudeau in droves in Canada’s 2015 election.

The decision by a legislator, who had defended a former minister at the center of a political scandal, to quit the ruling Liberal Party and sit as an independent dealt a fresh blow to Trudeau’s embattled government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on the then justice minister to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government’s chances of re-election. Polls have shown that Trudeau’s Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The latest defection overshadowed Tuesday’s budget which divided money between a large number of new initiatives and left few Canadians satisfied.

“It’s just too broad,” said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation. “They wanted to please lots of people and ... when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody, because you spread it too thin.”

Rob Edel, chief investment officer at Nicola Wealth Management, noted the government did not commit to reducing a budget deficit that is much larger than the Liberals promised. This was “a political rather than an economic decision,” he said.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada as well as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce complained about the lack of tax reform. But the center-left Liberals may not care too much as their core supporters are progressive thinkers, women and younger voters. Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed budget measures to help first-time home buyers, including allowing people to withdraw up to C$35,000 from a retirement savings account.

But asked on Wednesday how many younger first-time buyers actually had that much money available, he replied “that will help some people in the middle income range ... not everyone, for sure.”

The main opposition Conservative Party has relentlessly attacked Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin affair and described the budget as a bribe. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has continuously demanded Trudeau’s resignation, which some Conservatives privately worry is the wrong approach.

Two strategists with deep ties to the party said given the complexity of the affair, and former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould’s statement that no one involved had broken any laws, Canadians would not necessarily agree that Trudeau should quit now.

Conservative over-confidence or missteps could be the Liberals’ best hope for reversing their slumping poll numbers, pollster Nick Nanos said.

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers delayed Morneau’s budget presentation for an hour.

Conservatives initially drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers and then walked out en masse, a tactic that did not sit well with some Canadians on social media.","Canada's Trudeau under pressure as MP quits, budget criticized",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1R12Z6-OCATP

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 percent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 percent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

SCANDAL BREWING

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jason Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University. Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

“A week ago, I would not have thought there was much of a path to victory for the NDP,” he said. “Now I think there’s a slim path, which is better than none.”","Ahead of Alberta vote, Canada's oil industry roots for the opposition",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1R12T0-OCATP

To get you caught up on Alberta politics and to give you a taste of what to expect from the newsletter, here are some of our recent Maclean’s features and articles:

This is Notley and her NDP on pre-election footing, polling well behind Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives and their more aggressive posture toward pipelines and anyone who dares not to advocate for them. She’s largely denied critics the opportunity to label her anti-pipeline, and perhaps it’s her best shot at regaining acceptance—Notley has taken the NDP’s old reputation for Prairie pragmatism and dunked it in oil.

In question period, the governing side often attacks more than it defends, as if it’s auditioning to be the official opposition. With this massive advantage, Kenney plans to test how much of a rightward correction Albertans are willing to make. More than just angling to erase the NDP’s four-year imprint on Alberta, he wishes to roll back the political moderation of the Progressive Conservatives before that, too.

Jen Gerson: We may yet see another oil boom, or two. There will probably be applications for oil and plastics over the next century, and Alberta should be doing everything within its power to supply that demand. But it’s a pretty safe bet that global demand for oil is going to abate within my lifetime, as climate change policies, decarbonization efforts and new technologies come to the fore. These shifts are already starting to happen. My child—a toddler today—will probably drive an electric car. He may never learn to drive at all. So what, exactly, is the plan?

For nine years, Kenney sat in a Harper cabinet beset by competing impulses: on one hand, avid conservatism, on the other, incrementalism—the idea that Canadians had to be brought along gradually to accept the Conservative agenda on taxes and programs. A deﬁning question in the run-up to Alberta’s next election is how much cautious incrementalism Kenney will employ, or how free he’ll feel to untether his conservative id.

As a midterm examination of sorts, Maclean’s interviewed dozens of voters in some parts of Alberta where NDP support surged in 2015.

FCP Leader Derek Fildebrandt, MLA for Strathmore-Brooks, unveiled ...","Two days after the election call, the Freedom Conservative Party announced its first platform promise, declaring its commitment to limit federal powers over Alberta — or consider separating from Canada.

FCP Leader Derek Fildebrandt, MLA for Strathmore-Brooks, unveiled strategies to “end inequality” and “protect hard-working Albertans from Ottawa.” If elected, the party would lobby Ottawa to end equalization and grant the province independent rights over immigration, tax collection, employment insurance, pensions and justice, in regards to policing.

Fildebrandt said if the federal government rejects Alberta’s “rightful demands for equality,” then the party would hold a referendum on independence.

“The Freedom Conservative Party, in this election, is going to give Albertans an option unlike they have ever seen, unlike any other parties in this election,” he said Thursday at Bridgeland Community Park in the city’s northeast. A handful of FCP candidates joined him in support.

Fildebrandt formed the FCP last June after leaving the United Conservative Party, following a series of controversies.

In an election many see as a two-horse race between the New Democratic Party and United Conservative Party, the FCP is considered one of a handful of outliers fighting for attention and seats.

Also in the running is right-leaning Alberta Advantage Party, led by Marilyn Burns. It was formed by members of the Wildrose party who were dissatisfied with that party’s 2017 merger with the Progressive Conservatives to form the UCP. The AAP also promises lower taxes and greater autonomy from Ottawa.

The AAP and FCP hope to each put forward about 30 candidates, however Fildebrandt’s conclave is focused on running only in ridings where the NDP is not considered competitive. In contrast, the Green Party of Alberta has 19 candidates, so far, according to its website.

Political scientist Bruce Foster, who teaches at Mount Royal University, said the AAP and Green Party have “no chance” in winning seats. He said small parties are at a grave disadvantage because they don’t have enough resources, such as money and staff, and are generally neglected by the media.

“The system itself squeezes out fringe parties,” said Foster, adding people are more likely to vote for the “big machine” they most closely align with rather than a smaller counterpart.

Mount Royal political scientist Lori Williams agreed.

“There is something different that is happening in this election. It is much more a two-party race,” she said. “We don’t usually see two parties in contention and the rest of them, at least at this stage, looking completely out of contention.”

But Williams said the FCP could have a bigger effect than previously expected.

“A week ago, maybe a week and a half ago, I would have dismissed FCP as a fringe party, but it looks like they might actually be in play now,” said Williams.

She said Fildebrandt’s close ties with former UCP leadership hopeful Brian Jean and the recent kamikaze-candidate scandal plaguing Kenney and his staff could make the FCP a viable alternative for conservative voters in the province.

“So it’s now something that has become an election issue,” said Williams. “People are thinking about it, people are wondering, do I continue? Do I hold my nose and win government? Or do I stand up for my principles?”

She added Fildebrandt’s name recognition and former Wildrose ties could work to his advantage.

Fildebrandt said he’s confident in his team.

“I think we (have) a real chance to break through in this election to win a good number of seats, to provide a principled opposition,” he said.",Freedom Conservative Party leads charge of election outsiders fighting to be heard,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/freedom-conservative-party-leads-charge-of-election-outsiders-fighting-to-be-heard
11,Business,2019-03-22T07:40:00.0000000Z,"“What we see in Canada is our customers are concerned ... “We would wish that (pipelines) wouldn’t be a central point of an election, but we are where we are,” said Chris Bloomer, head ...","NDP Leader Rachel Notley launched the 2019 provincial election campaign Tuesday in downtown Calgary with talk of fighting for jobs, diversifying the economy — and battling for pipelines.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney kicked off his campaign in front of a rig in Leduc talking about the economy, jobs — and pipelines. (Those words were literally on the sign resting under his microphone.)

As Albertans head to the polls on April 16, the race will focus on an array of issues facing the economy today, from high unemployment and weak investment levels to curtailment and the fragile state of the oil and gas sector.

To modify a line from former U.S. president Bill Clinton’s campaign, it’s about energy, stupid.

Alberta has diversified and expanded in areas such as technology and financial services in recent years, yet the oilpatch remains the powerhouse behind the economy.

Today, it’s like a car stuck in a ditch, trying to regain traction.

Until new oil pipelines are built, other problems surrounding reduced oilpatch capital spending, less drilling and a choppy recovery won’t fade away.

“Pipelines will be central,” Notley told reporters in Calgary, a city still recovering from the global oil price downturn that began four years ago.

“I believe we are closer than we ever have been before … it’s been over 60 years since a pipeline to tidewater has been built. It’s not an easy task.”

Kenney began his campaign outside Total Energy Services in Leduc, an oilfield services company hit hard by the recession.

The company shuttered five branches in Western Canada last year.

“We would move from the NDP’s reactive, passive, defensive approach on pipelines to a proactive, strategic and assertive approach,” Kenney said.

For the energy sector, being stuck in the crosshairs of a volatile political campaign is not a comfortable spot to be, but building energy infrastructure is a linchpin for unlocking future growth.

Oil production has increased by 20 per cent since 2015, yet legal and regulatory hurdles on both sides of the Canadian-U.S. border have obstructed pipeline construction, costing the province millions of dollars a day.

In the past month, Enbridge’s Line 3 project and TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline have both faced setbacks in the U.S.

The Trudeau government spent $4.5 billion last year to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline, but a legal ruling put the expansion project on hold.

Without sufficient pipeline capacity, the province has had to restrict oil production.

The winter drilling season in Western Canada was down almost 30 per cent from 2018 levels, noted Kevin Neveu, CEO of Precision Drilling.

“What we see in Canada is our customers are concerned, worried . . . and still don’t have a good sense of increased pipeline capacity,” he said in an interview.

“The uncertainty we feel as a service company is felt by many, many Albertans.”

However, the pipeline issue is largely out of Alberta’s direct control.

After all, the federal government is responsible for regulating cross-border energy infrastructure.

Whoever sits in the premier’s chair doesn’t have a lot of ability to push a project ahead. Instead, they’re left to needle and compel the federal government to move the ball forward.

“We would wish that (pipelines) wouldn’t be a central point of an election, but we are where we are,” said Chris Bloomer, head of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association.

“Both parties are really going to put a focus on this issue as part of their campaign . . . but they can’t wave a magic wand and make things happen.”

While the two major parties agree on the need for new pipelines, they have vastly different plans for the energy industry.

Notley is pushing a plan to provide $3 billion in loan guarantees, grants and royalty credits to attract new petrochemical facilities and partial upgrading projects to the province, adding value to Alberta’s natural resources.

Kenney sees the idea as picking corporate winners and losers and would ditch such subsidies. Instead, he’s touting a broadly based corporate income tax cut, dropping the rate by a third to kick-start growth.

Notley has advocated for spending $3.7 billion on leasing rail cars to transport more oil out of the province, but says it will unlock $5.9 billion in higher revenues, royalties and taxes.

Kenney believes the private sector will take care of oil-by-rail shipments and has vowed to cancel the “boondoggle.”

Notley backs a carbon tax and cap on greenhouse gas emissions from the oilsands.

Kenney opposes both ideas.

The backdrop for this clash is the tepid state of the broader economy.

Crude prices are up this year, topping US$59 a barrel on Tuesday, although conventional oil and gas investment is expected to fall by nine per cent this year.

In February, Alberta’s unemployment rate rose to 7.3 per cent, and housing starts are down sharply.

“You have had a number of months now in a row with some pretty disappointing economic news,” said University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe.

“My largest concern now is the self-fulfilling nature of negative expectations.”

If entrepreneurs and consumers lose confidence in the economy, they will spend less. Holding off on new investments would only make the situation worse.

“There is just a frustration of an inability to move forward. Businesses want to grow,” added Sandip Lalli, CEO of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce.

A 28-day campaign won’t solve all of these economic problems, although it will offer distinctly different visions for the oilpatch’s future.

Other issues will grab the spotlight in the coming days, but expect energy and pipeline concerns to take a big turn on centre stage during Alberta’s election showdown.

Blue-collar workers are all targeted for new spending, whether it's help buying a first home, enhancements to the Canada Pension Plan or money ...","Bill Morneau's fourth budget is in the books, and that's a good thing since he didn't get a chance to deliver his speech in the Commons on Tuesday because of the din made by Conservative MPs determined to keep the public's attention on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The Conservatives jeered. They pounded their desks and they chanted ""let her speak"" in reference to their demand that former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould re-appear before the justice committee to discuss why she resigned.

Undeterred, the finance minister gamely plowed on, incapable of being heard on radio and television broadcasts, or even by his own mates on the government benches.

So let's recap here.

Morneau's fourth budget is not only the last instalment of the Liberals' relentless pursuit of middle-class voters before the October election, it was a road map showing exactly which voters the party needs for another election win.

Millennials. Seniors. Blue-collar workers are all targeted for new spending, whether it's help buying a first home, enhancements to the Canada Pension Plan or money for training. Mix in the Canada Child Benefit from Morneau's first budget and from cradle to the grave, this government is putting more money in Canadians' pockets.

As usual, Morneau didn't call it spending. He never has.





Throughout his news conference in the budget lockup, the finance minister referred to investments, the need to continue to invest in Canadians even if it meant blowing by the campaign promise four years ago to balance the books by now.

""The most important promise we made to Canadians was to invest in their future,"" Morneau replied when asked why the government was choosing to run deficits into the foreseeable future.





""I hope Canadians will look at what we've done since the beginning, to make investments in me and my family,"" he said to another question about what Canadians should take from this budget.

""I think Canadians will look at us and know we delivered on our promise of more success, for more middle-class Canadians than ever before.""

Anxiety despite job growth

Underlying everything Morneau said, and every new measure he put in the budget, is a gnawing fear that Canadians may not feel any better off than they did four years ago in ending a decade of Conservative governments.

Morneau talked about that sense of anxiety even as he rang off the strong job growth numbers, how 54 per cent of those new jobs went to women. He mentioned it as he spoke about the biggest wage jump in a decade last year, and that Canada continues to lead the other G7 countries in economic growth.

Watch as Conservative MPs jeer Morneau:

""If you are a young person still struggling to find meaningful work, a low unemployment rate probably doesn't mean that much,"" he said in the speech that nobody heard.

""Good GDP numbers don't mean a lot when the job you need to feed your family is on the line.""

New Democrats called the budget a wasted opportunity. Party Leader Jagmeet Singh said Canadians can't wait for the measures outline in the budget that are spread out over five years, or won't kick in until after the election.

He said the NDP would bring in a national pharmacare plan now to ensure no one goes without the medications they need. The NDP would spend now to build more affordable housing, not sometime down the road.

""This government doesn't have anything in this budget to build new affordable housing, nothing in this budget to address co-operative housing, or non market housing, instead they are offering people to use their RRSPs to buy their home,"" he told reporters.

""How many millenials are able to use, to have enough in their RRSP to buy a home? It shows how disconnected Mr. Trudeau is with respect to what Canadians are going through.""





The Conservatives hammered at the failure to present a plan to return to budget balance, but only as an afterthought.

Party Leader Andrew Scheer seemed far more interested in portraying the budget as a blatant attempt to deflect attention away from the role Justin Trudeau and his office played in trying to stop the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on fraud and corruption charges.





""Mr. Trudeau's plan is obvious. Massive deficits to distract Canadians from his corruption before the election. Massive tax hikes to pay for them after the election,"" he said.

“Bill C-76 needs to be put into context,” says Winkler, principal and founder of Winkler Dispute Resolution. “The bill does not really relate to the type of election tampering that the media, government and public have been concerned with. It is wrong to think it will serve as a cure-all to prevent undue influence in the electoral process.”

He says the legislation requires online platforms to keep a registry of all paid political and partisan ads they carry. Google has responded by “banning political advertising on its platforms ahead of the Canadian federal election ""because of new ad transparency rules it says would be too challenging to comply with,” the Globe and Mail reports.

Even if the search engine company were to comply with the legislation, Winkler says that would not be a solution to the manipulation of our political system during elections, since the bill only focuses on paid online advertising, and ignores social media.

“Anyone intent on influencing an election won’t use paid advertising,” he says. “They will use social media, which is much more difficult to track. The kind of improper influence that Russia was said to have in the last U.S. election was mostly through social media, and that does not fall within the parameters of this legislation.”

Winkler says the Canada Elections Act already requires those who are engaged in political advertising to register. That includes political parties, associations, candidates and certain third parties comprised of individuals or groups.

“The kind of transparency that is being discussed, to some extent, already exists,” he says. “There is a means of accountability, as anyone who spends more than $500 has to register with Elections Canada.”

The new tracking requirements in Bill C-76 will assist the government in the enforcement of these registration obligations, Winkler says, as the federal government will be able to compare the reports of the online platforms to its own registration database, ensuring that everyone who has purchased political advertising is registered with Elections Canada.

“It seems that the whole purpose of this legislation is to assist the federal government in enforcing provisions that are already there,” he says.

Canada could look south of the border for another solution, Winkler says, explaining that when any person or group in the U.S. registers as a third party, they are given a registration number by the U.S. Federal Election Commission, which they must provide when they purchase advertising.

“If Canada implemented the same type of system, Google and Twitter and others could demand the registration number before processing the advertising order, ensuring that anyone who is advertising is registered,” he says.

If the government wanted to regulate and monitor social media platforms, that would “raise really tricky issues,” Winkler says.

“How do we limit or control what people say on Facebook or Twitter while respecting their right to free expression and speech?” he asks.

If anyone attempted to control or regulate what is said on these online platforms, that would be viewed as censorship, Winkler says.

“The question then becomes, who will be the censor?” he says. “Should a private business determine what content should or should not be on its site? Do we want the government to be the censor of what is communicated to the public through these platforms?”

Winkler says the solution starts with clearly identifying who is behind any social media post dealing with politics.

“Where there is political speech, we should demand that the maker of the speech be properly identified,” he says. “Let’s not permit anonymous speech, but require those who want to disseminate opinions to do so with their real identities.”

When people are publicly held accountable, “what they say will be more tempered and well considered,” Winkler says. “Freedom of expression should also come with accountability.”",Bill C-76 a poor solution to election tampering: Winkler,long,https://www.advocatedaily.com/howard-winkler-bill-c-76-a-poor-solution-to-election-tampering-winkler.html

Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.

None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.

“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.

The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.

The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.

Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.

“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.

Skills Training

Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”

That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”

On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”

The budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government’s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau’s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.

Morneau has also said the government will “make sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism” and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded “pharmacare” program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party’s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he’s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada’s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.

As in something for everyone. Maybe. But the chickens in these pots are awfully modest. It might be more accurate to say an egg in every pot.

The Liberal government's budget, its last kick at the can before this fall's election, is certainly as much a political document as a financial one. And before anyone gets all self-righteous about ""buying votes,"" let's at least be honest: Every single incumbent government does the same thing to optimize its chances of re-election. The Trudeau Liberals are no different.

But while the investments may be modest, they are indeed plentiful.

Deficits continue. The Liberals are unapologetic, proudly so. They point to their economic track record, and the numbers support that. Most economists agree with Finance Minister Bill Morneau's mantra that the debt-to-GDP ratio matters more than deficits. But like many Canadians, we would be much more comfortable with a financial plan that included a path to balanced budgets.

There's help for first-time homebuyers. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. will have $1.25 billion to help eligible buyers lower their mortgage costs. You still need your down payment — typically five per cent of the total price — but if you apply for an insured mortgage, you could receive an incentive of up to 10 per cent. And if you're fortunate enough to have an RRSP, you can borrow against it.

There's something for low-income seniors. They'll be able to keep more of the money they earn before their Guaranteed Income Supplement is clawed back. And pension-protection language will be toughened to make it harder for bankrupt companies to slash retiree pensions and benefits. (It's worth noting that much more work remains on that file.)

A new Canada Training Credit will encourage workers 25 to 64 to put away up to $250 annually to a maximum of $5,000, to be used for deferring training costs, and a new employment insurance measure will subsidize workers who take leave for training purposes.

The budget's biggest investment is $1.4 billion for social services for Indigenous children. An additional $740 million will continue efforts to bring clean water to all communities and $333 million will support Indigenous languages.

Significantly, there's $2 billion to go directly to municipalities to speed up the rollout of infrastructure investments. This is in response to provincial governments, like Ontario's, that have refused to partner with Ottawa. So now the feds are going directly to municipalities — which makes perfect sense, since they are most efficient and effective at infrastructure upgrading. It also seems to signal a new degree of respect for local governments, which is overdue and welcome.",Editorial: Budget a prelude to a pharmacare election campaign in Canada,Waterloo Region Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/9232272-editorial-budget-a-prelude-to-a-pharmacare-election-campaign-in-canada/

This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs ...","Politicians talk about what they want to talk about and not what’s necessarily important and relevant to Canadians. There are taboo subjects that no political party will address. Tax laws that legally allow affluent Canadians to use tax havens to avoid paying tax are highly relevant to all Canadians. They’re also at the top of the list of taboo topics political parties refuse to talk about. Canada’s tax regulations have created a two-tier tax system, one for the rich and one for everyone else. Some have called this economic discrimination.

It’s estimated by some experts that the annual lost government revenue due to the legal use of tax havens by individuals is $5 billion, or $25 billion over five years. These billions could fund numerous elections promises without adding to Canada’s deficit. This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs over five years. It represents the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs. This lost revenue would enhance the lives of all Canadians, instead of benefiting only Canada’s affluent.

These affluent Canadians are not tax-cheats or tax evaders, nor are they abusing our tax system. They are adhering fully to Canada’s tax laws. These laws need to change.

These lost billions represent the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs.

The October 2019 election represents the only opportunity for Canadian voters to prohibit affluent Canadians from using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. We need to demand political parties engage in discussions about this “taboo” issue before the October election. For instance, in next week’s federal budget.

Politicians don’t talk about the Panama and Paradise Paper disclosures, in which thousands of affluent Canadians were identified as having used tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This represents only a fraction of the number of affluent Canadians who benefit from offshore tax havens.

The difference between tax evaders and tax avoiders is that tax avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is illegal. Tax evaders are hunted down by the Canada revenue Agency and face the possibility of going to jail.

By contrast, affluent Canadians who use tax havens are law-abiding citizens, free to continue doing the same year after year. This will only change if Canadians demand our government close tax loopholes. But we are reluctant to take to the streets and challenge political parties to address this issue.

Tax reform that prohibits the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians is not radical. U.S. citizens are forbidden to use tax havens to avoid paying taxes. It is a criminal offence. They respect the sacred principle of tax fairness, under which all citizens must pay their fair share of taxes. In Canada, we have a two-tier tax system, which is unfair and unjust.

The losers in all of this are “average” Canadians. Tax avoidance is a dominant factor for Canadians having inadequate health care and social programs. Investments are not being made to growth industries that would allow them to compete domestically and globally. “Average” Canadians are paying more taxes while our government debt is growing at a staggering rate. This should not be allowed to continue.

A 2017 Environics poll found that nine out of 10 Canadians say the use of tax havens is morally wrong, and 87 per cent said they would like to see tax-haven use criminalized. This poll is an indication as to how voters in October’s federal election might respond to a political party advocating for tax reform.

Both individual and corporate tax avoidance laws are crippling Canada. Solutions to tax avoidance by individuals can be addressed by voting for political parties committed to closing tax loopholes. The nature of corporate tax avoidance is complex and requires long-term solutions.

The goal of The Grassroots Coalition for Tax Reform, is to pressure political parties to address the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians, in their election platforms. Let’s all tell them how we feel. This policy issue should no longer be taboo.

The federal government has promised to spend $700 million over the next 10 years for Canada’s North, with money coming for post ...","While the new Liberal budget promises to spend $700 million over the next 10 years for things like post-secondary education in Canada’s North, new infrastructure and Arctic research, there is barely any mention of investing in the government’s hard power Arctic capabilities, experts say.

The 2019 budget gives the Canadian military funds to extend its missions halfway around the world in the Middle East and in Ukraine, but experts say there is no new money for beefing up Canada’s military or constabulary capabilities in the Arctic beyond what was pledged in the 2017 budget.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau tabled the budget on Tuesday and with the Oct. 21 federal election in mind the Liberal government has been in a full sales pitch mode to promote the budget.

But it’s a tough sell among some Canadian defence experts.

‘An election budget’

“Obviously it’s an election budget and I think they’re trying to hit some key demographics and the military might not be one,” said Adam MacDonald, deputy director at the Centre for the Study of Security and Development at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

The budget does contain “a sizeable piece” of funding for veterans and for members of the military transitioning to civilian life, MacDonald added.

“I think the government probably doesn’t feel that they are vulnerable on security and defence issues, that a lot of voters will base their votes on what we are going to do overseas or what ships we’re going to build,” MacDonald said. “But I do think the veteran file is very sensitive and it can cause political problems if it looks like they’re not addressing it and taking it seriously.”

The budget also sets aside $21.8 million over five years, starting in 2019–20 for Environment and Climate Change Canada for upgrades and repairs to the aircraft runway, sewage, ventilation and plumbing at the Eureka Weather Station on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut.

Investment in the upkeep and maintenance at the weather station located on Canada’s northernmost island is also important because Eureka forms an important communications chain that the Canadian military uses in the High Arctic, MacDonald said.

“Once you get up to those high latitudes, it becomes far more difficult to communicate,” MacDonald said. “So it’s a bit of a relay station from (the Canadian Forces Station) Alert down to Eureka.”

But that’s pretty much it for the military investments in the Arctic in the 2019 budget, MacDonald added.

Strong, Secure, Engaged?

MacDonald said most of the big-ticket items for the Canadian military were laid out when the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled its 2017 defence policy, pledging to increase Canada’s annual military spending by 70 per cent to $32.7 billion over the next decade.

The ambitious policy called Strong, Secure, Engaged set out plans to increase the size of Canada’s regular and reserve forces, invest in better care for soldiers and veterans, buy a new fleet of 88 fighter jets and 15 new navy warships, as well as invest in high-tech drones, cyber warfare, space and intelligence capabilities.

Rob Huebert, associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Calgary and senior research fellow with the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, said the budget “puts the lie” to the Liberals’ defence policy review.

The pre-election budget shows the Trudeau government has no intent of following up on its promises made in its Strong, Secure, Engaged defence policy.

And with less than eight months to go before the elections, the Liberal government has yet to present its Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, Huebert said.

“The other thing that the government kept saying it was going to do is, of course, to have this full blown competition for the replacement fighter jets,” Huebert said. “Where is that in the budget? Where are the funds for setting up this super-duper review and competition. And once again – crickets.”

Emphasis on northern communities

Military spending doesn’t register very high for most Canadian voters, MacDonald said.

“It doesn’t even matter if there is this kind of growing divide between the spending targets and the funding targets and what is actually being achieved now,” MacDonald said.

The budget provides stronger emphasis on building stronger Arctic and northern communities by building infrastructure and connecting the remote communities, which in itself would improve the logistical situation in Canada’s sparsely populated North, he added.

“I think as the military starts moving up north and regularly deploying up there, and possibly increasing the stationing of different service elements, there is going to be this debate how do the logistics work and whether or not it’s more beneficial to maybe not build military-specific assets like ports and airfields but maybe try and use civilian infrastructure that’s being built there in a kind of a dual-use way,” MacDonald said.

As climate change makes the Canadian Arctic Archipelago more accessible to regular shipping, the federal government will be facing increased pressure and demand to place search-and-rescue, navigation assistance and oil spill response assets in the North, he said.

“I think the military piece of that shouldn’t be seen as a totally separate issue,” MacDonald said. “In my opinion it probably should be included in this whole idea how are we going to develop the North.”

A year after the so-called mortgage stress test came into effect, the mortgage underwriting guidelines are being targeted by Conservative politicians ahead of a provincial and general election.

Alberta United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, a speaker at the Calgary Real Estate Board on Jan. 30, said the mortgage stress test was punitive to prospective Alberta homeowners and out of touch with housing markets in the province.

“One of the reasons why homes are less affordable in Alberta today is because of unfair rules imposed by Ottawa to deal with the overheated real estate markets in Toronto and Vancouver,” Kenney said.

“The so-called ‘stress test’ imposed by the CMHC (Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation) has put tens of thousands of Albertans out of reach of home ownership, diminishing the value of the homes they can buy, to deal with the real estate market in Toronto and Vancouver.”

READ MORE: Canadian home sales fall in February, average price down 5.2% year-over-year

Kenney went on to say that the mortgage stress test came into effect in January 2018, in the middle of Alberta’s post-oil price shock-fueled recession.

“We did not have the risk of overheating nationally. They did have the risk of overheating in Toronto and Vancouver. They took out a bazooka rather than a fly swatter to take care of the problem.”

READ MORE: Jason Kenney wants Alberta exemption on housing stress test

Calgary-Shepard Conservative MP Tom Kmiec also took aim at the stress test in a House of Commons debate on affordable housing on Jan. 31, calling the CMHC regulations “a one-size-fits-all tool that punishes Canadians from coast to coast to coast, regardless of the prices in their local markets.”

What’s the allegation?

Kenney and Kmiec purport that the mortgage stress test is unfair to Albertans and punishes them for overheating housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver. They also say the stress test has put “tens of thousands of Albertans out of reach of home ownership.”

They call for the mortgage stress test to be scrapped in Alberta.

What are the facts?

The stress test is applicable to all prospective home buyers with a less-than-20 per cent down payment — the buyers who require mortgage insurance offered by CMHC and two private insurers.

Those home buyers are evaluated on whether they could pay their mortgage if interest rates went up by two per cent above their current rate. The interest rate rise also serves as a proxy to other financial stresses a household might face, like a job loss or a reduction in income.

The stress test was passed along to Canada’s federally-regulated financial institutions in guideline B-20, “Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures,” from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). It is the latest in a series of mechanisms designed to stabilize house prices across Canada.

“The federal government and CMHC were looking at things like price-to-income ratios and price-to-rent ratios and noted that, globally, Canada is at the top end of those ratios,” said David Dale-Johnson, the Stan Melton Chair in Real Estate at the University of Alberta School of Business.

“In other words, housing prices here are pretty high relative to most other places around the world. Their concern is that Canadians are overextended with respect to their purchases of housing.”

What do the experts say?

While the CMHC’s mission stated on its website is “to make housing affordable for everyone in Canada,” housing prices were running away from being affordable in cities other than Toronto and Vancouver, with areas like Ontario’s Golden Horseshoe, Victoria and the greater Lower Mainland who were getting most of that overheating in 2017.

The size of the Toronto and Vancouver markets in proportion to the national housing market gave good reason for regulatory intervention, especially in the event houses in the 416 and 604 area codes experience a downturn.

“When you have Toronto and Vancouver representing more than half of home resales across Canada, they do register at the national level,” Dale-Johnson said. “You have to pay attention to what’s going on and, if it’s overheating, the risk of the market turning down with the potential of a brutal decline that could disrupt the market with a significant price decline — just for the sake of the stability of the market — it did make sense.”

“If we go back a couple of years prior to the oil price shock, there were some worries in Edmonton and Calgary,” Dale-Johnson added.

Before the stress test, insured mortgage eligibility requirements changed to include an increase in the minimum credit score, reducing the amortization period to 25 years from 30, limiting the home price tag mortgage insurance would cover, among others.

Vancouver introduced a one per cent empty homes tax in November 2016 and the Ontario government announced its Fair Housing Plan in April 2017, which included a foreign buyers tax and expanded rent controls.

In addition to stabilizing housing prices, the B-20 guideline is designed to reduce the number of Canadians with high mortgage debts.

“They are particularly focused on reducing the share of borrowers who are highly-indebted, so those borrowers who are seeking high loan-to-value mortgages,” CMHC senior analyst James Cuddy said.

“And there’s evidence to show that the share of mortgages going toward highly-indebted individuals is declining in Calgary and Edmonton.”

This probably a good thing, according to RBC senior economist Robert Hogue.

“Alberta households are the most indebted in Canada,” Hogue told Global News.

“Household debt has been identified by the Bank of Canada and many of us in the private sector as a key vulnerability to the health of the economy.

“High household debt may exacerbate the outcome” of the next downturn in the economy, Hogue said, adding the prudent course of action is to keep focusing on debt.

How indebted are Albertans?

Nationwide, Canadians have a debt-to-income ratio of 179 per cent to start 2019. Put another way, on average, for every dollar a Canadian earns, she or he owes $1.79. That’s the highest it’s been since records began in 1990.

According to an RBC economics report published in April 2018, Albertans’ total debts rose from $164,000 per household in 2010 to $192,000 in 2016, the highest of the 10 provinces. As of 2016, RBC says Alberta’s households spend 15.2 per cent of their disposable income servicing debt.

On Wednesday, Statistics Canada said Canadian households are spending even more to service their debt.

“Debt-to-income levels remain relatively high in both markets (Calgary and Edmonton). Part of the reason OSFI revised B-20 was to address this issue,” Cuddy added.

Moody’s, the international credit service, released a report Thursday saying “Canadian consumers are increasingly vulnerable to an adverse economic scenario despite stabilized household debt and low unemployment.”

What else do I need to know?

If a buyer has to qualify for a mortgage at a higher rate, does that affect how much house they can buy? Put simply, yes.

“The stress test had the biggest impact on the budget of buyers,” Hogue said.

“They have to have 20 per cent more income than they used to have or they would be buying a house that’s 20 per cent cheaper than they would have liked to have bought,” Dale-Johnson said.

In addition to lowering the budget Canadians are working with when buying a home, Mortgage Professionals Canada — a mortgage industry association — estimates a July 2018 report, that “about 100,000 Canadians have actually been prevented from buying a home.”

Credit report and credit score company Equifax recently said that consumer delinquency rates are on the rise in Canada.

Equifax reports that non-mortgage debt amounts are trending up in Alberta, with delinquencies increasing in Calgary but decreasing in Edmonton.

“Delinquency rates have much more to do with the state of the economy rather than interest rates or property values or size of mortgage,” Hogue said. “Delinquency rates, especially mortgage delinquency rates, correlates very highly with the unemployment rate.

“So what you’re witnessing in Alberta is the weakening in the provincial economy that is taking a toll on a number of borrowers that are facing some difficult situations,” the RBC senior economist added. “Rising interest rates possibly exacerbate the matter.”

According to the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada, more Albertans and Canadians are declaring bankruptcy — Alberta alone saw a 9.9 per cent increase in the 2018 calendar year.

Does the stress test unfairly punish Albertans?

For Hogue, one of the benefits of the stress test is a reduced debt load for Albertans who are already in a tough economy.

While reducing or eliminating the stress test could help increase house-buying budgets in the short term, market economic basics would kick in and increase demand and prices.

“While policymakers making changes might be well-intended, at the end of the day you’re not solving the basic issue of housing affordability,” Hogue said.

Hogue argued in a Feb. 28 report that the solution to getting more people into buying houses is to increase the supply of houses affordable to those entering the market.

According to ATB Financial, a record number of completed homes remain vacant and unpurchased in Edmonton, with Calgary reaching record numbers, as well. The provincial financial institution did not include a breakdown of the prices of those homes.

For the University of Alberta housing economist, the downturn in oil prices in 2015 took a lot of momentum out of the province’s housing market.

“If you look at Alberta separate from the rest of the country, I’d be inclined to think that you would not have needed a stress test because the oil price shock has taken care of any problem that might have arisen,” Dale-Johnson said.

The stress test isn’t the only reason it’s been difficult for Albertans to buy homes, according to Cuddy.

“The caveat is that it’s very difficult to disentangle the individual effects when looking at an environment in Calgary and Edmonton where we have some real challenges in the economy and higher interest rates as well,” Cuddy said. “Understanding the magnitude of the stress tests in terms of impact is difficult to assess.”

“Anywhere in Canada it’s hard to put together a down payment and finally get into home ownership,” Hogue said. “The bar is the highest it’s ever been in the country.

“At the same time, you don’t want to put young families, young households, at risk down the road of an even worse outcome.

“Knowing that Alberta households are the most indebted in Canada, that’s something to keep in mind when criticizing the type of policy that was really designed to address issues elsewhere but they are applicable to situations in Alberta.”

“If you want to help millennials or first time home buyers, focus on the economy,” Hogue said.

What can a premier do?

Given that the OSFI and CMHC are an independent federal agency and Crown corporation, respectively, premiers of any province are unable to do away with the mortgage stress test. The best they can hope for is to lobby and convince the finance minister and the executives of the OSFI and CMHC to change the mortgage stress test.

Whether or not they should is a question of caution.

Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau — whose purview includes the OSFI and CMHC — is set to table the pre-election budget on March 19, where he could relax mortgage eligibility requirements, lengthen the amortization of mortgages (the amount of time to pay a mortgage off, reducing monthly mortgage payments) or increase the amount a home buyer can withdraw from an RRSP for a house purchase.",Alberta Election Fact Check: Time to end the mortgage stress test?,SooToday,https://www.sootoday.com/global-news/alberta-election-fact-check-time-to-end-the-mortgage-stress-test-1324714

Andrew Scheer might just be having a smooth ride in the forthcoming elections.","The governing federal liberals are likely to lose their party status, the same way Kathleen Wynne’s Ontario Liberals, lost theirs, says Andre Marin, writing for the Toronto Sun. The only way to avoid this, writes the columnist, is for Justin Trudeau to“check his ego at the door.” In addition to dropping his ego, Trudeau was also advised to own up and concede that he and his allies messed up and won’t interfere with criminal prosecutions again.

Trudeau ego was likened to that of Wynne who lost all touch with the people and believed she could beat all odds all by herself until Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives came along with a simple three-word slogan: “For the People.” And took the leadership seat away from her.

It took Wynne about a decade to lose the Ontario seat, but it’s taking Trudeau just about three years, and worse still he seems to be in a free-fall just seven months before the elections. At present, a lot of Canadians are disappointed with Trudeau’s recent actions and the actions of his party allies such as PCO head Michael Wernick, especially how they have handled the entire SNC Lavalin scandal, now popularly called LavScam.

""The past few weeks have been an abysmal, slow-motion train wreck in issues management for the Trudeau Government,"" Ottawa-based political analyst YaroslavBaransaid, speaking with CNN.

When he was elected, Trudeau had promised to bring Canada back, but his actions these past few weeks could only be taking Canada backwards, right now Canada is under investigations by The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. They are reviewing the country’s compliance with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. “That’s the kind of review you’d expect of developing countries rife with corruption.” Says Marin. “Interestingly, Trudeau and his bunch of gofers justified harassing Wilson-Raybould into a deferred prosecution agreement by claiming they could save 9,000 jobs. But a country is under an OECD bribery investigation sends bad vibes to international businesses who might want to invest in Canada. Brilliant.”

Worse still, in the face of all this, Trudeau remains unrepentant. He is neither contrite nor apologetic and blames the former attorney general, Wilson-Raybould for not coming to him with her protests. Even after she had given evidence, that she did meet him with her objections.

Recently, Trudeau seems to be busy with any other thing but the issue at hand. Last week, on Wednesday 13th of March when the Justice Committee was to hold an emergency meeting to discuss bringing back Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance. Trudeau’s Liberals used their majority to adjourn the committee’s work to budget day, it is apparent, that they hope that the budget’s news would swallow upLavscam. Trudeau has also been vacationing, going from North Captiva Island to Florida while the image of its government gets even more tainted.

OTTAWA – The final budget of the Trudeau government’s mandate will scatter billions in fresh spending – on everything from pharmacare to retraining workers to first-time home buyers – as the Liberals commit to an electoral fight that pits their deficit-spending vision versus the Conservatives’ balanced-books approach.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s budget Tuesday resembled Liberal economic plans that preceded it: the government will exhaust a big windfall, run near-term deficits of about $20 billion and offer no timeline to return to balance.

The document tabled in the Commons showed that a stronger economy last year will put an extra $27.8 billion into the federal treasury over the next six years, compared to government predictions in its November economic update.

With seven months to go before the election, Morneau’s plan will spread around $22.8 billion of that additional cash. The government also said it’s booked another $4 billion in spending since the fall update.

Out of all this new spending, most of it will be aimed at Canadians’ pocketbooks.

Funding for some of Tuesday’s commitments will only start kicking in after October’s election, giving voters the chance to weigh in on the budget’s contents at the ballot box.

The Liberals’ plan places them in stark contrast with the Opposition Conservatives, who have called on the government to rein in spending.

“The opposition would like to see us make cuts very rapidly — their idea is balance the budget at any cost,” Morneau told a news conference Tuesday after being asked about his deficits.

“Well, if we had taken that approach in 2015 we would not be where we are today with a better outcome for middle-class Canadians. We’d be in a more difficult spot.”

The measures in Morneau’s fiscal blueprint cover a lot of territory, with a clear focus on individuals — particularly younger adults — as opposed to businesses. The plan includes:

$4.6 billion over five years to help more Canadians afford and access skills training to keep up with the rapidly evolving workforce

$4.5 billion over five years to improve living conditions for Indigenous Peoples

$1.8 billion over four years to enhance the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors

$885 million over five years to make homes more affordable for first-time buyers

$500 million per year, starting in 2022-23, to help cover the cost of drugs for rare diseases.

The government will make several large, one-time investments for 2018-19, including $2.2 billion worth of new infrastructure funding and $1 billion towards improving energy efficiency.

The budget also pledges up to $3.9 billion for supply-managed dairy, egg and poultry farmers affected by recent trade deals with the Asia-Pacific and Europe.

Even with these investments, Ottawa’s fiscal track promises to be a key issue on the campaign trail.

The annual deficit projections in Tuesday’s budget – which reach as high as $19.8 billion – are less than one percentage point of Canada’s gross domestic product, a modest level when compared internationally.

Still, the Liberals will be forced to explain themselves repeatedly until election day.

They came to power in 2015 on a platform that vowed to post annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to return to balance by 2019.

After the 2015 election, the Trudeau government abandoned the promise, arguing more investments were needed to lift Canada’s long-term economic growth. Instead, Morneau has focused on lowering the net debt-to-GDP ratio – a measure of how burdensome the national debt is – each year even as the actual debt has increased.

The Conservatives have attacked the Liberals for breaking their deficit promise and have demanded Morneau map out a return to balanced books. They’ve accused the government of borrowing today on the backs of future generations.

Morneau introduced his blueprint Tuesday just before 4 p.m. ET, but his customary budget speech to the House of Commons was delayed an hour by a series of procedural manoeuvres by the Conservatives.

When Morneau finally started speaking, Tory MPs drowned out most of his address by stomping and shouting.

The Tories were protesting the Liberal-dominated justice committee’s decision earlier Tuesday to pull the plug on its probe of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s and his senior officials have faced allegations of judicial interference.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told reporters that, given the SNC-Lavalin scandal, his MPs refused to stand by and watch Morneau table a budget as though it were business as usual.

On the new spending in the budget, Scheer warned that Canadians will have to pay for it through higher taxes if Trudeau is re-elected.

“Conservatives will fight to bring fiscal responsibility back to this country,” he said.

Leaders in corporate Canada and some economists have also criticized the Liberal deficits, especially since they’ve come during good economic times when many believe governments should be focused on paying off debt.

A big question is what will become of the Liberal spending plan – and how big the shortfalls will grow – when Canada is hit by the next economic downturn.

The economy has had a good run, but experts say it’s debatable how much of Canada’s recent economic performance has come from Liberal policies and how much has been a result of the stronger U.S. and global economies.

New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh said the budget didn’t go far enough on universal pharmacare, skills training and pensions.

He also questioned the budget’s measure to allow people to use a larger share – $35,000 instead of $25,000 – of their registered retirement savings plans to buy their first home.

“How many people have enough in their RRSP as a first-time home buyer to make that in any way meaningful?” Singh asked. “This is a budget that gives crumbs to Canadians when the government has already given the entire pie to the wealthiest.”",Deficits in big spending pre-election budget tee up ballot box choice,Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/manufacturing/deficits-in-big-spending-pre-election-budget-tee-up-ballot-box-choice-229277/

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday. Her father was charged with first degree murder and died a few days later in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We’re mere weeks into a new year and there have been at least four femicides across Canada already.

By Julie Gordon

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, seeking to move past a political crisis threatening its re-election, lavished new spending on middle-class voters in its budget on Tuesday, but the measures may be spread too thin to move the needle before October's vote.

The budget was aimed at boosting consumer spending at a time when the economy is slowing, while shifting the narrative away from a scandal involving a major engineering and construction company that has shaken the ruling Liberal Party government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top government officials leaned on his former justice minister to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

The issue has dragged the party down in opinion polls, which indicate it is at risk of losing power to the official opposition Conservatives in October's federal election.

The Liberals looked to counter that narrative with a budget that sprinkled benefits widely, helping everyone from millennials to retirees.

But with no single blockbuster pledge and with opposition antics distracting from the Liberals' message, Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos said the budget was unlikely to put Trudeau's party back ahead.

""At best, they can hope to stop the political bleeding,"" he said. The Liberals fell to 32.6 percent support in the latest Nanos Research poll, behind the Conservatives at 35.5 percent.

Opposition lawmakers delayed Finance Minister Bill Morneau from presenting the budget for an hour and then the Conservatives drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers. They later walked out in protest at what party leader Andrew Scheer said was Trudeau's attempt to bury the SNC-Lavalin scandal, calling it a ""corruption cover-up.""

""This budget has no legitimacy and we could not legitimize it by remaining in the chamber,"" Scheer told reporters.

The budget outlined C$21 billion ($15.8 billion) in spending over five years on new measures, including help to get first-time buyers into housing, a new skills training benefit, new perks for retirees and students, and the creation of a federal agency to cut the cost of prescription medications.

""The challenge I think with this budget is that there are so many boxes they tried to tick - everybody will get a little bit, but nobody will get enough,"" said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.

""To me, you get more bang for your buck if you have a focused approach,"" he added.

HELP FOR HOMEBUYERS

With many Canadians struggling to buy homes amid rising interest rates and stricter mortgage rules, the budget promised measures to help millennials and others boost their purchasing power without taking on too much debt.

It introduced a program to let some first-time buyers finance a portion of their home purchases through a shared equity mortgage with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government housing agency.

Under the plan, the CMHC would provide 10 percent equity on a new home or 5 percent on a resale home. It would then share in any upside benefit or downside risk, and the government said the move would incentivize the construction of new housing supply.

The move, along with other housing incentives, could give Canada's housing market a much-needed shot in the arm, reviving construction and bolstering homeowner sentiment, although economists warned the overall impact may be marginal.

""It is a potential concession that they went a step too far in dampening the housing market,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

BUSINESSES LEFT OUT

But there was little in the budget for corporate Canada, despite repeated calls from business groups for wide-ranging tax changes or cuts to boost competitiveness.

In his November budget update, Morneau unveiled a plan to allow businesses to write off additional capital investments to help them compete globally, but he stopped short of slashing taxes, saying it would cost tens of billions.

The budget on Tuesday did include a new training benefit, which will give workers money toward tuition and paid time off work to pursue new skills.

The measure could help employers that say they are struggling to fill jobs requiring specialized skills, notably in the technology and healthcare fields.

Disinformation is being confronted by governments encouraging social media platforms to crack down on suspicious content. In the run-up to Canada’s October ...,"This week’s federal budget included millions of dollars to beef up Canada’s detection and advisory capacity against nation-state and criminal attacks on critical infrastructure and democratic processes.

On Wednesday government officials, academics and private sector experts got a view into the future of cyber warfare at the 5th Security and Defence Symposium between Canada and the European Union in Ottawa.

That future, one panelist said in an interview, can be seen in the attacks — usually attributed to Russia or Russian-supported groups — on Ukraine in the past three years. They’re a toxic mixture of military and cyber incidents dubbed hybrid attacks.

Josef Schroefl, deputy director of the Helsinki-based European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (also known as the the Hybrid CoE), called Ukraine “the whole symphony, hybrid orchestration: Disinformation campaigns, cyber attacks and kinetic [military] attacks.”

A brief roundup of the incidents includes successive power failures in back-to-back Decembers and the recent seizure by Russia of three Ukrainian navy ships in the strait between Russia and the Ukrainian region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.

“What you see in Ukraine frightens me,” Schroef said. “Ukraine is something like a test lab for maybe something bigger. We don’t know.”

The half-day symposium is one of a number of ways Western countries are working together to exchange best practices for facing defence challenges, including nation-state backed cyber attacks. For example, Canada and the centre held a three-day table-top exercise in January to test their response skills, Schroefl said.

Last fall Canada joined the Hybrid CoE. Other members include Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S.

The organization defines hybrid threats as

Co-ordinated and synchronized action, that deliberately targets democratic states’ and institutions systemic vulnerabilities, through a wide range of means (political, economic, military, civil, and information);

Activities exploit the thresholds of detection and attribution as well as the border between war and peace;

The aim is to influence different forms of decision making at the local (regional), state, or institutional level to favour and/or gain the agent’s strategic goals while undermining and/or hurting the target.

Joining the group followed commitments made by Canada and other G7 countries at their annual meeting last year in Charlevoix, Que., to defend democracy from online foreign threats. Among the promises each country made was to set up a cyber Rapid Response Mechanism. This network will strengthen co-operation. between countries to identify and respond to diverse and evolving threats. Canada is the network co-ordinator, so the budget proposes giving the Global Affairs department $2.1 million over three years to help its work.

It parallels the Cyber Readiness Response Teams and Mutual Assistance in Cyber Security agreement that some European countries set up in 2016 under the EU’s Permanent Structure Co-operation (PESCO) on security and defence. Eight nations have or are setting up teams under the pact, which essentially established a collective cyber defence. To facilitate the teams one PESCO project is the creation of a cyber incident response information sharing platform.

Twenty five of the EU’s 28 countries have joined PESCO, but most have not yet joined the cyber mutual assistance pact.

One panel at Wednesday’s symposium discussed how PESCO — designed to increase EU co-operation — can work with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military institution. Not all members of the EU are members of NATO.

The other panel dealt with how to confront hybrid attacks, and included Air Commodore John Maas, senior military advisor to the European External Action Service; Colleen Merchant, director general of Public Safety Canada’s national cyber security directorate, Schroefl, and Satyamoorthy Kabilan, vice-president of policy for the Ottawa-based Public Policy Forum.

In a pre-conference interview, Kabilan said one of the biggest problems in dealing with cyber attacks is attribution.

“It’s very difficult to say definitively who’s behind a specific attack,” he pointed out. “In many cases there’s a little speculation involved. If you look at the number of attacks where people speculate nation-states are involved, and you look at the number where there have been indictments or statements from nations saying ‘X was responsible for attack Y,’ there’s a huge difference.”

And while it’s clear under NATO’s agreement when countries can come to the aid of another under physical attack, the rules are less clear when it comes to a cyber attack. That’s even more true for the world as a whole.

“We have nothing equivalent to the Geneva Convention when it comes to hybrid and cyber warfare,” Kabilan said. “So the line in the sand when you cross and it means, ‘This is an act of war’ — there isn’t one when it comes to cyber. No one knows what it is, what it should be. This creates some really difficult problems — how do we defend ourselves?”

Canadians don’t take cyber threats seriously, says ex-national security advisor Abuse of the Internet by countries, criminals and terrorists is only going to increase until governments draw a line in... May 9th, 2018 Howard Solomon @HowardITWC Howard Solomon

European countries have been worrying about this since 2007 when Estonia faced a series of cyber attacks against parliament, government departments, banks and the media amid a conflict over a grave marker with Russia. According to Wikipedia, that led to NATO creating a cyber defence centre of excellence in Estonia.

Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, NATO beefed up its forces in Baltic countries, with Canada leading the battle group in Latvia. According to the National Post, they have been the target of repeated disinformation as part of a campaign to discredit NATO forces.

The disinformation ranges from stories about Canadian troops being accommodated in luxury apartments at local taxpayers’ expense, to images that purport to show them littering indiscriminately or fixated on buying beer, Latvia’s defence minister told the National Post.

Around the same time, according to the Globe and Mail, Russian media targeted German NATO soldiers in Lithuania, when it fabricated a story accusing the officers of sexually assaulting a teenage girl.

On the other hand cyber attacks might get out of hand. That’s what some experts think happened in 2017 with the global spread of the NotPetya wiper malware. They believe it started as a Russia-backed attack on Ukraine by planting malware in a Ukranian accounting software package. But the malware spread around the world. Among the victims was the Maersk shipping company, which had to replace 4,000 new servers, 45,000 PCs, and 2,500 applications.

Disinformation — better known as fake news — can be an effective weapon, but it isn’t in the same league as compromising critical infrastructure and ‘jiggling the handles’ just to make people nervous. It does have the advantage, though, of being less messy than an invasion or a few warning shots across a border.

A prime example of how big a disinformation campaign can go is the huge alleged Russia-directed effort during the 2016 U.S. elections — which included hacking email of staff from the Hilary Clinton campaign, and creating phony social media accounts to spread disinformation. There were also hacking incidents leading up to the recent German and French national elections.

In the run-up to Canada’s October federal election the government recently passed a law obliging platforms to create a registry showing who is paying for election-related ads. It also created a task force to prevent covert, clandestine, or criminal activities from influencing or interfering with the electoral process.

The thing is, as Schroefl points out, online war is relatively cheap (compared to a missile or a jet bomber). That’s why he believes large nations are unlikely to dominate cyber warfare: There’s lots of room for small countries.

It also makes it harder to get unanimity on norms of behaviour in cyberspace.

So how can hybrid threats be met? “The lessons from the last years are public-private partnerships, don’t forget critical infrastructure and civilian-military relations,” said Schroefl.

26,,2019-03-21T02:36:00.0000000Z,"Elections in Ontario and New Brunswick last year paused provincial ... Provinces had asked the Liberals to find a way for the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance work, and pressed for better co-ordination in spending to connect remote or rural communities.","OTTAWA — A one-time $2.2-billion windfall in the federal budget to help Canadian cities improve roads, bridges, highways and water systems won't become an annual tradition, Finance Minister Bill Morneau warned Wednesday, even in the face of problems getting the first projects off the ground.

Tuesday's multibillion-dollar top-up will double the money cities receive this year through the federal gas-tax fund, which sends money directly to municipalities each year.

The spending blueprint says the Liberals have approved more than 33,000 projects worth about $19.9 billion in federal financing under new and existing infrastructure programs, but also acknowledges spending has been slower than anticipated, including ""some jurisdictions being slower to prioritize projects.""

Morneau called out four provinces on Tuesday in explaining the Liberals' decision to use the gas-tax fund to kickstart more projects, naming Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick — provinces with conservative-minded governments that don't always co-operate readily with the federal Liberals.

Topping up the fund was the appropriate response, Morneau said Wednesday at a post-budget event in Toronto.

""We haven't been able to do exactly what we expected and that was the reason for the municipal infrastructure top-up,"" he said.

""What you shouldn't do is take this as a conclusion on how we will go forward, but what it is, is an important way for us to move forward now in getting some projects that are stalled going.""

Federal infrastructure funding is regularly subject to delays because funds only flow once receipts are filed, which causes a lag between when work occurs and money is paid out.

An internal analysis of the Liberal program pointed to several issues to explain the pace of spending: too many low-value projects requiring the same detailed review as those much larger in size and delays in getting provincial and territorial project recommendations.

Elections in Ontario and New Brunswick last year paused provincial project approvals during the campaign. There are also delays in approvals when a new government is elected — as was the case in Ontario and New Brunswick — as new office holders learn their files and review government operations.

Even more spending will flow through funds managed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The federation's president, Mayor Vicki-May Hamm of Magog, Que., said the measures are a direct response to pleas from cities to modernize their relationship with Ottawa so they don't have to rely solely on the provinces.

Under the federal Liberal government's infrastructure program, federal spending will top $186 billion over the next decade.

How successful the plan has been to date is an area of contention between the Liberals and the parliamentary budget watchdog, who most recently questioned anew whether increases in federal spending have created the jobs promised by the government.

Other investments have, according to provinces, fallen short of what was required, particularly on rural broadband internet service. Provinces had asked the Liberals to find a way for the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance work, and pressed for better co-ordination in spending to connect remote or rural communities.

The Liberals created the bank in 2017 to take $35 billion in federal financing and use it to leverage three to four times that from the private sector to help pay for major highways, bridges, and water and electrical systems. To get private money involved, projects needed to produce revenue streams — tolls, for instance. Fees for internet service are already typical, but serving remote, sparsely populated areas with high-speed lines is a financial challenge.

On Tuesday, the Liberals added a new component to the Crown agency, earmarking $1 billion over 10 years for rural broadband, but mandating the bank find at least $2 billion more in private capital for the initiative. It was part of a plan to deliver up to $6 billion over a decade to connect everyone in the country to high-speed internet by 2030.

Rural Economic Development Minister Bernadette Jordan said in an interview that federal departments, other governments, telecommunications companies and others in the private sector needed to co-ordinate work ""to make sure that we do meet those objectives.""

""We have to look at every possible way to leverage the money because this is a huge project,"" she said.

""Connecting Canada is not going to be an easy, overnight fix. We've said that from day one. But we have a plan, we know which way we need to go with it and we know we have to work together in order to achieve it.""

If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were so inclined, he could send Canadians to the polls before Canada Day. He would not ...","But until this week, it was not clear that the option of a presummer federal vote was even available.

Per Alberta law, Notley could have called the election for a vote to be held as late as May 31 — blocking off in the process most of the spring's political calendar.

It is easier to make a case for the Liberals using all the time at their disposal to allow the dust to settle on SNC-Lavalin than to explain why the Conservatives are not clamouring for an election.

Polls show the affair has taken a toll on Trudeau's electoral prospects. Still whether that damage is permanent remains an open question.

On balance, Tuesday's budget was well received. Anyone looking for a visionary document was left hungry. Finance Minister Bill Morneau's fourth budget will not go down in history for its structural impact on the country. As a rule, few pre-election budgets do.

But nor did it come across as the product of a government on its last legs, at a loss to spring back from the hits it has been taking for more than a month.

If anything, Morneau seemed more comfortable with his latest budget than with some of the previous ones. In his first years as a minister, he might have been destabilized by Conservative efforts to shout down his budget speech. That did not happen on Tuesday.

The opposition parties may want to prevent the government from moving on from this crisis, but anecdotal evidence suggests public fatigue with the SNC-Lavalin is already setting in. The federal budget alone will not change the conversation on Parliament Hill but other issues are moving up on the radar.

If the past is any indication, public patience with parliamentary guerrilla wars and those who instigate them tends to be limited.

For the better part of the past month Scheer has been arguing that the prime minister no longer has the moral authority to govern. On Trudeau's role in the SNC-Lavalin affair, he has already come to a conclusion.

The Conservative party is committed to paralyzing Parliament for as long as it takes for the government to cave to its demands — something that seems unlikely to happen between now and the election.

If Scheer believes his own rhetoric, should he not be calling for Canadians to be given the earliest possible opportunity to kick the Liberals out?

And yet, prior to and since Tuesday's budgets, he has had plenty of opportunities to call for an earlier election and he has so far passed on all of them.

Scheer is betting that weeks of parliamentary warfare will enhance his pre-election standing. As it happens so — at least for now — is Trudeau.

What we will have to decide about in this election, is the fiction of slashing revenue to generate revenue, versus the reality of needing to build revenue to generate strength. We’ll also be witness ...","Premier Rachel Notley’s NDP clearly hopes to make Opposition Leader Jason Kenney’s character the ballot box issue for voters in the April 16 provincial election, but will the United Conservative Party’s scandals have as much traction now that the election writ has been dropped?

The risk for the NDP strategy, even if daily reminders of the UCP leader’s flawed character and his party’s problem with extremists continue, is that they will get lost amid the daily policy announcements both parties and their smaller rivals are bound to make during an election campaign.

For a government generally perceived to be campaigning from behind its principal challenger in popular support, the campaign didn’t get off to a bad start from the NDP’s perspective, with near simultaneous revelations that more fines had been levied in the UCP’s “Kamikaze Campaign” scandal and that a high-profile UCP candidate had been forced to quit the race after her apparent white supremacist views became known.

On Tuesday, the day Premier Notley called the election, the Office of the Election Commissioner announced that it had levied two additional fines related to Jeff Callaway’s UCP leadership campaign in 2017, which has come to be known as the “Kamikaze Mission,” so called in a leaked recording of UCP strategists talking because its intent was allegedly not to win, but to knock off Mr. Kenney’s main rival, former Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean.

The two $4,000 administrative penalties were levied against one Darcy McAllister. One was for contributing funds to the Callaway campaign that were furnished by another person, the other for “furnishing $4,000 to Maja McAllister, for purpose of making contribution to Jeff Callaway.”

The same day, it was learned that Caylan Ford, a star candidate personally recruited by Mr. Kenney to run in the Calgary-Mountain View riding had abruptly pulled out of the race after a progressive news site revealed she had complained that white supremacist terrorists are treated unfairly by the media compared with Islamic terrorists.

According to the report in Press Progress, Ms. Ford also expressed anxiety about “the replacement of white peoples in their homelands” and mused about the violent collapse of Western civilization as a result.

Since then, her uncomplimentary views on LGBTQ Pride Parades have also come to light. They are “a celebration of vice and transgression,” she opined, asking: “What are the redeeming values?”

Well, so much for the Caylan Ford campaign, for the moment anyway.

This in turn prompted an understandable debate on social media about Mr. Kenney’s own views, particularly on race and LGBTQ rights, and, whatever they are, what it is about the UCP that seems to attract such characters from the dark fringes of the right.

And the evening and the morning were the second day.

No time like an election to talk politics? Not at the U of A!

One would think there’d be no time like an election to talk about politics, especially at a university

But as it turns out, not everyone agrees. Leastways, certain folk appear to be uncomfortable with the idea of a brisk discussion that might lead to a critical consideration of the consequences of implementing some of the policies being proposed by the Opposition in the upcoming Alberta election.

A memorandum yesterday from the director of the Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life at the University of Alberta’s Augustana Campus in Camrose, for example, announced that a coffee and conversation event about Alberta politics planned for today would be cancelled because … wait for it … an election has been called!

“As you probably know, yesterday an election was called in Alberta,” wrote an apologetic-sounding Ian D. Wilson to the centre’s friends and supporters. “Now that campaigning has officially started, the U of A President’s Office has asked all units at the University to ensure that our activities do not influence the election in any way.” (Emphasis added.)

Say what?

“The goal of this Ronning Centre event was to facilitate an informed discussion about the interrelationship of religion and politics in the Alberta context, not to influence anyone’s political position during the election season,” Dr. Wilson said. “But in this case, given the timing of the election call, we think it is best to follow the President’s advice with due diligence and to cancel the event.”

Hmmmmm. For those of you who think an election might be an ideal time to talk about politics and policy, perhaps the explanation is that U of A President David Turpin took enough of a beating from the UCP over that honorary degree for environmentalist David Suzuki last year.

Well, there’s no point beating him up again this time, as the former University of Victoria president has already announced he’ll be outta here after June 2020. So, whatever the reason for his typically Albertan excess of election caution, he’s only going to have to put up with one more typical Alberta winter.

Chester Ronning, after whom the centre is named, would certainly not have had a problem with a briskly critical discussion of policy during an election, especially the kind of policies put forward by the UCP.

Born in 1894 in Xiangfan, China, to Christian missionaries, Mr. Ronning graduated from the University of Alberta in 1916 and returned to China in 1922 to continue his parents’ mission. He came back to Alberta in 1927 to serve as principal of the Camrose Lutheran College, which occupied the site that is now the U of A’s the Augustana Campus. Like Dr. Suzuki, he was awarded many honorary degrees.

Mr. Ronning served Canada as a diplomat in China, Norway and India, and led an attempt to bring a negotiated end to the Vietnam War in 1966.

In politics, he was elected as a United Farmers of Alberta MLA in 1932 and served as leader of the Alberta branch of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the predecessor to the NDP, from 1940 to 1942.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau has promised the budget will contain help for workers in need of skills training, young people looking to buy their first homes, seniors worried about their own finances, and patients with high drug costs.

“It’s an election budget … There’s been a tendency to use these as important communications vehicles – almost platform-launching vehicles,” Kevin Page, Canada’s former parliamentary budget officer, said in reference to recent budgets from federal and multiple provincial governments.

The likelihood that the Liberals will use the budget to sell their own record raises a question: who deserves credit for Canada’s strong economic run?

Job-creation numbers have been solid and the unemployment rate has fallen close to a 40-year low. A recent Statistics Canada report said in 2017 fewer Canadians were living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade. The agency credited the drop to a mix of a stronger economy and the Liberals’ enhancement of child benefits.

Canada rode a long stretch of impressive economic growth until the final three months of 2018 before it abruptly decelerated – and nearly stalled – along with a drop in oil prices. Experts predict the economy will regain its momentum over the coming months.

But even with a surprisingly weak end to 2018, Ottawa’s financial situation is better than last November’s fall fiscal update projected.

Experts say the federal treasury pulled in more tax revenues than anticipated. Many fully expect the Liberals to dedicate the bulk of the extra money to new promises, as they’ve done with windfalls in past budgets and economic statements.

Over the last few years, the Liberals have spent billions more than they promised in their 2015 election platform.

[RANT] Trudeau’s deficits: Short-term gain, long-term pain

They vowed to post annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to return to balance by 2019. Instead, they’ve posted shortfalls of more than $18 billion in each of the last two years and have offered no timeline to balance the budget. In their November update, the Liberals projected annual deficits of between $18.1 billion and $19 billion over the next three years.

Morneau has regularly argued that the Liberal plan is working.

“Our government has made smart and responsible investments in the middle class, and Canadians are seeing concrete results,” Morneau told the House of Commons last month as he announced the budget date.

Morneau has argued the bigger-ticket commitments, in areas such as child benefits and infrastructure, have been necessary to juice the economy for years to come. He’s also insisted the deficits remain small enough that they’re fiscally prudent.

Page expects the Liberals to take credit for the economic improvements and he thinks they deserve some recognition _ particularly for enhancing child benefits and an ambitious, expensive infrastructure plan, despite its slow start.

But he added Canada’s prospects have also been lifted by strong economic performances in the United States and the world as a whole.

Page said it’s difficult to know whether the Liberal deficits will actually raise Canada’s long-term growth or if they’ve mostly created a big, temporary bump in consumer spending, as the government has borrowed money and put it into Canadians pockets.

“You don’t have to be at balance. There’s nothing perfect about a zero (deficit) number in this environment,” said Page, who now heads the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy think-tank at the University of Ottawa. “Having said that, we are adding to the stock of debt and that creates potential instability down the road and we’ll have less room to manoeuvre – and future generations, definitely, are going to pay higher interest costs on the public debt.”

The Opposition Conservatives, some economists and leaders in corporate Canada have criticized the Liberal deficits, especially because they’ve come during good economic times that are traditionally thought to be when governments should pay debt off.

“My concern is, and I’ve said this to him … privately and publicly, it’s not that you’re spending, it’s where you’re spending,” Goldy Hyder, CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said of his exchanges with Morneau. “You’re spending a lot on things that no one can really point to and can say (there’s a) direct line back to helping the economy.”

Hyder said he supported Morneau’s move last fall to use some fiscal space for new accelerated investment write-offs for businesses. He also applauds the Liberals’ commitment to invest in worker training and their earlier efforts on trade, immigration and child benefits.

But he insists there’s an urgent need for Canada to be more competitive on regulations and taxes if it hopes to avoid falling behind the rest of the world.","Liberal budget to applaud Canada’s economy, but who deserves credit?",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/economy/liberal-budget-to-applaud-canadas-economy-but-who-deserves-credit-182168/

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

The federal budget tabled by Finance Minister Bill Morneau focuses on the country’s finances while setting the stage for the impending fall election.

It’s targeted largely towards middle-class voters, with a particular spotlight on baby boomers and millennials – including exemptions aimed at helping low-income working seniors and a modernized home buyer plan for first-time buyers, for instance – rather than providing a clearly defined set of initiatives for small- to mid-sized Canadian businesses.

With that said, skills and training are a notable budget theme for 2019, with some potentially significant benefits to Canadian businesses, in particular startups and companies in the process of scaling up. Here are some of the key takeaways.

Canada Training Credit

Budget 2019 introduces measures to address the barriers to professional development for working Canadians, helping them to upskill in a rapidly evolving, increasingly digital-first workplace at a price tag of $1.7 billion over five years. The newly introduced Canada Training Credit provides assistance to small business owners, entrepreneurs and employees looking to increase skills in their chosen fields.

A refundable tax credit will be available, with claims beginning in late 2020, to help eligible Canadian individuals (aged between 25 to 64 years old) accumulate $250 per year (up to a maximum accumulation of $5,000 over a lifetime) to cover some of the costs of training to learn new job skills at eligible post-secondary institutions.

Canadians must also file a tax return to qualify, earn work wages in excess of $10,000 and have a net income that does not exceed the top of the third tax bracket ($147,667 for 2019). The amount of the refundable credit that can be claimed in a taxation year will be equal to the lesser of one-half of the eligible tuition and fees paid in respect of the year and the individual’s notional account balance. The refundable Canada Training Credit will reduce the amount that will qualify as an eligible expense for the tuition tax credit.

Moreover, a newly introduced EI training benefit aims to provide income support for up to four weeks of paid leave every four years for individuals who take time off work to attend a training program (at 55% of earnings). As an added incentive for small business owners, it’s anticipated they’ll earn a small tax break on their EI premiums, although that has yet to be formalized since EI rates will be set later in the year.

Scientific research incentives for growing Canadian private companies

Story continues below advertisement

Prior to the new budget announcement, Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) could access the enhanced Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credit rate of 35% for expenditures up to $3 million every year.

Budget 2019 aims to better support small- and mid-sized businesses as they mature and scale up by eliminating the use of taxable income in the previous taxation year. Previously both taxable income and taxable capital of the associated group, whichever was higher, were used before Tuesday’s budget announcement when determining a CCPC’s annual expenditure limit and ability to access the refundable 35% tax credit rate.

Small business deduction for farming and fishing incomes

While much attention was paid in recent years to startups focused on using technology to disrupt existing industries, Budget 2019 also proposes to provide more relief for farming and fishing businesses. It plans to do this by counteracting measures introduced in 2016 which prevented CCPC’s “specified corporate income” from being eligible for a small business deduction. The exception will now be retroactively expanded to include a CCPC’s income from sales of farming products or fishing catches of its business to any arm’s-length purchaser corporation. This was previously only available for sales to co-operative corporations.

Canada-wide high-speed internet access by 2030

Another promise by the Trudeau government is 100% access to high-speed internet across Canada by the year 2030. While more of a long-term goal with total investment of $1.7 billion, this could have a positive impact on small businesses operating in rural areas of the country, could unlock new opportunities in the e-commerce sector and allow businesses to access previously untapped customers and markets.

Corporate rates and stock option deduction for small and growing businesses goes unchanged

Also of note: no changes were proposed to the corporate income tax rates or to the $500,000 small business income limit of a CCPC. Meanwhile, Budget 2019 seeks to limit the availability of the stock option deduction for “large, long-established, mature firms” to an annual maximum of $200,000 of stock option grants (based on the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant), while the stock option deduction will remain unchanged for startups and small businesses.

He indicates this is negative news for smaller companies looking for buyout deals. McDermitt offers technical analysis on large cap names in the space and highlights narrowing patterns, which suggest possible breakouts.

Transcript:

James West: Charting Man Dan McDermott joins me now via Skype from Asheville, North Carolina, right, Dan?

Dan McDermott: That’s right, glad to be back!

James West: Yeah, it’s great to have you back. Dan, so today our theme is, you know, the outlook for cannabis stocks and the economy generally in the context of the 2020 elections, and you had some interesting hypotheses – theses, we’ll call them. Why don’t we start with that?

Dan McDermott: Sure. So it’s bigger-picture, you know, we’re looking 20 months out, and I’m told that in the US it’s a much bigger deal. We look a lot further ahead in the election than you do in Canada, and that’s probably because there’s billions of dollars doing their best to purchase the outcomes. But what we’re going to be looking for is, we clearly see that the stock market is a fan of Trump and Republicans. It’s been going up since he was elected, in a very big way.

So we can assume that if Trump is re-elected, the market is going to be, you know, continue to do well, continue to hold on. And that would be important for the MJ sector because, you know, I’m always talking about correlations to the S&P 500 and how big of an impact that does have on the sector as a whole.

But we can also look at the other side of things and say that if a Democrat were to win, that would be negative for the overall market in my opinion, and we can anticipate things are going to go down due to a number of reasons. You know, we have Democrats talking about reining in the biotech sector, reining in the big banks, reining in Citizens United, which allows Big Money to have influence on politics. So if that were to happen, we would anticipate the markets would go down.

But we can make the assumption that if a Democrat were to be elected, they are very likely to have a very pro-marijuana legalization platform as well. So we can assume that while the markets will be going down in a reaction to a win, we would see the MJ market start to thrive again, anticipating that we would get accelerated steps toward legalization. So it’s almost like the marijuana sector could be a hedge play to go bullish in, as the market pulls back if there were a Democrat elected.

Now, way too soon to look at polls or anything like that, but this is just broader picture, something to start wrapping our heads around as we get ready for 2020.

James West: Sure. So are you suggesting, then, that a Republican victory, while it will be good for a broader economy, would be less beneficial to the progress of cannabis de-prohibition in the US than would a Democrat win?

Dan McDermott: I would say so. I think it’s inevitable regardless; we’re just talking timelines, and I think a Democrat would probably be a faster timeline towards legalization, towards, you know, rescheduling, getting the banking sector involved, all of the key points that we need to see for the US MJ market to start to thrive. So it would be an accelerated version of what’s going to play out, if the Democrats were to pull out a victory.

James West: Sure. Do you think the scope and scale of the cannabis market in 2020 would be sufficient to offset the broader economic downturn that would be engendered by a Democratic victory, as they seek to bring debt and spending under control?

Dan McDermott: Not big picture, not as far as a whole market is concerned; but if we’re talking individuals, you know, my parents are of the age of entering retirement, and so I’m constantly wondering, you know, what are people that have retirement accounts going to be doing? And if we were to see a Democrat victory, it would be bad timing in the sense that, you know, their investments would probably be taking a hit while they’re already retired, while they’re relying on that money.

But if they make that hedge play and go into the MJ space, in my opinion, it will make the blow to their account a little bit less severe.

James West: Interesting. Okay, so one of the events in the cannabis space that I wanted to touch on is, we saw HEXO bought Newstrike. So that’s, HEXO was the larger company there, and Newstrike was the lesser company, but against normal traditions when that kind of thing happens, we saw that the acquiring company’s stock went up, as did the acquiree, which is contrary to the normal pattern of the acquiring company’s stock taking a hit in the short term until it actually ingests the smaller company.

Why do you think that the stock of HEXO rose on news of the takeover bid?

Dan McDermott: Well, I won’t take credit for John back there, but deal was done with no premium, and that’s significant, and usually you see a premium paid to the company, and that’s why, you know, people invest in these smaller companies hoping to get bought out. And this is a change from that norm, and it’s also a potential, maybe an omen for future companies, saying, wow, you know, we don’t have as much hype in the space; maybe those premiums are going to start shrinking a little bit, so maybe all these smaller companies, these smaller LPs that are looking for the potential of a buyout deal from a CGC or a bigger company, maybe they’re not going to get as good a deal.

So I think it has a bit of a ripple effect in terms of perhaps lowering expectations in terms of the premiums that smaller companies are going to receive in the near term future.

James West: Okay. All right, Dan, so what are we looking at, here?

Dan McDermott: So we’ve got CGC, this is a five to six week long pattern, and it’s just a tightening range, and if we were going to visualize this, it would be something along the lines of a pendulum, where the swings are getting smaller and smaller each time, and we’re going to reach what I call, this is an equilibrium pattern, and we reach a flex point where we literally can’t get any tighter. And when that pattern reaches that flex point and we get a clear break, we see a volume spike – so next week, we’re anticipating this pattern is going to break. And people that draw trendlines – I’m not much of a trendline-drawer myself, but if we were to do it here, you could just see visually it’s a tightening range that’s going to be forming.

So like I said, we’re anticipating a break next week. Here we are, coming down towards the support here, and the key levels to be watching: 43.71 on CGC as a support level, and our new resistance level that’s key is 48.01. So we’re going to see this range continue to tighten into next week; we’re going to see a volume spike somewhere along the lines of, oh, let’s say, 12 million-plus shares traded. Right now our 20-day average is about 7 million shares traded.

So the volume spike tells us the break is occurring, and we’re going to be looking for this break to dictate pretty much where we’re headed for April in terms of momentum. So I do believe, obviously, because this is the sector leader, in my opinion, that it’s going to have a significant impact on all the names in the sector. There will be some names that can, you know, go against the grain and do their own thing, but at a broader sense, this break of this CGC pattern is going to be really important for, again, end of March into April.

James West: Interesting. So the break that you’re speaking about, is this a sign that investors are getting sort of fatigued with the diminished performance potential as a result of this consolidation pattern, and that that’s going to cause some abandonment of the play?

Dan McDermott: One thing that we don’t do is, we don’t, you know, try and predict direction. So with these equilibrium patterns, they’re very common after a high volatility; so when we had this huge move back in January and February and we entered a new range, this is just price discovery; this is trying to find out, you know, where we stand, and so we’re not saying it’s going to be a bull break or a bear break, but we know a break is imminent. So if we get a bull break, we’re going to see shorts covered, and we’re going to see bulls pile on as we look to test the recent high of 51.81.

If we see a bear break, we’re going to see stop losses trigger, we’re going to see bears jump in, and there’s a lack of support down under 41.68, so we would potentially be looking to the upper $30 area as a target from there. So it really, it’s going to paint a completely different picture depending on which direction this break does occur.

James West: Wow. So I guess absent a fundamental catalyst, is it more likely, in your opinion, that we’re going to see a break to the downside, whereas if we do see something that would be considered fundamentally significant, that the break might happen to the upside?

Dan McDermott: I would say that the break right now is favoured to the upside for a number of reasons. Number one, the trend, just in the sense of where we are coming from: we’re coming off of a bull move, and this is a tightening pattern from that bull move. And Number two, the S&P 500 has really impressed me in terms of the resiliency of these bulls over the past three months since the December crash. They’ve held up extremely well, and we’ve got oil holding up extremely well. So until I see weakness in the S&P 500 or in oil, I’m not going to anticipate significant weakness in the MJ sector.

James West: Okay, do you have an S&P chart good to go, there?

Dan McDermott: Sure, we can pull it up. This is SPY, which is the ETF which tracks the S&P 500. Let’s clear up these lines. So just looking at the weekly time frame: again, the dump from December, we saw just a straight-up V-shaped recovery with no consolidation. We finally got the consolidation we were looking for, and it lasted all of pretty much one week, and just like that, the bulls are right back to the high of the bounce. So, holding on very strong, and at this point for me, we’re going to have to break the low of last week to see any kind of bearish momentum in this sector, or I should say in the markets as a whole.

So, 272.42 on SPY is a key level for me, and if we were to pull back into next week on SPY, back to the low 270s, that’s a scenario where I could foresee CGC breaking bearish. CRON is also at a pretty critical point in terms of coming up on a couple key supports: 19.50 and then down to 18.72, these are US numbers. But again, once these levels break, if they do break, there’s a lack of support immediately below those levels, just like there is on CGC. So bears could get a little bit of follow-through if it is indeed how it plays out.

James West: Uh-huh. Looking at the large cap cannabis companies, it seems like they’re all sort of falling into this pattern, this equilibrium pattern after the big spike in the first quarter of 2019. And is that more or less indicative of the potential for another summer downward drift absent sector-wide catalysts?

Dan McDermott: Yeah, we’re definitely looking for that. Seasonality has been a big part of the MJ sector for quite some time; we’ve talked about it on your show here in the past. So it is, I mean, and it’s almost a self-fulfilling prophecy to a certain degree, where this is the narrative that we’re seeing in chat rooms and in social media groups that are concerned with the sector. Just, you know, people are expecting that perhaps ‘sell in May, go away’ is going to be occurring in the space. and for a lot of names, I mean, it wouldn’t be a significant red flag if we were to see consolidation.

Just looking at CRON, the run that we saw back at the end of the year, I mean, we could pull back into the upper teens and still be just fine on a longer term picture with how significantly we have run. I mean, just looking back, we ran to 15.30; we gave back 50 percent of that move, and then saw a continuation. So if you are truly long term and you’re looking out, you know, three, five years plus, then weekly consolidation and a bear break of these daily patterns wouldn’t really be a major concern at this point.

James West: Wow, Dan, fascinating as per usual. I always learn so much when I’m talking to you. We’re going to leave it there for now; I’ll come back to you next week. Thanks so much for your input as usual.

Dan McDermott: Thanks, James. See you next time.",Charting Man Dan on the 2020 Election and Market Movers in the Cannabis Space,midasletter.com,https://midasletter.com/2019/03/charting-man-dan-2020-election-market-movers-cannabis-space/
33,,2019-03-20T14:48:00.0000000Z,"It’s the final budget the Liberal government will release before this fall’s election. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) The federal government has promised to spend $700 million over the next 10 years for Canada’s North, with money coming for post ...","The federal government has promised to spend $700 million over the next 10 years for Canada’s North, with money coming for post-secondary education in the North, new infrastructure and Arctic research.

The budget, released Tuesday by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, is the fourth and last the Liberal government will table before the next federal election, set for October.

Overall, the budget delivers few big-ticket, signature programs but offers several programs targeting key electoral constituencies heading into the election campaign.

Across the North, the budget recommits to develop a new Arctic and Northern Policy Framework in consultations with Indigenous people and the Northern territories. But it doesn’t include a timeline for when that will be complete.

Here’s a breakdown with some of the other highlights for the territories.

Northwest Territories

One of the biggest individual spending promises for the Northwest Territories is $18 million over the next three years to start paying to expand the Taltson hydroelectric system.

That project is a key plank in the territory’s climate change plan, but the territory has long said it cannot pay for it without Ottawa’s help. Though there is not an up-to-date cost estimate, a 2014 business case priced the expansion at $1.2 billion.

Another $13 million has been promised for the Dechinta Centre for Research and Learning starting this year and continuing over five years to deliver a “culturally appropriate and community-developed curriculum.”

In addition, the government also recommitted to amending the Canada National Parks Act to legally establish the Thaidene Nene National Park Reserve.

In February, members of the Lutsel K’e Dene First Nation voted 89 per cent in favour of establishing the national park reserve.

Further reading: Small deficit projected in Northwest Territories budget

Nunavut

An addictions treatment facility has been promised for Nunavut, which has not had one in the territory for more than 20 years, according to budget documents.

Though the budget did not include a specific figure, that facility would be paid for through spending from the Nunavut government and other Inuit organizations.

The federal government also pledges to continue funding programs with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, such as $50 million over 10 years for the Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy, which was first announced in 2016. That is the exact figure Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami asked for in its pre-budget submissions.

The biggest news, I think, is the commitment for the addictions treatment facility in Nunavut. However, there isn't any money associated with it, and it seems contingent on funding from the Government of Nunavut, and ""Inuit partners."" pic.twitter.com/NHFpl7zqkk — Nick Murray (@NickMurray91) March 19, 2019

Overall, the budget lays out $286.2 million over five years in spending for Inuit-specific programs. That includes:

$125.5 million over 10 years for an Inuit-led post-secondary education strategy.

$50 million over 10 years to continue the National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy.

$220 million over five years for health and social services for Inuit children.

Environment and Climate Change Canada has also been promised $21.8 million over five years for the Eureka Weather Station on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, for much-needed repairs at the Arctic research facility.

The federal government is also exploring creating a marine conservation area in the High Arctic Basin or Tuvaijuttuq, which is the last portion of the Arctic expected to retain summer sea ice until at least 2050.

In October, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the federal government signed an agreement in principle for a marine protected area for Tallurutiup Imanga, also referred to as Lancaster Sound.

Yukon

Yukon College has been promised $26 million over the next five years for a new science building on campus. This money is supposed to support the college’s transformation as “Canada’s first university in the North.”

The budget also recommits to return all direct proceeds from the federal carbon tax back to the Yukon and Nunavut governments. The Northwest Territories has already released its carbon pricing plan.

Northern Quebec: Makivik Corporation reacts to federal budget “In relation to Makivik’s mandate, today’s Federal budget announcement will help address issues related to the Inuit and the Arctic,” said Charlie Watt, president of Makivik Corporation, the land claims organization representing the Inuit of Northern Quebec, in a press release. Watt welcomes the budget’s funding for post secondary education, suicide prevention, health and social services for Inuit children and Indigenous languages, as well as a measure to forgive or reimburse land claim loans.

34,Business,2019-03-21T16:41:00.0000000Z,"Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with ...","Through Elections BC's political donations database, the Star verified that between 2005 and 2013, SNC-Lavalin and the company's chairman of the board at the time, Gwyn Morgan, donated a combined total of $196,157 to the BC Liberal Party.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

35,,2019-03-22T04:33:00.0000000Z,Former Competition Bureau commissioner John Pecman notes a federal election is looming ... laws governing corporate competition reflect Canada’s outdated view of itself as primarily a ...,"Canadians like to believe they live in one of the most sophisticated free-market economies in the world. Don’t tell that to John Pecman. Until May of last year, Pecman was commissioner of the Competition Bureau, the agency responsible for enforcing laws against anti-competitive practices in the Canadian marketplace.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Want Justice? Then Let the Youth Lead When The Tyee’s Katie Hyslop won a major honour, here’s how she used the platform it provided.

After he stepped down in September 2018, he published an article in the Canadian Competition Law Review that called for reforms to give the bureau more power to check corporate concentration, including added independence by separating it from the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development.

In a phone interview with The Tyee last week, Pecman elaborated, saying that federal laws governing corporate competition reflect Canada’s outdated view of itself as primarily a resource exporter and otherwise unable to compete with the big U.S. economy next door.

This led to laws favouring corporate consolidation in the name of “efficiency” over promoting competition or the interests of consumers.

The Competition Bureau he ran lacks the independence that would make it truly effective, he said — a vulnerability to political meddling that brings to mind other headline grabbing moments in Ottawa of late.

“Scarce enforcement resources” further erode the bureau’s ability to take initiative, he noted. The Trudeau government trimmed the bureau’s already strained budget to help cover a $950-million industry initiative called “superclusters,” says Pecman.

When it comes to not just studying market concentration but moving to break it up, says Pecman, Canada is “so far behind other western economies on this front. The fact that the country does not treat competition policy seriously is just a great disappointment to someone who has spent his entire life working in this area.”

Here is more of what Pecman, who spent 34 years at the bureau and now is senior business advisor at the nation-wide law firm Fasken, had to say...

On why it’s time to get the Competition Bureau out of the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development:

“If you look at any international body’s recommendations on institutional framework and design for competition authorities, the number one no-no is to be housed in the industry department that’s there supporting business, particularly [corporate] ‘national champions.’ Of course the industry department is probably the most lobbied department, so there’s the perception of political interference.”

On years of competition law foot-dragging in Canada:

“Competition law has been sort of shunned to the side, other than there were some serious amendments in 2010. I think particularly when you’re reading the papers today and [headlines reflecting] the angst about monopolies and IT giants, and corporate concentration and income inequality, we haven’t heard much from the government on any plans to study these issues.

“There have been calls outside of my requests from time to time to look at the law. For example, Carolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada. During her speech this past year at the G7, she raised a concern about the growth of the IT giants and its impact on labour.”

On ‘scarce resources’ and ignored cases:

“Notably, on the abuse of [corporate market] dominance or consumer protection and deceptive marketing practices, particularly on the latter part, we receive more complaints than we have resources. We have to be careful, the bureau does, where to invest our scarce enforcement resources.”

On the big 2008 recommendation never enacted:

“If you are familiar at all with the competition review policy report done by L.R. (Red) Wilson [for the Canadian Council of Chief Executives] back in 2008... the largest recommendation that they made was to create an independent Canadian competitiveness council that would report to parliament that would do the advocacy and the policy work for competition. And that was not adopted by the previous government or this government.”

On how Canada lags behind other nations, hurting innovation:

“There is a huge gap. Most countries around the world have their competition authorities spending significant budgets to work in terms of promoting competition. In Canada, that’s just not the case. It depends on the discretion of the commissioner. There is no expressed authority to do it.

“To me, there needs to be some clarification of the importance of competition policy and advocacy in Canada with expressed authority to do that kind of work — whether it’s referred back to an independent competitiveness council to do the work or give the authority to the competition bureau. Someone has to do it.

“It’s hurting the competitiveness of the country not focusing on that, including the innovation agenda. The number one driver of innovation is competition.”

On why the Competition Bureau is ‘spinning its wheels’ because it can’t make regulations:

“We are so far behind other western economies on this front. It’s just disappointing. The fact that the country does not treat competition policy seriously is just a great disappointment to someone who has spent his entire life working in this area, knowing how powerful it is.

“Let’s take a good example — FinTech (Financial Technology). We engaged in a serious market study on the whole question of financial services technology. We put together a significant consultation and put out a report with 30 recommendations, including moving to an open banking system whereby consumers can move their banking data easily to competitors, whether it’s FinTechs or other banks, to facilitate competition, lower prices, better services.

“The government, in its last speech in the throne, identified this as important and in finances started to look at the issue.

“But in England, their competition authority did a robust market study because [unlike Canada] they can compel information from companies. Then it issued regulations. So England is about a year ahead of us. They’ve actually implemented open banking. And the FinTech companies and services and banking service fees have gone down significantly in the U.K. And FinTech is twice the size in Europe as it is in Canada.

“So there’s an example of the importance of competition advocacy in changes by government to facilitate competition and the benefits to the marketplace, where consumers have greater choice, lower prices, better services, better quality.

“And so, we’re spinning our wheels on open banking. The finance department is going to study this for years and who knows where it is going to end up?

“It just speaks to the lower priority competition policy has in Canada, in my view, compared to Europe, Australia, the U.S.”

On why Canada tolerates such high corporate concentration:

“I think it has to do with the fact is that we’re a small open economy next to the U.S. Economic thinking back in the ‘60s was that we needed to have large economies of scale in order to be competitive internationally. And of course, Canada has significant barriers to foreign competition in many sectors, whether it’s the financial services, transport, agriculture, just go down the list.

“The government has created economic policies that create corporate concentration, with the view of becoming more competitive internationally. I think that’s the thinking behind it. Whether it’s been successful or not, you can be the judge of that.”

On why ‘efficiencies’ enriching corporate shareholders supersede consumer interests:

“The ‘efficiencies defence’ was part of that thinking [that], in Canada, having larger companies to compete internationally was important. So this defence, which is an outright defence [supporting] an anti-competitive merger, was implemented. And we’re unique in that. I think we’re the only major economy in the world that has this defence, whereby an anti-competitive merger could proceed because of cost savings. Sometimes just static cost savings going to shareholders are more significant than potential higher prices to consumers or other businesses.

“It’s something that I don’t believe we should be an outlier on.”

On how consumer resentment may fuel populism:

“I just think [the efficiencies defence] needs a rethink, particularly when you’re looking at the whole issue of populism, corporate concentration and income inequality. In Canada, we can clear mergers to create increases in concentrations — further increases in concentration — because of cost savings that go to shareholders from a merger transaction. Increases that could be one-time, that do not benefit the economy at all writ large.”

On Canada’s own monopoly game, and why it’s rigged:

“I’m concerned about the rules that have created the concentration in Canada. Concentration per se, is not a problem. That is the end game for any company in a business — they want to become a monopoly. And if you earned organically and not through anti-competitive processes, more power to you! You’ve got a better mouse trap, you can reap the monopoly benefits of that.

“That’s not what competition laws are designed to prevent. They’re preventing abuses in a monopoly situation, or once you’ve emerged to become a monopoly. That’s what competition laws are in place to do.

“So really, the concentration piece doesn’t bother me, it’s how these companies are able to obtain concentration in Canada. It’s not through open, competitive markets. It’s through protection from government, protecting companies against competition.

“That’s the concern I have in Canada, with regard to our foreign investment rules, our supply management rules, our efficiency defences — those are my concerns with our process in Canada.”

On whether corporate concentration and competition could be an election issue this fall:

“I think it’s starting to make its way back to the front pages, and people may be following. But generally speaking, it’s an obtuse area that most don’t pay attention to. And so it rarely makes it as a priority in politicians’ platforms because it’s not a big vote-getter at the end of the day.

“But there’s a federal election coming up and, you know, what better way of targeting the middle class or consumers than saying there’s going to be a review of the Competition Act, given the growing concern about corporate concentration. To me it’s an easy, low-hanging fruit.

The reality for Justin Trudeau is that he needs these goodies in a way he didn't think he would.

Now he has found a way to help them buy their first homes and stay in his tent.

He was focused in his first mandate on helping lift people into the middle class, even though there are so many other ways to pick their pockets.

Now he has found late-stage promises like mid-life learning support to induce their support at the polls in the fall.

He forgot entirely about seniors.

Now in his budget, he is signalling his understanding of the necessary commitment to them - they, after all, vote in disproportionate numbers, and there are more and more of them and more to come.

Enter the prospect of pharmacare, if still faint in nature.

He appeared at first benign about business, then ham-handed in handling small business concerns about taxation and big business concerns about competitiveness and productivity.

On the former, he has generally patched things up over time, with some hard feelings remaining; on the latter, his budget Tuesday suggests he either doesn't think it matters for his political health or doesn't actually care. The yellowing and reform-needing tax code might outlive the lifespan of paper.

You can almost hear someone saying: ""Businesses don't vote. People do.""

Some governments would look at the recent operating surplus and say it was time to prune taxes as the country is stricken with economic stagnation and heads toward the first round of uncertainty in a decade.

That would leave some manoeuvrability if the storm hits shore. But the Liberals have determined in the time-honoured tradition of election cycles that it is again the moment to spend - as they have in their first term, for that matter, at a 6.5 per cent annual rate of growth - to improve their lately shakier odds of re-election.

For a government that has been at the helm during prosperous times, the Liberals have not demonstrated much interest in scrubbing the balance sheet.

Its projections suggest the deficit for the year ending March 31 will drop to $14.9 billion from $19 billion - thanks to revenue, not prudence - then rocket again to nearly $20 billion in the following two years.

Their optimism is that it is halved by 2023-24, after the second-next election.

They haven't extensively targeted spending programs that have outlived usefulness, nor particularly enabled through some support programs the next wave of wealth generation.

The extra $1.4 billion commitment to skills training will not hurt - workers 25 to 64 will accumulate credits of $250 annually to a maximum $5,000 - but will not necessarily align the needs of the labour market because they are not particularly targeted.

You will need to read the budget documents and fall listlessly into a hallucination to find anything to propel investment or corporate tax competitiveness.

In riding the revenue wave and pointing to lifetime lows in unemployment, the Liberals have taken a what-me-worry? pose.

They are content to sustain a debt-to-GDP ratio, maybe lower it a bit - all the while rolling out nearly $23 billion in new programs in the half-dozen years ahead.

This spendthrifty character could be a regret in a matter in a year or so, but that is a matter for a year or so.

Meantime there is an election machinery that needs to fire on all cylinders, have talking points for each riding it hounds, and nothing approaching sour medicine to spoon out.

To that end, Finance Minister Bill Morneau is straight out of Central Casting in the role of using our money - and, I suppose, our childrens' - to supply the illusion of improvement in our lives.

By The Canadian Press on March 20, 2019.

SILKEBORG, Denmark – Chelsea Carey’s Canadian rink bounced back with a much-needed 8-7 win over China’s Jie Mei on Wednesday at the world women’s curling championship.

The win improved the Calgary-based team’s record to 4-4 as it aims to avoid becoming the first Canadian rink to miss the playoffs at the women’s worlds since 1999.

Canada was in a three-way tie for sixth with Scotland and the United States after the second of three draws on Wednesday. The top six teams in the 13-rink event make the playoffs.

Carey scored three on a draw in the ninth to wipe out a two-point deficit and then held on for the win against a Chinese team (6-2) that entered the draw in a tie for first.

China settled for one in the 10th, giving Canada the win.

Stolen singles in the fifth and seventh ends gave Canada a 5-4 lead before China responded with a deuce in the eighth to go up 6-5.

Canada lost both its games on Tuesday to fall below .500.

The game against China was Canada’s lone contest on Wednesday.

Canada faces Switzerland (4-3) and Russia (6-2) on Thursday.

Tonight, on the finale of season two of TVO’s Political Blind Date, a Conservative and a Liberal stand on the Canadian-American border, and on opposing sides of this question.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, about the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which outlines what each country is obligated to do with asylum seekers arriving in each country.

Political Blind Date sets up two opposing politicians on a “date” to discuss some of the most divisive and pressing issues facing Canada. The topic of asylum seekers has become more prevalent with an increase in refugees crossing Canada’s southern border due to the hostile attitude toward immigrants percolating in the U.S. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, Chair of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee, thinks more resources should go to the processing of refugee claims. Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus, shadow minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, believes refugees shouldn’t be given more aid if they’re crossing illegally.

The two meet first for a coffee at Le Cafe in Hemmingford, Quebec. When Paul-Hus says that he might delve into French if English is insufficient for him to explain an idea, Oliphant mentions that his husband is from Rimouski. “When we’re arguing, he argues in French and I argue in English,” Oliphant says. He gestures across the table between him and Paul-Hus, and they both laugh. But will they end up arguing? Yes. Almost immediately. Oliphant takes issue with Paul-Hus describing asylum seekers’ border crossing as “illegal.” Using himself as an example, he explains that if he went into the U.S. and then came back to Canada at an “irregular border-crossing,” it would be illegal.

On the season two finale of Political Blind Date, Liberal MP Rob Oliphant and Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus debate the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement. ( TVO )

But, he said, “it is very clear in Canadian law and international law, that if you seek asylum on the other side, it’s not illegal.” To Paul-Hus, this is a “loophole” in the rules. He points out that the refugees are crossing from the U.S., and should have applied for refugee status there instead of Canada.

Article Continued Below

According to the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the country where they first arrive. Conservatives want to change the agreement with the U.S. to allow Canada to send those claiming refugee status after crossing at irregular locations back to the U.S.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, while standing at the north side of Roxham Road, the Quebec location where the majority of border crossings have happened over the last two years for irregular asylum claimants.

Conservative Party of Canada seats in the ...","David Anderson figures he’s put around three-quarters of a million kilometres on a succession of vehicles, and flown a couple million more, over his 19-year career in federal politics.

Now, Saskatchewan’s longest-serving Conservative Member of Parliament — and one of just a few left from the Canadian Alliance days — says he won’t stand for re-election when Canadians go to the polls in the fall.

“We’ve put in six terms and at some point there’s a reason to go back to a normal life, particularly around family life,” Anderson said, adding that he spends about two-thirds of his time away from his wife, Sheila.

“It’s time that we started living our life together, not apart, and really enjoying our time together.”

Anderson was first elected to represent Cypress Hills — Grassland in 2000, and was re-elected with wide margins in five subsequent elections. In 2015, he won more than 25,000 votes, good for 69 per cent of the total.

In an interview on Monday, the veteran MP — among current members, only Liberal Ralph Goodale has held a Saskatchewan seat for longer — said he is most proud of the role he played in dissolving the Canadian Wheat Board.

At the time of the still-controversial decision, Anderson was Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and the Canadian Wheat Board, a supporting role for former agriculture minister and Saskatchewan MP Gerry Ritz.

It is not immediately clear who will seek the nomination in the riding, one of the safest Conservative Party of Canada seats in the country. A party spokesman said the date for a nomination meeting has not been set.

“David — thank you for your dedication and your service to SW Sask and to the country. It has been an honour to work with you over the years,” Anderson’s friend, former Premier Brad Wall, said in a tweet on Monday.

Anderson, meanwhile, said he looks forward to spending less time on the road, but leaving public life behind won’t be easy.

“I don’t think anybody leaves easily. There’s a lot of really good things about this job; it’s an incredible privilege to be able to serve. So yeah, I expect there will be some days where it’ll be difficult, but it is the right thing … for us.”

CALGARY – Alberta Premier Rachel Notley has called an election for April 16.

Notley asked cheering supporters standing behind her in Calgary this morning if they are ready to fight for an Alberta that benefits everyone.

She began her attack on the leader of the Opposition United Conservatives immediately.

“The question is this: do Albertans stick together or do we turn on each other?” she said.

“Jason Kenney wants two Albertas – one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us. He wants two Albertas divided over people’s rights.

“I want to continue to build one Alberta.”

The start of a 28-day campaign comes a day after a new session of the legislature began with a throne speech that focused on the NDP government’s accomplishments in the last four years – from building schools, roads and hospitals to providing more supports for seniors, students and those in need.

It also criticized the former Progressive Conservative government, and said the New Democrats have been working to overcome the failures of the past.

The spring election will be the first for the United Conservative Party and its leader Kenney, a federal cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper.

The United Conservatives were Kenney’s answer to unite the right, and were born out of a merger of the Alberta Tories and what was the Opposition Wildrose Party.

By law, the election had to be held by May 31.

The election year budget was offered under a ...,"The Liberal government’s preference for continued deficits and increasing program spending “could increase the vulnerability of public finances to a faster economic slowdown or sudden shock,” according to Fitch Ratings.

Canada has the second largest gross government debt of ‘AAA’ rated countries after the United States, which is ‘incompatible’ with its gold-plated rating, according to the ratings agency.

While the credit agency concedes that increased spending and projected deficits in Canada’s latest budget remain consistent with a falling federal debt burden, the forecast assumes the economy will avoid a recession.

“Modest fiscal loosening and sustained deficits will increase the economy’s exposure to a downturn,” the ratings agency said in its post-budget analysis.

While the expanded federal deficits remain relatively modest at less than one per cent of GDP and are sufficiently low to keep debt-to-GDP ratio drifting lower over the medium term, the country’s gross general government debt, combining federal and provincial fiscal accounts, is higher than other similarly rated sovereigns, and the ratings agency notes that debt levels are “incompatible with (Canada’s) ‘AAA’ status.”

Fitch had issued a similar warning in 2017.

A raft of new spending items in the federal budget aims to stimulate an economy that’s lost momentum, with some analysts suggesting a recession may be around the corner. Canada’s GDP fell by 0.1 per cent in November and December, but the economy managed a marginal 0.4 per cent growth in the fourth quarter.

Earlier this month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it is now forecasting 1.5 per cent growth this year for Canada, compared to its previous call for GDP growth of 2.2 per cent.

On Wednesday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau disputed the notion that recession might rear its head.

“We’re expecting … that we will have a return to growth at expected levels in the second quarter (of 2019) and our long-term forecasts are positive,” Morneau said.

However, investors are becoming more cautious and more convinced that the next interest-rate move from the country’s previously hawkish central bank will be more dovish.

Local yields have fallen in recent weeks amid weakening economic data, a more downbeat assessment from the Bank of Canada and a global rally in bonds. Wednesday’s dovish shift by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the market’s more gloomy view on prospects for the U.S. buoyed sovereign bonds and supported the view that policy makers in Ottawa will need to cut rates.

Modest fiscal loosening and sustained deficits will increase the economy's exposure to a downturn Fitch Ratings

With “the bulk of the curve being below the overnight rate, it really says that the BoC will be reluctantly led to cutting rates,” Ryan Goulding, a fixed-income manager at Vancouver-based Leith Wheeler Investment Counsel Ltd., which manages around $19 billion, told Bloomberg. But it may not happen until “after a long, disappointing wait” for capital spending to pick up, he said.

The annual deficit projections in Tuesday’s budget, which is set to reach as high as $19.8 billion, will be racked up as the government makes several large, one-time investments for 2018-19, including $2.2-billion worth of new infrastructure funding and $1 billion towards improving energy efficiency.

The budget also pledges up to $3.9 billion for supply managed dairy, egg and poultry farmers affected by recent trade deals with the Asia-Pacific and Europe. Other big-ticket items include a $300 million zero-emissions car incentive, and a $1.25 billion houses-for-votes program that provides interest-free loans to first-time home buyers through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.

The election year budget was offered under a backdrop of disappointing growth over the last several months, according to CIBC Capital Market analysts Avery Shenfeld and Andrew Grantham.

“This was less a rain of largesse and more of a sprinkling of measures, aimed at winning-over targeted groups.”

There was an enhancement of the fiscal track since the fall statement, CIBC analysts wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

“With revenues running further ahead of plan, and spending undershooting,” they said.

Instead of aiming at a lower track for deficits than had been laid out last year, CIBC said the government used the extra room generated by the enhancements to announce a dissemination of new spending and tax benefits, “thereby giving the economy a modest dose of stimulus while leaving the deficit track little changed from the fall statement.”

THE CANADIAN PRESS

OTTAWA- The federal Liberal government plans to spend $4.5 billion over the next five years to try to narrow the socio-economic gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people- part of a plan to keep reconciliation at the forefront of this fall’s campaign narrative.

Speaking to reporters inside the budget lockup, Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed the Liberals have been committed to reconciliation from the beginning of their mandate.

“It is a continuation of what we’ve been doing since Day One,’’

Morneau said. “It is driven by the fact that we know in this country, we need to get this right. We’ve got a lot of work to do and we are going to stay on it.’’

Part of the budget pledge is $1.2 billion over three years, $404 million per year beginning in 2019-2020, to develop a long-term approach for services for First Nations children.

The policy is named after a Manitoba First Nations boy from Norway House Cree Nation, Jordan River Anderson, who had multiple disabilities. When he was two years old, doctors recommended he move to a special home suited to his medical needs.

He died three years later, after jurisdictional squabbles between federal and provincial governments over payment for his care.

“It should be no surprise that we continue to deal with issues, like Jordan’s Principle, that we’ve been talking about for a long time,’’ Morneau said.

The budget also includes plans to invest $220 million over five years, beginning in 2019-2020, to provide services to Inuit children who face unique challenges to get health and social services due to the remoteness of their communities and limited availability of culturally appropriate care.

The Liberal government is communicating in the budget it is serious about its commitment to Indigenous Peoples, said Rebekah Young, the director of fiscal and provincial economics with Scotiabank.

“We are looking at almost $5 billion (in new spending) over five years, of a total budget spend of $20 billion,’’ she said. “We are talking about a quarter of the budget.’’

The federal budget also includes plans to move ahead with responding to calls to act from the Truth and Reconciliation that spent six years probing the dark legacy of Canada’s residential schools.

The spending plan includes $126.5 million in 2020-21 to establish a national council on reconciliation designed to serve as a permanent reminder of the fraught past between Canada and Indigenous Peoples and to contribute to better understanding of it. There is also $333.7 million over the next five years earmarked for helping to revitalize Indigenous languages, a move that follows legislation introduced in February.

The funding will help create a commissioner of Indigenous languages, the budget said, adding that only one in seven Indigenous children reports being able to carry on a conversation in an Indigenous language.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said there is no relationship more important than the Canadian government’s with Indigenous Peoples, though some Indigenous leaders and the federal NDP have raised concerns about the rate of progress on the file.

MIAMI – Everything was completely different for Bianca Andreescu at the Miami Open on Thursday compared to her victory in the final of the BNP Paribas Open on Sunday in Indian Wells, Calif.

Except for one thing: the 18-year-old Canadian’s fight and determination.

Andreescu was nearly out in the first round at the hands of Irina-Camelia Begu on Thursday, in a match postponed from the night before because of rain. The product of Mississauga, Ont., was down a set, and down 5-1 in the second set before pulling out a 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2 victory that puts her in the second round against No. 32 seed Sofia Kenin of the U.S.

There won’t be much time to rest as that match will be played Friday afternoon.

The surface in Miami is different than the one in Indian Wells, much quicker. The conditions were different too, being warmer and much more humid.

Even the cheering section was different. Andreescu’s parents, Nicu and Maria (and dog Coco) were on hand, having already arrived in Miami as their teenaged daughter was winning the title in California.

It was a lot to adjust to, only four days after the unexpected triumph of her first win on the WTA.

“I hit 30 minutes before (Wednesday’s postponement), and then 30 minutes today. So just an hour. Now, I know that it’s pretty difficult to come into a new tournament after winning a really big tournament, because everyone has so many expectations,” Andreescu said. “But I try not to focus on that, even though it’s really difficult. And I think that’s what happened today a bit in the first set.”

Andreescu looked short on energy, understandably. While Begu was relatively cool and collected in the other chair, Andreescu was draping the ice towel around her neck, or across her upper legs. She sat on changeovers with another big bag of ice between her thighs. Occasionally, she poured some water over her head.

And Andreescu’s game, usually full of variety, wasn’t working.

Some of that was Begu, who she had beaten in the first round of that Indian Wells run. The veteran Romanian played much better this time, until it came time to close out Andreescu.

After Begu broke her serve for the second time to take a 4-1 lead in the second set, a tearful Andreescu looked for a little inspiration with an on-court consult from coach Sylvain Bruneau.

“I’m not feeling anything out there. Every time I try to do the right thing, it never goes my way,” said Andreescu. “I’m getting so mad at myself. I’m, like, so irritated.”

Bruneau told her to mix it up more. He told her she wasn’t far away. After that consultation Andreescu got a second wind just as her opponent got tight.

“He obviously helped me, as he always does. I fought as hard as I could, and I’m really proud of myself with how I dealt with everything,” Andreescu said.

Begu served for the match at 5-2 in the second set, and squandered a match point. She served for it again at 5-4, gave Andreescu a couple of free points, and the Indian Wells champion found her wings again.

In the third set, the big question was whether or not Andreescu could just keep holding her own serve, after an early break.

It turns out she had enough in the tank, after 2 1/2 hours, to do even better than that.

She broke Begu’s serve a second time for safety, and closed it out.

As with Begu, Kenin is a repeat opponent for Andreescu in her breakout season.

The 20-year-old American defeated Andreescu in the semifinals of the WTA tournament in Acapulco, Mexico, the week before Indian Wells.

She was, in fact, the last player to defeat Andreescu, and one of only three players to accomplish that feat during a 2019 season in which Andreescu is now 29-3.

Also on Thursday afternoon, Andreescu’s fellow 18-year-old Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime advanced to the second round with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Norwegian qualifier Christian Ruud.

“I feel like since the beginning of the season, I’ve had some good starts to matches. Normally I start serving well. But not today,” Auger-Aliassime said. “The wind, the noise from the next court, both of us had trouble winning our serve at start. But I stayed calm, tried to find solutions, and I found my rhythm and my zones as the match went on.”

The Canadian Press reported this week ...","Canada’s federal government does not consider the Albertan oil industry a priority despite its central importance to the provincial economy, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said after Ottawa released its 2019 budget.

""They're recognizing that the investment levels are down, they're recognizing that prices are down and that unemployment is up, and yet they're not really taking any meaningful action to support our industry,"" the group’s vice-president of oilsands, Ben Brunnen, said as quoted by CBC.

""The reality is, when we see those indicators all facing down, from an oil and gas perspective, and no recognition from the government of a willingness to support our industry, it's a pretty strong message towards our industry that we're not a priority for this government, and that's disappointing,"" Brunnen added.

The budget includes funds for retraining initiatives that could help with Alberta’s high unemployment problem, but according to CAPP, this is not enough.

Alberta’s oil industry may not be a priority for Ottawa, but it certainly is a priority for everyone running in this year’s elections, scheduled for April 16. The Canadian Press reported this week that oil and gas investments and carbon tax were central topics on the campaign trail.

Incumbent Premier Rachel Notley has promised to increase local oil and gas processing capacity while her rival from the United Conservative party, Jason Kenney, focused on the carbon tax approved by the Notley government.

Notley’s plan aims to reduce the amount of crude oil Alberta exports, therefore reducing the need for transportation capacity including pipelines—nowhere in sight—and oil trains. It should bring in tens of billions of dollars in fresh investments.

Kenney, on the other hand, promised his first order of business would be to repeal the carbon tax that is “punishing” Albertans. This, he said, would save the province more than US$1billion (C$1.4 billion) every year “in one fell swoop.”

46,LifeStyle,2019-03-20T22:10:00.0000000Z,"Ms. Field said Canada can follow the example of its G7 counterpart of ... and policy wonks from the Liberals’ final, pre-election fiscal plan.","The Liberal government has proposed creating a national school meal program, which, if implemented, would see Canada join most other advanced economies in the world in having a countrywide school food initiative.

In yesterday’s federal budget, the government announced its “intention to work with provinces and territories towards the creation of a National School Food Program.” The one-sentence declaration was tucked into Liberals’ sprawling 464-page federal budget, the last of this government before Canadians head to the polls in October.

No money was earmarked in the budget for the proposed policy. It’s also uncertain whether a national program can be achieved given funding costs and potential provincial opposition to the federal Liberals’ idea.

Although there is a patchwork of existing local and provincial programs in the country providing funding for food for school children from junior kindergarten to Grade 12, Canada is the only G7 country and member of the 30-plus-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to lack a national school meal program, according to a 2016 report by two Simon Fraser University business professors.

The proposed school program in the budget was grouped with the unveiling of a $134-million national food policy designed to increase Canadians’ access to healthy foods, promote domestically grown and harvested food, support food security in the North, and reduce food waste.

Debbie Field, co-ordinator for the Coalition for Healthy School Food, called the proposal a “huge deal,” comparing it to other major social welfare programs.

“It’s a major social policy initiative,” she said. “Sometimes one line in a budget like this creates national pharmacare or other things like that. It really is at that level.”

Ms. Field said a national school meal program can help address children’s access to healthy and nutritious foods. In terms of this metric, Canada lags behind most other rich countries.

A 2017 UNICEF report ranked Canada 37th of 41 wealthy countries when it comes to food security, ending hunger, and improving nutrition. The report suggested a national school meal program could contribute to improvements in children’s healthy eating.

Poor nutrition, chronic diseases, and food insecurity are often problems for people living on lower incomes and those belonging to marginalized populations. Studies have also shown that healthy eating can correlate with improved educational outcomes.

“It’s a great first step and the coalition is looking forward to working with the federal government,” said Ms. Field.

Liberal MP Julie Dabrusin (Toronto-Danforth, Ont.) has pushed her government to put in place a school meals program, and is currently sponsoring a petition calling for the creation of an “adequately-funded national cost-shared universal healthy school food program.” Retired Liberal Senator Art Eggleton also put forward a similar motion calling for such an initiative in June 2018.

In a March 20 phone interview, Ms. Dabrusin said the proposed program will “look different in different places.”

“The idea is to work with different provinces and territories with the programs that they want to establish,” she said. “And when you think about it, what the different types of foods people might eat in parts of the country might be different, the needs might be different as to how to best deliver it.”

Ms. Dabrusin said there are many reasons why children may not decide to eat or have access to healthy and nutritious foods, but that it’s important the proposed program is universally available and doesn’t stigmatize poor students.

“There is a tremendous cost to having kids being hungry in school,” she said. “And I hear it from teachers who keep granola bars in their desk to feed kids, because they know that if the kids are hungry [they] can’t concentrate and participate in class.”

In a pre-budget submission to the House Finance Committee, Ms. Field’s organization asked for the Liberal government to invest $360-million, through provincial and territorial transfers, into a school food program, with an eventual goal of universal coverage.

Ms. Field said the total national cost of such a school meal program would be around $1.8-billion a year. That calculation is based on multiplying the number of Canadian children enrolled in schools—currently about five million—by the number of school days and an estimated price per meal of $2.

Oliver Anderson, a spokesperson for Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau (Compton-Stanstead, Que.), said “our government believes that all Canadians should have access to safe, healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate, and local food.” He said the food policy includes taking the “first steps” towards a national school meal program.

“We will have more to share on this in the weeks and months to come,” he said in an email.

The previous Conservative government under Stephen Harper, however, was cool to the idea of a national school meal program, with a Health Canada departmental spokesperson telling The Tyee in 2014: “The provision of food in schools is a provincial and territorial responsibility.”

In 1946, the United States created its national school meal program. In 2016, 30 million American children participated in the initiative providing free or low-priced meals at a cost of $13.6-billion for taxpayers, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures.

The program works by offering school districts and independent schools cash subsidies and government-bought food for each reimbursable meal they serve, which is required to meet federal standards.

The standards are a source of political contention, however, with the Trump administration loosening Obama-era requirements on grains, salt, and milk in 2017.

Ms. Field said Canada can follow the example of its G7 counterpart of France, or the example set by Finland, which she said have the best national programs in the world. She said their programs offer cooked, healthy, culturally appropriate, and often locally sourced foods.

Food insecurity is a challenge experienced at some level by four million Canadians, according to research done by PROOF, a University of Toronto-based research group studying policy choices to reduce the problem. It also found that household food insecurity affects one in six Canadian children.

Ms. Field described the current coverage of school food through provincial and locally funded school food programs as a “hodgepodge.”

“We all pride ourselves on our health-care system. We all pride ourselves on the fact that Canada has more progressive social policy than the U.S. on many issues,” Ms. Field said. “But we’re not doing well on this.”

To recap, the new First Time Home Buyer’s Incentive will offer first-time buyers an interest-free loan, in the form of a shared-equity mortgage, from the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation. The loan will be up to 10 per cent of the purchase price if you’re buying a new-build home, and up to five per cent if you’re buying resale. Only households earning under $120,000 a year are eligible, and the program is capped at four times the applicant’s annual household income, so it will only apply to homes where the mortgage value plus the CMHC loan is $480,000 or less.

article continues below

The Budget document gave an example of how it might work. It said, “For example, if a borrower purchases a new $400,000 home with a five per cent down payment and a 10 per cent CMHC shared equity mortgage ($40,000), the borrower’s total mortgage size would be reduced from $380,000 to $340,000, reducing the borrower’s monthly mortgage costs by as much as $228 per month.”

The CMHC loan will have to be repaid, of course. The Budget document did not say when, but the current widespread assumption is that it gets repaid upon the eventual sale of the home. The loan is interest-free, but it’s a shared-equity mortgage, which suggest CMHC would get back a proportional cut of any uplift in the home’s value, in addition to the original loan amount, although this has not been clarified.

This new program has been met with some surprise, and a mix of positive and negative reactions.

Surprise because it’s glaringly similar to the largely unsuccessful, now-defunct B.C. HOME down payment loan program, which was introduced by the B.C. Liberals when they were in power, and scrapped in 2018 by the B.C. NDP government. That program saw relatively little uptake, as many buyers seemed unenthusiastic about the province sharing a small slice of their home.

Positive reactions on the feds’ new measure have come largely from the real estate and development industry, which have lauded the attempt to not only aid first-time buyers in getting into homeownership, but also to balance any increased demand by encouraging the purchase of new homes, which should theoretically boost supply. This is a well-thought-through move on the part of the Liberals – whether it will work in practice remains to be seen.

Critics pan upper limit

Critics, however, have slammed the new incentive, for two key reasons. First and foremost, they say that the upper home price limit of $480,000 means that the program will have the least significant effect in the most expensive urban regions where it is most needed.

But does that mean that the price limit should have been increased – let’s say, to a more widely encompassing $700,000?

After all, nobody is criticizing the household income eligibility level of $120K a year – such a limit has to be set, and that seems fair. And an applicant-household earning less than $120K really shouldn’t be taking out a home-purchase loan of more than $480K. It would have been more irresponsible of the Liberals to encourage those households to make pricier home purchases than that. (The only people of that income group who should buy a pricier home should be those with a substantial additional down payment, who likely don't need this loan.)

The question then becomes whether a first-time buyer can get into an expensive real estate market like Metro Vancouver or Victoria for $480K. The kneejerk reaction has been something along the lines of, “You can’t buy a shoebox for that in Vancouver!”

Well, a quick search of current listings (March 21, 2019) shows there are just over 2,000 attached resale home listings in the Greater Vancouver and Fraser Valley board regions under $480K (admittedly only a handful of detached houses, but nobody starts in a detached house). Sure, that wide catchment includes inexpensive areas such as Mission, Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows. But there are 98 such listings in Vancouver alone, and hundreds in great starter-home areas like Surrey, Langley and New Westminster. In the Greater Victoria area, there are around 300 resale homes currently available for that price or less. Unfortunately there’s no single source of data on how many new presale homes are available for under that price, but they do exist, especially in places like Langley and Abbotsford, and around the capital region.

Cheap, but not free, money

The other criticism is that the federal government isn’t really offering anything – the buyers are simply borrowing from a cheaper source, as the loan is interest free. But with a federal budget that is not yet balanced, expecting the feds to hand out more than a billion dollars in permanently free money is highly unrealistic.

So will this new measure help people into homeownership, even in pricey cities? I think yes, some people, a bit.

For those who are motivated to buy, this is cheap – not free, but cheap – money that they’d be fools to turn down. The new policy is probably not significant enough to cause a rush of demand, and it may help boost new supply a little. So although it isn’t a cure-all for affordability (nothing is), we do have reason to hope it’ll help a good number of people get out into homeownership without making affordability worse.",Opinion: Will First Time Buyer Incentive really help people into homeownership?,Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/federal-election-2019/opinion-will-first-time-buyer-incentive-really-help-people-into-homeownership-1.23671027

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

In October 2018, Liberal MP, Patty Hajdu in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding announced she would be seeking re-election.

Political coalitions are notoriously fragile and the coalition that emerged in the wake of the last federal election in support of carbon pricing is no exception. The 2018 election of Doug Ford ...,"At the historic climate talks in Paris in 2015, countries agreed that large-scale transformation is required to avoid the worst effects of global temperature rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released last year added more urgency to this message — countries have little more than a decade to keep global warming below 1.5°C.

Carbon pricing is globally recognized as a vital tool to reduce carbon emissions. While Canada joins the ranks of countries like China, Argentina and South Africa in implementing some form of carbon pricing mechanism in 2019, Canada’s federalist system poses a unique set of challenges.

Last month the Ontario government released the details of its carbon pricing plan for big emitters, which looks quite similar to the federal emissions trading system the province adamantly opposes. This was the most recent development from a provincial coalition — made up of the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick — opposed to the federal carbon pricing plan.

While provincial governments have employed a range of strategies to oppose the federal plan, influential industry players like the Canadian Chamber of Commerce have openly supported the federal carbon pricing system. Canadians are now spectators to a surprising matchup, with the federal government and a growing number of industry players facing off against defecting provinces.

It is difficult to imagine a scenario where Canada can meet its Paris Agreement target of reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 without an ambitious and effective carbon pricing mechanism. So how can we make sense of these two seemingly contradictory developments — provincial opposition yet (conditional) industry support for carbon pricing — and how will they affect the future of Canada’s price on carbon?

The federal carbon pollution pricing system became law last summer. The plan consists of two ‘backstops’: a carbon levy and a trading system for large emitters. The carbon levy (also known as a fuel charge) will apply to fossil fuel producers or distributors, starting at $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (C02e). This comes into effect in April 2019 for Saskatchewan, Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick.

The second part of the federal plan — which came into effect on January 1 — is the trading system designed for large industrial emitters (those that emit 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year), known as the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS). In this system, the government sets an emissions threshold for each sector; companies that emit below their annual limit receive credits and those that exceed the limit must either buy credits from other companies or pay the tax (which also starts at $20 per tonne). The OBPS came into effect in January for industry in Ontario, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and partially in Saskatchewan.

A price on carbon is not a silver bullet for Canada’s emissions reductions, nor was it intended to be. Although Canada is slipping further behind on its Paris targets, the federal carbon pricing system will still significantly reduce emissions. Last fall the government estimated that — once the planned provincial and territorial systems take effect and the federal backstop is applied — the system could cut carbon pollution across Canada by 50 to 60 million tonnes in 2022. According to the latest federal projections, with the carbon pricing backstop and other proposed measures, Canada will fall short of its 2030 target by 79 millions tonnes. Without these measures the gap increases to 164 million tonnes.

Applying the federal backstop will be no easy feat. The Ontario and Saskatchewan governments have launched legal cases against the federal government. The first legal case against the federal plan is already underway in Saskatchewan, with Ontario and New Brunswick intervening in favour of Saskatchewan (and British Columbia intervening in favour of the federal government). If the newly elected premier of New Brunswick, Blaine Higgs, makes good on his promise, and if Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party wins the Alberta spring provincial election, they could also file court cases. While Manitoba has yet to take legal action, Premier Brian Pallister unexpectedly announced last October that the government would abandon a planned carbon tax. Together these politicians are forming a new alliance against carbon pricing. Despite some variations in their positions — like Kenney’s indication that he would support the price for heavy emitters but reject the fuel charge — they are rallying together and supporting each other’s legal cases.",Redrawing the battle lines in the fight over Canada’s price on carbon,opencanada.org,https://www.opencanada.org/features/redrawing-the-battle-lines-in-the-fight-over-canadas-price-on-carbon/

The Trudeau government is promising billions of dollars to compensate dairy, egg and poultry farmers hurt by Canada’s recent free-trade agreements — industries concentrated in vote-rich Quebec and Ontario.

The $3.65 billion the government is setting aside includes $2.15 billion to help farmers who lose income because of trade deals with Europe and countries on the Pacific Rim, both of which make it easier for foreign egg, dairy and poultry producers to enter the Canadian market.

That is in addition to a $250-million, five-year fund established in 2016 to compensate dairy farmers for the European Union deal.

The budget earmarks $1.5 billion for farmers who lose money when they sell their production rights in the supply-management system, which limits egg, poultry and dairy production in Canada. To gain the right to sell supply-managed products, farmers have to buy “quota,” often from existing producers who want to leave the industry.

The system also limits foreign products by slapping steep tariffs on imports beyond a certain level, which raises their price at the grocery store and makes them less attractive to consumers. Allowing more foreign-produced food into the Canadian market will increase competition for products from Canadian farmers.

“To ensure that Canada’s dairy, poultry and egg farmers can continue to provide Canadians with high-quality products in a world of freer trade, we will make available an income protection program for supply-managed farmers, along with a measure to protect the value of quota investments these farmers have already made,” Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in his prepared budget speech.

The budget does not provide details on how or when the money will be distributed to farmers and producers, who have long railed against any move that would expand foreign involvement in those sectors.

But the government appears to be hoping the promise of compensation will provide a salve to supply-managed farmers, many of whom are clumped in key ridings in Quebec and Ontario and angry that the deals have weakened their grip on the market.

That could prove important for the Liberals, who will likely need a strong showing in the two provinces in this year’s federal election to have a hope of retaining power.

The budget also indicates more money could be forthcoming as the government works with industry “to address the impacts on processing, as well as potential future impacts of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement.”

The North American deal, which will succeed NAFTA, has yet to be ratified and come into effect. That deal is the third free-trade agreement in which Canada agreed to open its supply-managed sectors, which emerged last year as a favourite target of U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly the dairy sector.

Supply management has long been hotly debated in Canada.

Proponents say the system keeps the market from getting saturated, which keeps prices stable and ensures steady incomes for farmers while protecting food safety, ensuring higher-quality products and eliminating the need for direct subsidies.

Critics say it drives up the cost of dairy, eggs and chicken for consumers, which has a disproportionate impact on low-income families. The system has been a frequent target in — and barrier to — past free-trade negotiations.

Successive federal governments for decades nonetheless resisted opening Canada to more tariff-free imports from other countries, in part because of the political implications.

But when Stephen Harper was prime minister, the Conservatives opened the door to change when they agreed to ease restrictions on European cheese imports through the Canada-European Union trade deal, which was signed and came into force under the Trudeau Liberals.

Ottawa then agreed, in the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, to give participants more access to Canada’s dairy, egg and poultry markets.

Advocacy

On March 19, the government of Canada tabled its 2019 federal budget, which included an additional $100 million in funding for international aid, and highlighted $600 million from previous announcements over the period of 2019 to 2024.

This funding is intended to help Canada deliver on commitments from 2018 in support of the objectives in its feminist international assistance policy — especially in regards to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls around the world.

In addition, the budget highlighted steps being taken to bring greater transparency and accountability to Canada’s foreign aid commitments.

This is a big year for Canada as the country gets set to host the Women Deliver 2019 Conference — the largest global gathering on the health, rights and wellbeing of women and girls — this June in Vancouver. And in the run-up, we need Global Citizens to take action to help us ensure the event leads to a lasting global impact.

Take Action: Call on Canada to Increase Funding for the Health and Rights of Women and Children

Nearly 5 million mothers and children die each year from preventable causes and 214 million women worldwide want to avoid pregnancy, but do not have access to modern contraception and family planning services.

Global Citizen’s #SheIsEqual campaign is working towards a world where all women are empowered and have the opportunity to build a better future for themselves, their families and their communities.

One of the campaign’s objectives is to secure a new commitment from the government of Canada in support of women's and children’s health, nutrition and rights around the world. That is why we’ve joined over 25 Canadian organizations to promote Thrive, a bold new agenda for the future of Canadian leadership in women's and children’s health.

With Canada’s global health funding set to run out this year, and its next federal election quickly approaching, now is the time for Canadian leaders to take the necessary steps forward to safeguard and advance crucial progress made in maternal and child health and nutrition, family planning, and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).

Thrive promotes the integration of these key pieces so that women and children can access the full range of interventions they need throughout their lives in order to reach their full potential. It also promotes long-term, sustainable investment over a 10-year period to provide the time and space needed to achieve real change.

With Thrive, Global Citizen is calling on Canada to renew its annual global health funding of $1 billion and add an additional $400 million per year to fill critical gaps, from 2020 to 2030. This includes $500 million per year to specifically address neglected areas of SRHR, such as access to modern contraception.

There are actually big risks in baking big programs into the budget before an election, as all the parties can use the increased fiscal room for their own platform priorities without affecting the deficit. Just ask the 2005 Martin government, whose pre-budget child care program was cancelled and rolled into the unhelpful Universal Child Care Benefit by the incoming Conservatives. My bet is that bigger promises will appear in the election platform.

On the macro front, Budget 2019 announces another surprise revenue boost (since the fall economic update) of $6 billion this fiscal year (ending in 12 days) and $5 billion for each of next two years. Combine that with the $3 billion “risk adjustment” that is just subtracted from revenues and you’ve got some serious money available without changing the deficit figures at all. There was so much extra money that the gas tax transfer to cities got a $2.2 billion kick in the pants with the cheque going out the door before March 31, a short-term boon for city infrastructure. But with a deficit of only 1% of GDP (roughly $20 billion a year), the debt-to-GDP ratio is actually falling: the government could have spent roughly $10 billion more this year (ahem, the cost of a universal pharmacare program) and kept that ratio constant.

Housing affordability is a big issue for many young Canadians who have been on the losing end of 10%-per-year house price increases. The challenge is to balance their interests with those of existing homeowners who are enjoying (and relying on) the appreciating value of their homes. For the past decade, that was achieved by letting new home buyers rack up historically high mortgage debt. That particular approach has largely run its course, so the government is introducing two new types of debt millennials can access to buy a house: their RRSP savings, and a new no-interest loan/equity stake (home mortgage) offered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMCH).

In the short term, these programs will make it easier for people to afford homes, although at the cost of owing CMHC and having to pay back into personal RRSPs. The trouble is that access to these new types of debt, even if they are interest free, will likely further drive up house prices until, say, next year around this time. The affordability benefit is wiped out and we’re back to where we started.

There is no shortcut to housing affordability. But the government should be meeting millennials where they are, which is the rental market. There is plenty of money in previous budgets for affordable housing focused on low income households. These are laudable and important efforts, however, they won’t necessarily have a big impact on middle class renters. That group needs purpose-built rental apartment buildings, in other words—not condos—to reduce high rental costs while they wait out housing prices. Measures on that front were much less a focus in this budget.

Workplace training is another important issue addressed in Budget 2019. Employers often bemoan the “skills mismatch” that they say results in their not being able to find the employees they need. This is supposed to be the workers’ fault, even though recent generations of Canadians are the most educated in the industrialized world (and have the student debt to show for it). Despite historically low unemployment, these workers have also not seen raises anywhere near where they should be. A new Canada Training Credit in the 2019 budget will provide workers with $250 a year from the feds (which workers have to match) to get the training employers want. (Incidentally, average university tuition went up $220 last year.) This is combined with a four additional weeks of EI leave so workers can get training at EI expense and get off the company payroll.

While employers are vocal about the skills mismatch, they are completely missing in action when it comes to funding on-the-job training. These initiatives let them off the hook. Canadian employers spend far less on training than employers elsewhere. Forcing workers with high student debt to spend even more on training is just not fair. The government could have nationalized the Quebec approach of requiring employers who don’t spend enough on training to pay into a training fund.

The Liberal government has been hyping pharmacare since the fall. The Hoskins commission that was struck to investigate the issue released its interim report just a few weeks ago. It made three recommendations, two of which are in this budget: the creation of a national drug agency, and the creation of a national formulary. The budget also included a co-ordinating body for catastrophic drug coverage, something most provinces offer.

It’s hard to tell what this will mean in practice, since the Hoskins commission’s full report isn’t expected until June and the government will not commit to a detailed plan until then. This budget therefore does not take a position on the big issue of whether pharmacare will mean a fill-the-gaps approach within existing coverage or a public, first payer system that targets drug costs. The budget highlights a possible $3 billion in savings through lower drug costs (a federal first payer system would save roughly $6 billion), which recognizes how we pay some of the highest per capita drug costs in the world. The CCPA will comment on the Hoskins recommendations when we see them.

There were some changes to seniors programs. CPP for seniors over 70 will now be auto-enrolled. The government knows your age and whether you’re eligible for CPP; there’s no excuse for not paying it out simply because a person failed to fill out some paperwork. Auto-enrollment is an obvious and important measure to make sure seniors receive the benefits they deserve. Call centres for old age benefits will also be beefed up to acknowledge that seniors are less likely to have a computer and go online.

Finally, there is a change in how much employment earnings one can make before Guaranteed Income Supplement money is clawed back. What’s interesting about this measure is that it doesn’t include CPP income, which is how the 2019 Alternative Federal Budget would structure it. If you’re getting GIS as a senior, you’re by definition in poverty, so the Budget 2019 measure supports working poor seniors as it exempts employment income. The reason why we targeted CPP income was it would give a break to low income seniors who aren’t working (or can’t work), not just those who can.

There are some interesting turns on the tax front in Budget 2019. For one, the much loathed (by progressives anyway) stock option deduction has been capped. This was suggested in the fall of 2017, but then apparently abandoned. Under the plan announced today, you can still get $200,000 worth of stock options run through the deduction, which seems an absurdly high cap for rich executives, but as one of the most unequal tax expenditures its closure is a step in the right direction. The trouble is, in the absence of other tax changes CEOs and other top executives will just shift how they are paid (to stock awards, for example), which is the danger of a one-off approach to tax expenditures instead of a comprehensive review.

The French-born Ephestion ""is grateful to finally call New Brunswick, Canada, home,"" says a news release from Jen Smith, his vice-president of communications.

Ephestion's citizenship is dependant on whether he passes the test, but Smith said she doesn't expect he'll have any problems with that or with his application to become a Liberal leadership candidate.

""We're very confident he's going to pass his test, and he will be a citizen on the 17th.""

Smith said Ephestion has resigned as director of Nazareth House, a shelter in Moncton, so he can devote his time to his leadership campaign.

The only other person who has expressed interest in succeeding former premier Brian Gallant as leader is Kevin Vickers, the former sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, who announced his candidacy for the leadership last week.

But the leadership race rules published by the Liberal Party on Feb. 7 require that candidates ""be eligible for election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in accordance with the Elections Act."" This means candidates must be citizens.

The deadline for candidates to submit their applications and nomination forms is March 29.

Ephestion could be disqualified from the Liberal leadership race because he is not yet a citizen. He has permanent resident status in Canada and applied for citizenship in September.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government’s chances of re-election in a vote scheduled for October this year. Polls have shown that Trudeau’s Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The prime minister told reporters that parliamentarian Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who has publicly backed Wilson-Raybould several times and earlier this month attacked Trudeau on Twitter, had left the Liberal parliamentary caucus.

“I want to thank her for her service to the Liberal Party and to her constituents and wish her the best,” Trudeau said in brief remarks.

Caesar-Chavannes, who represents a parliamentary constituency in the province of Ontario, had already announced she would not run again in this October’s federal election.

Although her departure has little immediate political effect - the Liberals still have a majority in the House of Commons - it underlines the staying power of an affair that has already cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy.

It is also awkward for a prime minister who came to power in late 2015 promising to boost the role of women in politics.

The office of Caesar-Chavannes was not immediately available for comment.

The legislator told the Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month that Trudeau had shouted at her after she called him to say she would not contest her seat in this year’s election.","In fresh blow to Canada PM Trudeau, lawmaker quits his caucus",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1R12KA-OCADN

Khan presented the platform at his campaign office in Calgary, alongside Indigenous Liberal candidates Michelle Robinson of the Dene nation (Calgary-East) and Jaro Giesbrecht of the Métis nation (Calgary-Peigan). Also present were elder Sally Black of the Siksika nation and former Alberta Liberal leader David Swann. Some of the party’s more ambitious policy promises included the addition of six Indigenous MLAs through a democratic election process, a reform of the provincial justice system, and the implementation of regional child protection offices. Khan called the child protection offices a “bold strategy” and said they would be run by Indigenous-led organizations. Implemented across Alberta in both rural and urban settings, he said the offices’ mandate would be to ensure Indigenous children stay connected to their culture and language.

He also promised Indigenous language immersion programs and curriculum revisions led by Indigenous peoples.

The justice reform would include the use of “Aboriginal-based sentencing principles,” said Khan, as well as an amendment of the Jury Act to “make juries more representative of Alberta society.” He also promised to end police carding, a practice that has been shown to disproportionately affect Black and Indigenous people. “The time for rhetoric is over. The time for reconciliation is now,” he said. “We must move beyond just apologies.” Some of the other policy points, such as providing training for public servants and improving school curriculums, echo NDP policies to which leader Rachel Notley is now pointing as proof of her party’s track record. However, Robinson said she thinks the Liberal version of those points will be much more effective than she believes the NDP government has been.

“Yes, we’ve had a new government that is doing much better than the previous government. That’s a really low bar,” she said. Robinson said she was compelled to run because she believes many of the NDP’s policies are not being felt in her community and beyond.

Philpott addressed the group at the beginning of the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled and was described by people in the room as ""rough"" and ""uncomfortable.""

Philpott — widely considered to be one of the most competent and respected ministers in the Trudeau government — resigned from the Liberal cabinet March 4, saying in a public statement that she had lost confidence in how the Trudeau government was handling the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Today's meeting of the Ontario regional caucus was the first since Philpott resigned. She did not attend today's meeting of the national Liberal caucus.

She remains a member of the caucus and has said she intends to seek re-election as the Liberal candidate in her Markham-Stouffville riding.

Today, some of her fellow Liberal MPs reminded her that others in the caucus had made compromises on sensitive issues such as medical assistance in dying — one of the key pieces of legislation Philpott fronted as health minister, along with then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking a Deferred Prosecution Agreement that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Wilson-Raybould also remains in the Liberal caucus and says she will run in the fall campaign under the party's banner.

Trudeau touts 'strong team'

As caucus tensions played out behind closed doors today, Trudeau insisted the Liberals are a ""strong team"" bound by a collective focus on growing the economy for the middle class, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and promoting gender equality.

""As the two members in question have indicated, they intend to run as Liberals in the next election,"" he said during an event in Orleans, Ont., where he was promoting the housing affordability measures in Tuesday's budget. ""We will continue to work together and make sure that we're delivering tangibly for Canadians the way we did with this most recent budget.""

In the statement announcing her resignation from cabinet, Philpott said that after ""serious reflection"" on the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks, she concluded she must quit.

""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations,"" she said.

""There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Earlier today, Celina Caesar-Chavannes quit the Liberal caucus, apologizing for harm she had caused through an interview with the Globe and Mail.

The Whitby, Ont. MP told the newspaper that when she first told Trudeau she did not plan to seek re-election, he became hostile towards her.

""He was yelling. He was yelling that I didn't appreciate him, that he'd given me so much,"" Caesar-Chavannes told the Globe.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, about the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which outlines what each country is obligated to do with asylum seekers arriving in each country.

Political Blind Date sets up two opposing politicians on a “date” to discuss some of the most divisive and pressing issues facing Canada. The topic of asylum seekers has become more prevalent with an increase in refugees crossing Canada’s southern border due to the hostile attitude toward immigrants percolating in the U.S. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, Chair of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee, thinks more resources should go to the processing of refugee claims. Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus, shadow minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, believes refugees shouldn’t be given more aid if they’re crossing illegally.

The two meet first for a coffee at Le Cafe in Hemmingford, Quebec. When Paul-Hus says that he might delve into French if English is insufficient for him to explain an idea, Oliphant mentions that his husband is from Rimouski. “When we’re arguing, he argues in French and I argue in English,” Oliphant says. He gestures across the table between him and Paul-Hus, and they both laugh. But will they end up arguing? Yes. Almost immediately. Oliphant takes issue with Paul-Hus describing asylum seekers’ border crossing as “illegal.” Using himself as an example, he explains that if he went into the U.S. and then came back to Canada at an “irregular border-crossing,” it would be illegal.

On the season two finale of Political Blind Date, Liberal MP Rob Oliphant and Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus debate the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement. ( TVO )

But, he said, “it is very clear in Canadian law and international law, that if you seek asylum on the other side, it’s not illegal.” To Paul-Hus, this is a “loophole” in the rules. He points out that the refugees are crossing from the U.S., and should have applied for refugee status there instead of Canada.

According to the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the country where they first arrive.

Until April 2018 he was Policy Chair for the Liberal Party of Canada.","British Columbia has long been known for producing world-class cannabis. In the wake of legalization, however, BC risks losing its foothold. The province is home to 14% of Canada’s population and over half of all medically-licensed producers populate the west coast.

Legalization has ushered in a new era of cultivation that is alienating the small producers who made Canadian cannabis famous in the first place.

“Craft cannabis is just getting started in the federal legal landscape but it’s behind,” said David Hurford, who worked for the federal Health Minister when Canada legalized cannabis and started regulating industrial hemp production and natural health products.

After years of working in policy for the government, Hurford became active within the Liberal Party of Canada as BC policy chair when the Party approved the legalization of cannabis in 2013. Until April 2018 he was Policy Chair for the Liberal Party of Canada.

More recently, Hurford is supporting the establishment of a BC Small Cannabis Producer and Processor Co-op with Grow Tech Labs and other stakeholder groups across BC.

“It’s very important that the small producers are brought in to the legal market,” said Hurford. “Many of them have been experts in their field, they are a significant asset to the industry and the country in terms of economic opportunity.”

Grow Tech Labs was founded in October 2018 as a Vancouver-based cannabis business accelerator that is backed by Victory Square Technologies. Hurford is one of GTL’s mentors, focusing on government relations.

“The Grow Tech mission is to accelerate the pace at which small producers and processors enter the legal marketplace,” said Grow Tech Labs CEO Barinder Rasode, in a press release.

There are thousands of small cannabis producers in BC who are designated by Health Canada to produce medical cannabis.

“BC has the most to gain by ensuring small producers and processors are active participants in Canada’s cannabis economy,” said Rasode. “BC co-op’s have demonstrated this business model can deliver economic prosperity for a broad range of citizens and establish a proven legal framework to govern collective decision-making in this rapidly evolving sector.”

BC has a vibrant co-operative movement, with 700 co-op businesses, two million members, and almost $50 billion in assets.

Hurford noted a number of benefits to joining a co-op.

“Pooling resources could mean getting a better price for their product; a group can negotiate a good price for them domestically and internationally as well. In British Columbia’s case, this is a major international product that we have here. People around the world want BC bud. When they think of BC cannabis, they are thinking about the small producer.”

“The other benefit is to share best practices, particularly around environmental stewardship of land,” said Hurford. “There is an opportunity to create a culture around diversity, equality, environmental sustainability, and regeneration.

“For us, it’s about BC maintaining that status and keeping small producers in the game is a key part of that.”

Hurford noted that despite BC’s robust pool of talent, transitioning to the legal market has not been made easy.

“Health Canada has not proactively engaged with small producers and given them a pathway to flip,” said Hurford, who hopes Health Canada will recognize these skilled cultivators as a resource.

“We’re having a supply shortage right now. We don’t have enough cannabis to serve the population. The black market is still thriving. I think especially with the supply shortage, many are quite disappointed that the federal government has not done more to reach these people and bring them into the process.”

One of the challenges is the zoning requirements. Municipal approval is another requirement under the new legalization regime.

“This is an area where the co-op can help. It can facilitate government relations with small producers.”

The co-op can also create a collective voice and help the ongoing process of refining regulations based on industry needs. For example, Hurford said almost everyone feels the current cap on growing space for micro cultivators is too restrictive and limits profitability.

“A co-op can help advocate to improve those regulations to make sure small producers are thriving,” said Hurford.

“The co-op is there to help make the case for transitioning to the legal market. This is a group of people that can be trusted, they want to comply with regulations. They are not all criminals or connected to organized crime. They are law-abiding, respectful people just trying to make an honest living for their family and contribute to their local economy.”

Grow Tech is sponsoring a series of regional meetings across the province in February and March. The goal is to invite feedback on services the co-op could provide members along with a proposed mission, goals and governance structure. The results of the consultation will guide a formal process to incorporate the co-op this spring under BC’s legislation.",Cannabis co-op wants BC Bud at the forefront of Canada’s new industry,Daily Hive,https://dailyhive.com/grow/cannabis-co-op-canada-emerging-industry-2019

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed the news to reporters Wednesday on his way into question period and thanked Caesar-Chavannes for the work she has done for the party.

Caesar-Chavannes, first elected in 2015 to represent the riding of Whitby, announced earlier this month that she would not run for re-election this fall.

She later told The Globe and Mail that Trudeau yelled at her in February after she told him that she would not re-offer in the election. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office denied Trudeau yelled at the MP but said they had ""emotional"" conversations about the matter.

Caesar-Chavannes said in a tweet Wednesday that her Globe interview had ""unintended effects"" on people that she cares about.

""I think that it's important to understand that while I support the values and the principles of the Liberal party, that it might be good, since that message did go out, that I sit as an Independent for the rest of the term that I'm here.""

Caesar-Chavannes made headlines in February when she jumped to the defence of Jody Wilson-Raybould over the SNC-Lavalin affair. The MP tweeted that Wilson-Raybould was ""fierce, smart, and unapologetic"" after unnamed Liberal insiders made unflattering comments about the former attorney general in the media.

""When women speak up and out, they are always going to be labelled. Go ahead. Label away. We are not going anywhere,"" she said at the time.

When Jane Philpott stepped down as Treasury Board president weeks ago, saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau has handled the controversy, Caesar-Chavannes threw her support behind the departing minister.

""When you add women, please do not expect the status quo,"" she tweeted. ""Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised.""

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott remain members of the Liberal caucus and plan to run again under the party banner.

When she announced that she would not seek re-election, Caesar-Chavannes said the decision was not related to the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

I had the opportunity to work with some fantastic colleagues, debate policy, put forward ideas and shape tremendous pieces of legislation that will have a real and positive impact on families across the country,"" Caesar-Chavannes wrote in a statement at the time.

""It is an honour I never took for granted, and will not soon forget. That is why this announcement is a tremendously difficult one for me to make.""

The MP previously served as a parliamentary secretary to both the prime minister and international development minister.

Vocal on mental health, race issues

In 2016, Caesar-Chavannes revealed that she struggles with depression.

""Owning my depression is my therapy. Talking about it, in my opinion, gives others permission to talk about mental health as well,"" she wrote in a blog for HuffPost Canada.

As one of the few black MPs in the House, Caesar-Chavannes has also been vocal on issues of race, including ""microaggressions"" she has faced on Parliament Hill.

In 2017, the MP wore ""dope"" braids to deliver a speech in the Commons denouncing body shaming. In remarks that went viral, Caesar-Chavannes said she was speaking out for ""young girls and women who look like me"" and those who do not.

Watch:

""I want them to know that their braids, their dreads, their super-curly afro puffs, their weaves, their hijabs, and their headscarves, and all other variety of hairstyles, belong in schools, in the workplace, in the boardroom and yes, even here on Parliament Hill,"" she said.

Caesar-Chavannes clashed with former Tory MP Maxime Bernier, now leader of the People's Party of Canada, on social media last year. They had heated exchanges after Bernier criticized the Liberal government's decision to fund programs designed for Canadians with minority backgrounds.

Caesar-Chavannes apologized after telling Bernier to ""check your privilege and be quiet.""

Months later, Bernier accused Caesar-Chavannes on Twitter of thinking ""the world revolves around (her) skin colour.""

She fired back by saying that, unlike Bernier, she can focus on matters of public policy ""while also shifting the status quo and increasing awareness.""

James Cullingham is a documentary ...,"By James Cullingham

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes has informed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that she's leaving the federal Liberal caucus and will sit as an independent MP.

The Whitby, Ont., MP has been a vocal supporter of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, two cabinet ministers who resigned over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an interview with the Globe and Mail last week, she also accused Trudeau of yelling at her angrily when she informed him that she would not be seeking re-election this fall — an accusation the Prime Minister's Office has denied.

In a tweet Wednesday, Caesar-Chavannes said that interview ""has had unintended effects on those I care about. Although that was not the intention, it was the consequence, and I am sorry. I no longer want to distract from the great work my caucus colleagues are doing. Love and hugs, C.""

But Conservatives pounced on the defection, arguing that Caesar-Chavannes's exit, added to the departures of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from cabinet, prove that Trudeau is a ""fake feminist.""

Conservative House leader Candice Bergen said the ""good old boys"" in the Prime Minister's Office wanted Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and when she refused, ""she was promptly fired and silenced.""

""The prime minister is really good at yelling and screaming at women, as the member from Whitby knows, and he's also a very good actor. But, Mr. Speaker, he's a fake feminist,"" Bergen told the House of Commons.

Trudeau said he'll take no lessons on feminism from Conservatives who ""still want to challenge a woman's right to choose"" to have an abortion.

Caesar-Chavannes, first elected in 2015, has been a relatively high-profile backbencher, primarily as an advocate for the rights of black Canadians. She's gotten into several Twitter wars with Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party of Canada, who once accused her of thinking ""the world revolves around your skin colour."" On another occasion, she apologized to Bernier after telling him to ""check your privilege and be quiet"" when he questioned funding for minority groups.

She also made news in 2016 when she openly talked about her battle with depression.

At the time, Caesar-Chavannes, who was initially named parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, praised Trudeau's understanding of mental illness but she has since soured on his leadership.

Throughout the SNC-Lavalin saga, she has used social media to send messages of solidarity — accompanied by a clenched-fist emoji — to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

In January, she used a speech at Parliament's annual dinner tribute to Scottish poet Robbie Burns to take a swipe at Trudeau for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a small cabinet shuffle earlier that month, to be replaced by Montreal MP David Lametti. Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet a few weeks later, although both she and Philpott, who resigned subsequently from cabinet, remain members of the Liberal caucus.",Liberal MP quits caucus,Castanet,https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/252012/Liberal-MP-quits-caucus

By David Ljunggren and Fergal Smith

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained under pressure over a corruption scandal on Wednesday as a legislator quit his party's caucus and a pre-election budget aimed at swaying key voters appeared to offer too little to stem the tide of negative news.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also provided a little for key groups such as millennial voters who backed Trudeau in droves in Canada's 2015 election.

The decision by a legislator, who had defended a former minister at the center of a political scandal, to quit the ruling Liberal Party and sit as an independent dealt a fresh blow to Trudeau's embattled government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on the then justice minister to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government's chances of re-election. Polls have shown that Trudeau's Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The latest defection overshadowed Tuesday's budget which divided money between a large number of new initiatives and left few Canadians satisfied.

""It's just too broad,"" said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation. ""They wanted to please lots of people and ... when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody, because you spread it too thin.""

Rob Edel, chief investment officer at Nicola Wealth Management, noted the government did not commit to reducing a budget deficit that is much larger than the Liberals promised. This was ""a political rather than an economic decision,"" he said.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada as well as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce complained about the lack of tax reform. But the center-left Liberals may not care too much as their core supporters are progressive thinkers, women and younger voters. Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed budget measures to help first-time home buyers, including allowing people to withdraw up to C$35,000 from a retirement savings account.

But asked on Wednesday how many younger first-time buyers actually had that much money available, he replied ""that will help some people in the middle income range ... not everyone, for sure.""

The main opposition Conservative Party has relentlessly attacked Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin affair and described the budget as a bribe. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has continuously demanded Trudeau's resignation, which some Conservatives privately worry is the wrong approach.

Two strategists with deep ties to the party said given the complexity of the affair, and former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould's statement that no one involved had broken any laws, Canadians would not necessarily agree that Trudeau should quit now.

Conservative over-confidence or missteps could be the Liberals' best hope for reversing their slumping poll numbers, pollster Nick Nanos said.

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers delayed Morneau's budget presentation for an hour.

Conservatives initially drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers and then walked out en masse, a tactic that did not sit well with some Canadians on social media.

People's Party of Canada ...","OTTAWA — With a federal election looming this fall, the Liberals and Conservatives are bracing for an ideological battle that pits the merits of balancing the books against spending on consumer confidence — and many Canadians may actually agree with both of them, a new poll suggests.

The Leger poll was conducted for The Canadian Press this week shortly after the government released its latest federal budget, which promises billions in new spending on measures like job retraining, services for seniors and incentives for first-time homebuyers.

article continues below

The budget also leaves government coffers with average annual deficit of around $18 billion over the last four years — a far cry from the modest deficits and balanced 2019 books that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during the 2015 election campaign.

The Liberals argue the spending is necessary to make a real difference in the lives of Canadians, while Conservatives accuse the government of wasting money and saddling future generations with unnecessary debt.

Both messages, however, resonated with Canadians, the Leger poll suggests: while a substantial percentage of respondents agreed the Liberal deficits were bad, many also expressed support for the centrepiece spending measures featured in Tuesday's spending blueprint.

Some 44 per cent of respondents said they believed the decision to run four years of deficits was the wrong call, while 20 per cent called it the right move and 35 per cent were not sure.

A large majority also voiced support for some big-ticket items in Tuesday's budget, including a plan to expand high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas of Canada, which garnered the support of 76 per cent of respondents, and a suite of measures to help workers to learn new job skills, which got a thumbs-up from three quarters of those polled.

Measures in the budget designed to make it easier for more Canadian families to buy their first home got a 68 per cent approval rating, while 55 per cent cheered proposed financial incentives to foster electric-vehicle sales.

As for the budget itself, 12 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied, while 19 per cent felt the opposite. The remainder of respondents either said they didn't know, or remained neutral — an amorphous body of swing votes the parties will no doubt be courting as the election clock ticks down to October.

""If you're the Liberals, the clear story is to say: 'Well, we needed to go into deficit to help the economy and do all of these great things that you agree with,'"" said Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.

""The story for the Conservatives is to say: 'It's not right. We can't do this, period.' So I believe we'll hear a lot about not necessarily the budget, but about public finances more generally in the weeks to come. And I think that will be a ballot-box question.""

Leger's internet-based survey, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples, was conducted March 19 and 20 using computer-assisted web-interviewing technology.

It heard from 1,513 Canadians who are eligible to vote and were recruited from the firm's online panel. The results were weighted to reflect age, gender, mother tongue, region and level of education to reflect the makeup of Canada's population.

The poll also suggested the Liberals have been bleeding support over the past month as the government struggled to contain the damage caused by the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair.

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled said they would vote for the Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of three percentage points from February and a total loss of eight percentage points since November.

Yet while 37 per cent said they would back the Conservatives — a one-point bump from February and four-point increase since November — Bourque said most of the gain has come from voters in the West and may not translate into a big gain of seats in Parliament.

The NDP and Greens, meanwhile, saw their support increase by two points from February to 14 and 10 per cent, respectively, which Bourque said could represent trouble for the Liberals.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer also jumped ahead of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister, earning the support of 25 per cent of respondents, compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who made his debut in the House of Commons this week, stood at eight per cent while Green party Leader Elizabeth May was supported by seven per cent of respondents. People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier came in at four per cent.

The results are surprising, said Bourque: none of the leaders are as popular as their parties, which suggests that while the shine may have come off Trudeau, that popularity has yet to migrate to anyone else.

""It's as if right now there is a bit of a void in terms of leadership,"" Bourque said.

""There's not one clear person who's driving support like Jack Layton did in 2011, like Justin Trudeau did in 2015 … who is kind of pulling support up for their political party.""

“Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.”

Given the Liberals on the justice committee released those words about their ‘investigation’ into the five-alarm fire that is the SNC-Lavalin scandal on the very day that Michael Wernick was claimed as another of its victims—based largely on his serial immolation in front of their committee—we’re going to need a new word for “chutzpah”.

Justin Trudeau has now lost his top aide, two of his top ministers, and the country’s top bureaucrat because of SNC, and the Liberals are asking us to “arrive at a conclusion”?

What conclusion do they think anyone can draw from trying to shut down inquiries into this clusterf–k, other than ‘these people definitely have something to hide’?

It’s breathtaking.

So bravo, Liberal Party of Canada; congratulations on achieving in three years a level of cynicism and contempt for the electorate most governments only reach at the tail end of their third mandate. It’s about the only thing the Liberals have managed to deliver that’s under-budget and ahead of schedule.

Principled Liberals must look back at 2015 like it was some kind of fever dream. Trudeau’s Liberals were going to be pro-women, transparent, non-partisan, evidence-based, for the middle class, and free from the all-controlling grip of the PMO. Now it’s 2019 and they’re gleefully trading women, transparency and evidence in favour of special interests, all at the direction of an ultra-partisan PMO.

And before the ‘two wrongs make a right’ brigade pops up to spew their whataboutery: the Liberals were supposed to be better than the gang they replaced, not the same or worse.

Even worse, in this case the Liberals deployed their deep bag of dirty tricks in the service of a company that has done things like bribe hospital managers and foreign governments to get their custom.

Had this firm been headquartered in a place like Calgary, or in an industry Justin Trudeau doesn’t give a toss about—like oil and gas—would the government have let it face the music? This is about politics, not jobs. Full stop.

Indeed, the gang who were all for evidence-based policy a few years back took SNC’s wild claims of catastrophic job loss at more or less face value. The government certainly didn’t press the company hard, if at all. Even Gerry Butts, Trudeau’s High Priest of Facts, could only mumble something about Finance having the figures when asked. Had they bothered to look, Liberals would have found a long-term investment in SNC from the Caisse de dépôt and the resulting commitment to keep SNC HQ in Montreal for years on end. No, SNC said ‘jump’ and Trudeau went through the roof.

And when the whole sordid tale finally came to light in the Feb. 7 edition of The Globe and Mail the Liberals went full Nixon instead of full transparency. Instead of treating the issue of the independence of the criminal justice system seriously the Liberals have tried to downplay it or—worse—treat it as a difference of opinion, a position that is both morally and ethically bankrupt.

From calling the story false to slandering Wilson-Raybould off-the-record, to muzzling her, to circumscribing her ability to speak, to now shutting down the entire committee investigation, the Liberals have resisted transparency at every turn. And if you believe the Ethics Commissioner is going to get to the bottom of this, then you, my friend, qualify for membership in the Trudeau Chapter of the Useful Idiots Club.

Instead of simply believing Wilson-Raybould—or Jane Philpott, for that matter—the Prime Minister has brushed them off as having either poor memories or poor comprehension skills. They simply experienced the inappropriate pressure differently, Trudeau explained, a line he first trotted out last summer to mansplain away an old groping allegation, a route out he had denied to others in his caucus facing similar allegations.

Because Trudeau just doesn’t live by normal standards or rules. He doesn’t pal around with the middle class and those hoping to join them. He hangs out with the jet set, the people who can afford cash for access, with the Aga Khan on his island and the tech titans who are polarizing our societies. These are his people. Of course he listened when SNC came calling.

And as the vice began to grip, Trudeau’s instinct was to politicize the public service in his defense, trotting out Wernick to run interference by caterwauling about the threat of violence on our streets. It was the same trick Trudeau pulled with Daniel Jean during the India trip when a convicted Sikh terrorist was spotted in his entourage. And you thought Stephen Harper was toxic for the non-partisan public service?

What’s worse, nothing will now change Trudeau’s mind on SNC. The company will get its deal, no matter what the federal courts or OECD say. On SNC, the Liberals have become the practitioners of the democratic failure they so harshly condemned in 2015.

A burning question for observers of the SNC-Lavalin affair is whether former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, who publicly opposed actions of their government, will be cut loose from the Liberal caucus. While some, including former deputy prime minister Sheila Copps, urge retribution, others in the party admire these MPs and want them to stay on. Whatever the pair’s political future, my research around party discipline suggests they can expect some rough treatment and career drudgery in the Liberal caucus.

Over the past year, I have had the privilege of interviewing 125 current and former politicians and political staff for a book I am writing about how party discipline has intensified in Canada in recent years. A common theme raised by current and former members of cabinet, party leaders, party whips, private members and political staff is that everyone affiliated with a political party identifies as a member of a team. They form bonds as they go on a journey together to realize common goals. Sparring with adversaries occurs with the confidence that teammates have your back. Members understand they must never be a public distraction for the team leader.

Here are snippets of what some current MPs told me in the months before the SNC-Lavalin story:

In a government caucus, there are those in cabinet, and there are those working hard to join it. Backbenchers know that when they go astray of a certain whipped vote, it doesn’t help their ambitions. We keep saying this is a team sport, but the House of Commons was not set up to be a team sport. — Liberal MP

To rise above the party positions and the leadership’s positions that got you elected is a form of narcissistic conceit. For you to go out against the party line on something, guess what? People aren’t going to vote for you because you’re bucking the party line. It might be once in four years that you can take a different position. — Conservative MP

When I got elected, I naively expected that caucus was the place where MPs could have a free and frank discussion of issues of the day. The biggest single disappointment upon becoming an MP was finding that caucus meetings were structured to begin with the head table sort of providing us with our marching orders. — New Democratic Party MP

Within a political team, there is considerable deference to authority, and individual behaviour conforms to social and institutional norms. Many backbenchers — that is, members who are not part of cabinet — find national caucus meetings to be stifling rather than enlightening. The leadership says they should come to the microphone to share opinions, but there is so much fear that people bottle things up. They loathe the watchful eyes of powerful staff in the leader’s office and who appear to lack respect for the elected.

Some parliamentarians get annoyed that the party leadership, through the whip, seeks to influence behaviour by deciding on their assignments to particular committees, vetting their requests to be away from Ottawa, authorizing participation on parliamentary junkets and generally controlling who gets to speak in the House. A backbencher has shockingly little policy influence. Staying silent in caucus meetings, staying away from a vote in the House, offering no public comment and declining to share social media posts are the most common ways for them to publicly express dissent — except that in a political team a backbencher’s silence is equated with support.

Backbenchers are unfairly derided by pundits as trained seals who mindlessly follow their masters’ orders. In reality, they are interesting people who get involved in party politics hoping to make a difference. But too often independent thinking does give way to a team mentality. The transformation begins the moment they sign a “values contract” when they want to be nominated as party candidates. The contract is signed during the candidate vetting process to screen out people who might attract negative attention during a campaign and those unwilling to commit to the party’s core values, such as the principles articulated in the party constitution. The team ethos is reinforced through a daily barrage of digital messages, including hashtags that emphasize the team leader (such as #TeamTrudeau).

Fantastic turnout at our #ScarbTO North Federal Liberal AGM – looking forward to working closely with the newly elected executive, enthusiastic team of dedicated @liberal_party members, supporters & volunteers as we seek re-election in 2019! #TeamTrudeau pic.twitter.com/bZ1Mj82zI9 — Shaun Chen (@Shaun_Chen) March 17, 2019

Most government backbenchers settle into a morale-zapping role of repeating approved messages, of jostling for the opportunity to speak in the House, of lobbying ministerial staff and of a public image as government cheerleaders. Those who want to be promoted cooperate with the leadership. Others focus on helping constituents with casework. Team players know not to stray too far from the party line in public.

It appears that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are less inclined to obey the normal rules of conduct for members of a governing party’s caucus. The corresponding erosion of trust between them and their Liberal colleagues, especially those holding positions of power, will likely cause them to be marginalized.

The worst part of being on the outs with the leadership is not the lost perks or privileges. In my interviews, current and former politicians informed me that the truly horrible bit is how political teammates treat nonconformists. Many members of a political team who praise ministers feel a duty to shun outcasts. Hardcore partisans and leader loyalists will be furious and/or deeply disappointed. Some will keep a distance so as not to jeopardize their own prospects of promotion. It can be difficult to distinguish them from those who find the whole matter too awkward to deal with.

The stories that some politicians across Canada shared with me about the downsides of team discipline are disconcerting. Social shunning can be very painful for those on the receiving end: a lack of eye contact, avoided conversation, people sitting on another side of the room, not being invited to come along for lunch or a drink, and so forth. Outside of caucus meetings, people in positions of power communicate their seething displeasure by ignoring phone calls and being slow to respond to messages. Fortunately, some parliamentarians who disagree with a renegade’s actions will nevertheless go out of their way to be kind, which is a pleasant contrast to those who hide behind a mask of fake smiles. But for the most part, being socially ostracized within a political team is the hardest part of going rogue — and the hurt is largely internalized because the timeworn principle of caucus confidentiality means the poor treatment cannot be publicly discussed.

Occasionally, independent thinkers bristle at the confines of party affiliation. Usually mavericks are lone wolves who gradually became isolated from the team. Months of fruitless internal agitation and social pinpricks erupt in a public outburst that marks the end of the parliamentarian’s time with the party. Those who can’t stomach the public worship of their party leader and the party line have a few options available to them: they can wait until someone else takes the helm; they can wreak havoc internally through various forms of civil disobedience and destabilizing the leader’s authority; they can sit as independents; cross the floor to another party; or relinquish their seat. On occasion a cluster of dissidents leave together to form their own parliamentary group to express a leadership breakdown, such as the Democratic Representative Caucus that split from the Canadian Alliance in 2001 or Québec Debout, which splintered off from the Bloc Québécois in 2018.

Much ink has been spilled in recent years about power imbalances in politics. In January 2018, Minister Patty Hajdu said in the House of Commons that “Parliament Hill features distinct power imbalances…It is a place where often the victimized individual is blamed for the harassment that she herself has experienced.” Still, very little is known about mobbing behaviours toward backbenchers within parliamentary caucuses. Understanding these dynamics is important, because a strong, healthy democracy requires that a diversity of points of view can be safely expressed.

The power imbalances in a governing party’s caucus are stark, given that a prime minister controls upward mobility. It is especially disconcerting when backbenchers affiliated with a governing party are portrayed as troublemakers when they question those in positions of authority. Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers in a majority government do not hold the cabinet and senior political staff to account.

Encouraging backbenchers to repeat government messages and to refer to “our government” fosters a mistaken identity. Backbenchers need reminding that they are not the government. Probing, pestering, seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be regularly doing in a respectful manner. The stars of any political team need to accept that they will be held to account, and they should offer meaningful opportunities for this to happen. They should offer clarity about what would go too far.

Political leaders say that caucus is the place to voice concerns, but in reality caucus is a structure that rewards conformity and frowns on disruption. Ministerial caucus advisory committees used in the Ralph Klein government in Alberta and adopted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper are noteworthy mechanisms that require ministers to engage in meaningful consultation with the caucus. But ensuring that caucus is a safe space for colleagues who challenge authority is another matter.

It would take someone with a strong backbone to advocate for minimum standards for how all members of a caucus should be treated, particularly ways to protect those involved in a reasonable disagreement with the team leader. Perhaps certain Liberal MPs — if they are not ousted from caucus — will explore culture change from within.

Kinsella is a veteran of Liberal election war rooms that supported the campaigns of Dalton McGuinty in Ontario and ...,"Within a day of the official launch of the 2019 Alberta election, the Alberta NDP had already dropped a nasty negative ad.

The ad attacked United Conservative Party (UCP) leader Jason Kenney for comments he made 20 years ago about a campaign he was involved in 30 years ago, in which he challenged the idea that same-sex couples ought to have the rights as couple of the opposite sex.

The ad begins with Kenny clearly boasting about his part in helping to overturn “the first gay spousal law in North America.” (The issue involved a law in San Francisco.)

Then there’s a swell of the kind of ominous tones you hear in any negative ad as a female voice intones that “Kenney stopped dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex spouses in hospital.”

And then, the voice actor does what she gets paid to do: Feign a tone of horrified incredulity as she asks: “Is this a premier?”

As attack ads go, it’s a pretty good punch.

“In order for a so-called negative ad to work, it has to have a centre of truth. It has have an essential truth,” said Warren Kinsella, the author, political commentator, and president of the Toronto-based consultancy The Daisy Group.

Kinsella is a veteran of Liberal election war rooms that supported the campaigns of Dalton McGuinty in Ontario and Jean Chretien at the federal level.

That “essential truth”, in this case, is that Kenney is mean or at least can be mean to his opponents. The cheeky smile that appears on Kenney’s face in that NDP ad after he boasts about defeating a same-sex law is the “killer” part of that ad where that “essential truth” is revealed. Kinsella said he expects the ad to take some of the starch out of the UCP numbers.

But then the NDP, whether provincially or federally, has developed a reputation over the last couple of decades as a party that is definitely not afraid of throwing a punch — and the harder they can hit, the better.

“It’s true. That’s their reputation. They’re good at it,” said Kinsella.

In the 2008 federal election, the NDP whipped up one of the all-time nasty attack ads. It was in French for Quebec voters, aimed at Stephen Harper’s Conservatives.

Among other things, the ad warned that a vote for the Conservatives was a vote for war — as battalions of animated soldiers came marching towards the viewers while images of Harper and George W. Bush floated at the top of the screen.

WATCH: The 2008 NDP election ad attacking the Conservatives

“It was one of the harshest ads to be run in Canadian political history,” said Dennis Matthews, a vice-president at the Toronto-based public affairs firm Enterprise Canada.

Matthews is a veteran of Harper-era campaign war rooms and helped design and write some of the advertising and marketing material that powered some of Harper’s successful election campaigns. He was in the Conservative war room in 2008 when that NDP ad dropped.

“It was over the top, but it really hammered the Conservative vote in Quebec,” Matthews said.

When asked what they don’t like about politics, voters and even politicians themselves often say they don’t like all the negativity, particularly at election time when there’s a plethora of attack ads often from all parties.

But here’s the thing: When it comes to the chance to hold on to or seize power, political parties like the Alberta NDP and many others go negative because going negative works.

“People pay more attention to those ads,” Kinsella said.

“And negative ads do bring down the support of your opponent,” Matthews said.

WATCH: Kenney says NDP attacks on him are “desperate”

Negative ads are not designed to turn a supporter from one party to a supporter of another party. Instead, they are all about damaging an opponent’s ability to recruit volunteers, fundraise and, most of all, to suppress an opponent’s voter turnout.

The most important thing political parties do leading up to and during a campaign is identify their supporters and then get those supporters to the polls. A strong negative attack ad could, in the case at hand, get potential UCP supporters doubting their commitment to voting.

No one expects a UCP supporter to turn into an NDP supporter. But, there are UCP supporters who may have wished that Brian Jean beat Kenney for the UCP leadership 18 months ago and a good negative campaign against Kenney could get that kind of supporter to stay at home on polling day.

Negative ads are also intended to sap morale of the opposing campaign.

The Alberta NDP has been running an online campaign attacking Kenney for weeks now, mostly through a website, trying to help accomplish all of these objectives.

Kenney has vowed that his party’s political messaging will be positive and will avoid personal attacks. In that way, it’s a vow very similar to the one Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made for the upcoming 2019 federal election.

It is time for change. Positive change that creates good jobs, brings common sense to government, and builds an Alberta that's strong and free. #ableg #abstrongandfree pic.twitter.com/AK09sL7Tci — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) March 19, 2019

But it’s a vow that’s easy to keep when you are, as Kenney is, ahead in the polls by a long shot. It gets a little tougher when the numbers for you and your party start to fall.

“When the numbers start to change, watch out, here’s comes Willie Horton,” Kinsella said, referring to one of the most devastating and infamous attack ads ever, released by supporters of George H.W. Bush attacking challenger Michael Dukakis for being soft on crime.

The ad blamed Dukakis, a state governor, for allowing Horton, a convicted killer serving a life sentence, to get a weekend furlough and then commit rape, assault and armed robbery. The ad was condemned as racist, but it had a devastating effect on Dukakis, who was soundly defeated by Bush.

But negative ads or negative political messaging can also have serious backlash effects.

Federal Liberals were widely ridiculed, for example, when they tried to scare voters in the 2006 federal election campaign with an ad warning about how, if Harper won, we would see an increase in “military presence in our cities. Canadian cities. Soldiers with guns.”

This ad, part of a series of “scary Harper” ads, started off with some scary drumbeats, followed by a grainy black-and-white image of Harper.

But federal Liberals benefited from an attack gone wrong back in 1993 when the Progressive Conservatives ran an ad that some — including some conservatives — saw as mocking Jean Chrétien for his crooked way of speaking, a result of Bell’s palsy Chretien had as a child.

This attack ad, mild by today’s standards, was widely credited for helping to turn the tide against Kim Campbell and in favour of Chretien.

Perhaps one of the most entertaining attacks ads came in the 2015 election when the NDP candidate in the Toronto riding of St. Paul’s, author Noah Richler, decided to put together a video attacking Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. Richler would lose to Liberal Carolyn Bennett and would later chronicle the creation of that ad in his book The Candidate: Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.

But it was an ad that gave the the NDP war room trying to support the national campaign of Thomas Mulcair fits even if it delighted political pundits.

Many of the New Democrats in Mulcair’s war room in 2015 ended up in Alberta, after Notley won power, and are still there. That’s because in Canadian political circles, each major party borrows heavily from and builds on earlier campaigns at all levels.

Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats all tend to draw from the same group of pollsters, advisors, operatives and war room generals which means that tactics and strategy you might see from one party in a federal election years ago be put to use in a provincial election the same party is contesting now.","ANALYSIS: In Alberta and elsewhere, New Democrats have mastered the art of the negative election ad",Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5081715/new-democrats-negative-campaign-ads/

The Whitby, Ont., MP has been a vocal supporter of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, two cabinet ministers who resigned over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

She also accused Trudeau earlier this month of yelling at her angrily when she informed him that she would not be seeking re-election this fall — an accusation the Prime Minister’s Office has denied.

Conservatives pounced on Caesar-Chavannes’s defection Wednesday, arguing that her departure, added to the departures of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from cabinet, prove that Trudeau is a “fake feminist.”

Conservative House leader Candice Bergen said the “good old boys” in the Prime Minister’s Office wanted Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and when she refused, “she was promptly fired and silenced.”

“The prime minister is really good at yelling and screaming at women, as the member from Whitby knows, and he’s also a very good actor. But, Mr. Speaker, he’s a fake feminist,” Bergen told the House of Commons.

Trudeau said he’ll take no lessons on feminism from Conservatives who “still want to challenge a woman’s right to choose” to have an abortion.

Caesar-Chavannes, first elected in 2015, has been a relatively high-profile backbencher, primarily as an advocate for the rights of black Canadians. She’s gotten into several Twitter wars with Maxime Bernier, leader of the People’s Party of Canada, who once accused her of thinking “the world revolves around your skin colour.” On another occasion, she apologized to Bernier after telling him to “check your privilege and be quiet” when he questioned funding for minority groups.

She also made news in 2016 when she openly talked about her battle with depression.

At the time, Caesar-Chavannes, who was initially named parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, praised Trudeau’s understanding of mental illness but she has since soured on his leadership.

Throughout the SNC-Lavalin saga, she has used social media to send messages of solidarity — accompanied by a clenched-fist emoji — to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

In January, she used a speech at Parliament’s annual dinner tribute to Scottish poet Robbie Burns to take a swipe at Trudeau for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a small cabinet shuffle earlier that month, to be replaced by Montreal MP David Lametti. Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet a few weeks later.

Had Burns been an MP, Caesar-Chavannes said, Wilson-Raybould would have been asked to remove him from Parliament.

“If she didn’t succeed, she would have been fired. If she succeeded in removing Robbie Burns, she would have been fired. You can’t have an Indian doing that to the white man. Lametti can, you can’t. The lads are better at that sort of thing,” she said.","Celina Caesar-Chavannes quits Liberal caucus, will sit as an independent MP",Ottawa Citizen,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/canada/celina-caesar-chavannes-quits-liberal-caucus-sits-as-independent-mp-2/wcm/e604392c-24d4-40eb-b8c7-9c5fc63847cb
71,Business,2019-03-21T16:41:00.0000000Z,"In an emailed response, the Liberal Party said it returned the money and improved its donation acceptance procedures. The Conservative Party of Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dogwood, a B.C. environmental organization ...","Through Elections BC's political donations database, the Star verified that between 2005 and 2013, SNC-Lavalin and the company's chairman of the board at the time, Gwyn Morgan, donated a combined total of $196,157 to the BC Liberal Party.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

In October 2018, Liberal MP, Patty Hajdu in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding announced she would be seeking re-election.

We only need to look at countries where press freedom is absent or political dissent is illegal to know how important the responsibility of the media and opposition is to holding governments accountable.

That said, opposition parties who want to form government by claiming revulsion at alleged government improprieties are often disappointed at election time. While it is frequently suggested that governments defeat themselves, opposition parties seeking to take over need a positive message about intent and priorities to make the transition into government. The unusual policy-free “For the People” victory of the Doug Ford Conservatives in Ontario in 2018 – and the rapidly collapsing approval levels for that administration – bodes ill for any party hoping to inherit the keys to the store without earning the privilege. Both Justin Trudeau in 2015 and Stephen Harper in 2006, 2008 and 2011 had policy proposals and clear priorities for which to seek public support.

Canadian Conservatives, and those Canadians of other or no affiliation searching for alternatives this October, have the right to expect a substantive platform and set of priorities from the Conservatives.

Canadian Conservatives … have the right to expect a substantive platform and set of priorities from (their party).

There are different paths Conservatives can take. One is the path seeking to mine as much dissatisfaction and animus as possible by blindly opposing every Liberal policy from immigration to pipelines, carbon taxes and rebates, or defence and foreign policy.

The other is to offer Canadians a robust and positive conservatism, replete with fresh ideas, nation and economy-building proposals and clear and compelling priorities – none of which would weaken Conservative principles of “smarter as opposed to larger” government; fair as opposed to excessive taxation; and equality of opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.

The Century Initiative Foundation in Canada, a distinguished mix of business, academic, volunteer sector and representative individuals, has a series of proposals for how Canada can achieve a population of 100 million people by 2100. It is nation-building at its best. If we want more clout at trade and environmental negotiations, in international forums and with enhanced strategic and defence capacity that facilitates a more pronounced independence for Canada, these are ideas Conservatives should consider and find a way to offer.

Fresh concepts on how to reduce poverty without growing the bureaucracies that manage existing, poverty-preserving welfare programs, would also be welcome. There is no contradiction within mainstream Conservative or Canadian mindsets between humane and effective government and reducing inefficiencies and burgeoning administrative overheads. Replacing the bureaucracy of the Indian Act (unbecoming to Canada and disrespectful to First Nations), is a classic Conservative project based on building trust, shared revenues and genuine respect for First Nations. And it could be incorporated into an economic growth plan for Canada.

Nor is there any reason Canadian Conservatives need to avoid frank discussion on foreign and defence policy. While much of both policies are, for good reason, non-partisan in substance, there is room for Conservative innovation on procurement, an Arctic strategy, relations with China and other authoritarian partners, and doubling the size of our Navy and Air Force over a reasonable period of time. And, if carbon taxes, deemed by some Conservatives as the devil’s spawn, are not the answer, neither is not having a policy that does not curb consumption of fossil fuels. It is not in the country’s or party’s interest.

The lure of dog whistle politics (decrying asylum seekers arriving through non-official border entries and knowing this will attract the anti-immigration and anti-diversity vote; or declining to support statutory reform of the Senate, while hoping not to get caught campaigning for the “all partisan all the time” Senate of yore) may work for a moment in time. But the conservatism of anger, resentment, turning back the clock, ignoring legitimate constitutional and self-government rights of First Nations, have rarely, in Canadian politics, won elections.

The negative approach not only underestimates the Canadian voter but affords the incumbent government and other parties strategic and tactical options that a more positive and constructive Conservative approach might supercede.

The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted ...,"Canada’s next budget will look very familiar, with Justin Trudeau set to spend much of a revenue windfall and continued red ink in his government’s books.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.

None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.

“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.

The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.

The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.

Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.

“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.

Skills Training

Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”

That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”

On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”

The budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government’s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau’s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.

Morneau has also said the government will “make sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism” and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded “pharmacare” program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party’s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he’s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada’s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.

Balanced budgets, rainy day funds, and debt reduction no longer are features of the Liberal brand. From a purely ...","Paul Martin, where have you gone?

In 2015, the deficit slayer appeared with Justin Trudeau on the campaign trail, lending instant credibility to the Liberal upstart’s economic policy.

Trudeau has repaid Martin for his support by frittering away the previous Liberal prime minister’s legacy for fiscal prudence.

Martin, as finance minister in Jean Chretien’s government, perfected the budgetary art of underpromising and overdelivering. He regularly found himself with revenue windfalls, all of which he used to erase a record deficit and reduce the debt. Frankly, the constant “surprises” got ridiculous after awhile, but the effort did have the effect of instilling confidence in Ottawa’s oversight of the economy.

Times have changed.

Bill Morneau, the former executive who has served as Trudeau’s finance minister since the Liberals unexpectedly won the last election, keeps finding himself with more money than he expected. His latest budget, released on March 19, includes additional revenue of about $30 billion through 2024, compared with October’s economic update.

Unlike Martin, Morneau’s habit is to spend the windfall — all of it — on initiatives that will play well with his party’s base. Balanced budgets, rainy day funds, and debt reduction no longer are features of the Liberal brand. From a purely economic perspective, the strategy could result in reduced poverty and narrower wealth gaps, which would have long-term societal benefits. The worry is that too little is being done to prepare for an economic downturn, but that appears to be a risk that the Trudeau government is willing to take, especially months before an election.

“The most important promise we made to Canadians is to invest in their future,” Morneau said at a press conference in Ottawa before he tabled his fourth budget. In the House of Commons, he congratulated himself for making these investments while moving the books back “towards” balance. The deficit will be about $20 billion in the fiscal year that ends a year from now, and about $10 billion in 2024, according to Morneau’s latest financial plan.

If the economy continues to roll, those deficits won’t be a problem; they amount to one per cent of gross domestic product or less, entirely manageable and low by international standards.

But there is reason to be wary about Canada’s economic prospects.

The budget assumes economic growth of about 1.8 per cent over the next five years, which is about as fast as the Bank of Canada reckons the economy can grow without causing inflation. That’s a reasonable outlook, but one that some forecasters will see as optimistic.

GDP barely grew in the fourth quarter, and the first quarter probably won’t be much better. The soft patch could be temporary, the result of an unusually large convergence of headwinds that converged over the second half of last year that have since begun to relent. The future of the North American Free Trade Agreement no longer is in doubt, for example. That should be good for investment, as executives will have one less thing to worry about.

But what if something else is going on?

Canada might already be in a recession, if only a shallow one, according to David Wolf, a former adviser at the Bank of Canada who now is a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments in Toronto. Household debt is about 174 per cent of disposable income, a record and one the highest levels in the world. The surprise in the fourth quarter was a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending, suggesting that all that debt could finally be weighing on domestic demand.

At the same time, national home prices declined in 2018 for the first time in records that date to 1990, according to Bloomberg News. A slump could cause the value of the currency to drop to record lows of around US$0.65, creating a new headwind, according to Wolf. The country’s economy remains uncompetitive, so there is little to offset weaker household spending. “There’s a good chance that those stars are going to be misaligned,” Wolf told Bloomberg News in an interview earlier this week.

Balance-sheet recessions tend to drag. The U.S. recovery from the financial crisis was weaker than anyone expected, and Japan still is digging out from under the debt that crashed its economy in the 1990s. Indebted households and companies are unable to help with the recovery because the owe so much to their creditors.

If Canada found itself in a downturn, the federal government alone would be in a position to do something about it, according to David Dodge, the former Bank of Canada governor and the deputy minister at Finance when Martin balanced the budget in the 1990s. The biggest provinces all spent heavily to help reverse the Great Recession. None of them have the fiscal room to do so now, especially Ontario, the country’s biggest provincial economy, Dodge and Richard Dion, a former economist at the central bank, said in a pre-budget report published by Bennet Jones, the Toronto-based law firm for which both now work as advisers.

“In his spring budget, the federal minister of finance should take no spending or tax actions which would further compromise a future government’s room to take the necessary discretionary action to support growth and public investment in the event of a major economic downturn, unless these actions are aimed directly and demonstrably at enhancing productivity and investment to promote the potential growth of the economy,” Dodge and Dion wrote.

Morneau pledged incentives to ensure all of rural Canada has a broadband connection by 2030 and promised about $2 billion over five years for new training initiatives. The rest of the windfall was used on initiatives such as pharmacare and enhanced pension benefits. Nice initiatives. Let’s hope a recession doesn’t wreck them.

Martin Prud’homme, who took a year off his job as director of the Sûreté du Québec provincial police force to clean up dubious practices by the Montreal police, was himself suspended earlier this month pending a criminal investigation.

In announcing the suspension of Prud’homme, Geneviève Guilbault, Quebec’s deputy premier and public safety minister, would not go into details, except to say that the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes, Quebec’s special police investigations unit, was looking into an allegation against Prud’homme.

Guilbault described the situation as “delicate” and “complex.”

Media reports suggest the suspension is related to the investigation of leaks to journalists about ongoing investigations by UPAC, Quebec’s permanent anti-corruption squad.

The BEI would only confirm that it was conducting a “criminal investigation following an allegation of a criminal infraction concerning Martin Prud’homme.”

Now, Quebec’s public prosecutor, the Direction des poursuites criminelles et pénales, has called on the Supreme Court of Canada to adjourn the case of Marie-Maude Denis versus Marc-Yvan Côté.

The start of hearings on that case was set for May 16.

Denis is a journalist and host of Radio-Canada’s flagship investigative program Enquête.

Côté, a former Quebec Liberal minister and fundraiser for both the federal and Quebec Liberals, along with former Quebec Liberal deputy premier Nathalie Normandeau and five others, were charged with fraud, bribery, corruption and breach of trust, related to party financing and the awarding for government contracts.

Côté’s lawyer, Jacques Larochelle, has been trying to derail the trial, alleging that leaks to Denis and other journalists about investigations involving Côté, as well as former premier Jean Charest and Liberal fundraiser Marc Bibeau, were directed from the highest levels.

Larochelle says this means his client cannot get a fair trial and he wants to force Denis to name her sources.

In a response to the adjournment request Monday, lawyer Oliver Desjardins, who is Larochelle’s associate and co-counsel in Côté’s defence, said Côté is not opposed to the adjournment motion.

Desjardins added that it would be strange to plead Côté’s case on May 16 “without knowing certain information in the possession of the court and Her Majesty the Queen,” using the formal title for the crown, or the public prosecutor.

The adjournment request, sent last Friday to Supreme Court Chief Justice Richard Wagner, says that in view of facts that have come to light in the course of the BEI investigation, the public prosecutor can no longer stand by the legal case presented in Quebec Superior Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal.

“If the Supreme Court renders a decision in this case based on the facts presented in the lower courts, it would not fully appreciate the validity of representations by the respondent (Côté) as to the necessity for him to obtain or not the disclosure of journalistic sources,” the request states.

The BEI investigations indicate that Côté’s allegations “are not frivolous and baseless,” the request continues, describing the investigation as “complex” and covering a six-year period from 2012 to 2018 that could last for several months.

There is no mention of Martin Prud’homme in the public prosecutor’s request, but he was interviewed by the RCMP in September 2017 after he contacted then UPAC head Robert Lafrenière to ask what he should do if Guy Ouellette was in touch with him.

Ouellette is a former Sûreté sergeant who was the SQ spokesman during operations against criminal biker gangs.

He was also a long-standing acquaintance of Prud’homme before he was elected as a Liberal member of the Quebec National Assembly in 2007.

Ouellette was re-elected as a Liberal in the Oct. 1 Quebec election, but now sits as an independent, after he was expelled from the party caucus for leaking Liberal secrets to the Coalition Avenir Québec, winners of the last Quebec election.

Prud’homme asked to be interviewed by the RCMP, not UPAC, to avoid conflicts of interest.

His wife is Dominique Lafrenière, a Sûreté du Québec captain responsible for criminal investigations, and daughter of Robert Lafrenière.

Ouellette was arrested but never charged in October 2017.

At the time, Lafrenière suggested at a news conference he was confident Ouellette was the source of leaks about UPAC investigations.

Media reports have indicated that in addition of Prud’homme, former UPAC investigators are among those giving testimony.",Investigation of leaks about Quebec corruption case proving ‘complex’,iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/03/20/investigation-of-leaks-about-quebec-corruption-case-proving-complex/

Manthorpe, a former Hong Kong correspondent, Vancouver Sun columnist and Business in Vancouver contributor, is on a speaking tour for his new book Claws of the Panda. He spoke March 13 to a decidedly anti-Communist Party of China crowd hosted by the Vancouver-based society Friends of Hong Kong.

article continues below

Claws of the Panda is an overview of Canada’s relationship with the authoritarian regime and the influence Beijing has on Canadian politicians and Canada’s Chinese diaspora. However, it was written before the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on December 1, 2018.

Manthorpe said the fallout from Meng’s arrest is the worst crisis in Canada-China relations since the two countries established mutual diplomatic relations in 1970.”

Manthorpe drew chuckles when he expressed how “queasy” he got at recent political interference in the Meng case by former ambassador to China John McCallum. Equally worrisome for Canada’s upholding of the rule of law, he said, is the alleged interference by the Prime Minister’s Office in the possible prosecution of construction firm SNC-Lavalin for bribing the Libyan government.

On the whole, he said, there is a “gulf” between China’s civic, judicial and human rights values and those upheld by Canada domestically and internationally. One example, before Meng, was when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went to China expecting to discuss trade and democratic values, only for Beijing to “send him packing with a flea in his ear.”

The Meng crisis should be “welcomed” and it should force scholars and naive politicians to re-examine Canada’s relationship with the authoritarian regime, he said.

“The first task is for Canadian policy and opinion makers is to realize the Huawei crisis is an opportunity to sweep away the self-delusion that has clouded their view of the People’s Republic of China few decades,” Manthorpe said.

Manthorpe prefaced his speech and Q&A session at the downtown Vancouver Public Library by noting that his research speaks to the authoritarian regime of the People’s Republic of China and not Canada’s 1.5-million-person ethnic Chinese diaspora. He acknowledged that speaking frankly about the subject locally is difficult given the social and cultural ties Canada, and especially Vancouver, has with China, Taiwan and especially Hong Kong, a city with about 300,000 Canadian passport holders.

He expressed disappointment after hearing about one person who did not want to attend his talk, fearing it would be an “anti-Chinese” event.

Manthorpe said raising legitimate issues about Canada-China relations usually provokes controversy.

“We saw it, for example, in the whole business of the investment in real estate in Vancouver and Toronto. We saw real estate agents rolling out the racism card,” he said, adding that Chinese government officials accused Canada of white supremacy after Meng’s arrest.

To maintain objectivity, Manthorpe said, he wrote his book entirely from the public record.

His book delves into, among other things, how agents of the authoritarian regime exert pressure on ethnic Chinese people overseas who have either personal or business ties to China.

China, he says, employs agents in Canada who meddle in local political affairs via organized, typically pro-business or “friendship” groups. Local politicians, he notes, are increasingly falling under the influence of those groups.

“These agents have been able to come over here and work with no pushback from Canadian authorities,” he said. “The fact that we have very similar campaigns in Australia and New Zealand as we have in Canada gives me great satisfaction that I’m not a conspiracy theorist.”

There is some hope of pushback within government, however, he said. Last May, in Vancouver, China’s propaganda wing, the United Front Work Department, organized the ninth Conference of the World Guangdong Community Federation, which saw over 200 Chinese nationals slated to attend the event denied visas. Premier John Horgan, MLA Teresa Wat, MP Alice Wong and Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie attended the conference, among others.

The United Front is reportedly used to quash dissent and stifle criticism of the Communist Party of China while promoting the party’s political goals, such as bringing Hong Kong and Taiwan into its grasp or undermining the liberal democratic order.

Manthorpe stressed Sino-Canadian relationships will likely need to be developed outside of government activity given the level of influence pro-Beijing groups are exerting on Canadian politicians.

He also called interference in local Chinese media “quite appalling,” noting a free exchange of ideas in the Mandarin-language press is fundamental.

Canadians, he said, should keep in mind the repressed minorities in China and those who are threatened and punished for speaking out against the Chinese government.

Turpel-Lafond said 13 hours of hearings and testimony is not much given the importance of the issues and the fact so many other witnesses were not heard from. ""I've handled pretrial applications that have lasted twice as long.""

""Moreover, only in coarse and substandard systems of justice do we say things like 'it's over and Canadians can decide who to believe' leaving matters to the vagaries of political messaging rather than proper defensible justice processes,"" she added.

Scheer said Canadians need to know what led Wilson-Raybould to quit cabinet a month after she was punted as attorney general to veterans affairs. Wilson-Raybould insists she is still bound by cabinet confidentiality, but is willing to speak if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau releases her.

New Democrats say only a public inquiry now will ascertain whether any laws or rules were broken in the whole affair.

""People deserve answers,"" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told the Commons. ""Why will the Liberal prime minister not call for a public inquiry? What is he so afraid of?""

However, the Liberals say they've heard enough, and Canadians could judge for themselves whether any lines were crossed. In a letter to the committee chair, the five Liberal MPs on the justice committee said their minds were made up: ""Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all rules and laws were followed.""

Outraged, Scheer said Canadians ""expect accountability in this place and by ending the justice committee's investigation into his own corruption scandal Justin Trudeau is thumbing his nose at every single Canadian.

""His message to Canadians is 'you don't deserve to know the truth.' ""

New Democrat MPs Murray Rankin and Tracey Ramsey said with federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion on sick leave, that inquiry is on hold. Following Dion's announcement he would be taking a leave, his office issued a statement saying it would continue its work. But it is not conducting any of its inquiries in public.

Wilson-Raybould, who accused the prime minister and his team of trying to politically interfere in a bribery prosecution of the giant Quebec company, had little to say publicly Tuesday. She tweeted only that Bill Morneau had tabled his budget.

In a procedural surprise move, Morneau introduced the budget quietly in the Commons, allowing its release — pre-empting the Conservatives' vow to delay it.

But Morneau's speech was delayed, and continually interrupted.

After leading his caucus out of the Commons, Scheer warned his party was not done. He said the government tried to present a budget full of big spending to distract Canadians ""as if it were business as usual.

""It is not business as usual and we could not stand by while the Liberals pretend otherwise.

The Progressive Conservative government eliminated free tuition for low-income students in January and made several once-mandatory student fees, such as those that fund campus organizations and clubs, optional.

Wednesday's protest was organized by the Canadian Federation of Students' Ontario chapter and was said to involve more than 17 school campuses.

The group is calling on the province to provide more grants rather than loans and to eliminate tuition fees for all students. It is also calling on school administrators to pressure the province to reverse the changes, saying they are not ""absolved of responsibility in this whole issue.""

""We want to diversify our tactics,"" Nour Alideeb, who chairs the organization, said about the decision to stage a walkout.

'Thousands of dollars in debt'

""We've been seeing rallies and marches and so forth, we've had town halls, students are organizing community action and things like that and now we want to bring it to campus, where our local administrations are, where we can show solidarity between faculty, between staff.""

While the group has been able to meet with provincial legislators of all parties, neither Premier Doug Ford nor the minister of training, colleges and universities have agreed to a meeting, Alideeb said.

It's going to mean that I personally can't go to school next year. - Alexxus-Leigh Newman

A crowd of students and supporters gathered outside Toronto's Ryerson University around midday, hoisting signs and chanting their disapproval of the tuition changes.

""It's going to mean that I personally can't go to school next year,"" said Alexxus-Leigh Newman, a second-year English student.

""It's also going to mean that a bunch of other students aren't going to be able to go to school or (will) have to go finish school in thousands upon thousands of dollars in debt that they're never going to be able to unbury themselves from,"" said Newman, who is Indigenous and from a low-income family.

She said actions such as walkouts can put pressure on governments, citing the effectiveness of the 2012 student strike in Quebec in overturning planned tuition increases.

Minister's office did not immediately respond

The group is calling on the province to provide more grants rather than loans and to eliminate tuition fees for all students. (Grant Linton/CBC) Seyon Raveendrarajah, in his first year of Ryerson's engineering program, said students were taking time to protest even in the lead-up to mid-term exams because this is a significant issue.

""I think it's better to fight back,"" he said. ""If there's enough people, they have to listen to us at one point.""

The minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The funding changes, which were announced in January, also include a 10 per cent tuition cut for the upcoming school year, with schools expected to absorb the loss in revenue.

Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said he hopes the government will listen to the backlash from students.

""I know in my own riding, at the University of Guelph, students are concerned about the loss of our campus radio station, campus newspaper, and just services that support students because that funding won't be there anymore,"" he said.

Interim Liberal Leader John Fraser said the changes aren't going over well with families, either.

""It's making it harder it harder for families, it's putting more debt on families, it's going in the wrong direction,"" he said.

The previous Liberal government had increased the number of grants and made it possible for low-income students to attend college or university free of cost.

Under that program, low-income students could qualify for grants large enough to cover the full cost of tuition under the previous plan, but now a portion of the funding they receive will be a loan.","University, college students walk out of class to protest Ontario's funding changes",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/student-walkout-university-college-ontario-1.5064712?cmp=rss

A call for a vote on an unrelated procedural motion, at 3:55 p.m., would delay the vote at least 30 minutes, according to person familiar with the plan. But the opposition has other tactics it could use to slow things down, including rising on points of order or having MPs take their time voting.

The budget — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s last before Canada’s next election — comes as the Liberal government has been roiled by a scandal involving SNC-Lavalin that has seen four high profile resignations.

The budget is not expected to dramatically change the country’s fiscal course. Trudeau is expected to use a revenue windfall to increase spending on social programs — and the deficit — as the economy starts to wobble.

A protesting First Nations woman who was pushed to the ground during Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Climate Action Rally at the Danforth Music Hall on March 4, says the prime minister “witnessed” her being assaulted, and “did nothing.”

The woman is 26-year-old Vanessa Gray, a community organizer from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation. In a press release written a few days after the incident, Gray said it is disturbing that many of the people who attended the event, including Trudeau himself, did nothing.

At the event, Trudeau was interrupted several times during his speech by hecklers and protestors in the crowd, who were immediately ushered out by security.

Gray said she went to ensure that the voices of Indigenous people were present and draw attention to the ongoing colonial and environmental violence that indigenous people experience in Canada.

Before arriving at the event, Gray hid a Canadian flag in her shirt that said, “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.”

She said it was to remind those at the event that ground zero of environmental violence is occurring right now on unceded land.

Videos and photographs of the incident have been making the rounds online.

During Trudeau’s speech, Gray threw her flag and shouted “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.” Seconds later, an older white man, in a blue shirt, pushed her down to the floor.

“Shocked, but not deterred I rose up and continued to speak, ‘No Justice on Stolen Native Land.’ I said this over and over until security pulled me from the rally,” she wrote in her statement.

While Gray was quickly escorted out, the man, who is yet to be identified, remained inside the event and continued to cheer Trudeau on.

In a video taken during the event, Trudeau can be seen witnessing the scuffle and uttering “Oh boy, oh boy,” moments after Gray is pushed to the ground.

Gray has been speaking up against environmental violence for eight years.

She and her lawyer Nick Cake, with Millars Law, are considering her legal options. Cake said they are in a preliminary stage and are reviewing all options and working to determine the best possible path.

“Our options include filing a police report because police didn’t take any action on that day. Another avenue will be civil remedies that may be available. Another would be to leverage a conversation between Vanessa and the prime minister’s office,” he said.

“Situations like this have a way of fizzling off and falling off into the background and essentially being forgotten about. It’s our intention to keep this fresh and to keep it going so it does not become outdated or a situation that lacks the public’s interest,” Cake said.

In an email statement, Liberal Party spokesperson Parker Lund said the safety of all Canadians attending such events is a top priority and that the incident has been brought to their attention.

82,,2019-03-21T21:23:00.0000000Z,But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession ... mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups. Remember infrastructure?,"The 2019 federal budget, like all recent federal budgets, is a tribute to the pleasures of endless economic growth.

In the days when inflation was high, interest rates were volatile and growth was very stop and go, budgeting was hard work. Reining in runaway deficits absorbed most of the energies of finance ministers for the better part of three decades.

But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession in the last quarter-century, and a mild one at that. Budgeting in such times is comparative child’s play — governments, at the federal level at least, have to positively go out of their way to run deficits.

Indeed, so steady has the revenue-gusher been — no government has ever had as much money to play with, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars per citizen — that the Liberals have been obliged to perform quite heroic feats of spending just to keep pace. Though real per capita spending is at all-time record levels, the deficit remains stubbornly below one per cent of GDP — hardly a deficit at all, really. My God, in the fiscal year just ending, the deficit actually fell: revenues came in faster (6.8 per cent) than even the Liberals could spend them (4.9 per cent).

I’ve said before that these are deficits of choice, rather than necessity. A better way to describe them might be deficits for show. Not even the Liberals still pretend deficits of this size would have any impact on growth, nor have they: real growth per capita in the bad old Harper years, from fiscal 2007 to 2016, averaged 0.9 per cent — versus 0.7 per cent, actual and projected, in the shining new era ushered in by the Liberals (2017-2024).

Indeed, they’re not even supposed to. Their impact is, first, symbolic — behold, we run deficits because we like to, whereas the previous government did so only grudgingly! — and second, to permit the government to spend more, mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups.

Remember infrastructure? That was supposed to differentiate the new Liberal deficit spending from the old Liberal deficit spending. It wasn’t about pork-barrel politics, or short-run economic fixes. It was about making strategic investments that would increase productivity for the long run. Only it hasn’t quite worked out that way, has it?

The budget boasts that federal infrastructure spending has increased from $8 billion in fiscal 2016 to $14 billion in the current fiscal year. That’s an increase of $6 billion, which sounds like a lot, until you realize total program spending has increased by $47-billion in the same period. At one point the Liberals used to claim one dollar in three of new spending would go to infrastructure. The actual result: more like one in eight.

It is time, then, for the conversation to move on: from how spending is financed to what it is spent on, from the size of government to its composition, from the macro to the micro. Deficits of this size are not going to ruin us, as the opposition claims; neither would eliminating them, as the finance minister pretends.

The quantity of spending isn’t so much the issue as the quality. It isn’t that we can’t afford it: it’s that, in the rush to get all that spending out the door, little thought appears to have been given to whether the money is being spent in the best way, or whether it should be spent at all.

The most telling table in the budget is the last: the one that tallies up the estimated savings from the several “comprehensive reviews” of spending the government claims to have undertaken. The total annual saving: $237 million. Out of a budget of $323.5 billion.

Perhaps one day something a little more stringent will be attempted. And perhaps this budget’s signature initiatives on training and housing, which give every impression of having been cooked up in the Prime Minister’s Office, if not in party election planning sessions, will be the subject.

The training chapter notes, with evident satisfaction, that the government now spends close to $7.5 billion a year on skill development “across more than 100 distinct programs.” Given the country’s acute and growing skills shortages, some questions might be asked about their efficacy. Some, but not too many: a review of skills programming provided “an opportunity to reflect on past successes and determine where more can be done.”

Such a forgiving attitude to the past does not bode well for the future. Has any serious analysis been done of the new Canada Training Benefit — how it will interact with provincial programs, what sort of training will be eligible, and so on?

Likewise for the government’s suite of new policies to make housing more affordable. The budget acknowledges the only real solution to high house prices in the long run is to increase the supply of houses. But the specific measures it announces would mostly stimulate the demand — notably a First-Time Home Buyer Incentive that would involve the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, worryingly, in lending directly to prospective buyers. The details are sketchier than sketchy, but any benefit would more than likely be capitalized into prices. Would anyone really be made better off?

But why ask hard questions, when growth is endless and budgets need never be balanced? Except … even if the business cycle has been abolished, and growth does persist, it will be much slower growth than we have known, now that the Baby Boomers are hitting their retirement years. That may not be of much concern to the feds, who largely insulated themselves, in the deficit-slashing years, from the fiscal consequences. But it’s a huge problem for the provinces, who will have to pay to look after all those aging Boomers.

What would the budget do to stimulate growth in the long run — to improve Canada’s sluggish productivity record, to arrest the alarming decline in business investment, to reform Canada’s complex, growth-killing corporate and personal income tax system?

Er, nothing, as it happens. For as it has been said, in the long run we are all out of office.","Andrew Coyne: Federal budget a testament to the pleasures of endless growth.

83,Politics,2019-03-21T04:07:00.0000000Z,"In conversation with The Journal after her Community Matters town hall meeting in Ashcroft on March 5, Green Party of Canada leader and Saanich-Gulf ... they were always going to vote Liberal. It was almost genetic. “That’s changing.","In conversation with The Journal after her Community Matters town hall meeting in Ashcroft on March 5, Green Party of Canada leader and Saanich-Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May was asked whether the Green Party had more work to do to get away from the idea that they are mainly concerned with a single issue.

“Absolutely. Right now Canadians are looking around and thinking ‘I don’t feel like I want to vote “fill in the blank”.’ A lot of people are no longer as rooted in one party only. Growing up in Cape Breton, you used to feel that if someone’s parents were Liberals, they were always going to vote Liberal. It was almost genetic.

“That’s changing. People are looking around and thinking ‘Where do I want to put my vote? Who’s earned my vote?’ And almost by process of elimination people find themselves looking at the Green Party with new eyes. So we really have to explain ourselves. We’ve always had credible platforms, budgeted programs that are more detailed and fiscally sound than other parties. But a lot of people don’t know that, because the media coverage hasn’t shown us as the viable option. Now they are.

“Going into the 2019 election we do have work to do. We have an obligation to offer Canadians a viable alternative that answers the questions that they have.”

One of the main questions, May said, was to do with the idea that the Greens are against the economy; that if you care about the environment you are somehow against the economy. “That isn’t valid, but it’s been pitted like that for so long that people have a tendency to assume that’s going to be a problem in voting Green.”

May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada have set a standard for being hard-working and ethical. “We’re open to ideas, and wanting to cooperate with others. That’s one of the key things that makes us different from other parties. We want to get the best of the ideas from everybody and work on them together.”

Asked if she wanted to predict how many Green Party candidates might be elected in October, May said it was hard to say. “When I look at the variables I see that a lot is in flux. I’m not trying to be deliberately cagey, but look at what happened to the NDP in Quebec in 2011. That could happen for us this time.

“In the Outremont by election [on Feb. 25] we placed ahead of the Conservatives and ahead of the Bloc Québécois. That’s the best showing the Greens have ever had in Outremont. It’s not the same as saying we’re poised to win Outremont, but for the first time the Quebec media began to say ‘Wait a minute, the Greens could win seats in Quebec.’ Once people begin to say we could win, that’s when voters begin to think ‘Oh, it’s not a wasted vote,’ and they begin to look at our candidates differently.”

May said that she had expected the subject of trains to come up at the town hall in Ashcroft, but not to the extent that it did, and that she had learned a lot. She added that conversation in rural New Brunswick regarding trains was a lot like the one in Ashcroft, although with more emphasis on the inadequacies of passenger travel.

“Where you find a lot of conversation around rail safety is in Montreal, where people are still reeling from Lac-Mégantic.”

Regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair, May said that she did not expect to see any further cabinet resignations, and wondered how much pressure had to be put on every remaining member of cabinet to get their signature on a letter of support for the Prime Minister. “There may be some unhappy [people] who signed that.”

May planned to fly to Ottawa overnight on March 5 to attend the Justice Committee meeting on March 6 to ask questions. “I have a lot of questions, and I hope we make some headway in answering the key bits where there’s missing information.”

May had nothing but praise for the ethics and intelligence of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, both of whom have resigned from Cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin affair. “They’re both really impressive, and they’ve both done the thing that people with integrity will do. The extent to which that wasn’t anticipated by the old boys’ club that really runs things is fascinating.

“The gender analysis of this episode, when it’s all over, will be really, really interesting. The pressure … in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, there were a lot of men pressuring her. And Bill Morneau’s response to Jane Philpott leaving was ‘I know they were close friends.’ They’re both women. Women apparently, according to Bill Morneau, form little pinky-pacts where if one goes the other has to go too.

“No, that’s not the case. These are people of integrity, and in our political system it’s so rare for a cabinet minister to step out of that post.”

May said she was doing a lot of digging into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and had a lot of questions. “Where’s the evidence and analysis that would suggest that SNC-Lavalin could fold and all these people could lose their jobs? I don’t see it. There’s a lot to dig into here before I’ll feel as if I know what happened.”

Former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick recently had a dire warning about the upcoming election, saying that he worried about the “rising tide of incitements to violence” and that he feared “somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign”. May called the words a “diversionary tactic”, and said “I don’t think that’s Canada, and I think Michael Wernick’s testimony was unhelpful. Anything that gives oxygen to the idea that we’d take violent actions against people in private life I don’t appreciate, as a person in public life.

“I hope the election won’t be ugly. Of all the leaders of parties and of all the party strategies so far, it’s Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives who’ve been willing to play footsie with white supremacists, willing to run fear-based campaigns. We’ll see if the election unfolds in ways that elevate discourse, or move us closer to the kinds of things that go on in the U.S.”

May said that she is concerned about the potential for social media sites like Facebook to have paid-for advertising and the spreading of fake news designed to advantage one party over another. “Canadians, as intelligent and critical thinkers … I think the best defence against that kind of thing happening is to actually be prepared to be a watchdog. If they see something where they go back to the original media site over some claim that strikes them as unlikely, and it turns out it’s a manipulated propaganda site, they’re going to get on board a campaign that does #don’tbelievethisnewssite. Whatever it takes to say ‘We need to make decisions based on information from reliable news sources, not propaganda websites.'”

Current infrastructure funding, where the costs are split between the federal and provincial governments and municipalities, sees the federal government paying 50 per cent, the provincial government paying 33 per cent, and the municipality paying 17 per cent. The federal government considers a “rural community” to be anything under a population of 100,000, putting Ashcroft in the same boat as Kamloops. The difficulty that very small communities have in raising their 17 per cent share of infrastructure funding was pointed out to May.

“This is a big issue in my riding too,” said May. “A municipal government is still treated as if it’s a child of a province. Most of the critical infrastructure needs are found at [the municipal] level of government. One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments and First Nations.

“The access to a tax base is so small for municipalities compared to the provinces and feds. The split clearly isn’t sensible. You’re not going to find the tax base here to raise the kind of money that’s needed to gain access to infrastructure funding. But every community in Canada has a huge infrastructure deficit. There’s a better way to deal with it, and cost-sharing isn’t it.

“Infrastructure projects for small and rural municipalities should be 100 per cent federal. Just get it done, because it’s such a barrier when rural municipalities first have to beg the province and then find their 17 per cent. It’s not workable.”

May said that she had had a wonderful visit to the area. “The school, the theatre production of Shrek: I’ve been very fortunate to have had a lot of really great experiences of connecting with community. I visited the screwdriver factory and got my own personalized screwdriver with my name on it.

“Visiting Ashcroft, it’s clear that the number one asset of this community is the community spirit of talented people who love living where they live.

“Small communities are capable of doing amazing things, and Ashcroft is a great example of that. Really impressive.”

1919: A Graphic History of the Winnipeg General Strike Graphic History Collective and David Lester Between The Lines, 2019

“History is an important resource for people who want to change the world.” (vii)

This opening line captures the philosophy of the Graphic History Collective (GHC), whose books and posters have not only helped to amplify the history of marginalized populations, but breathe new life into how we present history. The GHC projects have seized the visual medium to intertwine historical knowledge and context with the sort of impressions which can only be summoned through the poignancy of illustration.

In this way, 1919: A Graphic History of the Winnipeg General Strike is a worthy addition to an already impressive lineup. After an introduction by historian Jim Naylor, which lays out the rationale for the Strike being rooted in a national and international working-class revolt against capitalism, the graphic novel begins in earnest.

The project is a wonderful distillation of the Strike’s series of events, antecedents, and motivations of its key actors, elevated with evoking images that place the reader among the strikers. Particularly immersive is the minute-by-minute depiction of the Bloody Saturday clashes where, with almost no words, the story of that day is told. You can see the workers protesting jailed Strike leaders, the overturning of a scab-operated streetcar, and the violent response from thugs and Mounties, including their killing of immigrant workers Mike Sokolowski and Mike Schezerbanowicz.

Crucially, the book perceptively roots the origins of the Strike, not just in the developments of total war and industrial capitalism, but in the systematic dispossession and genocide of the Indigenous peoples who called these lands home. Capital’s dominance of the city and its environs would have been impossible without it. Along this line, the book does well to connect the events in Winnipeg to working-class protest across Canada and the globe.

Much more could be said, but it is imperative to note how David Lester and company deftly demonstrate how the Strike materialized, starting as a plan laid by the city’s craft unionists, before expanding to include most of the city’s working-class, women and men, union and non-union, British and non-British. Equally noteworthy, the book highlights how Canada and Winnipeg’s capitalist elite organized to crush the Strike, largely through a systematic program of redbaiting, thuggery, show trials, and bigotry. It was they—supposedly—who stood for venerated British institutions in the face of Bolshevik and ‘alien’ interlopers.

It should be stressed that this graphic novel finishes strong in demonstrating that the Strike’s impacts aren’t crystalized in 1919. Rather, it influenced broad Canadian labour and left movements, from the more immediate expansion of industrial unionism and rise of the Communist Party and Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, to the longer-range influence the event had in inspiring activism, protest, and social reform generations later, including in our own times. This acts as an effective bridge to the GHC’s Direct Action Gets the Goods, which examines the broader history of how strikes have wrought social, political, and economic change in Canada.

But above all, 1919’s greatest strength is that it has deep value, both for those unfamiliar with the history of the Strike, and for even the most seasoned scholars of the Canadian labour and left movements.

There is much here for everybody.

As measles outbreaks become more common, Canada still lacks key data

Story continues below advertisement

When Vancouver experienced a measles outbreak at three schools last month, it took the local health authority a week to track down the vaccination records for 20 per cent of the students. The delay complicated the response, and made it more difficult to determine which students might have been most at risk of the contagious disease.

The root of the problem, reports Wendy Stueck, lies in Canada’s glaring data gaps: Parents in nearly every province and territory aren’t required to provide schools with immunization records; there’s no national online registry of vaccinations; records don’t carry over when people move or travel across provincial boundaries; paper records are still being used to varying degrees in New Brunswick and Nunavut.

As a result of the data gaps, we don’t have a clear sense of Canada’s overall vaccine coverage: The measles vaccination rate for two-year-olds is 89 per cent, according to a 2015 national survey, well below the 95-per-cent threshold recommended to reach “herd immunity.” But the survey is just an estimate (officials say the number is likely higher due to a low response rate).

Rise of outbreaks: The Vancouver outbreak comes as high increases in measles cases occur worldwide, with the World Health Organization calling vaccine hesitancy one of the top global health threats in 2019. Ukraine alone had more than 24,000 measles cases in the first two months of this year.

Fighting misinformation: The threat posed by anti-vaxxers and those who are wary of vaccinations has prompted Canada’s Public Health Agency to launch an education campaign to counter false narratives, while health centres across Canada have started to go as far as banning unvaccinated individuals from their facilities.

New Zealand is banning semi-automatic weapons

All military-style weapons and assault rifles will be banned within weeks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said as her country responds to the deadly Christchurch mosque shootings that left 50 dead and dozens more injured. New Zealand will also be implementing a buy-back program for the banned weapons.

Thousands are expected to attend a Friday prayer service tomorrow across the street from the Al Noor mosque where at least 42 were killed. The mosque is planning to reopen for services next week, with some workers offering their services for free to speed up repairs.

SNC-Lavalin says it never cited job losses as a reason for a settlement

CEO Neil Bruce also told The Globe that his firm “never threatened anybody” about moving its head office out of Canada as an argument for settling its criminal corruption trial. He also pointed out that federal legislation doesn’t allow for economic reasons to be used as an argument against prosecution. (for subscribers)

The comments stand in contrast with testimony by retiring Privy Clerk Michael Wernick and ex-principal secretary Gerald Butts; Wernick said officials believed there was a risk of SNC moving, while both he and Butts repeatedly cited the possibility of job losses.

Bruce said the possibility of a headquarter move might have been discussed in the event of a negative outcome in the criminal case, noting “we need to make alternative arrangements” should SNC be banned from federal contracts.

Separately, the Liberals used their majority in the House of Commons to defeat a Conservative motion calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to let Jody Wilson-Raybould give further testimony on the SNC fallout. (for subscribers)

And Celina Caesar-Chavannes, the Liberal MP who had told The Globe that Trudeau yelled at her during a conversation on the same day Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet, will now be sitting as an independent in Parliament.

The OPP hiring process was ‘flawed’ – but Doug Ford didn’t break any rules, a report says

Ontario’s Integrity Commissioner said the Premier kept his distance from the decision to hire his friend Ron Taverner for the province’s top police job. But Commissioner J. David Wake “found that there were some troubling aspects of the recruitment process and ultimately made the finding that the process was flawed.” While Ford called the findings “a complete vindication,” the NDP is renewing calls for a public inquiry.

The report detailed the ways Ford’s government had tried to hire Taverner for previous positions, including a senior role at the Ontario Cannabis Store. The outgoing deputy minister of community safety is also quoted saying he was told another public servant felt under pressure to hire “a friend of the Fords.” That public servant, Steve Orsini, later denied making those remarks.

Carter pitches athletes on Moscow Olympic boycott

Open this photo in gallery (Bettmann/Getty Images) Bettmann / Getty Images

March 21, 1980: No one applauded as president Jimmy Carter entered the East Room of the White House. Nearly 100 top American athletes were there to hear his argument in favour of boycotting the coming Summer Olympics in Moscow. Most left the March 21 meeting unconvinced. Carter proposed the boycott in January, 1980, shortly after Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in support of the country’s struggling communist regime. Fearing a larger push toward the oil-rich Persian Gulf, Carter demanded Soviet troops withdraw and threatened a boycott of the Moscow Olympics as an ultimatum. The boycott proved a hard sell. Prime minister Joe Clark threw Canada’s support behind the plan, and kept Canadian athletes away from the Games. But other NATO allies, including France and Britain, declined to follow suit. At home, American athletes complained bitterly. “The only way to compete against Moscow is to stuff it down their throats in their own backyard,” gold-medal-winning discus thrower Al Oerter said. Carter eventually persuaded the United States Olympic Committee to support his plan, and American athletes stayed home. Soviet athletes returned the favour four years later, boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. – Mark Rendell

Even BC Liberal ...","Over the past few weeks, British Columbians who own property received their speculation and vacancy tax notices and were asked to provide information to make themselves exempt from the levy.

The speculation tax in specific urban areas targets foreign and domestic homeowners who pay little or no income tax in the province and those who own second properties that are not long-term rentals. It is one of five different policies the current provincial government implemented in an effort to give more British Columbians access to the real estate market. Housing began to climb as a concern for residents in 2014 and was a key issue for most urban voters before the 2017 provincial ballot.

article continues below

When Research Co. asked British Columbians about the speculation tax last May, 62 per cent deemed it a “very good” or “good” idea.

Earlier this month, when Research Co. asked if they agree or disagree with the policy, the results were also satisfactory. More than two-thirds of British Columbians (68 per cent) say they agree with the speculation tax.

There is little fluctuation in the level of support for the speculation tax across all regions of the province.

When it comes to different age groups, British Columbians aged 18 to 34 who are aching to enter the housing market are more in favour: 73 per cent of them agree with the speculation tax. Majorities of those aged 35 to 54 (68 per cent) and those aged 55 and over (64 per cent) also support it.

More than four in five British Columbians who voted for the governing BC NDP almost two years ago (82 per cent) agree with the speculation tax, along with seven in 10 (70 per cent) of those who cast a ballot for BC Green Party candidates. Even BC Liberal voters from the last election are more likely to agree with the speculation tax right now (55 per cent) than to disagree with it (39 per cent).

The other four key housing policies are also endorsed by majorities of British Columbians. The decision to increase the foreign-buyer tax to 20 per cent from 15 per cent remains extremely popular, with four in five residents (80 per cent) agreeing with its implementation. The remaining measures were regarded as more controversial when they were announced. Across the province, 64 per cent of British Columbians agree with the government’s decision to increase the property transfer tax to 5 per cent from 3 per cent for homes valued at more than $3 million.

A similar proportion (66 per cent) is also in favour of the introduction of a tax of 0.2 per cent on the value of homes between $3 million and $4 million, and a tax rate of 0.4 per cent on the portion of a home’s value that exceeds $4 million.

When asked if they think the provincial government’s actions will be effective or ineffective in making housing more affordable in British Columbia, residents are not entirely convinced.

Fewer than two in five British Columbians (39 per cent) say they believe the provincial government’s intervention will be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in making housing more affordable. Almost half (47 per cent) expect these actions to be “moderately ineffective” or “very ineffective” in the long term.

This is where the key challenge for the government lies. The housing taxes, widely regarded as good ideas last year, continue to enjoy the backing of a majority of residents.

Still, measuring the effectiveness of these policies, even if the prospect of an early election has dissipated, will be complex. Housing will have to begin to disappear as a key concern for British Columbians, perhaps to be replaced by issues such as the environment or health care, which used to be top of mind among voters polled in the Gordon Campbell era before the 2008 financial crisis.

In any event, the province’s residents of all ages will need to establish an emotional connection to success. Maybe it will come in the form of a friend who was considering moving away but ultimately was able to stay, or a family member who gleefully signs his or her first mortgage. These are the milestones that can cause the currently muted numbers on “effectiveness” to surge.

On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government presented its 2019-20 budget, which lavished new spending on middle ...","(Reuters) - The Canadian province of Saskatchewan forecast on Wednesday its first balanced budget since 2014-15, with resource revenues set to rise after the government proposed a change to how it calculates its return from potash sales.

Saskatchewan, home to major potash and uranium reserves, projected a C$34.4 million ($25.9 million) surplus for 2019-20, with increasing surpluses for future years, the province’s budget document showed.

For the fiscal year ending on March 31, the deficit was projected to rise to C$379.9 million ($285.6 million) from C$365.3 million forecast in November’s mid-year fiscal update.

“This budget contains no new taxes or tax increases, so it’s the right balance to keep our economy strong,” Finance Minister Donna Harpauer said.

The western Canadian province, which has a population of about 1.2 million, had balanced its books for two decades before its economy was weakened by the 2014 collapse in the price of oil.

The right-leaning Saskatchewan Party government, led by Scott Moe, has since moved to reduce the province’s reliance on oil revenue. In 2017, it bumped up the sales tax up by 1 percent and applied it to more items.

Tax revenue is forecast to rise 5.8 percent in 2019-20 from the current fiscal year to nearly C$7.6 billion, while there is a 7.1 percent projected increase in resource revenue that is mostly due to potash.

The budget includes changes to the Potash Production Tax, which eliminates some deductions.

Resource revenue has rebounded by 40 percent since 2016-17 but remains 30 percent below 2014-15 levels, the province said.

The price for potash is forecast by Saskatchewan to average $219.66 per tonne in 2019, up from $207.66 last year.

The province expects the average price of West Texas Intermediate oil to fall to $58 a barrel this year from $64.78 a barrel in 2018.

Net debt-to-GDP is projected to dip to 14.7 percent at the end of 2019-20 from 14.8 percent in the current fiscal year. It had climbed each year from 5.5 percent in 2014-15.

89,,2019-03-22T01:39:00.0000000Z,"“Let’s not give up on Canada because of the Notley-Trudeau alliance ... “There’s a spectrum of views about this and this is not a party with a rigid ideological orthodoxy, this is not ...","Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are allies in “sabotaging” Alberta and their efforts will be met with constitutional and legal challenges, UCP leader Jason Kenney said Thursday.

Notley, meanwhile, later warned of the threat of “American-style” health care under a UCP government.

With a backdrop of Calgary’s downtown skyline, where office vacancy rate is between 25 and 30 per cent, Kenney lashed into the premier, calling her an accomplice in keeping that space empty and the city’s employment rate Canada’s highest.

The carbon tax meant to ease the way for pipelines and Notley’s failure to support the Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipelines are incriminating evidence, said the UCP leader.

“Rachel Notley sold out to Justin Trudeau and all we got in exchange is a carbon tax and no pipelines,” said Kenney, who also mentioned the proposed federal Bill C-69 that critics contend will make it far more difficult to build energy projects.

“Notley can’t even bring herself to call for a full repeal of Bill C-69.”

Alberta’s economy took a huge nosedive when oil prices plunged globally in late 2014, months before the NDP took power, but Kenney argues other oil-producing jurisdictions have seen greater recovery since.

If necessary, Kenney said a UCP government will launch a constitutional challenge against the legislation, turn off oil taps to a pipeline-obstructionist B.C., and forge a pro-energy alliance with other provinces.

If a pipeline to tidewater isn’t built by 2021, a UCP government would also hold a provincial referendum on reforming equalization payments he says yields $3 billion annually from Alberta taxpayers that sends $20 billion more a year to federal coffers than it receives.

That referendum would be held Oct. 18, 2021.

“Let’s not give up on Canada because of the Notley-Trudeau alliance, let’s end the alliance,” he said.

It was pointed out to Kenney that it was the Harper government — in which he was a cabinet minister — that forged that equalization formula.

Kenney admitted he was “in the cabinet when there were a couple of different versions of equalization” but that times have changed dramatically since then, with Alberta now facing considerable economic challenges.

“We didn’t have provinces trying to block Alberta pipelines,” he said.

Kenney also said he accepts the scientific consensus that human beings are responsible for climate change, but added he won’t insist his candidates or MLAs — some of whom have voiced skepticism — follow suit.

“There’s a spectrum of views about this and this is not a party with a rigid ideological orthodoxy, this is not an issue that has come up for debate (within the UCP),” he said.

Meanwhile, Alberta will get 2,000 more long-term-care beds if the NDP is re-elected, a plan put at risk by “American-style” health care under the UCP, Rachel Notley said Thursday.

Speaking in Lethbridge, the NDP leader said her government already delivered 2,000 of those beds for seniors after taking power in 2015.

“Despite that increase, we know we need to keep building those,” she said of the $170-million investment.

“When you work your entire life to make Alberta prosper, you deserve a government that stands for you.”

In Lethbridge, and again at a rally in the Calgary-North East riding Thursday evening, Notley took aim at Kenney, who has pushed for privatizing some aspects of health care such as laundry services.

“He wants to privatize large parts of our health-care system,” Notley told a crowd of cheering supporters and candidates in Calgary.

“With an aging population, you can bet that that is going to hurt. And why? Why does he want to hurt people with these cuts? To pay for reckless corporate tax giveaways.”

At the Calgary rally, Notley described Kenney as “dithering” on the Springbank dam project and said the UCP leader wants to freeze education funding.

“With 15,000 more kids entering school every year, that is going to hurt,” Notley said.

On pipelines, Notley told the crowd that: “when times were their toughest, I stood up and I compelled the federal government to step up.

“Mr. Kenney thinks that the way to get a pipeline built is by yelling at the rest of Canada and building a firewall, but here’s the thing: you don’t build pipelines through firewalls,” Notley said. “Mark my words: this pipeline will be built and we are going to be the ones to get it done.”

The NDP leader also brought up the topic of racism and referred to the UCP losing a “star candidate” earlier this week.

“The bottom line is this: racism and hate have no place in today’s Alberta and they have absolutely no place in our legislature,” Notley said.

In a message directed at Albertans who have voted Conservative in the past, Notley positioned the NDP as the “moderate mainstream of today’s Alberta.”

At another rally Thursday evening, Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel took aim at both Notley and Kenney, describing the NDP as a “far left” party and the UCP as a “far right” party. Mandel positioned the Alberta Party as a “centrist party that cares about people and business.”

“They try to represent something that they’re not,” he said of the other two parties. “We’re the only one not misrepresenting, because we are who we are. We’re not something from the right or something from the left; we’re an amalgam of people who want to see this province move forward in an effective and creative way.”

At her announcement in Lethbridge, Notley said more long-term health-care beds will free up spaces in acute-care hospitals that are now too often occupied by seniors.

The groups Friends of Medicare and Public Interest Alberta said that investment is welcome news but questioned how many of those beds would be privately or publicly operated, adding they much prefer the latter.

“It is disappointing that the NDP’s announcement seems to leave the door open to for-profit corporations providing this care, which means more public money being wasted on corporate profits,” said Public Interest Alberta executive director Joel French, who added 1,700 of the previously created 2,000 beds are privately run.

Also on Thursday, Liberal Leader David Khan unveiled an Indigenous policy platform his government would pursue to make juries, the legislature and school curricula more representative of First Nations.

“The time for rhetoric is over and the time for reconciliation is now . . . we must move beyond just apologies toward real healing and real co-operation,” said Khan, who has worked with First Nations as a lawyer.

The voice of the first people is not only in print, media or communications that are discernible by mainstream measurements. The voice of the first people is the land. The voice of the first people is the water. The voice of the first people stretches centuries back to our creation stories. It is a voice that resounds with power and strength on this land.

When Jody Wilson Raybould evoked the words of the true Indigenous laws of this land, these words resonated into the cosmos. Initial reactions from Mainstream media were the incredulity at what Wilson Raybould shared with the justice committee. Very quickly, global media sources were quoting this event.

An Indigenous woman, originally from the west coastal people was delivering in the Canadian House of Commons a lesson on what the “rule of law” actually meant. She did not get this understanding from her undergrad or degree from mainstream institutions. Jody Wilson Raybould reminded the world and herself that the original laws and teachings of her own people are instilled within her own blood memory and DNA.

Global media focused on the past corruption of a global corporate actor, the placement of deferred prosecution agreement, or remediation agreement in an omnibus bill, and the unwillingness of a Liberal cabinet to lose footing or seats in the province of Quebec.

The corruption of a Liberal or Conservative government is not something new to the First Nations or people like Jody Wilson Raybould have had to encounter. In 2012, the Conservative sitting federal government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper put forth an omnibus bill where they attacked the protection of waters and also, hidden in this legislation was also an amendment to land surrenders or designations on reserve. But Harper’s Bill C-38 had one positive outcome. It united the indigenous people in Canada and launched the IdleNoMore movement.

Similarly, with Jody Wilson Raybould, there is an “indigenous take” on her testimony. The most important factor was not the fact that the Liberals were guilty of some serious corporate cronyism. The most important factor was that after 152 years, a sitting member of the white Canadian parliament had not followed the rule of whiteman made law. Jody Wilson Raybould quoted her own experiential learning, the laws of the Big House and her position as a matriarch and truth-teller.

This action by Jody Wilson Raybould was heard, not only by the Indigenous people throughout this land called Canada; the land, itself, heard her words. Our ancestors are in this land. The relationship between the Indigenous and the land is absolute. Repeated attempts to explain the spiritual significance and cosmic connection that the original people have in this territory falls deafly on mainstream ears.

The Indigenous “anthropomorphize” tangible objects. Mainstream sees a tree and a specific land area in monetary terms. The Indigenous sees the same tree, but they see the places where our people took shade or sheltered. The Indigenous know the place name and the stories of this place and the power that still lives. The difference in our memories and the difference in our history, means the application of law will be different for the Indigenous and the non-native who are guests in this land.

This is the conflict between Mainstream and the Indigenous. This is why there can be no reconciliation. For the Indigenous to reconcile, they have the option of assimilating into the larger society and becoming “equal” to the non-native so that they can finally take up their roles as “Canadians”. The indigenous must come to see the tree as just a tree with a price tag or a value attached.

If the Indigenous cannot see this tree like a commodity, they have a second option. This option is to maintain their Indigenous teachings and understanding and to go forward until the larger society begins to reconcile their view with our understanding.

Jody Wilson Raybould has opened this doorway. Only after the initial fray, mainstream media began to write that Jody’s words returned her to her teachings as a Kwakwaka’wakw person.

Therefore the heart of democracy and the noble action Jody Wilson Raybould took in not acquiescing to party pressure came from who she is as a person. Integrity cannot be taught. Integrity must come from within and must be supported by the systems that exist around a person.

In the Indigenous systems, there is respect for all life, because the Indigenous understand the Creator, the Great Mystery has made all things. There is no hierarchy of animals, rocks or water, there is only existence and co-existence. In this system, if you value or respect the land, the waters, the animals, the plants and all things, you have innate respect before any other measurable.

Where is the integrity in the non-native system? With technology, humans separate themselves from each other and from the natural world. With this separation, there is no connection, no reminder and no awe for the wonders of this world. Within the mainstream system, there are false examples of integrity like returning a lost wallet. If there is money involved, and money is measured, then there is integrity in this action.

When the newcomers to this land begin to operate in a system of interconnected understanding, they too will begin to understand what integrity means. It is standing at the edge of headwaters, looking at the mountains and seeing a line of shadowed ancestors, praying and resting in the foothills. It is in seeing a grizzly bear show its young how to push over trees in an area that has always been where the grizzlies go to dance. It is returning to the places where salmon swim against the current to reach their destination with determination and glory. It is in the comforting winds that gently rock babies to sleep in their swings. All these things do not cost and have no “apparent” monetary value. The value is in the eternal song of life that continues because of the respect, the integrity and the love each part shares for the other. It is in the Indigenous law of this land.",The original laws and teachings of this land are instilled in our blood memory and DNA,Two Row Times,https://tworowtimes.com/columns/mu-wiyan-iuch/the-original-laws-and-teachings-of-this-land-are-instilled-in-our-blood-memory-and-dna/

FCP Leader Derek ...","Two days after the election call, the Freedom Conservative Party announced its first platform promise, declaring its commitment to limit federal powers over Alberta — or consider separating from Canada.

FCP Leader Derek Fildebrandt, MLA for Strathmore-Brooks, unveiled strategies to “end inequality” and “protect hard-working Albertans from Ottawa.” If elected, the party would lobby Ottawa to end equalization and grant the province independent rights over immigration, tax collection, employment insurance, pensions and justice, in regards to policing.

Fildebrandt said if the federal government rejects Alberta’s “rightful demands for equality,” then the party would hold a referendum on independence.

“The Freedom Conservative Party, in this election, is going to give Albertans an option unlike they have ever seen, unlike any other parties in this election,” he said Thursday at Bridgeland Community Park in the city’s northeast. A handful of FCP candidates joined him in support.

Fildebrandt formed the FCP last June after leaving the United Conservative Party, following a series of controversies.

In an election many see as a two-horse race between the New Democratic Party and United Conservative Party, the FCP is considered one of a handful of outliers fighting for attention and seats.

Also in the running is right-leaning Alberta Advantage Party, led by Marilyn Burns. It was formed by members of the Wildrose party who were dissatisfied with that party’s 2017 merger with the Progressive Conservatives to form the UCP. The AAP also promises lower taxes and greater autonomy from Ottawa.

The AAP and FCP hope to each put forward about 30 candidates, however Fildebrandt’s conclave is focused on running only in ridings where the NDP is not considered competitive. In contrast, the Green Party of Alberta has 19 candidates, so far, according to its website.

Political scientist Bruce Foster, who teaches at Mount Royal University, said the AAP and Green Party have “no chance” in winning seats. He said small parties are at a grave disadvantage because they don’t have enough resources, such as money and staff, and are generally neglected by the media.

“The system itself squeezes out fringe parties,” said Foster, adding people are more likely to vote for the “big machine” they most closely align with rather than a smaller counterpart.

Mount Royal political scientist Lori Williams agreed.

“There is something different that is happening in this election. It is much more a two-party race,” she said. “We don’t usually see two parties in contention and the rest of them, at least at this stage, looking completely out of contention.”

But Williams said the FCP could have a bigger effect than previously expected.

“A week ago, maybe a week and a half ago, I would have dismissed FCP as a fringe party, but it looks like they might actually be in play now,” said Williams.

She said Fildebrandt’s close ties with former UCP leadership hopeful Brian Jean and the recent kamikaze-candidate scandal plaguing Kenney and his staff could make the FCP a viable alternative for conservative voters in the province.

“So it’s now something that has become an election issue,” said Williams. “People are thinking about it, people are wondering, do I continue? Do I hold my nose and win government? Or do I stand up for my principles?”

She added Fildebrandt’s name recognition and former Wildrose ties could work to his advantage.

Fildebrandt said he’s confident in his team.

Derek Fildebrandt said that policy is part of the FCP plan to fundamentally change Alberta's relationship with the federal government.

""Only the Freedom Conservative Party is dedicated to breaking the grip of Ottawa and putting Alberta first,"" he said as he unveiled the first plank of his party's platform at the Bridgeland Community Association in northeast Calgary.

Fildebrandt also promised the FCP would demand that Alberta be allowed to collect its own taxes, control policing in the province and control immigration.

""I am tired of Alberta being treated as a second-class colony,"" he said, promising that if major changes don't happen soon, his party would also hold a referendum independence for Alberta.

He summed up his first policy announcement as, ""More Alberta, less Ottawa.""

The FCP bills itself as ""a coalition of grassroots conservatives, libertarians and Alberta patriots.""

Fildebrandt says that means the party is against ""big government socialism"" as well as ""big business corporate welfare.""

""Instead, we embrace a brave new future for Alberta,"" he said.

""We embrace a conservatism that isn't just for small government in business and your wallet, but small government in every part of everyone's life. Our fundamental philosophy is that if you are not hurting anybody else, it's not the government's bloody business.""

Fildebrandt, the sitting MLA for Strathmore-Brooks, said Wednesday that he expects to field roughly 30 candidates in the election, which is set for April 16.

He says the party has been careful to field candidates only in ridings where the NDP has very little chance of winning so that the UCP and FCP don't split the vote.

Fildebrandt also threw barbs at UCP Leader Jason Kenney over the co-called kamikaze affair — allegations that Jeff Callaway's campaign for the UCP leadership was little more than a collaborative effort with Kenney's team to attack their mutual opponent, Brian Jean.

Fildebrandt said politicians are humans and make mistakes and should admit them, yet Kenney has blamed everyone but himself for the controversy.

Fildebrandt first won his seat in the Legislature in 2015 as a member of the now-defunct Wildrose Party.

Alberta's rights to self-govern are top of mind, Fildebrandt said, alluding to Quebec's separation movement.

Freedom Conservatives would, he said, offer voters the chance to decide ""if they want to continue the relationship with Ottawa,"" should the federal government not ""accept reasonable demands for equality for Alberta within Canada.""

""We want to be treated the same as… Quebec, to have control of our own immigration, our own tax collection, our own police force, our own pension and EI — and the complete end of equalization,"" Fildebrandt said.

The provincial election was announced Monday, and the other main contenders — the NDP, United Conservative Party, Alberta Party and Alberta Liberals — all held events to discuss their messages for the race.

'Not running paper candidates'

The Freedom Conservatives were missing from the first day of announcements. Instead, the party has an event scheduled for Thursday in Calgary to discuss platform points.

""We're not running paper candidates everywhere just to have a number of candidates,"" Fildebrandt said Wednesday. ""We want to have people running where we believe they can actually win.""

The party has strategically placed candidates in ridings where it believes the NDP are less likely to win a seat, he said.

Candidates will promise to answer to their constituents, he said, and not ""other politicians,"" as he accused UCP candidates of doing.

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third-largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

READ MORE: Oil producers want to see policies that will double industry’s growth in Alberta election

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

WATCH: UCP leads NDP ahead of 2019 Alberta election

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 per cent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 per cent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

READ MORE: Notley kicks off election Day 2 with vow to double Alberta’s oil and gas incentives

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

Scandal brewing

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jeff Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

READ MORE: Pipeline politics to affect economy, two elections in 2019, economists say

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University.

Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

We only need to look at countries where press freedom is absent or political dissent is illegal to know how important the responsibility of the media and opposition is to holding governments accountable.

That said, opposition parties who want to form government by claiming revulsion at alleged government improprieties are often disappointed at election time. While it is frequently suggested that governments defeat themselves, opposition parties seeking to take over need a positive message about intent and priorities to make the transition into government. The unusual policy-free “For the People” victory of the Doug Ford Conservatives in Ontario in 2018 – and the rapidly collapsing approval levels for that administration – bodes ill for any party hoping to inherit the keys to the store without earning the privilege. Both Justin Trudeau in 2015 and Stephen Harper in 2006, 2008 and 2011 had policy proposals and clear priorities for which to seek public support.

Canadian Conservatives, and those Canadians of other or no affiliation searching for alternatives this October, have the right to expect a substantive platform and set of priorities from the Conservatives.

Canadian Conservatives … have the right to expect a substantive platform and set of priorities from (their party).

There are different paths Conservatives can take. One is the path seeking to mine as much dissatisfaction and animus as possible by blindly opposing every Liberal policy from immigration to pipelines, carbon taxes and rebates, or defence and foreign policy.

The other is to offer Canadians a robust and positive conservatism, replete with fresh ideas, nation and economy-building proposals and clear and compelling priorities – none of which would weaken Conservative principles of “smarter as opposed to larger” government; fair as opposed to excessive taxation; and equality of opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome.

The Century Initiative Foundation in Canada, a distinguished mix of business, academic, volunteer sector and representative individuals, has a series of proposals for how Canada can achieve a population of 100 million people by 2100. It is nation-building at its best. If we want more clout at trade and environmental negotiations, in international forums and with enhanced strategic and defence capacity that facilitates a more pronounced independence for Canada, these are ideas Conservatives should consider and find a way to offer.

Fresh concepts on how to reduce poverty without growing the bureaucracies that manage existing, poverty-preserving welfare programs, would also be welcome. There is no contradiction within mainstream Conservative or Canadian mindsets between humane and effective government and reducing inefficiencies and burgeoning administrative overheads. Replacing the bureaucracy of the Indian Act (unbecoming to Canada and disrespectful to First Nations), is a classic Conservative project based on building trust, shared revenues and genuine respect for First Nations. And it could be incorporated into an economic growth plan for Canada.

Nor is there any reason Canadian Conservatives need to avoid frank discussion on foreign and defence policy. While much of both policies are, for good reason, non-partisan in substance, there is room for Conservative innovation on procurement, an Arctic strategy, relations with China and other authoritarian partners, and doubling the size of our Navy and Air Force over a reasonable period of time. And, if carbon taxes, deemed by some Conservatives as the devil’s spawn, are not the answer, neither is not having a policy that does not curb consumption of fossil fuels. It is not in the country’s or party’s interest.

The lure of dog whistle politics (decrying asylum seekers arriving through non-official border entries and knowing this will attract the anti-immigration and anti-diversity vote; or declining to support statutory reform of the Senate, while hoping not to get caught campaigning for the “all partisan all the time” Senate of yore) may work for a moment in time. But the conservatism of anger, resentment, turning back the clock, ignoring legitimate constitutional and self-government rights of First Nations, have rarely, in Canadian politics, won elections.

The negative approach not only underestimates the Canadian voter but affords the incumbent government and other parties strategic and tactical options that a more positive and constructive Conservative approach might supercede.

Matthews is a veteran of Harper-era ...,"Within a day of the official launch of the 2019 Alberta election, the Alberta NDP had already dropped a nasty negative ad.

The ad attacked United Conservative Party (UCP) leader Jason Kenney for comments he made 20 years ago about a campaign he was involved in 30 years ago, in which he challenged the idea that same-sex couples ought to have the rights as couple of the opposite sex.

The ad begins with Kenny clearly boasting about his part in helping to overturn “the first gay spousal law in North America.” (The issue involved a law in San Francisco.)

Then there’s a swell of the kind of ominous tones you hear in any negative ad as a female voice intones that “Kenney stopped dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex spouses in hospital.”

And then, the voice actor does what she gets paid to do: Feign a tone of horrified incredulity as she asks: “Is this a premier?”

As attack ads go, it’s a pretty good punch.

“In order for a so-called negative ad to work, it has to have a centre of truth. It has have an essential truth,” said Warren Kinsella, the author, political commentator, and president of the Toronto-based consultancy The Daisy Group.

Kinsella is a veteran of Liberal election war rooms that supported the campaigns of Dalton McGuinty in Ontario and Jean Chretien at the federal level.

That “essential truth”, in this case, is that Kenney is mean or at least can be mean to his opponents. The cheeky smile that appears on Kenney’s face in that NDP ad after he boasts about defeating a same-sex law is the “killer” part of that ad where that “essential truth” is revealed. Kinsella said he expects the ad to take some of the starch out of the UCP numbers.

But then the NDP, whether provincially or federally, has developed a reputation over the last couple of decades as a party that is definitely not afraid of throwing a punch — and the harder they can hit, the better.

“It’s true. That’s their reputation. They’re good at it,” said Kinsella.

In the 2008 federal election, the NDP whipped up one of the all-time nasty attack ads. It was in French for Quebec voters, aimed at Stephen Harper’s Conservatives.

Among other things, the ad warned that a vote for the Conservatives was a vote for war — as battalions of animated soldiers came marching towards the viewers while images of Harper and George W. Bush floated at the top of the screen.

WATCH: The 2008 NDP election ad attacking the Conservatives

“It was one of the harshest ads to be run in Canadian political history,” said Dennis Matthews, a vice-president at the Toronto-based public affairs firm Enterprise Canada.

Matthews is a veteran of Harper-era campaign war rooms and helped design and write some of the advertising and marketing material that powered some of Harper’s successful election campaigns. He was in the Conservative war room in 2008 when that NDP ad dropped.

“It was over the top, but it really hammered the Conservative vote in Quebec,” Matthews said.

When asked what they don’t like about politics, voters and even politicians themselves often say they don’t like all the negativity, particularly at election time when there’s a plethora of attack ads often from all parties.

But here’s the thing: When it comes to the chance to hold on to or seize power, political parties like the Alberta NDP and many others go negative because going negative works.

“People pay more attention to those ads,” Kinsella said.

“And negative ads do bring down the support of your opponent,” Matthews said.

WATCH: Kenney says NDP attacks on him are “desperate”

Negative ads are not designed to turn a supporter from one party to a supporter of another party. Instead, they are all about damaging an opponent’s ability to recruit volunteers, fundraise and, most of all, to suppress an opponent’s voter turnout.

The most important thing political parties do leading up to and during a campaign is identify their supporters and then get those supporters to the polls. A strong negative attack ad could, in the case at hand, get potential UCP supporters doubting their commitment to voting.

No one expects a UCP supporter to turn into an NDP supporter. But, there are UCP supporters who may have wished that Brian Jean beat Kenney for the UCP leadership 18 months ago and a good negative campaign against Kenney could get that kind of supporter to stay at home on polling day.

Negative ads are also intended to sap morale of the opposing campaign.

The Alberta NDP has been running an online campaign attacking Kenney for weeks now, mostly through a website, trying to help accomplish all of these objectives.

Kenney has vowed that his party’s political messaging will be positive and will avoid personal attacks. In that way, it’s a vow very similar to the one Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made for the upcoming 2019 federal election.

It is time for change. Positive change that creates good jobs, brings common sense to government, and builds an Alberta that's strong and free. #ableg #abstrongandfree pic.twitter.com/AK09sL7Tci — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) March 19, 2019

But it’s a vow that’s easy to keep when you are, as Kenney is, ahead in the polls by a long shot. It gets a little tougher when the numbers for you and your party start to fall.

“When the numbers start to change, watch out, here’s comes Willie Horton,” Kinsella said, referring to one of the most devastating and infamous attack ads ever, released by supporters of George H.W. Bush attacking challenger Michael Dukakis for being soft on crime.

The ad blamed Dukakis, a state governor, for allowing Horton, a convicted killer serving a life sentence, to get a weekend furlough and then commit rape, assault and armed robbery. The ad was condemned as racist, but it had a devastating effect on Dukakis, who was soundly defeated by Bush.

But negative ads or negative political messaging can also have serious backlash effects.

Federal Liberals were widely ridiculed, for example, when they tried to scare voters in the 2006 federal election campaign with an ad warning about how, if Harper won, we would see an increase in “military presence in our cities. Canadian cities. Soldiers with guns.”

This ad, part of a series of “scary Harper” ads, started off with some scary drumbeats, followed by a grainy black-and-white image of Harper.

But federal Liberals benefited from an attack gone wrong back in 1993 when the Progressive Conservatives ran an ad that some — including some conservatives — saw as mocking Jean Chrétien for his crooked way of speaking, a result of Bell’s palsy Chretien had as a child.

This attack ad, mild by today’s standards, was widely credited for helping to turn the tide against Kim Campbell and in favour of Chretien.

Perhaps one of the most entertaining attacks ads came in the 2015 election when the NDP candidate in the Toronto riding of St. Paul’s, author Noah Richler, decided to put together a video attacking Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. Richler would lose to Liberal Carolyn Bennett and would later chronicle the creation of that ad in his book The Candidate: Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.

But it was an ad that gave the the NDP war room trying to support the national campaign of Thomas Mulcair fits even if it delighted political pundits.

Many of the New Democrats in Mulcair’s war room in 2015 ended up in Alberta, after Notley won power, and are still there. That’s because in Canadian political circles, each major party borrows heavily from and builds on earlier campaigns at all levels.

Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats all tend to draw from the same group of pollsters, advisors, operatives and war room generals which means that tactics and strategy you might see from one party in a federal election years ago be put to use in a provincial election the same party is contesting now.","ANALYSIS: In Alberta and elsewhere, New Democrats have mastered the art of the negative election ad",Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5081715/new-democrats-negative-campaign-ads/

Lisa Raitt, Conservative ...","Are asylum seekers crossing illegally into Canada, or simply irregularly? Tonight, on the finale of season two of TVO’s Political Blind Date, a Conservative and a Liberal stand on the Canadian-American border, and on opposing sides of this question.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, about the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which outlines what each country is obligated to do with asylum seekers arriving in each country.

Political Blind Date sets up two opposing politicians on a “date” to discuss some of the most divisive and pressing issues facing Canada. The topic of asylum seekers has become more prevalent with an increase in refugees crossing Canada’s southern border due to the hostile attitude toward immigrants percolating in the U.S. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, Chair of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee, thinks more resources should go to the processing of refugee claims. Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus, shadow minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, believes refugees shouldn’t be given more aid if they’re crossing illegally.

The two meet first for a coffee at Le Cafe in Hemmingford, Quebec. When Paul-Hus says that he might delve into French if English is insufficient for him to explain an idea, Oliphant mentions that his husband is from Rimouski. “When we’re arguing, he argues in French and I argue in English,” Oliphant says. He gestures across the table between him and Paul-Hus, and they both laugh. But will they end up arguing? Yes. Almost immediately. Oliphant takes issue with Paul-Hus describing asylum seekers’ border crossing as “illegal.” Using himself as an example, he explains that if he went into the U.S. and then came back to Canada at an “irregular border-crossing,” it would be illegal.

On the season two finale of Political Blind Date, Liberal MP Rob Oliphant and Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus debate the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement. ( TVO )

But, he said, “it is very clear in Canadian law and international law, that if you seek asylum on the other side, it’s not illegal.” To Paul-Hus, this is a “loophole” in the rules. He points out that the refugees are crossing from the U.S., and should have applied for refugee status there instead of Canada.

Article Continued Below

According to the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the country where they first arrive. Conservatives want to change the agreement with the U.S. to allow Canada to send those claiming refugee status after crossing at irregular locations back to the U.S.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, while standing at the north side of Roxham Road, the Quebec location where the majority of border crossings have happened over the last two years for irregular asylum claimants.

Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades ...,"By James Cullingham

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 percent in an Ipsos/Global News ...","CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s battered oil industry is rooting for the opposition in next month’s election in energy heartland Alberta, investors said on Wednesday, but a brewing scandal involving the party’s leader could derail its hopes of an easy victory.

FILE PHOTO: An oil pump jack pumps oil in a field near Calgary, Alberta, Canada, July 21, 2014. REUTERS/Todd Korol/File Photo

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 percent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 percent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

SCANDAL BREWING

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jason Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University. Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

“A week ago, I would not have thought there was much of a path to victory for the NDP,” he said. “Now I think there’s a slim path, which is better than none.”","Ahead of Alberta vote, Canada's oil industry roots for the opposition",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/idCAKCN1R12T0-OCABS

The United Conservative Party is threatening to pull Alberta out of Canada’s equalization deal, while the NDP is promising more long-term care beds.

Premier Rachel Notley spent the day in Lethbridge, where she promised funding for 2,000 more long-term care beds to try and relieve wait times and alleviate the stress on emergency rooms.

“For the last four years, we've built up our hospitals and our long-term care homes,” said Notley. “As your premier, I will continue fighting for patients and their providers. I will continue fighting for your loved ones.”

UCP Leader Jason Kenney made a stop in Calgary, where he promised a tougher stance against Ottawa, British Columbia, and anyone else who gets in the way of Alberta’s energy sector.

“We will use the ""turn off the taps"" legislation,” said Kenney. “We will demand a fair deal for Alberta in Canada.”

Kenney also suggested that if Ottawa doesn’t shoot down Bill C-69 and ensure that progress is made on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion by the fall of 2021, he will hold and Alberta-wide referendum on opting out of equalization payments.

The locations for both party leaders may show that southern Alberta is a target for both campaigns according to one political expert—and where they go next could indicate where the parties are looking to protect or steal votes.

“In the first couple days of this campaign, everybody is promise-happy,” said Bob Murray, a local political analyst. “Where they're campaigning is gonna tell us a lot more than what we're gonna know right now about the perceptions of where the numbers might be adjusting and where those battleground areas will emerge.”

The election will be held on April 16.

Tuesday’s election call came a few days after the Star and other outlets obtained a document leak that showed UCP Leader Jason Kenney’s staff oversaw critical aspects of Jeff Callaway’s opposing campaign in the 2017 party leadership race, such as his communications strategy, attack ads, and when he’d drop out of the race. The RCMP and Alberta’s election commissioner are currently investigating allegations related to the 2017 leadership race.

The ongoing probe has experts wondering how much it will affect voters’ decisions at the ballot box on April 16. Early polls favoured the UCP and experts aren’t sure to what extent the “kamikaze” candidate story will affect the party’s chances. Star Calgary spoke to Calgarians on their lunch breaks Wednesday and Thursday to see whether it’ll play a part in their decision. For many voters who were already planning on supporting the NDP, this latest story only confirms the feelings they said they already had about Kenney.

Karen Chu said she doesn’t trust Kenney, but added that has more to do with her concerns around alleged white supremacist and racist views in his party. “I was talking to a friend this morning about how Alberta is a conservative province. I know that. But if a conservative party was elected, I’ve never had concerns about whether the leader would do a good job, would be a professional. But now I’m actually concerned and worried,” Chu said.

Chu’s friend, Matt Leadbeater agreed, having only just heard about the kamikaze story. Leadbeater said he thinks if he was on the fence about who to vote for April 16, this would push him away from the UCP. He also said Kenney’s long political career makes him trust the conservative leader less than other candidates coming to politics from other lines of work. “He’s a politician, that’s his job. So it would not surprise me that he’s a little bit sneaky or anything,” Leadbeater said. Maria Calder said that while following Alberta’s parties leading up to this week, she’s felt irritated and distrustful of Kenney to the point she’s fed up hearing about him and seeing him in the media.

“I don’t have a lot of respect for him and the party, so it was just one more thing that annoyed me,” Calder said. “It almost makes me change the channel when I hear him or when they start talking about the (kamikaze campaign) story. I don’t want to hear about it.” But to some voters, it’s less important than Alberta’s other election issues.

“I think it’s a common thing that happens in politics all the time,” said Coltart, who voted for the Progressive Conservatives in 2015 and plans to vote for the UCP, a party he believes will do more to aid the province’s oil and gas industry. “There’s definitely more important issues. Like pipelines and getting the oil industry back on track in Canada. There’s a million different things that we should be talking about. Like health care, definitely. I know the NDP promised a million different things with health care and those didn’t come to fruition.” Some conservative voters felt unsure about continuing to support the UCP, but hadn’t decided if it was enough to make them vote for any other party. Others, like Ryan Faulkner, said even after learning of this story, he figures he’ll continue to vote conservative this election, as he always has.

He said he believes Kenney and NDP Leader Rachel Notley are both good people. Gurmu said he leans conservative, but thinks Notley and the NDP government have done a good job. He only just learned about the kamikaze leadership campaign story earlier this week, but Gurmu said his vote will hinge partially on how the investigation into Kenney’s ties to the Callaway campaign continues in the next month.

Premier Rachel Notley has not yet set a date for the election, but Alberta law states it must be held between March 1 and May 31.

Voters will be asked to cast their ballots at a time of controversial government intervention in Alberta’s oil market that has drawn support from some major producers and fierce criticism from others.

The NDP stunned many political commentators when it swept to power in Alberta in 2015 in the midst of the global oil price crash, ending 44 years of conservative rule in the province.

Since then Notley’s government has grappled with shrinking capital investment in the province’s energy sector and persistent budget deficits, and is focused on convincing voters an economic recovery is underway.

“We remain on track to balance the budget by 2023, with the best balance sheet in the country. We are doing this without making reckless cuts to the services all Albertans rely on,” the government said in a speech to the legislature delivered by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Lois Mitchell.

Effective Jan. 1, the Alberta government mandated oil production cuts to help relieve congestion on export pipelines that last year led to a glut of crude building up in storage and the price of Canadian barrels plummeting to record lows.

The move threw a lifeline to oil producers selling their barrels at a loss but has been harshly criticized by integrated companies with refining operations like Suncor Energy and Husky Energy that were benefiting from cheap crude.

On Friday Imperial Oil delayed a C$2.6 billion oil sands project in northern Alberta and laid the blame squarely on the uncertainty generated by government intervention in the market.

The provincial government also plans to lease 4,400 rail cars to transport crude while waiting for long-delayed export pipelines to be built, even though stronger oil prices as a result of curtailments mean rail transportation is no longer economic.

Opposition leader Jason Kenney has promised to rip up those rail contracts if the UCP wins the election, adding to uncertainty in the oil industry.

Notley said her government will continue to manage curtailments and the differential between Canadian and U.S. crude slowly and carefully.

“This is not the long-term solution...Long-term we need more pipelines and more value added in Alberta,” she told a news conference.",Canada's Alberta kicks off final legislature session before election,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKCN1QZ2KG-OCABS

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The western Canadian province of Alberta will hold an election on April 16, kick-starting a contest that many polls suggest will result in a change of government in the country's oil-producing heartland as it struggles with a sluggish economy.

Premier Rachel Notley's left-leaning New Democratic Party won a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015, ending 44 years of conservative rule, but inherited a provincial economy rocked by the collapse of global oil prices.

Notley was initially an ally of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and backed his attempts to please the oil industry and environmentalists by championing export pipelines while also introducing carbon pricing.

The relationship soured last year over efforts to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, prompting Notley to pull her support for Trudeau's carbon plan. Ottawa bought the pipeline, whose expansion remains delayed.

The opposition has criticized Notley for her alliance with Trudeau, who is viewed by some Albertans as out of touch with the oil industry's woes.

Alberta's government has grappled with weak oil prices, persistent budget deficits and a dearth of new export pipelines that left the landlocked province's crude building up in storage, resulting in the discount on Canadian heavy crude blowing out to record levels last year.

As a last resort, Alberta took the controversial step of curtailing oil production to help prop up prices and investing in railcars to move more crude to market, a move that earned approval from some cash-strapped producers in the province's dominant oil industry, and outrage from critics.

Announcing the date of the election in the oil industry's corporate hub Calgary on Tuesday, Notley emphasized her government's commitment to health and education and its efforts to revitalize Alberta's economy.

""Since the oil price collapsed I know these last few years have been scary for a lot of families and I have worked day and night with my team to fight this recession and bring our economy back,"" she told supporters.

Opinion polls suggest Notley could be the first one-term premier in Alberta's history, and cede power to opposition leader Jason Kenney of the United Conservative Party, a former top federal cabinet minister.

The UCP have been consistently ahead in the polls since last year. An Ipsos/Global News poll on Tuesday said 53 percent of Albertans would vote for the UCP if an election were held today, versus 35 percent for the NDP.

Notley criticized Kenney for recent allegations that he was involved in an ethically dubious campaign to discredit a rival in the UCP leadership contest in 2017.

Kenney has denied any wrongdoing, but some political analysts say the scandal will dog his party's election bid.

""If you add up the number of actual (UCP) party members to come out and publicly speak against Jason Kenney, this is significant,"" said Lori Williams, a political science professor at Calgary's Mount Royal University. ""But is it going to be enough to shift undecided voters? That remains to be seen.""

In light of the allegations, Notley and the NDP are likely to make issues of integrity, equality and trust a central part of their campaign, Williams said.

Kenney brushed off the scandal, saying his party would be focused on jobs, the economy and getting pipelines built.

""Are you better off than you were four years ago? That's the question Albertans will be asking when they choose their new government,"" he told reporters in Edmonton. ""The NDP has to resort to the politics of personal destruction because they cannot defend the worst economic record in modern Alberta history.""

104,Business,2019-03-21T16:41:00.0000000Z,"The Conservative Party of Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dogwood, a B.C. environmental organization, is calling for a deeper examination of SNC-Lavalin's activities in British Columbia and a full inquiry to examine possible ...","Through Elections BC's political donations database, the Star verified that between 2005 and 2013, SNC-Lavalin and the company's chairman of the board at the time, Gwyn Morgan, donated a combined total of $196,157 to the BC Liberal Party.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

CALGARY -- It was back to the future at a United Conservative campaign rally in Calgary where leader Jason Kenney stirred up the crowd by talking about the old national energy program.

Kenney reminded supporters last night that the NEP brought in by former prime minister Pierre Trudeau in 1980 ravaged Alberta's energy industry and economy.

And he says the policies of Alberta's NDP government and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have been doing the same thing.

Kenney says Premier Rachel Notley has sold Alberta out to the federal Liberals and it is time for a bright new day under his leadership.

Notley was also in the key election battleground city, firing up her supporters at her own rally by promising to protect education and health care and promoting her plan to diversify the economy.

Notley says there is no place for right-wing extremism, racism or hate in Alberta, especially in the legislature.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained under pressure over a corruption scandal on Wednesday as a legislator quit his party's caucus and a pre-election budget aimed at swaying key voters appeared to offer too little to stem the tide of negative news.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also provided a little for key groups such as millennial voters who backed Trudeau in droves in Canada's 2015 election.

The decision by a legislator, who had defended a former minister at the center of a political scandal, to quit the ruling Liberal Party and sit as an independent dealt a fresh blow to Trudeau's embattled government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on the then justice minister to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government's chances of re-election. Polls have shown that Trudeau's Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The latest defection overshadowed Tuesday's budget which divided money between a large number of new initiatives and left few Canadians satisfied.

""It's just too broad,"" said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation. ""They wanted to please lots of people and ... when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody, because you spread it too thin.""

Rob Edel, chief investment officer at Nicola Wealth Management, noted the government did not commit to reducing a budget deficit that is much larger than the Liberals promised. This was ""a political rather than an economic decision,"" he said.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada as well as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce complained about the lack of tax reform. But the center-left Liberals may not care too much as their core supporters are progressive thinkers, women and younger voters. Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed budget measures to help first-time home buyers, including allowing people to withdraw up to C$35,000 from a retirement savings account.

But asked on Wednesday how many younger first-time buyers actually had that much money available, he replied ""that will help some people in the middle income range ... not everyone, for sure.""

The main opposition Conservative Party has relentlessly attacked Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin affair and described the budget as a bribe. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has continuously demanded Trudeau's resignation, which some Conservatives privately worry is the wrong approach.

Two strategists with deep ties to the party said given the complexity of the affair, and former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould's statement that no one involved had broken any laws, Canadians would not necessarily agree that Trudeau should quit now.

Conservative over-confidence or missteps could be the Liberals' best hope for reversing their slumping poll numbers, pollster Nick Nanos said.

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers delayed Morneau's budget presentation for an hour.

Conservatives initially drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers and then walked out en masse, a tactic that did not sit well with some Canadians on social media.

Aryan Sadat said on Twitter on Monday night that 10 members of the Calgary North East UCP constituency association “are no longer a part of, and we no longer support the UCP party under Jason Kenney leadership.

“We believe in an all-inclusive political party that will act in the best interest of Albertans,” Sadat, who said he was a representative for the association though not a board member, said in a statement.

“I have terminated my membership with the UCP . . . and will no longer support Jason Kenney.”

The UCP issued a statement saying it “has not received individual resignations from any board members on the Calgary North East constituency association at this time, nor has the local constituency association president.”

The UCP says said Sadat “has no standing with the party or constituency association.”

“Mr. Sadat indicated last summer that he was wanting to run for a UCP nomination,” a statement reads. “He was subsequently informed that it was highly unlikely he’d pass UCP candidate screening due to his past, well-publicized issues,” referring to past criminal charges.

Sadat’s claim comes one week after several board members from the Livingstone-Macleod constituency association resigned.

Sadat, who said he was chosen to speak to the media, said discontent over various issues has been brewing for weeks, including the attraction of white supremacists to the UCP and Kenney’s comments on women being less tactical than men.

Revelations Calgary-Mountain View candidate Caylan Ford allegedly made social media comments in 2017 voicing sympathy for white supremacist thought and the dismissal of other board members’ resignations as sour grapes have also rankled, said Sadat.

But the latest scandal over the 2017 leadership race and Kenney’s refusal to admit fault was a major factor, he added.

“We still believe in presumption of innocence, but you’ve got to step up and take responsibility,” adding the board members who quit are immigrants.

“We didn’t come here to follow these kinds of politics . . . we live in Canada, not America.”

He said the board members still wish the party’s candidate in the riding, Rajan Sawnhey, well, but doesn’t know where she stands on the resignations.

Not all members of the board resigned, he added.

Documents published by CBC Saturday night and later obtained by Postmedia show regular communication between Kenney’s deputy chief of staff and a senior member of leadership candidate Jeff Callaway’s campaign manager, Cameron Davies.

Last month, Alberta’s election commissioner handed a $15,000 penalty to Davies for “obstruction of an investigation.”

The RCMP is investigating, though Kenney has denied all knowledge of a so-called Kamakazi campaign to discredit Jean

Kenney and Callaway have denied any political collusion between their campaigns.

Accusing Mr. Kenney of “a profound absence of integrity,” Premier Notley told more than 1,000 cheering supporters in Old Strathcona’s St. Basil’s Cultural Centre that leaked United Conservative Party documents reported by journalists over the weekend showed Mr. Kenney’s “denials were calm, cool, confident lies. Outright lies.”

“Mr. Kenney owes Albertans a full accounting, not just empty denials,” she stated.

Soon after she accepted the nomination by her son Ethan and addressed the packed meeting, Ms. Notley told reporters “the evidence that has come out and the memos that have come out make it pretty clear that on Friday, when Mr. Kenney … responded very calmly and coolly and confidently to those questions, that he was lying. He was absolutely lying.”

And so, inevitably, the ballot question for many Albertans in the election Ms. Notley will call soon will be, “Can Jason Kenney be trusted?”

Or, perhaps, to spin the same question another way,“What else can he not be trusted about.”

If this is so, it is not the question the UCP’s strategists would have wanted Albertans to be asking themselves.

The documents first reported by the CBC and now in the hands of other news organizations show Mr. Kenney’s victorious 2017 UCP leadership campaign and that of Jeff Callaway, the alleged Kamikaze Candidate, were effectively joined at the hip. The CBC reported that the Kenney crew gave the Callaway camp strategic direction, talking points, speech drafts, videos, and advertisements, “all aimed at undermining Kenney’s main political rival, Brian Jean.”

In her spirited remarks – a campaign speech in all but timing – Premier Notley sharply contrasted her NDP Government’s platform with promises made by Mr. Kenney.

“This election is about who is going to be premier,” she said. “It’s about the kind of province that we leave to our kids. And I say to all of you, that the choice could not be more stark.

“Mr. Kenney believes we are in a race to the bottom. The lowest corporate taxes, the worst environmental regulations, underfunded and overstressed public services, low wages, stressed out families desperately trying to make ends meet. Angry and divisive politics. Two Albertas.

“I believe that we are in a race to the top. I believe that good public schools give our kids the best start in life. I believe that good public health care is the foundation of a decent society. I believe that we can do the hard work of diversification to build an economy that works for everyone. And I believe Alberta is stronger when we stick together and take care of each other.

“Alberta is for all of us. One Alberta. Not just for the few, but for all of us. And, friends, I believe that Alberta’s best days are absolutely ahead, and that the politics of love, and hope, and optimism always trump the politics of anger, division and fear.”

On Mr. Kenney’s plan to cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy, she said: “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.”

On his vow to cut minimum wages for young people: “All work has dignity no matter who does it. There are no second class citizens in Alberta.”

She poked fun at Mr. Kenney’s recent suggestion that male candidates “understand tactical politics a little bit better than women.” She has “an unladylike flair for tactical politics,” she observed, to laughter.

And she mocked the UCP’s vociferous recent demands that she call an election as soon as possible. “We’re getting clearer and clearer insight into why it was that the UCP was so hysterically calling for the writ to be dropped,” she told the reporters after her speech.

Either way, she said, the timing of the election will not be based on the strategic needs of the UCP. “If our election timing was driven by the calendar of investigation into Conservative criminal wrongdoing, then we would never have a campaign.”

Ms. Notley got some support yesterday from an unexpected quarter when former Kenney ally Derek Fildebrandt, a man once touted as the conservative most likely to play the role of the Kamikaze Candidate and now leader of the libertarian Freedom Conservative Party, told the CBC, “not everyone that brings forward an allegation is necessarily credible or telling the truth, but these are now backed up by hard evidence.”

“The documents released last night show clearly that it is not the whistle-blowers that have lied, but Jason Kenney,” he stated.

112,Business,2019-03-19T21:01:00.0000000Z,While Canada joins the ranks of countries like China ... Carbon pricing will be a core election issue and federal Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer is calling 2019 the “year of the carbon tax.” While such punchy messaging has certainly tested ...,"At the historic climate talks in Paris in 2015, countries agreed that large-scale transformation is required to avoid the worst effects of global temperature rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released last year added more urgency to this message — countries have little more than a decade to keep global warming below 1.5°C.

Carbon pricing is globally recognized as a vital tool to reduce carbon emissions. While Canada joins the ranks of countries like China, Argentina and South Africa in implementing some form of carbon pricing mechanism in 2019, Canada’s federalist system poses a unique set of challenges.

Last month the Ontario government released the details of its carbon pricing plan for big emitters, which looks quite similar to the federal emissions trading system the province adamantly opposes. This was the most recent development from a provincial coalition — made up of the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick — opposed to the federal carbon pricing plan.

While provincial governments have employed a range of strategies to oppose the federal plan, influential industry players like the Canadian Chamber of Commerce have openly supported the federal carbon pricing system. Canadians are now spectators to a surprising matchup, with the federal government and a growing number of industry players facing off against defecting provinces.

It is difficult to imagine a scenario where Canada can meet its Paris Agreement target of reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 without an ambitious and effective carbon pricing mechanism. So how can we make sense of these two seemingly contradictory developments — provincial opposition yet (conditional) industry support for carbon pricing — and how will they affect the future of Canada’s price on carbon?

The federal carbon pollution pricing system became law last summer. The plan consists of two ‘backstops’: a carbon levy and a trading system for large emitters. The carbon levy (also known as a fuel charge) will apply to fossil fuel producers or distributors, starting at $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (C02e). This comes into effect in April 2019 for Saskatchewan, Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick.

The second part of the federal plan — which came into effect on January 1 — is the trading system designed for large industrial emitters (those that emit 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year), known as the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS). In this system, the government sets an emissions threshold for each sector; companies that emit below their annual limit receive credits and those that exceed the limit must either buy credits from other companies or pay the tax (which also starts at $20 per tonne). The OBPS came into effect in January for industry in Ontario, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and partially in Saskatchewan.

A price on carbon is not a silver bullet for Canada’s emissions reductions, nor was it intended to be. Although Canada is slipping further behind on its Paris targets, the federal carbon pricing system will still significantly reduce emissions. Last fall the government estimated that — once the planned provincial and territorial systems take effect and the federal backstop is applied — the system could cut carbon pollution across Canada by 50 to 60 million tonnes in 2022. According to the latest federal projections, with the carbon pricing backstop and other proposed measures, Canada will fall short of its 2030 target by 79 millions tonnes. Without these measures the gap increases to 164 million tonnes.

Applying the federal backstop will be no easy feat. The Ontario and Saskatchewan governments have launched legal cases against the federal government. The first legal case against the federal plan is already underway in Saskatchewan, with Ontario and New Brunswick intervening in favour of Saskatchewan (and British Columbia intervening in favour of the federal government). If the newly elected premier of New Brunswick, Blaine Higgs, makes good on his promise, and if Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party wins the Alberta spring provincial election, they could also file court cases. While Manitoba has yet to take legal action, Premier Brian Pallister unexpectedly announced last October that the government would abandon a planned carbon tax. Together these politicians are forming a new alliance against carbon pricing. Despite some variations in their positions — like Kenney’s indication that he would support the price for heavy emitters but reject the fuel charge — they are rallying together and supporting each other’s legal cases.",Redrawing the battle lines in the fight over Canada’s price on carbon,opencanada.org,https://www.opencanada.org/features/redrawing-the-battle-lines-in-the-fight-over-canadas-price-on-carbon/

It was difficult to hear Finance Minister Bill Morneau when he stood to deliver his budget speech Tuesday. There was too much yelling.

Mr. Morneau was drowned out by chants from across the aisle of “let her speak” and “cover-up” -- a protest against the Liberal-dominated justice committee’s move earlier in the day to shut down hearings into political interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

Before the uproar, the Conservatives used procedural tactics to delay Mr. Morneau’s budget speech by an hour. ""We will not sit idly by while the Liberals destroy the integrity of our justice system,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.

“It’s disappointing that the Conservatives actually don’t care and don’t know what’s in the actual budget,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters.

What’s in the budget is $22.8-billion worth of new measures -- and a peek into the Liberals’ strategy to woo key slices of the electorate in the looming federal election.

Here are some of the highlights:

Ottawa is taking aim at housing affordability with billions of dollars in new incentives, including zero-interest mortgages for first-time buyers and subsidized loans for the construction of tens of thousands of rental units.

The federal government outlined its plans to set up a national pharmacare program, setting aside as much as $1-billion for expensive drugs to treat rare diseases and $35-million for a new national drug agency in the budget.

The budget proposes new measures to help workers upgrade their skills and training through a tax credit and employment insurance.

Ottawa committed $4.7-billion in spending for Indigenous people in Canada, with a promise to end all drinking-water advisories on reserves within two years.

The federal government will commit almost $1.2-billion over five years to address the challenges posed by tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have entered Canada through unauthorized areas along the U.S. border.

The federal government is laying out specific criteria that journalism organizations will have to meet in order to qualify for its $595-million package supporting Canada’s struggling news media.

Ottawa is strengthening its anti-money laundering regime by spending an extra $29-million each year to fund the RCMP and the country’s financial intelligence watchdog.

Ottawa is moving to increase taxation on the stock option gains of some of Canada’s most highly paid executives, a move seen as an attempt to siphon support from the New Democratic Party.

Ottawa is fixing a perceived flaw in its flagship research and development program by lifting a cap on how much income small companies can generate and still qualify for the tax credit.

114,Business,2019-03-20T20:51:00.0000000Z,"Canada’s next budget will look very familiar ... that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they ...","Canada’s next budget will look very familiar, with Justin Trudeau set to spend much of a revenue windfall and continued red ink in his government’s books.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.

None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.

“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.

The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.

The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.

Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.

“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.

Skills Training

Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”

That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”

On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”

The budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government’s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau’s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.

Morneau has also said the government will “make sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism” and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded “pharmacare” program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party’s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he’s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada’s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.

A recent survey conducted by the Angus Reid Institute, a Canadian non-profit independent research organization, showed that most Canadians (60 per cent) think the country’s birthright laws, which stipulate that anyone born in Canada is a citizen, must change.

article continues below

Among the respondents, 64 per cent believe children born to parents who are here on tourist visas should not be granted Canadian citizenship and 24 per cent said they should.

Meanwhile, 55 per cent of respondents said the citizenship should be given to a child if both of the parents are in Canada on work visas, and 40 per cent said kids from parents on student visas should be granted the citizenship.

When asked about the policy overall, 40 per cent said birthright is a good policy and 33 per cent said it is a bad one.

Opinions were also split on how serious this problem is, while 55 per cent said it is a very or quite serious issue and 44 per cent said it is not serious.

“Opponents of changing birthright citizenship rules say doing so is unnecessary because 'birth tourism' – while a phenomenon in some Canadian cities – particularly Richmond in B.C. – is not a serious enough problem nationwide to justify changing Canada’s citizenship rules,” stated the report.

The report added that how concerned people are about birth tourism appears to depend ""heavily"" on their age and political affiliation.

“Generationally, it is older Canadians (over 55 years old) who consider the issue more serious, while those under the age of 55 are evenly divided,” it stated.

""Similarly, two-thirds of Liberal- and NDP-inclined Canadians say that this is not a serious issue, while those considering the CPC (Conservative Party) say it is serious by a ratio of three-to-one.""

Half of Canadians are in favour of an overhaul of the whole system, whereas 28 per cent wanted only specific changes made to birth tourism policies.

A petition hosted by Richmond residents calling for the federal government to end birth tourism collected 11,000 across Canada and was presented in Parliament by Richmond MP Joe Peschisolido last October.

Birthright citizenship has also been a contentious issue in some other countries. The French changed their citizenship laws in 1993 to eliminate birthright citizenship, while Ireland followed suit in 2005 and more recently New Zealand and Australia. In these countries at least one parent must be a citizen for their child to automatically be a citizen.",Two thirds of Canadians support a change on birthright citizenship: Survey,Richmond News,https://www.richmond-news.com/news/two-thirds-of-canadians-support-a-change-on-birthright-citizenship-survey-1.23665592

""They're recognizing that the investment levels are down, they're recognizing that prices are down and that unemployment is up, and yet they're not really taking any meaningful action to support our industry,"" the group’s vice-president of oilsands, Ben Brunnen, said as quoted by CBC.

""The reality is, when we see those indicators all facing down, from an oil and gas perspective, and no recognition from the government of a willingness to support our industry, it's a pretty strong message towards our industry that we're not a priority for this government, and that's disappointing,"" Brunnen added.

The budget includes funds for retraining initiatives that could help with Alberta’s high unemployment problem, but according to CAPP, this is not enough.

Alberta’s oil industry may not be a priority for Ottawa, but it certainly is a priority for everyone running in this year’s elections, scheduled for April 16. The Canadian Press reported this week that oil and gas investments and carbon tax were central topics on the campaign trail.

Incumbent Premier Rachel Notley has promised to increase local oil and gas processing capacity while her rival from the United Conservative party, Jason Kenney, focused on the carbon tax approved by the Notley government.

Notley’s plan aims to reduce the amount of crude oil Alberta exports, therefore reducing the need for transportation capacity including pipelines—nowhere in sight—and oil trains. It should bring in tens of billions of dollars in fresh investments.

Kenney, on the other hand, promised his first order of business would be to repeal the carbon tax that is “punishing” Albertans. This, he said, would save the province more than US$1billion (C$1.4 billion) every year “in one fell swoop.”

Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta were bastions of Conservative support, with students in all three provinces favouring them. Saskatchewan had the ...","Education, poverty and the environment are high on the list of budget priorities for Canadian high school students.

That’s according to the 2019 Student Budget Consultation, an annual survey of Canadian students conducted by CIVIX, a non-partisan charity dedicated to building political engagement among young adults. More than 8,000 high school students took part in this year’s survey, including 45 from the Prince Albert area.

Crime and fiscal responsibility rounded out the list of top five major concerns, but education was by far the one item students wanted to see supported in the federal budget, especially post-secondary education.

CIVIX content director Dan Allan said most students remain confident they’ll be able to find a job when they graduate. However, not all think they’ll be able to pay for the training and education needed to get one.

“Education is one of the results that we see really strongly this year, as an area that students think the government can really help them,” Allan explained. “Whether it’s lowering the cost of school or making debt a more manageable thing, (education) is a top thing which, for the group that’s taking the survey, makes a lot of sense.”

A total of 93 per cent of all students surveyed want the government to either increase spending on post-secondary education, or spend at least the same amount. Almost half of students, 48 per cent, say making student debt more manageable is the best thing the federal government could do to help young Canadians enter the workforce.

Post-secondary costs also topped the list of concerns when CIVIX asked about what steps the federal government should take to assist families. Roughly 35 per cent of students surveyed said the government should make post-secondary education more affordable and accessible. Lowering personal income taxes was the second highest response, with 27 per cent of students picking that option.

Although students are concerned about the need for more accessible education, most don’t want the government to break the bank to do it. Allan said students are very conscious of the Canadian debt, and are worried it‘s getting out of control. In fact, 72 per cent of students surveyed wanted the government to prioritize lowering the federal debt as much as possible.

“One of the things that students have told us is that they’re worried about is the amount of debt the government is taking on, that will have to be paid back when their older,” Allan said. “There is very much a mixture of concerns. They’re hoping the government spends now to help them, as well as wanting the government to be mindful of what they spend.”

While 92 per cent of students said they wanted the federal government to either spend the same or increase spending when it came to the environment, they remain fairly neutral on one of Canada’s most controversial issues: the federal carbon tax. Roughly 47 per cent of students surveyed said they are neutral about the federal government’s plan to implement the tax, with 35 per cent supporting it and 18 per cent opposing.

Students were also uncommitted about federal government support for struggling private media companies, with 49 per cent saying they’re neutral. Another Roughly 28 per cent say they oppose the federal government giving support to media organizations, while 22 per cent agree.

Roughly 400 Saskatchewan students responded to the survey, representing 43 of the province’s schools.

Saskatchewan and Alberta students were the most likely to support Canada’s oil and gas industry, however Saskatchewan students were also the most likely to agree with the statement “wealthy people have a greater financial obligation than everyone else to help those who are in need.”

The federal Conservatives and NDP were the parties Canadian students were most likely to support, with each party getting 31 per cent of the vote. The Liberals were next with 24 per cent of the vote, followed by eight per cent supporting the Green Party and five per cent supporting the People’s Party of Canada.

Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta were bastions of Conservative support, with students in all three provinces favouring them. Saskatchewan had the highest rate, with just under 50 per cent of students agreeing with the Conservatives. Students in B.C. gave by the strongest vote of confidence to the NDP, while students in Ontario and Atlantic Canada were more evenly divided across party lines.

Allan said there’s an assumption that most young people are less conservative than their parents, however this survey shows that’s not true on the prairies.

“It’s not really a surprise,” he said. “We never want to have any preconceived notions about where students are going to fall, but … what we find over the years is that nine times out of 10, students in a given area will vote along the same lines as adults do. We’ve done votes in Saskatchewan, both for the 2016 provincial election and the 2015 federal vote, and the results of students who took part pretty much lined up exactly (with the actual vote) in those cases, so it doesn’t surprise us that the results in these cases pretty much line up.”",Post-secondary costs highlight list of concerns in 2019 CIVIX Student Budget Consultation,Prince Albert Daily Herald,http://paherald.sk.ca/2019/03/18/post-secondary-costs-highlight-list-of-concerns-in-2019-civix-student-budget-consultation/

120,Politics,2019-03-18T23:04:00.0000000Z,"He noted that the clerk is supposed to be “an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference” occurs during the campaign, as part of a new federal watchdog panel, and is also supposed to be ready to help whichever party is elected to form ...","OTTAWA — The SNC-Lavalin affair claimed its fourth resignation Monday as Michael Wernick announced he will step down as the country’s top public servant, having concluded he’s lost the trust of opposition parties.

Opposition parties have been calling for the clerk of the Privy Council’s resignation since he first vehemently rejected allegations that he and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Wernick’s combative testimony to the House of Commons justice committee was denounced as partisan and unbecoming of a senior bureaucrat.

Also on Monday, the Liberals who make up a majority on that committee said publicly that they believe it has done all it can, or should, to investigate the affair.

In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, Wernick said he will retire before this fall’s federal election campaign kicks off. He noted that the clerk is supposed to be “an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference” occurs during the campaign, as part of a new federal watchdog panel, and is also supposed to be ready to help whichever party is elected to form government — two roles he no longer believes he can fulfil.

“It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” Wernick wrote. “I wish to relinquish these roles before the election. It is essential that Canadians continue to see their world-leading public service as non-partisan and there to provide excellent services to Canadians and the governments they elect.”

Wernick, who has served in senior public service roles for nearly 38 years, has been clerk of the Privy Council since 2016, shortly after the Trudeau Liberals assumed office. Government insiders have said he wanted to retire as clerk a year ago but was persuaded to stay on.

Wilson-Raybould has accused Wernick of making “veiled threats” that she’d lose her job as justice minister and attorney general if she didn’t cave in to pressure last fall from Trudeau and his senior staff to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya. She has said they pushed her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Montreal engineering giant, which would have forced the company to pay stiff penalties but let it avoid the risk of a criminal conviction that could threaten its financial viability.

Wernick has denied the accusation and maintained that all concerned acted with the highest standards of integrity.

Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about undue pressure only surfaced publicly after she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle. She resigned from cabinet a month later. Her exit was followed by the departure of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and then the resignation from cabinet of Jane Philpott, who cited loss of confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Wernick’s decision to quit as well proves “this SNC-Lavalin scandal is even bigger than we thought,” said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre.

Trudeau said he intends to name Ian Shugart, currently deputy minister of foreign affairs, to replace Wernick.

On his way into the House of Commons, Trudeau thanked the clerk for his “extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades” and credited his government’s accomplishments “definitely in large part” to Wernick’s leadership of the public service. Trudeau did not respond when asked if he’d sought Wernick’s resignation but his office later said he had not.

Wernick’s letter was released minutes before MPs reconvened for their first question period after a two-week March break, an exchange that proved explosive almost from the get-go.

Opposition members erupted in protest when Trudeau announced he’d appointed former Liberal justice minister Anne McLellan as a special adviser to explore what he called “important questions” about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice, who plays a dual role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

McLellan “will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation, of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,” the prime minister said in a statement. “She will consider whether machinery-of-government or legislative changes may or may not be recommended.”

“Her work will be another important step towards maintaining Canadians’ confidence in their institutions,” he told the Commons.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer mocked the announcement as nothing more than saying “Liberals will investigate Liberals.”

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus ridiculed the idea of a Liberal minister from the era of the sponsorship scandal looking into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which he dubbed “a five-alarm dumpster fire.”

As for Wernick, Angus professed no surprise at his decision to retire.

“I think once we saw how much of an active political player Mr. Wernick was in the SNC scandal, it became impossible for him to carry on his job, which is to have the trust of all parliamentarians on key matters of policy,” he said outside the Commons.

Angus also said Wernick should have “known better” in the way he presented himself before the justice committee, suggesting he was combative, evasive and partisan.

MPs on the committee were taken aback when he prefaced his initial testimony with a diatribe about the deteriorating tenor of political discourse, with incitements to violence that he said made him fear someone will be assassinated during the coming election campaign. He cited the example of a Conservative senator who’d urged truckers in a pipeline protest on Parliament Hill to “roll over every Liberal” in the country.

Wernick engaged in a number of testy exchanges with opposition MPs. In a second appearance, he suggested profane messages he received through the social media “vomitorium” after his first appearance amounted to witness intimidation.

The Liberal-dominated committee is to meet Tuesday to consider opposition demands to recall Wilson-Raybould. She has already testified for nearly four hours but has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation a month later.

But the five Liberals on the justice committee — Edmonton’s Randy Boissonault, Toronto-area MPs Iqra Khalid and Ali Ehassi, B.C.’s Ron McKinnon and Nova Scotia’s Colin Fraser — tipped their hand in an open letter to their fellow Liberal who chairs it, Anthony Housefather.

“The committee has heard from principal witnesses in this matter,” their joint letter says, including Wernick, Wilson-Raybould, and Trudeau’s top aide Gerald Butts. They’ve met for 13 hours of testimony over 11 meetings, it says, and “Canadians can judge for themselves the facts, perspectives and relevant legal principles … As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings.”

McLellan’s work and a separate investigation by the federal ethics commissioner will complete the picture, the letter says.

In the Commons, Trudeau himself likewise argued that the committee has been meeting for five weeks and has heard “all perspectives.” He suggested further inquiry should be left to the federal ethics commissioner.",Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick to quit before election in wake of SNC-Lavalin scandal,Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/national/privy-council-clerk-michael-wernick-retires-in-wake-of-snc-lavalin-scandal

Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers ...,"Seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be doing regularly inside caucus.

A burning question for observers of the SNC-Lavalin affair is whether former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, who publicly opposed actions of their government, will be cut loose from the Liberal caucus. While some, including former deputy prime minister Sheila Copps, urge retribution, others in the party admire these MPs and want them to stay on. Whatever the pair’s political future, my research around party discipline suggests they can expect some rough treatment and career drudgery in the Liberal caucus.

Over the past year, I have had the privilege of interviewing 125 current and former politicians and political staff for a book I am writing about how party discipline has intensified in Canada in recent years. A common theme raised by current and former members of cabinet, party leaders, party whips, private members and political staff is that everyone affiliated with a political party identifies as a member of a team. They form bonds as they go on a journey together to realize common goals. Sparring with adversaries occurs with the confidence that teammates have your back. Members understand they must never be a public distraction for the team leader.

Here are snippets of what some current MPs told me in the months before the SNC-Lavalin story:

In a government caucus, there are those in cabinet, and there are those working hard to join it. Backbenchers know that when they go astray of a certain whipped vote, it doesn’t help their ambitions. We keep saying this is a team sport, but the House of Commons was not set up to be a team sport. — Liberal MP

To rise above the party positions and the leadership’s positions that got you elected is a form of narcissistic conceit. For you to go out against the party line on something, guess what? People aren’t going to vote for you because you’re bucking the party line. It might be once in four years that you can take a different position. — Conservative MP

When I got elected, I naively expected that caucus was the place where MPs could have a free and frank discussion of issues of the day. The biggest single disappointment upon becoming an MP was finding that caucus meetings were structured to begin with the head table sort of providing us with our marching orders. — New Democratic Party MP

Within a political team, there is considerable deference to authority, and individual behaviour conforms to social and institutional norms. Many backbenchers — that is, members who are not part of cabinet — find national caucus meetings to be stifling rather than enlightening. The leadership says they should come to the microphone to share opinions, but there is so much fear that people bottle things up. They loathe the watchful eyes of powerful staff in the leader’s office and who appear to lack respect for the elected.

Some parliamentarians get annoyed that the party leadership, through the whip, seeks to influence behaviour by deciding on their assignments to particular committees, vetting their requests to be away from Ottawa, authorizing participation on parliamentary junkets and generally controlling who gets to speak in the House. A backbencher has shockingly little policy influence. Staying silent in caucus meetings, staying away from a vote in the House, offering no public comment and declining to share social media posts are the most common ways for them to publicly express dissent — except that in a political team a backbencher’s silence is equated with support.

Backbenchers are unfairly derided by pundits as trained seals who mindlessly follow their masters’ orders. In reality, they are interesting people who get involved in party politics hoping to make a difference. But too often independent thinking does give way to a team mentality. The transformation begins the moment they sign a “values contract” when they want to be nominated as party candidates. The contract is signed during the candidate vetting process to screen out people who might attract negative attention during a campaign and those unwilling to commit to the party’s core values, such as the principles articulated in the party constitution. The team ethos is reinforced through a daily barrage of digital messages, including hashtags that emphasize the team leader (such as #TeamTrudeau).

Most government backbenchers settle into a morale-zapping role of repeating approved messages, of jostling for the opportunity to speak in the House, of lobbying ministerial staff and of a public image as government cheerleaders. Those who want to be promoted cooperate with the leadership. Others focus on helping constituents with casework. Team players know not to stray too far from the party line in public.

It appears that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are less inclined to obey the normal rules of conduct for members of a governing party’s caucus. The corresponding erosion of trust between them and their Liberal colleagues, especially those holding positions of power, will likely cause them to be marginalized.

The worst part of being on the outs with the leadership is not the lost perks or privileges. In my interviews, current and former politicians informed me that the truly horrible bit is how political teammates treat nonconformists. Many members of a political team who praise ministers feel a duty to shun outcasts. Hardcore partisans and leader loyalists will be furious and/or deeply disappointed. Some will keep a distance so as not to jeopardize their own prospects of promotion. It can be difficult to distinguish them from those who find the whole matter too awkward to deal with.

The stories that some politicians across Canada shared with me about the downsides of team discipline are disconcerting. Social shunning can be very painful for those on the receiving end: a lack of eye contact, avoided conversation, people sitting on another side of the room, not being invited to come along for lunch or a drink, and so forth. Outside of caucus meetings, people in positions of power communicate their seething displeasure by ignoring phone calls and being slow to respond to messages. Fortunately, some parliamentarians who disagree with a renegade’s actions will nevertheless go out of their way to be kind, which is a pleasant contrast to those who hide behind a mask of fake smiles. But for the most part, being socially ostracized within a political team is the hardest part of going rogue — and the hurt is largely internalized because the timeworn principle of caucus confidentiality means the poor treatment cannot be publicly discussed.

Occasionally, independent thinkers bristle at the confines of party affiliation. Usually mavericks are lone wolves who gradually became isolated from the team. Months of fruitless internal agitation and social pinpricks erupt in a public outburst that marks the end of the parliamentarian’s time with the party. Those who can’t stomach the public worship of their party leader and the party line have a few options available to them: they can wait until someone else takes the helm; they can wreak havoc internally through various forms of civil disobedience and destabilizing the leader’s authority; they can sit as independents; cross the floor to another party; or relinquish their seat. On occasion a cluster of dissidents leave together to form their own parliamentary group to express a leadership breakdown, such as the Democratic Representative Caucus that split from the Canadian Alliance in 2001 or Québec Debout, which splintered off from the Bloc Québécois in 2018.

Much ink has been spilled in recent years about power imbalances in politics. In January 2018, Minister Patty Hajdu said in the House of Commons that “Parliament Hill features distinct power imbalances…It is a place where often the victimized individual is blamed for the harassment that she herself has experienced.” Still, very little is known about mobbing behaviours toward backbenchers within parliamentary caucuses. Understanding these dynamics is important, because a strong, healthy democracy requires that a diversity of points of view can be safely expressed.

The power imbalances in a governing party’s caucus are stark, given that a prime minister controls upward mobility. It is especially disconcerting when backbenchers affiliated with a governing party are portrayed as troublemakers when they question those in positions of authority. Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers in a majority government do not hold the cabinet and senior political staff to account.

Encouraging backbenchers to repeat government messages and to refer to “our government” fosters a mistaken identity. Backbenchers need reminding that they are not the government. Probing, pestering, seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be regularly doing in a respectful manner. The stars of any political team need to accept that they will be held to account, and they should offer meaningful opportunities for this to happen. They should offer clarity about what would go too far.

Political leaders say that caucus is the place to voice concerns, but in reality caucus is a structure that rewards conformity and frowns on disruption. Ministerial caucus advisory committees used in the Ralph Klein government in Alberta and adopted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper are noteworthy mechanisms that require ministers to engage in meaningful consultation with the caucus. But ensuring that caucus is a safe space for colleagues who challenge authority is another matter.

It would take someone with a strong backbone to advocate for minimum standards for how all members of a caucus should be treated, particularly ways to protect those involved in a reasonable disagreement with the team leader. Perhaps certain Liberal MPs — if they are not ousted from caucus — will explore culture change from within.

During a 2008 visit to Canada it is believed that Garda World was hired by SNC-Lavalin to protect ...","Almost lost in the current media storm surrounding the resignation of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, sparked by allegations that she faced political pressure from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office, is the timeline of events surrounding the original infraction.

Yes, we are all aware that Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was lobbying Trudeau’s inner circle hard in order to secure a deferred prosecution agreement, rather than face a possible criminal conviction for bribery charges.

In turn, Wilson-Raybould has testified before the Commons justice committee that Trudeau’s top aide, Gerald Butts, and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick pressured her on this file. Their argument was that a criminal conviction would preclude SNC-Lavalin from bidding on future federal government tenders. Should that occur, SNC-Lavalin executives had suggested they would fold up their headquarters tent in Montreal, and 9,000 skilled jobs would vanish from the Canadian landscape. This would, of course, not sit well with voters in an election year.

The allegations of political interference in this case have made this a decidedly Liberal Party scandal, with the Conservative opposition circulating petitions urging Trudeau to resign.

Upon closer examination, however, the actual accusations of SNC-Lavalin having bribed their way into lucrative Libyan construction contracts spans the period of 2001 to 2011. During that decade it is alleged that SNC-Lavalin representatives paid an estimated $48 million in bribes to members of the Gadhafi family.

During a 2008 visit to Canada it is believed that Garda World was hired by SNC-Lavalin to protect Saadi Gadhafi, the former Libyan president’s third-eldest son. That protection by Garda is alleged to have included some $30,000 worth of prostitutes and tickets to a Spice Girls concert.

The timeframe also puts this sordid affair back onto the Harper Conservatives. Fast forward to the spring of 2011 and the start of the Libyan uprising. At that juncture, no doubt thanks in part to the $48 million in palm grease paid to the Gadhafi family, SNC-Lavalin had secured billions of dollars’ worth of construction in Libya. Heck, they were even in the process of building a big new jail for the very president we were now labelling as a bloodthirsty despot.

Foreign affairs minister John Baird was among the loudest and most bellicose of western voices demanding that Gadhafi must go.

To help make that happen, Canada was among the first countries to participate in the NATO air campaign aimed at destroying the Gadhafi loyalist forces.

It took a hell of a lot longer than anyone would have imagined for the world’s most sophisticated air armada to defeat a fourth-rate African army, but by early October 2011, the end was clearly nigh. The last of the Gadhafi loyalists were contained alongside their embattled leader in the town of Sirte.

On Oct. 11, 2011, a full nine days before Libyan rebels would capture and murder Gadhafi, Baird made a secret visit into the rebel held Libyan capital of Tripoli. During that whirlwind trip, Baird met with and praised several of the Libyan rebel leaders and he announced Canada’s commitment of $10 million to secure Libyan weapons once the war was finally won.

Travelling with Baird were a number of Canadian business executives, including representatives from SNC-Lavalin, eager to start a new round of lucrative Libyan projects under the new post-Gadhafi leaders. Keep in mind that at this point Gadhafi was still alive and fighting.

So, if we are to believe that paying bribes to corrupt Third World leaders in order to obtain contracts is criminal nature, how do we define using military force to effect regime change, and then bringing in the carpet-baggers to profit from the puppet regime which we installed next?

The only problem with the Libyan caper was that Baird and company failed to listen to ambassador Sandra McCardell. She was with Baird in Tripoli as he used that same visit to reopen our embassy.

Her prophetic statement to the Canadian Press at that time was that getting the guns out of the hands of young, heavily armed rebels would be the best way for Canada to contribute to Libya’s post-Gadhafi reconstruction. That’s right, the best way to help Libya would be for us to disarm the rebels we had armed.

Baird never did say just how his $10 million in pledged funding would actually secure the Libyan arsenals, but suffice it to say whatever he had planned failed miserably.

Once Gadhafi was dead, the various rebel groups, Islamic extremists, human traffickers and tribal thugs began fighting among themselves. Libya quickly plunged into a failed state of violent anarchy, where it remains to this date.

The Trudeau Liberals tried to avert a possible criminal conviction for SNC-Lavalin’s alleged bribery. That’s bad.

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

In October 2018, Liberal MP, Patty Hajdu in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding announced she would be seeking re-election.

Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson. Singh's first words as an elected ...","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made history Monday as he asked his first questions to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons.

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered an emotional clarion call Monday as he urged people of all political stripes to turn the page on hateful ideology and condemn the sort of intolerance that fuelled the brutal killing of 50 Muslims in New Zealand.

A visibly angry Trudeau denounced the “small, toxic segments” of society that peddle the belief diversity is a weakness, spewing hatred and inciting brutality.

“We see it here in Canada — in online harassment, anonymous letters, defaced places of worship, acts of violence and even murder,” he told the House of Commons as party leaders expressed solidarity with the victims in Christchurch and their families.

“When we fail to denounce hatred with total conviction, we empower those people and legitimize their violence.”

Trudeau expressed sorrow at the many attacks in recent years that have taken the lives of defenceless people at mosques, temples, churches, synagogues, concerts, schools and malls.

“I’m sick and tired of extending our thoughts and our prayers. People around the world are exhausted by the carnage,” he said.

“We have to chase out this hatred from our parties, fight it online, denounce it at town halls, push back when it reaches our front door.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer joined Trudeau in stressing the need to condemn all racist ideologies and doctrines of prejudice.

Canada has, from its inception, been a country built on values that transcend religious, ethnic and linguistic divides, Scheer said. “This is who we are, and this is who we will always be. Those who think otherwise have no place in our democracy.”

In his maiden speech to the Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the use of dehumanizing language and making immigration out to be a threat can breed fear and fuel hatred.

“Let’s open our hearts and replace the ignorance, the lack of knowledge with understanding, which will create the climate for compassion, so we care for one another,” he said.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale suggested Friday’s deadly mass shooting, which killed 50 people and wounded 50 more as they gathered at a pair of Christchurch mosques, will spur parliamentarians to take a careful look at Canada’s gun laws.

The massacre has sparked a global sense of concern that will prompt Canadian politicians to make some timely decisions, Goodale said Monday after appearing before a Senate committee.

Goodale said cabinet colleague Bill Blair will deliver recommendations soon, having been asked last August by Trudeau to study the possibility of a full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada.

A visibly galvanized Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, said her government plans to announce gun-law reforms within days.

A bill already before Canada’s Senate would, among other things, expand the scope of background checks on those who want to acquire guns here.

The bill would also require gun retailers keep records of firearms inventory and sales, and ensure the purchaser of a hunting rifle or shotgun presents a firearms licence, while the seller would have to verify it.

(The Canadian Press/Sean Kilpatrick)

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled his fourth budget in Ottawa today, an election-year measure that not only plays up the positive effect Liberal policy has had on the economy — especially the historically low unemployment numbers — but, perhaps more importantly, primes voters who will head to the polls this year.

One thing this budget — which announces $23 billion in new spending — does not do is eliminate the deficit, which the Liberals promised they would do away with by their fourth budget. The fact that they missed this target by $23 billion sends a clear signal that they’re comfortable with running deficits going forward.

Goodies for Middle Age and Older Canadians

Though the big news was a scheme to help millennials buy their first home, there were several measures that were clearly aimed at older Canadians:

The government will create the Canadian Drug Agency whose role will be the creation of a national drug plan somewhere down the road, likely before the election. (Trudeau first hinted at the possibility of a national pharmacare plan during an August 2018 interview with Zoomer magazine in which he unequivocally promised “It’s coming.”)

in which he unequivocally promised “It’s coming.”) Changes to the Guaranteed Income Supplement program will allow older low-income Canadians to earn $1,500 more (raised from $3,500 to $5,000) before their benefit is clawed back

$50 billion for a National Dementia Strategy.

A $1.7 billion initiative that will offer money to middle-age Canadians to retrain for new job skills. They will also be able to hang on to their current jobs even if they leave for re-training

Introduction of new measures, possibly changing federal law, to protect pensioners of companies that go bankrupt

Canadians over the age of 70 who have not applied for the Canada Pension Plan will be automatically enrolled

CARP’s initial reaction to the budgetary measures aimed at older Canadians was very positive — it seemed many were drawn directly from it’s national advocacy platform The Faces of Canada’s Seniors. “We’ve been calling for significant changes to safeguard Canadians as we age,” said Laura Tamblyn Watts, CARP’s Chief Public Policy Officer. “The government has listened.”

There was plenty of pre-budget drama today. Before Morneau had finished lacing up his new budget-day shoes, the Conservatives threatened to delay the release of the document in protest to the Liberal’s refusal to recall Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify at the House Justice Committee looking into the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

At a press conference earlier in the day, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer raised the possibility that his party planned to disrupt Morneau’s attempt to table the budget by slowing down a vote (on an unrelated matter) in the House of Commons.

“Justin Trudeau shut down the justice committee investigation into his corruption scandal. If he expects us to quietly accept a cover-up, he will get a rude awakening this afternoon,” Scheer said.","Federal Budget 2019: Morneau Offers Lots of Goodies For Middle-Age, Senior Canadians",Everything Zoomer,http://www.everythingzoomer.com/general/2019/03/19/budget-2019-gis-training-pharamcare/

An Indigenous woman, originally from the west coastal people was delivering in the Canadian House of Commons a lesson on what the “rule of law” actually meant. She did not get this understanding from her undergrad or degree from mainstream institutions. Jody Wilson Raybould reminded the world and herself that the original laws and teachings of her own people are instilled within her own blood memory and DNA.

Global media focused on the past corruption of a global corporate actor, the placement of deferred prosecution agreement, or remediation agreement in an omnibus bill, and the unwillingness of a Liberal cabinet to lose footing or seats in the province of Quebec.

The corruption of a Liberal or Conservative government is not something new to the First Nations or people like Jody Wilson Raybould have had to encounter. In 2012, the Conservative sitting federal government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper put forth an omnibus bill where they attacked the protection of waters and also, hidden in this legislation was also an amendment to land surrenders or designations on reserve. But Harper’s Bill C-38 had one positive outcome. It united the indigenous people in Canada and launched the IdleNoMore movement.

Similarly, with Jody Wilson Raybould, there is an “indigenous take” on her testimony. The most important factor was not the fact that the Liberals were guilty of some serious corporate cronyism. The most important factor was that after 152 years, a sitting member of the white Canadian parliament had not followed the rule of whiteman made law. Jody Wilson Raybould quoted her own experiential learning, the laws of the Big House and her position as a matriarch and truth-teller.

This action by Jody Wilson Raybould was heard, not only by the Indigenous people throughout this land called Canada; the land, itself, heard her words. Our ancestors are in this land. The relationship between the Indigenous and the land is absolute. Repeated attempts to explain the spiritual significance and cosmic connection that the original people have in this territory falls deafly on mainstream ears.

The Indigenous “anthropomorphize” tangible objects. Mainstream sees a tree and a specific land area in monetary terms. The Indigenous sees the same tree, but they see the places where our people took shade or sheltered. The Indigenous know the place name and the stories of this place and the power that still lives. The difference in our memories and the difference in our history, means the application of law will be different for the Indigenous and the non-native who are guests in this land.

This is the conflict between Mainstream and the Indigenous. This is why there can be no reconciliation. For the Indigenous to reconcile, they have the option of assimilating into the larger society and becoming “equal” to the non-native so that they can finally take up their roles as “Canadians”. The indigenous must come to see the tree as just a tree with a price tag or a value attached.

If the Indigenous cannot see this tree like a commodity, they have a second option. This option is to maintain their Indigenous teachings and understanding and to go forward until the larger society begins to reconcile their view with our understanding.

Jody Wilson Raybould has opened this doorway. Only after the initial fray, mainstream media began to write that Jody’s words returned her to her teachings as a Kwakwaka’wakw person.

Therefore the heart of democracy and the noble action Jody Wilson Raybould took in not acquiescing to party pressure came from who she is as a person. Integrity cannot be taught. Integrity must come from within and must be supported by the systems that exist around a person.

In the Indigenous systems, there is respect for all life, because the Indigenous understand the Creator, the Great Mystery has made all things. There is no hierarchy of animals, rocks or water, there is only existence and co-existence. In this system, if you value or respect the land, the waters, the animals, the plants and all things, you have innate respect before any other measurable.

Where is the integrity in the non-native system? With technology, humans separate themselves from each other and from the natural world. With this separation, there is no connection, no reminder and no awe for the wonders of this world. Within the mainstream system, there are false examples of integrity like returning a lost wallet. If there is money involved, and money is measured, then there is integrity in this action.

When the newcomers to this land begin to operate in a system of interconnected understanding, they too will begin to understand what integrity means. It is standing at the edge of headwaters, looking at the mountains and seeing a line of shadowed ancestors, praying and resting in the foothills. It is in seeing a grizzly bear show its young how to push over trees in an area that has always been where the grizzlies go to dance. It is returning to the places where salmon swim against the current to reach their destination with determination and glory. It is in the comforting winds that gently rock babies to sleep in their swings. All these things do not cost and have no “apparent” monetary value. The value is in the eternal song of life that continues because of the respect, the integrity and the love each part shares for the other. It is in the Indigenous law of this land.",The original laws and teachings of this land are instilled in our blood memory and DNA,Two Row Times,https://tworowtimes.com/columns/mu-wiyan-iuch/the-original-laws-and-teachings-of-this-land-are-instilled-in-our-blood-memory-and-dna/
128,LifeStyle,2019-03-20T21:31:00.0000000Z,WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US ... the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have ...,"WELLS: On that note, I want to welcome to The Message Graeme MacKay, the Hamilton Spectator's award winning editorial cartoonist. In fact it occurred to me as I was preparing for the episode that the sign Beware of Cartoonist is funny and also has deeper meetings or layers to it, just as your work always does, because in fact you occupy a physical space in the newsroom off on your own — separate from the reporters. And you also play a singular role at The Spectator which is to offer an opinion, a point of view on everything from politics to Hamilton's quirks and the vast canvas of human nature and to do so editorial cartoons. That's me giving my spin how you might see your job. How do you see what you do?

MACKAY: Yeah, I occupy a very isolated corner of the newsroom way at the other end and by the exit door to the newsroom too so there's a symbolic thing there. I guess I'm lucky enough to have a position that I have because it's sort of like a visual columnist. But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: Sure.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

1. American Jews are more divided over Israel than Trump thinks

By Trump’s account, Jewish Americans should leave the Democratic Party because the GOP has become the more pro-Israel party. Political science research, however, shows that Americans rarely change their long-standing partisan preferences based on their opinions about a single issue.

Even if they did, American Jews are much more divided over Israel than the president thinks. Only 30 percent said they were very attached to Israel in a 2013 Pew Survey of 3,475 Jewish Americans. In the same Pew survey of U.S. Jews, 89 percent said that you can be both Jewish and strongly critical of Israel, and just 38 percent thought that the “Israeli government is making a sincere effort to bring about a peace settlement with the Palestinians.”

Nor is American Jewish opinion squarely behind the two ostensibly pro-Israeli policies that Trump cites as reasons Jews should leave the Democratic Party: withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.

In the figure above, you can see on the left that only 38 percent of Jewish Americans supported withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal in the 2018 CCES. Meanwhile, the right-hand side shows that Jewish Americans were evenly divided on the Trump administration’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

Moreover, most Jews who support moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem aren’t Democrats. Only around one-third of Jewish Democrats supported the policy. There simply are not that many Jewish Democrats to pick off with even a relatively popular policy like recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

In fact, the display shows that American Jews are actually significantly less supportive of withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem than Protestants and Catholics. The Trump administration’s pro-Israel policies are certainly not enough to win over Jewish voters.

2. American Jews have liberal views about immigration

While Americans rarely change their partisan attachments over a single issue, party identification has become more polarized over racial and immigration issues during Barack Obama and Donald Trump’s presidencies. The growing importance of immigration in partisan politics does not bode well for hopes of a mass Jewish exodus from the Democratic Party.

As Matthew Yglesias asserted, “Jewish values and Jewish identity are tied up with openness and pluralism in a way that makes the GOP a very hard sell.” Indeed, those values are reflected in Jewish Americans’ liberal views about immigration.



Source: 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (Michael Tesler/Michael Tesler)

The figure above shows that there’s little Jewish support for the Trump administration’s restrictive immigration policies. At least two-thirds of Jews in the 2018 CCES opposed cutting legal immigration in half; funding the border wall; defunding police departments that do not report undocumented immigrants; and banning immigrants from counties including Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya.

The display further shows that American Jews’ positions on immigration are much more liberal than those of Catholics and Protestants. It’s hard to see Jewish Americans leaving the Democratic Party, then, in favor of a Republican Party that has become increasingly defined by its opposition to immigration.

[Republicans used to agree with Democrats that the n-word should never be used. Republicans changed their minds.]

3. Most American Jews of all ages strongly disapprove of Trump

It’s also hard to see Jewish Americans increasingly align with a Republican Party led by Trump. A new book by political scientist Gary Jacobson shows that some Americans change parties based on how they feel about the president — especially young people whose partisan attachments are more in flux than their older counterparts.

This is bad news for Republicans who hope to win over Jewish voters — because most American Jews strongly disapprove of Trump. In both 2018 Gallup surveys and the 2018 CCES, roughly 70 percent of Jews disapproved of his job performance as president. The CCES data further show that 63 percent of Jewish Americans strongly disapprove of Trump, compared with only 17 percent who strongly approve.

Across all age groups, more than 60 percent of Jews strongly disapproved of Trump. For those under 30, whom Republicans would need at the vanguard of any future Jexodus from the Democratic Party, 63 percent strongly disapprove of Trump; only 11 percent strongly approve.

Of course, it’s not surprising that an anti-immigrant president, who proposed banning a religious minority from entering the country and has a long history of trafficking in anti-Semitic stereotypes, would be unpopular with Jewish Americans. It is surprising, though, that the Jexodus movement thinks American Jews will overlook that and join Trump’s Republican Party because of its pro-Israel policies.

Alberta contains Canada’s vast oil sands, home to the world’s third-largest crude reserves. With an economy nearly the size of Ireland, the province contributes almost 15 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product.

READ MORE: Oil producers want to see policies that will double industry’s growth in Alberta election

But billions of dollars of foreign capital have fled the sector since 2017, partly because of lack of pipeline capacity.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) came to power in a shock victory in traditionally conservative Alberta in 2015 in the midst of a global oil price collapse that slashed energy company revenues.

But critics say Notley’s government exacerbated the crisis by raising corporate taxes, launching a review of royalty rates and introducing a carbon tax at a time when firms were already struggling.

WATCH: UCP leads NDP ahead of 2019 Alberta election

Polls indicate the NDP is headed for a drubbing in the April 16 election.

The NDP trails the United Conservative Party (UCP), led by former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, 53 to 35 per cent in an Ipsos/Global News poll published this week.

The energy industry would likely cheer a UCP victory as the party has promised to reverse unpopular NDP policies.

The sector accounts for 30 per cent of the province’s economic activity and supports 415,000 Alberta jobs, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“A Kenney government would be very strongly welcomed by the oil industry,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager specializing in energy investing at Canoe Financial in Calgary. “(In 2015), the sector was already on its knees because of commodity prices being low and the government entered into its role really not showing recognition of that.”

READ MORE: Notley kicks off election Day 2 with vow to double Alberta’s oil and gas incentives

Kenney promises to cut corporate income taxes, a key CAPP recommendation, scrap the carbon tax, slash red tape, and fight for new export pipelines to bring Alberta’s landlocked crude to market.

Regulatory delays have stalled new pipeline proposals for years. Last autumn the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels hit record levels as production outpaced pipeline capacity, leaving crude sitting in Alberta storage tanks.

The Alberta government responded by imposing crude production cuts to shore up prices and leased 4,400 rail cars to bring more oil to market. Some companies criticized the measures as unnecessary government intervention in a free market, but others supported them.

“Our members are on their last legs,” said John Bayko, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, who added his organization would back any party that offered a strong vision for the energy sector.

Premier Notley has become increasingly vocal in support of pipelines. Last year she fell out with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over delays to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project.

But industry participants recall her opposition to Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway project, which has since been scrapped.

Kenney casts himself as a far more forceful oil industry advocate. Appealing to some Albertans’ sense of western alienation from national politicians in Ottawa, he vows to “stand up to Justin Trudeau and those attacking Alberta.”

Scandal brewing

Kenney’s pugnacious approach has earned support from some in an energy industry that feels it lacks a champion. But it may also be the source of a growing scandal around his 2017 UCP leadership bid.

Some Canadian media outlets have reported that Kenney’s camp allegedly colluded with another candidate, Jeff Calloway, to run a “kamikaze” campaign to discredit Kenney’s main UCP leadership rival.

READ MORE: Pipeline politics to affect economy, two elections in 2019, economists say

Kenney has denied acting unethically, saying it is not unusual for competing campaign camps to communicate.

Last week, Alberta’s elections commissioner handed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) an investigation into irregular contributions to Calloway’s campaign.

RCMP spokesman Fraser Logan said no further information could be provided unless criminal charges are brought forward.

“Any time there’s potential of a leader being under investigation during an election campaign, that’s a problem,” said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University.

Adding to UCP woes, a star candidate, Caylan Ford, resigned on Monday after a media report claimed she posted comments echoing white supremacist rhetoric on Facebook.

WATCH: Jason Kenney responds to Caylan Ford’s resignation from UCP race

Ford said the comments were distortions and did not reflect her views, but resigned to avoid becoming “a distraction.”

Bratt said these developments offered some hope to Notley’s NDP government in the April election, but the UCP was still the clear favorite.

Sanders’ campaign said it is bringing in David Sirota, whose work has appeared in The Guardian and Newsweek, among other outlets, as a senior adviser and speechwriter.

The move could stoke tensions within the Democratic field since Sirota has previously targeted O’Rourke, a former U.S. congressman from Texas who entered the presidential race last week, and other rivals.

READ MORE: Beto O’Rourke apologizes for his violent teenage writing, rhetoric toward wife

Sirota on Twitter and in published articles has accused O’Rourke of siding with President Donald Trump and Republicans while a member of the House of Representatives, as well as being overly friendly with the oil and gas industry.

Sirota’s criticism of O’Rourke in December drew a warning from Neera Tanden, a top ally of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and president of the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank.

“A supporter of Bernie Sanders attacking a Democrat,” Tanden tweeted. “This is seriously dangerous. We know Trump is in the White House and attacking Dems is doing Trump’s bidding.”

The conflict was a reminder of the bad blood between the Clinton and Sanders camps when they battled for the Democratic nomination ahead of the 2016 presidential race and the mistrust between the party’s moderate and progressive wings.

Sirota also has slammed presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, as well as former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, for being overly cozy with corporate interests.

Sanders’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Sirota’s hiring.

Sirota worked for Sanders as a press secretary when Sanders was a member of the House of Representatives in the early 2000s.

An article Sirota wrote in 2013 for the liberal news website Salon praising the economic record of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s late socialist president, also attracted criticism on social media from Sanders’ Democratic Party critics and conservatives alike.

Party Debate There has been growing skepticism in the Democratic Party about the U ...","(Bloomberg) -- Several Democratic presidential candidates say they are skipping this year’s meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee amid a roiling debate within the party over U.S. policy toward Israel under President Donald Trump.

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is “concerned about the platform AIPAC is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a two-state solution,"" his campaign policy director, Josh Orton, said in an email.

Representatives of Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, former Representative Beto O’Rourke and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Julián Castro said they won’t be attending the AIPAC conference, which begins Sunday in Washington, without giving a reason. John Delaney, another 2020 Democratic contender, said Thursday he also won’t be attending, citing a scheduling conflict.

Trump has accused Democrats of being “anti-Israel” and “anti-Jewish.” The president has been a close ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and on Thursday he broke with decades of U.S. policy and said it’s time for the U.S. to “fully recognize” Israel’s sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights. The move will give a boost to Netanyahu, who faces corruption allegations as he’s running for re-election. He is scheduled to speak at AIPAC and meet with Trump next week.

The conference will have a bipartisan lineup of members of Congress who plan to address the group over three days, including New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a member of the Democratic House leadership, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, according to AIPAC’s schedule.

Party Debate

There has been growing skepticism in the Democratic Party about the U.S.-Israel lobbying group, which is seen as a hub of support for Netanyahu’s policies that are controversial among American progressives, including in the Jewish community. The party also has been embroiled in controversy over accusations that statements made by Democratic first-term Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota used anti-Semitic tropes.

Republican National Committee spokesman Steve Guest said Democrats were showing ""transparently anti-Israel bias."" He cited the absence of the Democratic presidential candidates at AIPAC and a call by progressive activist group MoveOn for them to boycott the conference.

MoveOn’s Iram Ali said, “AIPAC is clearly a partisan lobbying group that has undermined diplomatic efforts and progressives want no part in it.”

Invitations

It’s not clear whether any of the Democratic presidential candidates were actually invited to speak at the AIPAC conference.

""Our focus for the conference has always been Congress, and the bipartisan leadership of the House and the Senate will be speaking,"" AIPAC spokesman Marshall Wittmann said. ""We do not discuss who is invited to speak at the conference.""

Jeremy Ben-Ami, the executive director of J Street, a pro-Israel group that has been critical of Netanyahu’s policies, said there has been ""a massive shift"" on Israel in the Democratic Party.

""It is a direct result of the games that the prime minister of Israel has played on this issue,"" Ben-Ami said in an interview. ""He alone bears responsibility, over the course of the last decade, for tearing apart the bipartisan consensus on Israel that used to exist, and turning this into another football in the culture wars of the United States.""

""It’s not good for the United States or for Israel,"" he said.

Jewish Americans have overwhelmingly backed Democrats in presidential elections for decades: Hillary Clinton won 71 percent of Jewish voters in 2016, according to exit poll data compiled by the Pew Research Center. Democrats have carried Jewish voters by anywhere between 39 and 60 points in White House races since 2000.

""Nothing that the Republican Party has ever tried to do to win over Jewish voters on the Israel issue has worked. They try this every election cycle — they run ads and spend money,"" Ben-Ami said.

Q: According to Elections Alberta, there are 12 registered political parties in Alberta. Why don't they all appear in Vote Compass?

A: By default, Vote Compass includes those political parties that were represented within a given jurisdiction at the conclusion of its previous election. A political party may also be included if it meets all of the following conditions:

It is registered under the jurisdiction's elections commission.

It fields candidates in a majority of ridings.

it has a fully developed platform.

it participates, where necessary, in the consultative process undertaken to determine its positions on the issues reflected in Vote Compass.

Q: How does Vote Compass determine the positions of the parties?

A: Party responses to each of the questions in Vote Compass are derived through careful research of the party platforms along with consultations between the academic team and the parties themselves. See Vote Compass methodology for details.

Q: How does Vote Compass figure out my results?

A: Vote Compass figures out your alignment with the political parties by comparing your responses to the questionnaire with the parties' positions on the same issues.

Q: Why does Vote Compass place me closest to a party that I don't intend to vote for?

A: Vote Compass is not intended to predict which party a person intends to vote for in a given election nor which party a person feels that she or he is most closely aligned with. It specifies how the person is aligned with each of the parties on the basis of the public policy issues included in Vote Compass.",Vote Compass: Compare your views to party platforms for the 2019 Alberta election,Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/vote-compass-compare-views-party-090000012.html
136,World,2019-03-17T20:57:00.0000000Z,A new Gallup poll found “liberal Democrats ... of Turning Point USA urge blacks to divorce themselves from the Democratic Party. She calls this movement “Blexit.” Can we expect a similar ...,"Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., denies that anti-Semitism is “on the rise” within the Democratic Party.

He’s right.

This is not a recent phenomenon. Anti-Semitism within the Democratic Party has been on the rise for some time.

Democrats failed to pass a resolution specifically condemning freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a Muslim and naturalized citizen from Somalia, who recently made several comments considered anti-Semitic. She tweeted that American politicians support Israel because “it’s all about the Benjamins,” meaning Jews essentially offer bribes for political support.

She accused politicians who support Israel of dual loyalty. In 2012, she tweeted, “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”

Following the “Benjamins” tweet, the Anti-Defamation League’s national director and CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, issued the following statement: “As Americans and Jews, we expect our politicians to condemn bigotry, not to fuel it. Words matter. At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise in the U.S. and abroad, Rep. Omar is promoting the ugly, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews have an outsized influence over politics. The notion that wealthy Jews are controlling the government is a longstanding anti-Semitic trope and one of the pillars of modern anti-Semitism, a retread of ideas spread by bigots from David Duke to Louis Farrakhan.”

Omar, fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., are the only members of Congress to publicly support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which “works to end international support for Israel’s oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law.”

Criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism are, of course, not necessarily the same thing. But Omar pushes a stereotype that Jews have a dark, even sinister effect on the political process.

Jewish bigotry from black liberals — and Omar is black — has long been an unspoken problem among Democrats.

According to an annual survey commissioned by the ADL, their latest 2017 report found that blacks, who vote 90% for Democrats, were 2.3 times more likely than whites to be anti-Semitic. By contrast, polls show that Jews, among various demographic groups, are the least likely to be racist against blacks.

Consider: Rev. Jesse Jackson, when running for president in 1984, referred to Jews as “Hymie” and New York City as “Hymietown.”

Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, who once posed with then-Sen. Barack Obama in a photograph (helpfully not released until after President Obama left office), called Judaism a “gutter religion,” praised Hitler as “a great man” and recently said: “When they call me an anti-Semite — stop it. I’m anti-termite.”

Rev. Al Sharpton, whose endorsement is being sought by 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, referred to Jews as “diamond merchants” and helped fuel a 1991 riot between blacks and Jews in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn.

Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., a critic of American support of Israel, served two stints in Congress, from 1997 to 2003 and then from 2005 to 2007. Her father, a state representative for Atlanta, was asked on television, days before his daughter was defeated in a 2002 primary, why she faced such intense opposition. He said: “That ain’t nothing. Jews have bought everybody. Jews. J. E. W. S.”

Even Jews who do not support many Israeli policies nevertheless support the state of Israel.

A recent poll by the Jewish Electorate Institute found 92% of American Jews are “generally pro-Israel,” even as 59% say they are comfortable supporting Israel and also criticizing its government. But support for Israel is down among Democrats, particularly young Democrats.

A new Gallup poll found “liberal Democrats are only party/ideology group not partial to Israel” in the Mideast conflict. Young liberal Democrats are about as likely to support the Palestinians as they are Israel, with black support for Israel even lower.

A recent Economist/YouGov poll that asked whether Israel is an American “ally” found that only 19% of blacks and 22% of Hispanics agreed.

Young blacks like Candace Owens of Turning Point USA urge blacks to divorce themselves from the Democratic Party. She calls this movement “Blexit.”

Can we expect a similar movement in which Jewish voters reconsider their traditional 70% support for the Democratic Party?

Some call it Jexodus.

In an election many see as a two-horse race between the New Democratic Party ...","Two days after the election call, the Freedom Conservative Party announced its first platform promise, declaring its commitment to limit federal powers over Alberta — or consider separating from Canada.

FCP Leader Derek Fildebrandt, MLA for Strathmore-Brooks, unveiled strategies to “end inequality” and “protect hard-working Albertans from Ottawa.” If elected, the party would lobby Ottawa to end equalization and grant the province independent rights over immigration, tax collection, employment insurance, pensions and justice, in regards to policing.

Fildebrandt said if the federal government rejects Alberta’s “rightful demands for equality,” then the party would hold a referendum on independence.

“The Freedom Conservative Party, in this election, is going to give Albertans an option unlike they have ever seen, unlike any other parties in this election,” he said Thursday at Bridgeland Community Park in the city’s northeast. A handful of FCP candidates joined him in support.

Fildebrandt formed the FCP last June after leaving the United Conservative Party, following a series of controversies.

In an election many see as a two-horse race between the New Democratic Party and United Conservative Party, the FCP is considered one of a handful of outliers fighting for attention and seats.

Also in the running is right-leaning Alberta Advantage Party, led by Marilyn Burns. It was formed by members of the Wildrose party who were dissatisfied with that party’s 2017 merger with the Progressive Conservatives to form the UCP. The AAP also promises lower taxes and greater autonomy from Ottawa.

The AAP and FCP hope to each put forward about 30 candidates, however Fildebrandt’s conclave is focused on running only in ridings where the NDP is not considered competitive. In contrast, the Green Party of Alberta has 19 candidates, so far, according to its website.

Political scientist Bruce Foster, who teaches at Mount Royal University, said the AAP and Green Party have “no chance” in winning seats. He said small parties are at a grave disadvantage because they don’t have enough resources, such as money and staff, and are generally neglected by the media.

“The system itself squeezes out fringe parties,” said Foster, adding people are more likely to vote for the “big machine” they most closely align with rather than a smaller counterpart.

Mount Royal political scientist Lori Williams agreed.

“There is something different that is happening in this election. It is much more a two-party race,” she said. “We don’t usually see two parties in contention and the rest of them, at least at this stage, looking completely out of contention.”

But Williams said the FCP could have a bigger effect than previously expected.

“A week ago, maybe a week and a half ago, I would have dismissed FCP as a fringe party, but it looks like they might actually be in play now,” said Williams.

She said Fildebrandt’s close ties with former UCP leadership hopeful Brian Jean and the recent kamikaze-candidate scandal plaguing Kenney and his staff could make the FCP a viable alternative for conservative voters in the province.

“So it’s now something that has become an election issue,” said Williams. “People are thinking about it, people are wondering, do I continue? Do I hold my nose and win government? Or do I stand up for my principles?”

She added Fildebrandt’s name recognition and former Wildrose ties could work to his advantage.

Fildebrandt said he’s confident in his team.

The thin margin enjoyed by Romania’s Social Democratic Party (PSD) ahead of its main rival, the National Liberal Party (PNL), has narrowed to 0.6 percentage points (pp) in the latest poll conducted by INSCOP for Konrad Adenauer Foundation ahead of the May 26 European Elections.

The socialists’ score dropped from 27.8% to 26.9%, while the liberals lost less support: from 26.7% to 26.3%.

The margin was 1.1pp in the previous poll released in early February. Therefore, the narrowing and the margins themselves are statistically irrelevant at a 95% confidence. More relevant is that a larger share of the polled electorate expressed an option (58.5% versus 54.5% in February), although the “virtual turnout” remains low and typically results in lower actual turnout.

Another relevant inference from the polls is that the two opposition parties that joined forces, Save Romania Union (USR) and PLUS of former prime minister Dacian Ciolos, got weaker support in March when counted together (15.3%) than taken separately in February (10%+7%). Furthermore, the weaker (combined) score occurred amid higher rate of responses (the “virtual turnout”).

Coming on as a Senior Advisor to the Florida Democratic Party is Christina Diamond. Diamond has also served as the finance director for both the FDP and former U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.

The FDP is also adding to its data team: Will Zigler will take over as Data Director.

Zigler specializes in political data and first worked in the state as part of former President Barack Obama‘s re-election campaign in 2012. He’s also served as data director for both the Texas Democratic Party and the Missouri Democratic Party.

Joining Zigler will be Taehan Lee, who was hired as Deputy Director of Data and Reporting. Lee worked as the data and analytics director for Gery Chico’s campaign for Mayor of Chicago. Lee also served as the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as part of their recount data team in Florida.

Catherine Theriault and Chrisney Frederick, both former FDP filed organizers, are coming back into the party fold. Theriault was hired as the Deputy Director of Analytics.

In 2018, Theriault served as an organizer in Broward county for NextGen America and worked as the finance director for Lori Berman’s state Senate campaign. Frederick will be the party’s NGP VAN Administrator. She was a part of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign in Florida.

The FDP is also hiring a trio of new faces to handle community engagement in three different regions. Former Tampa City Council candidate Ella K. Coffee was hired as the Community Engagement Director in Tampa Bay.

Harrison Angelis will serve in the same role in Central Florida. Angelis worked for U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy‘s re-election campaign in 2018. Alex Berrios will oversee operations in Martin, Indian River, Palm Beach and St. Lucie Counties. Berrios served as a field organizer in 2018.

On the press outreach side, Luisana Pérez Fernández is coming on as Hispanic Press Secretary. A native of Caracas, Venezuela, Pérez Fernández has worked as District Director for State Senator José Javier Rodríguez and Hispanic Press Secretary for the Bill Nelson for U.S. Senate Campaign.

Alex Morash will take over as the Statewide Press Secretary after leaving his post as the spokesperson and media director for the National LGBTQ Task Force.

Nearly rounding out the new hires is Devon Murphy-Anderson, who’s joining the FDP as its Deputy Finance Director in South Florida. Murphy-Anderson held the same position for Liuba Grechen Shirley’s campaign against incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York.

Finally, Sam Cook is the party’s new Assistant to the Executive Office. Cook has worked on campaigns across the state as part of a consulting firm, including the campaign of Parkland mom Lori Alhadeff, who won the District 4 seat on the Broward County School Board in 2018.

As for those earning promotions, Lauren Calmet is moving from Deputy Political Director to Political Director. Rachel Berger was promoted to Party Affairs Director. Berger joined the party as a student intern in 2015 and joined the Party Affairs department in 2017.

Last but not least, Kevin Donohoe was named the party’s Chief Spokesperson and Senior Communications Advisor. Donohoe will be based in Tallahassee with a focus on the Legislative Session. He previously served as the Party’s gubernatorial race spokesperson during 2018.

Even with the new infusion announced Friday, the FDP says it’s still looking to add to the team. Additional planned new hires include eight regional organizers, a statewide training director, a municipal victory program director and a voter protection director.

On top of the extensive hires announced Friday, the FDP has also announced a $2 million effort to register voters throughout the state. A handful of the party leaders were also chosen from within the FDP.

“Florida is ground zero for the 2020 presidential race, and that’s why the Florida Democrats are starting early to turn our state blue and put a Democrat in the White House,” said Florida Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo.

“We’re taking nothing for granted and are going to organize in every corner of our state. By investing early in field, data, and messaging, we are laying the groundwork for Democratic victories in 2020 — from county commission races to the White House.”",Florida Democratic Party prepares for 2020 with latest hires,Florida Politics,http://floridapolitics.com/archives/291565-florida-dems-2020-hires

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel promised Thursday that his party would increase annual funding available for inclusive education from $490 million to $690 million per year, would ensure students who need special assessments get them within a 90-day window, and would give schools more time to apply for funding for new international students.

His party, Mandel said, would accomplish this while providing funding for growing student enrolment, reducing class sizes, and building more schools. “There is nothing more important than our children, and if we give them the educational tools that they need to be successful, it will allow them to pursue their dreams and goals, which will make Alberta a more successful province,” Mandel said. Mandel said in talking with teachers over the past 14 months, one consistent issue raised was the complexity of modern classrooms, with teachers working to accommodate the needs of English as a second language students or students with physical or mental challenges.

However, Mandel’s plan to double the number of student aides is supposed to happen while funding for inclusive education is increased by only 40 per cent. Mandel said exempting schools from having to pay the carbon tax would free up resources from school boards to achieve some of these goals, but admits money would have to be borrowed.

“If we are going to have the system that I deeply believe in and our candidates deeply believe in, we have to invest in it. These little boys and little girls are what Alberta is going to be in the next 20, 30, 40 years. Let’s give them that opportunity,” Mandel said, surrounded with elementary school students at the Al Mustafa Academy in Edmonton.

What do you think?

Candidates of all stripes will have to answer tough questions about how they plan to pay for their campaign promises. Current finance minister Joe Ceci says the New Democratic government is on the path to balance the budget by the year 2023. That being said, in the 2018-19 fiscal year, Alberta’s budget was still running a $6.9-billion deficit, meaning the province spent $6.9 million more than was taken in through revenue. While the budget might be balanced by 2023, the total provincial debt currently stands at $58.6 billion, and has been predicted to balloon to as much as $96 billion by 2024. In a rally speech on Tuesday, United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney criticized the NDP government’s economic record over the last four years as “the worst economic record since the Great Depression,” saying the province cannot afford to keep wasting money on interest payments while piling on debt. As part of their plan to get Alberta back in the black, the UCP would freeze education spending. However, that plan would mean there would be no money to fund new student enrolment in Alberta’s schools, with 15,000 new students expected to enter the school system this fall alone. “Jason Kenney says he won’t find funds to hire new teachers for the 15,000 students, but he has no problems finding $700 million in a tax giveaway for the wealthiest Albertans,” said education minister and NDP candidate for Edmonton-North West David Eggen in a press release in January. “I’m calling on all parents, teachers and those who value education in our province to join me and tell Jason Kenney that you won’t stand for this.”

In her rally speech Tuesday, NDP Leader Rachel Notley defended her government’s financial plan for protecting services Albertans value during an economic recession and downturn in oil prices, which have played a large role in the province’s deficit. The NDP has blamed decades of Conservative mismanagement for driving up class sizes and school board infrastructure deficits, issues Notley says her government has worked to fix by funding hundreds of new schools and school maintenance projects. On Tuesday, Notley slammed Kenney for the funding freeze — which she said is effectively a cut — while working to provide a “reckless” $4-billion tax cut to corporations that she says will only serve to fatten bottom lines without creating jobs and at the expense of public services.

Thompson said she has so far received a positive response from campaigns and is hoping to work with party organizations as well.,"A new Democratic firm is looking to assist political campaigns with human resources policies. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo)

When Dallas Thompson signed on as Hillary Clinton’s director of operations in North Carolina in 2016, she quickly recognized that she had a lot to learn about human resources.

Thompson, who had previously worked as a fundraiser, discovered campaigns needed a more sustained human resources infrastructure, including training and services.

And that was before the #MeToo movement that saw sexual harassment on campaigns grab headlines. Political staffers, particularly women, spoke out about the lack of anti-harassment policies and enforcement.

Samantha Register, who was harassed by former Nevada Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen, left politics altogether after her experience.

“I worked on eight different campaigns before I decided to quit, and none of them had either an HR department or any system in place for filing complaints,” she wrote in an op-ed in the Nevada Independent in January.

Human resources isn’t always a top priority for turbulent political campaigns, which can involve lots of stress, long hours, constant turnover and finite resources. Thompson noted there was no pipeline for campaign human resources officers because smaller campaigns typically don’t have one.

So this week, Thompson launched Bright Compass, a firm that helps Democratic campaigns with develop and implement human resources policies, particularly to prevent harassment and discrimination.

“Staff are demanding something different,” she said in a phone interview. “And I just think that the old ‘It is what it is’ [attitude] isn’t going to cut it.”

Ally Coll, a lawyer and campaign operative who co-founded the Purple Campaign to address workplace sexual harassment, and consultant Dan Kanninen both serve as advisers to Bright Compass. The firm offers a number of services, including a review of a campaigns’ policies and in-person training for campaign staff.

Bright Compass had a “soft launch” last year, testing out their training program for Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine’s re-election campaign in Virginia. The firm also held a sexual harassment training at the Democratic National Committee’s winter meeting in February.

Thompson said she has so far received a positive response from campaigns and is hoping to work with party organizations as well.

Party committees, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, do provide guidance for campaigns that are developing workplace policies.

The DCCC requires campaigns of candidates named to its Red to Blue program to establish a sexual harassment policy. These candidates and their staff participate in an online sexual harassment training. And the committee also provides in-person training for campaign managers on handling sexual harassment and assault.

While the campaign committees are taking their own steps, Thompson said Bright Compass can provide further assistance because it is singularly focused on workplace issues. In contrast, a campaign committee has “a million balls in the air,” she said.

The next challenge for Thompson is convincing campaigns to spend some of their limited time and resources on workplace policies and training. Such an investment is worth it, she said, because a political campaign depends on a motivated and effective staff.

“I think that for a long, long time, politics has just been really, really brutal for the people who work in it,” Thompson said. “And the excuse has always been about the mission. … And ultimately, I just believe that you can’t have a winning campaign when your staff is losing.”

Larry Hogan — or another Republican — to challenge President Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election bid.

“Voices like John Kasich and Governor Hogan, from my state, would do an enormous service to not just their party, but to their fellow Americans to stand up and challenge this president,” said Delaney, who stepped down from his Maryland 6th Congressional District seat at the end of last year to run for president.

Hogan is among the Republicans — including Kasich, the former Ohio governor, and former Massachusetts governor William Weld — who are considering challenging Trump in the 2020 primaries.

For months, some so-called “Never Trump” Republicans have been urging Hogan to challenge Trump. The governor has largely demurred, without closing the door completely to the possibility. A spokesperson said recently that the governor will travel to New Hampshire after the end of the General Assembly session in April to speak at an event that bills itself as a “must stop” for presidential hopefuls.

A news release from Delaney’s campaign on Thursday was headlined, “Delaney: Hogan Should Primary Trump.”

Delaney said in the release that “we need a Democrat in the White House” but it would help the country if Trump were challenged by his own party.

“Unless Republicans believe that Donald Trump is a fair and accurate representation of the Republican party as a whole, they should put up a challenger to run against him in the primary election. One of the biggest problems facing the country is that very few Republicans have shown the courage to stand up to Trump,” Delaney said.

After throwing projectiles and firecrackers for about an hour, a group of protesters tried to break the police line at the main parliament entrance but did not succeed. Riot police in the second line did not intervene, and a nearby water cannon was not used.

In previous rallies, opposition supporters have tried to enter the parliament or government buildings using smoke bombs and projectiles. Police have responded with tear gas.

National leaders, NGOs and others discussed, among other things, how to create more “sustainable patterns of consumption and production.” What really struck me in Nairobi, though, was what wasn’t discussed: the Green New Deal being pushed by Democratic Party politicians in the U.S.

This is surprising, in a way: It was the United Nations Environment Programme that first called for a “Global Green New Deal” in 2009, hoping to revive the world economy through investment in climate change-related sectors.

That extra word, “global,” suggests why international players today aren’t terribly enthused by the Democrats’ plan. The program -- or what little of it can be adduced from what’s now largely a slogan -- is focused entirely on green investment in the U.S. The basic notion that climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution seems to have been forgotten.

Don’t get me wrong: De-carbonizing the U.S. economy would be a big deal. A lot of good work can be and is being done. The Beyond Coal campaign supported by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News) has already helped shut down 285 of the country’s 500-plus coal-fired power plants and is aiming to close the rest by 2030. And getting climate change back onto the political agenda is important in and of itself. Nor should Republicans be allowed to use concerns about the growth of emissions in the developing world to stymie work on carbon mitigation at home.

Yet, fawning coverage of the Green New Deal rubs many in the developing world the wrong way. We’ve long known that an economy transitioning to a low-carbon growth path will both require investment and create jobs. But, the New Deal of the 1930s is simply not the right analogy. Then, economies across the world had enormous amounts of unused capacity that just needed to be put to work.

By contrast, a global low-carbon transition will require laying claim to resources that are productively employed in carbon-intensive sectors of the economy. It will be expensive. It will require sacrifice. And resources will need to flow more freely across national borders.

The New Deal framing and rhetoric is merely an extension of what the left of the Democratic Party has long argued about multiple other policy issues -- that special interests beholden to the one percent are holding back changes that would benefit all. This may well be true and the answer may indeed be greater and fairer redistribution. The original New Deal argued correctly that redistribution of resources would spur growth under the specific conditions of the Depression.

But, that hardly means that something similar is possible today -- that simply redistributing resources within the U.S. economy, through a program managed by the U.S. government, would be sufficient to address climate change as well as create general prosperity. Someone needs to remind the Democrats that when it comes to global problems such as climate change, much of the U.S. is itself the one percent. (In 2012, economist Branko Milanovic estimated that an average income of over $34,000 put you in into the global one percent.)

This group will have to sacrifice something if climate change is to be stopped. The truth is that the resources that Democrats want the U.S. government to appropriate and use domestically need instead to flow elsewhere in the world. That valuable finance and capacity is needed to help the developing world pay for cities that don’t stress the planet, to protect those who are losing livelihoods and homes because of climate change, and to ensure that everyone in the world has access to reliable, affordable and clean energy.

The good news is that much of this financing can actually pay for itself in the long run. Since Americans seem addicted to mid-century references, what we need isn’t a Green New Deal, but a Green Marshall Plan.

Meanwhile, the global one percent will have to adjust its expectations. Yes, people in America will have to eat fewer hamburgers. Yes, people in France and elsewhere will have to pay more for their petrol. Politicians who do not frankly tell the truth about the sacrifices these changes entail, about what will be lost and not just what will be gained, are no better than the older generation they loudly disdain.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang Within a ...","Seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be doing regularly inside caucus.

A burning question for observers of the SNC-Lavalin affair is whether former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, who publicly opposed actions of their government, will be cut loose from the Liberal caucus. While some, including former deputy prime minister Sheila Copps, urge retribution, others in the party admire these MPs and want them to stay on. Whatever the pair’s political future, my research around party discipline suggests they can expect some rough treatment and career drudgery in the Liberal caucus.

Over the past year, I have had the privilege of interviewing 125 current and former politicians and political staff for a book I am writing about how party discipline has intensified in Canada in recent years. A common theme raised by current and former members of cabinet, party leaders, party whips, private members and political staff is that everyone affiliated with a political party identifies as a member of a team. They form bonds as they go on a journey together to realize common goals. Sparring with adversaries occurs with the confidence that teammates have your back. Members understand they must never be a public distraction for the team leader.

Here are snippets of what some current MPs told me in the months before the SNC-Lavalin story:

In a government caucus, there are those in cabinet, and there are those working hard to join it. Backbenchers know that when they go astray of a certain whipped vote, it doesn’t help their ambitions. We keep saying this is a team sport, but the House of Commons was not set up to be a team sport. — Liberal MP

To rise above the party positions and the leadership’s positions that got you elected is a form of narcissistic conceit. For you to go out against the party line on something, guess what? People aren’t going to vote for you because you’re bucking the party line. It might be once in four years that you can take a different position. — Conservative MP

When I got elected, I naively expected that caucus was the place where MPs could have a free and frank discussion of issues of the day. The biggest single disappointment upon becoming an MP was finding that caucus meetings were structured to begin with the head table sort of providing us with our marching orders. — New Democratic Party MP

Within a political team, there is considerable deference to authority, and individual behaviour conforms to social and institutional norms. Many backbenchers — that is, members who are not part of cabinet — find national caucus meetings to be stifling rather than enlightening. The leadership says they should come to the microphone to share opinions, but there is so much fear that people bottle things up. They loathe the watchful eyes of powerful staff in the leader’s office and who appear to lack respect for the elected.

Some parliamentarians get annoyed that the party leadership, through the whip, seeks to influence behaviour by deciding on their assignments to particular committees, vetting their requests to be away from Ottawa, authorizing participation on parliamentary junkets and generally controlling who gets to speak in the House. A backbencher has shockingly little policy influence. Staying silent in caucus meetings, staying away from a vote in the House, offering no public comment and declining to share social media posts are the most common ways for them to publicly express dissent — except that in a political team a backbencher’s silence is equated with support.

Backbenchers are unfairly derided by pundits as trained seals who mindlessly follow their masters’ orders. In reality, they are interesting people who get involved in party politics hoping to make a difference. But too often independent thinking does give way to a team mentality. The transformation begins the moment they sign a “values contract” when they want to be nominated as party candidates. The contract is signed during the candidate vetting process to screen out people who might attract negative attention during a campaign and those unwilling to commit to the party’s core values, such as the principles articulated in the party constitution. The team ethos is reinforced through a daily barrage of digital messages, including hashtags that emphasize the team leader (such as #TeamTrudeau).

Most government backbenchers settle into a morale-zapping role of repeating approved messages, of jostling for the opportunity to speak in the House, of lobbying ministerial staff and of a public image as government cheerleaders. Those who want to be promoted cooperate with the leadership. Others focus on helping constituents with casework. Team players know not to stray too far from the party line in public.

It appears that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are less inclined to obey the normal rules of conduct for members of a governing party’s caucus. The corresponding erosion of trust between them and their Liberal colleagues, especially those holding positions of power, will likely cause them to be marginalized.

The worst part of being on the outs with the leadership is not the lost perks or privileges. In my interviews, current and former politicians informed me that the truly horrible bit is how political teammates treat nonconformists. Many members of a political team who praise ministers feel a duty to shun outcasts. Hardcore partisans and leader loyalists will be furious and/or deeply disappointed. Some will keep a distance so as not to jeopardize their own prospects of promotion. It can be difficult to distinguish them from those who find the whole matter too awkward to deal with.

The stories that some politicians across Canada shared with me about the downsides of team discipline are disconcerting. Social shunning can be very painful for those on the receiving end: a lack of eye contact, avoided conversation, people sitting on another side of the room, not being invited to come along for lunch or a drink, and so forth. Outside of caucus meetings, people in positions of power communicate their seething displeasure by ignoring phone calls and being slow to respond to messages. Fortunately, some parliamentarians who disagree with a renegade’s actions will nevertheless go out of their way to be kind, which is a pleasant contrast to those who hide behind a mask of fake smiles. But for the most part, being socially ostracized within a political team is the hardest part of going rogue — and the hurt is largely internalized because the timeworn principle of caucus confidentiality means the poor treatment cannot be publicly discussed.

Occasionally, independent thinkers bristle at the confines of party affiliation. Usually mavericks are lone wolves who gradually became isolated from the team. Months of fruitless internal agitation and social pinpricks erupt in a public outburst that marks the end of the parliamentarian’s time with the party. Those who can’t stomach the public worship of their party leader and the party line have a few options available to them: they can wait until someone else takes the helm; they can wreak havoc internally through various forms of civil disobedience and destabilizing the leader’s authority; they can sit as independents; cross the floor to another party; or relinquish their seat. On occasion a cluster of dissidents leave together to form their own parliamentary group to express a leadership breakdown, such as the Democratic Representative Caucus that split from the Canadian Alliance in 2001 or Québec Debout, which splintered off from the Bloc Québécois in 2018.

Much ink has been spilled in recent years about power imbalances in politics. In January 2018, Minister Patty Hajdu said in the House of Commons that “Parliament Hill features distinct power imbalances…It is a place where often the victimized individual is blamed for the harassment that she herself has experienced.” Still, very little is known about mobbing behaviours toward backbenchers within parliamentary caucuses. Understanding these dynamics is important, because a strong, healthy democracy requires that a diversity of points of view can be safely expressed.

The power imbalances in a governing party’s caucus are stark, given that a prime minister controls upward mobility. It is especially disconcerting when backbenchers affiliated with a governing party are portrayed as troublemakers when they question those in positions of authority. Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers in a majority government do not hold the cabinet and senior political staff to account.

Encouraging backbenchers to repeat government messages and to refer to “our government” fosters a mistaken identity. Backbenchers need reminding that they are not the government. Probing, pestering, seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be regularly doing in a respectful manner. The stars of any political team need to accept that they will be held to account, and they should offer meaningful opportunities for this to happen. They should offer clarity about what would go too far.

Political leaders say that caucus is the place to voice concerns, but in reality caucus is a structure that rewards conformity and frowns on disruption. Ministerial caucus advisory committees used in the Ralph Klein government in Alberta and adopted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper are noteworthy mechanisms that require ministers to engage in meaningful consultation with the caucus. But ensuring that caucus is a safe space for colleagues who challenge authority is another matter.

It would take someone with a strong backbone to advocate for minimum standards for how all members of a caucus should be treated, particularly ways to protect those involved in a reasonable disagreement with the team leader. Perhaps certain Liberal MPs — if they are not ousted from caucus — will explore culture change from within.

The hottest position in the Democratic presidential field this week is abolishing the Electoral College.

Elizabeth Warren kicked things off at a CNN town hall Monday night when the Massachusetts senator drew enthusiastic applause by saying: “Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.”

The next day, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said there was “a lot of wisdom” in abolishing the Electoral College. California Sen. Kamala Harris told late night host Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night that she’s “open to the discussion.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, tweeted a clip of him saying the Electoral College “has got to go.”

It’s the latest push by White House hopefuls to embrace a procedural tactic to rally the Democratic base, following similar calls to scrap the filibuster and increase the size of the Supreme Court. The 2020 candidates are tapping into Democratic anger after Donald Trump became the second Republican in five presidential elections to win the presidency through the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.

The Electoral College, a group that comes together every four years to technically elect the president, is enshrined in the Constitution and won’t be easy to eliminate. O’Rourke suggested a constitutional amendment to award the presidency to the winner of the popular vote.

Several Democratic-controlled states are pushing for a national popular vote. But rather than pass a constitutional amendment, these legislatures are joining the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a group of states that pledge to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote.

The compact only goes into effect when it includes states representing 270 electoral votes, the majority needed to win the White House. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis brought the current total to 181 when he signed a bill last week to join the compact, and the Democratic governors of Delaware and New Mexico also have bills on their desk.

Still, with legislative sessions winding down, there are no other states expected to join this year.

Warren endorsed the compact after her town hall. Patrick Rosenstiel of the group pushing the idea said in an interview that converting to a national popular vote is not a partisan issue.

“The way to do it is through state action and we would welcome Sen. Warren, President Trump, anyone who believes” in the popular vote, said Rosenstiel, a self-described “lifelong conservative Republican” who grew tired of his vote not factoring into presidential elections in reliably Democratic Minnesota.

Though the Electoral College favoured Trump in 2016, and some analysts predict it could give him an edge in 2020, it is not necessarily a pro-GOP institution. During Barack Obama’s presidency, many predicted he may benefit from an Electoral College advantage.

That led to criticism of the institution at the time from some Republicans, notably, Trump himself. “The electoral college is a disaster for democracy,” Trump tweeted on the evening of the 2012 election, before it was apparent Obama had also won the national popular vote.

Now that the institution made him president, Trump takes a warmer view. “The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play,” he tweeted Tuesday.

Critics say the Electoral College focuses attention on a handful of swing states at the expense of candidates campaigning throughout the country.

But defenders say the current system almost always lines up with the popular vote and is part of the way the country’s founders wanted to check popular passions and encourages attention to small states that may otherwise get passed over.

Some Democrats agree.

Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur running for the party’s presidential nomination, tweeted: “The problem with deciding Presidential elections via popular vote is that candidates would naturally campaign in urban areas with big media markets and their policies would follow suit. Better to have proportional electoral college votes in each state so you campaign everywhere.”

Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, another longshot Democratic candidate, dismissed the idea as a waste of time.

“It requires a constitutional amendment,” Delaney told CNN Wednesday. “I’d much rather focus on things that can get done.”

To understand Beto O’Rourke as a candidate, it’s vital to go beneath the surface of his political backstory. News watchers are already well aware of the former Texas congressman’s good looks, charisma, youthful energy and fundraising prowess. But most remain unaware of an inconvenient truth that could undermine the O’Rourke campaign among the people who matter most — the ones who’ll be voting to choose the Democratic presidential nominee next year.

O’Rourke is hardly eager for those upcoming voters to realize that the growth of his political career is rooted in an alliance with powerful Republicans that began 15 years ago. Or that he supported raising the minimum age for Social Security in 2012. Or that — during six years in Congress, through the end of 2018 — he often aligned himself with Republican positions.

If facts matter, such weighty facts could sink the “Beto for America” presidential campaign. Since his announcement, information gaining traction nationwide runs directly counter to the Beto brand.

“Before becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party,” the Wall Street Journal reported a week ago, “Beto O’Rourke relied on a core group of business-minded Republicans in his Texas hometown to launch and sustain his political career. To win their backing, Mr. O’Rourke opposed Obamacare, voted against Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader and called for a raise in the Social Security eligibility age.”

Meanwhile, a Washington Post news article — under the headline “Beto O’Rourke’s Political Career Drew on Donations From the Pro-Republican Business Establishment” — also foreshadowed a bumpy ride on the campaign trail. In the eyes of most people who don’t like the GOP, key points in the Post’s reporting are apt to be concerning. For instance:

+ “Several of El Paso’s richest business moguls donated to and raised money for O’Rourke’s city council campaigns, drawn to his support for a plan to redevelop El Paso’s poorer neighborhoods. Some later backed a super PAC that would play a key role in helping him defeat an incumbent Democratic congressman.” + “O’Rourke worked on issues that had the potential to make money for some of his benefactors. His support as a council member for the redevelopment plan, which sparked controversy at the time because it involved relocating low-income residents, many of them Hispanic, coincided with property investments by some of his benefactors.” + “As a congressman, he supported a $2 billion military funding increase that benefited a company controlled by another major donor. That donor, real estate developer Woody Hunt, was friends with O’Rourke’s late father. Hunt also co-founded and funds an El Paso nonprofit organization that has employed O’Rourke’s wife since 2016.”

Central features of Trumpism are budgets that add billions to already-bloated Pentagon spending while cutting essential programs. In Beto’s last year in Congress, when nearly one-third of House Democrats opposed the record-breaking 2019 National Defense Authorization Act of $717 billion, Beto voted with Trump. (Four senators who are running against O’Rourke voted no: Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.)

Overall, the Post reports, “in contrast to the aspirational image he has fostered in recent years,” O’Rourke’s political career has gone along a path of “winning support from a typically pro-GOP business establishment interested in swaying public policy. Born into one politically potent family and married into another, he benefited repeatedly from his relationships with El Paso’s most powerful residents, including several nationally known Republican moneymen.”

To put his more conservative actions in context, O’Rourke cannot plausibly claim that he was striving to be in sync with the voters who elected him. El Paso and the House district that O’Rourke represented are heavily Democratic. The Wall Street Journal summed up this way: “In a one-party town — the Democrats have held El Paso’s congressional seat for all but one term since 1902 — local Republicans viewed Mr. O’Rourke as one of their own.”

Naturally, O’Rourke would much rather talk in upbeat generalities than answer pointed questions about why anti-Republican voters should cast ballots for him — when he has a long record of going along with many GOP positions they find abhorrent. It may be better for him if unflattering coverage fixates instead on matters like youthful stints as a punk rocker and early computer hacker.

It was just seven years ago when — during his first run for Congress — O’Rourke did a campaign video to tell people in the blue West Texas district that “we’ll have to look at future generations . . . retiring at a later age, paying a greater percentage of their income into Social Security and making other necessary adjustments.” And, the Wall Street Journal reports, “in a candidate questionnaire published two days before the May 2012 primary, Mr. O’Rourke called for raising the Social Security eligibility age and means-testing federal entitlements.” According to exit polling, O’Rourke won that election with major help from Republicans who opted to vote in the Democratic primary and cast their ballots for him by a ratio of more than 7 to 1.

After becoming a congressman, O’Rourke backtracked and, as Politico reports, “co-sponsored legislation that would increase Social Security benefits — without raising the retirement age.” Yet his wobbly stance on Social Security in this decade is a warning flag.

O’Rourke affinity with Republican sensibilities related to corporate power has continued. So has largesse from interests that are the antithesis of progressive values. Notably, for his final term, Beto retired from the House as the member of Congress who was the second-highest recipient of campaign cash from the oil and gas industry.

In June 2015, O’Rourke was one of only 28 Democrats — out of 188 members of the party in the House — who voted to give President Obama the power to negotiate the corporate-oriented Trans-Pacific Partnership. The measure squeaked through the House, propelled by support from 190 Republicans.

A year later, the TPP was a highly visible and contentious issue at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, where hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates held anti-TPP signs. (I was one of those delegates and still support Sanders.) These days, O’Rourke is typically aiming to have it both ways, as Vanity Fair reported in a campaign kickoff cover story last week: “O’Rourke now says he would have voted ‘no’ on the ultimate agreement. But in 2015, he traveled with Obama on a trip to Asia to help build support for the deal.”

At the end of last year, the Guardian published an exhaustively researched article under the headline “Beto O’Rourke Frequently Voted for Republican Legislation, Analysis Reveals.” The piece reported that “even as O’Rourke represented one of the most solidly Democratic congressional districts in the United States, he has frequently voted against the majority of House Democrats in support of Republican bills and Trump administration priorities.”

Written by investigative journalist David Sirota (who days ago joined the Sanders presidential campaign as a speechwriter), the Dec. 20 article reviewed “the 167 votes O’Rourke has cast in the House in opposition to the majority of his own party during his six-year tenure in Congress. Many of those votes were not progressive dissents alongside other left-leaning lawmakers, but instead votes to help pass Republican-sponsored legislation.”

A cautionary tale comes from David Romo, an activist and historian in El Paso who describes Beto O’Rourke as a “masterful politician. . . It’s all fluff, it’s all style, it’s all looks.” Romo clashed with City Councilman O’Rourke when he went all-out for redevelopment that would enrich some of his wealthy backers. Romo said recently: “O’Rourke, because of his charisma, can kind of pull off some of this behind-the-scenes power peddling. He was the pretty face in the really ugly gentrification plan that negatively affected the most vulnerable people in El Paso.”

To the casual listener, however, O’Rourke might sound lovely. Consider this verbiage from the presidential campaign trail: “We want to be for everybody, work with everybody. Could care less about your party affiliation or any other difference that might otherwise divide us at this moment of truth, where I really feel we will either make or break this great country and our democracy.”

From O’Rourke, that kind of talk has sometimes overlapped with disinterest in defeating Republicans. Last year, while running for the Senate, O’Rourke helped a friend in need — Texas GOP Congressman Will Hurd — by notably refusing to endorse his Democratic opponent. Gina Ortiz Jones, a gay Filipina-American, had momentum in a district with a majority of Hispanics. But O’Rourke’s solidarity with his Republican colleague may well have saved Hurd’s seat.

Hurd won re-election by under one-half of a percentage point, while O’Rourke won in the district by a five-point margin. As the New York Times reported, O’Rourke “had elevated” his Republican colleague Hurd “with frequent praise and, most memorably, a live-streamed bipartisan road trip that helped jump-start their midterm campaigns.” During the campaign, O’Rourke tried to justify his refusal to endorse Hurd’s Democratic opponent by declaring: “This is a place where my politics and my job and my commitment to this country come into conflict. I’m going to put country over party.”

When Politico asked O’Rourke late last year whether he considered himself to be a progressive Democrat, O’Rourke replied: “I don’t know. I’m just, as you may have seen and heard over the course of the campaign, I’m not big on labels. I don’t get all fired up about party or classifying or defining people based on a label or a group. I’m for everyone.”

Everyone?

After O’Rourke campaigned in the Detroit area a few days ago, the Detroit Metro Times published information that would concern anyone with minimally progressive leanings: “He supported Republican efforts to limit the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established by Obama and Democrats to protect Americans from Wall Street following the recession. O’Rourke also broke with the party to support Trump and GOP attempts to loosen requirements in hiring border patrol agents; chip away at the Affordable Care Act; kill a ban on oil drilling in parts of the Gulf of Mexico; and lift the 40-year-old oil export ban. He also supported Republican legislation that protected utility companies that start wildfires.”

It’s understandable that many progressives came out of 2018 with a favorable view of O’Rourke. He ran a strong campaign that got remarkably close to unseating the odious Sen. Ted Cruz. Along the way, O’Rourke showed himself to be eloquent and tireless. Some of his stances are both enlightened and longstanding, as with his advocacy for legalizing marijuana. And O’Rourke provided some stunning moments of oratory, as in a viral video that showed his response to a question about NFL players kneeling in protest during the national anthem; his support for dissent in the context of civil rights history was exemplary.

Yet, overall, there’s a good reason why O’Rourke declines to call himself “progressive.” He isn’t. His alliances and sensibilities, when you strip away some cultural affinities and limited social-justice positions, are bedrock corporate.

In his quest for a Democratic nomination that will require support from a primary electorate that leans progressive, Beto O’Rourke will be running to elude his actual record.

Conservatives, remember how we complained 20 years ago about our government schools and their toxic self-esteem movement — the ...","Last week, Beto O’Rourke, who in November lost his bid to be a U.S. senator from Texas, announced to America with great excitement that he’s running for president of the United States. A beaming Beto left the unmistakable impression that he could not wait to run — for our benefit as well as his. Here was a grandiose opportunity to bestow the gift of his person upon the eagerly awaiting masses.

Beto O’Rourke’s announcement promised nothing less than a moment of truth — provided in the form of Beto O’Rourke. Practically hopping out of his seat, with his wife aside him on the verge of shaking pom-poms, the giddy, gushing 46-year-old proclaimed it “a defining moment of truth for this country.” He exudes a steady certainty that the electorate will not be able to get enough of him. Part childish, part girlish, he smacks of an American version of Justin Trudeau — i.e., a train-wreck.

But Beto doesn’t seem to see himself that way. He looks in the mirror, or the nearest camera, and he discerns that voters will not be able to take their eyes off him, just as they cannot take their eyes off Miss Democratic Socialist, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Beto and “AOC” are two shiny kids in the left’s ideological candy-store, clamoring for attention among the progressive kiddies who fawn over them like prom-king and prom-queen. They bask in the attention.

At 29 years old, with no life experience beyond college, waitressing, and bartending, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is confident that she can spearhead — as promised in her Green Red Deal — nothing less than a fundamental transformation of history’s most extraordinary nation. Knowing better than Jefferson and Madison and Washington and Adams and Hamilton and Franklin combined, she vows a mass plan to “mobilize every aspect of American society,” at a “national, social, and industrial level,” and “at a scale not seen since World War II.” One marvels at the sense of self-omniscience of this singular woman we’ve all been waiting for. She bears the wisdom of a thousand Ruths, a thousand Solomons, albeit one who has never met a payroll.

The three words that best describe Ocasio-Cortez also happen to best describe Beto O’Rourke: narcissism, narcissism, narcissism.

Meet the new stars of the new left, of the new Democratic Party.

Conservatives, remember how we complained 20 years ago about our government schools and their toxic self-esteem movement — the latest Deweyan fad of the day? We feared it was coddling and creating a nation of mediocrities puffed up with overinflated pride. Well, welcome to the egotistical results. The children of the self-esteem saps are now seeking affirmation and taking power, and (not surprisingly) with a striking arrogant ignorance.

These two — Beto and Ocasio-Cortez — typify the new narcissism of the New Left. They also typify its dimwittery. Indeed, rivaling the audacity of this pair’s displays of narcissism were their inane statements condemning capitalism.

At a coffee shop at a presidential-campaign stop in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, Beto airheadedly referred to capitalism, and specifically American capitalism, as “racist,” a distinctively human trait not typically applied to an economic ideology — but no doubt something Beto would have learned at Columbia University. “It is clearly an imperfect, unfair, unjust and racist capitalist economy,” surmised Mr. O’Rourke.

The statement would be laughable if not so outrageous and so corrosive. Not only is it viciously polarizing, but shamelessly patronizing as well as ludicrously untrue. Where does one start and end with examples of enormously successful African-American men and women, from Madam C. J. Walker (look her up) to Oprah Winfrey, from George Washington Carver to Herman Cain, from Ben Carson to LeBron James, from Michael Jackson to Michael Jordan? Ask my two Steelers buddies, Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell, both recent recipients of eight-figure contracts, if capitalism has discriminated against them lately. There are countless African-Americans with far more money than I (a despicable white male) will ever have, or that Beto has garnered in his short career of posing for pictures and begging for votes.

Shame on him. Such is the slop that passes as enlightened thinking in our silly universities, which Beto and Ocasio-Cortez are complete products of.

And yet, true to form, Beto hastened to pander and add generously: “I consider myself a capitalist.”

Well, then, by his own standard, Beto is a racist.

For her part, Ocasio-Cortez, at something called the “South by Southwest Conference & Festivals” in Austin, held forth on the vagaries of capitalism and the virtues of “democratic socialism.” The recent college grad defined capitalism as a system of “concentration of capital” whereby “we prioritize profit and the accumulation of money above all else.” She denounced capitalism as an “ideology of capital,” and said that, “to me, capitalism is irredeemable.”

This stands in stark contrast to the sunny world of “democratic socialism.” “When we talk about ideas like democratic socialism,” explained Ocasio-Cortez, “it means putting democracy and society first.”

Actually, that isn’t how Marx or Engels or Lenin or Trotsky would define democratic socialism, nor even Ocasio-Cortez’s organization, the Democratic Socialists of America.

Does she know that? Probably not. But neither did most of those drooling over her in Austin.

That’s the essence of the problem with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and with Beto O’Rourke. They don’t even know what they don’t know. And yet they speak with such sanctimonious assuredness.

One of the presidential hopefuls in the crowded Democratic Party field is generating some buzz with ideas not normally promoted by mainstream U.S. politicians.

Andrew Yang has made the rise of robots in the workplace a cornerstone of his campaign.

He says that automation has already destroyed more than four million American jobs. And he predicts that millions more will be eliminated in the next five to 10 years.

So in response, he's proposed a 10 percent value-added tax targeting digital giants like Amazon and Google.

""Once I understood the magnitude of this problem, and that even our most forward-thinking politicians were not going to take the steps necessary to stem the tide, I had no choice but to act,"" Yang states on his website. ""I’m the father of two young boys. I know the country my sons will grow up in is going to be very different than the one I grew up in, and I want to look back at my life knowing I did everything in my power to create the kind of future our children deserve—an America of opportunity, freedom, equality, and abundance.""

He told MSNBC that the digital giants won't leave America because other countries have value-added taxes with higher rates than what he's suggested.

Yang has also proposed a universal basic income in response to the rise of automation.

Yang's ""freedom dividend"" would give every American $1,000 per month, free and clear.

You can hear more about this idea in the video below.

Yang was born in upstate New York as the son of Taiwanese immigrants who met in grad school.

After studying economics and law, he worked for a while as a corporate lawyer before becoming an entrepreneur.

He founded Venture for America, which promotes entrepreneurialism in cities facing tough economic times.

South Peace News

Local leaders fear funding for a new college campus and dialysis in High Prairie could be in jeopardy in the upcoming provincial election.



Town of High Prairie Mayor Brian Panasiuk is concerned that funding could be lost for a new Northern Lakes College campus and renal dialysis at High Prairie Health Complex.



“Given these projects are not started I am concerned that the election could put these projects at risk,” Panasiuk says.



“Those two projects represent an investment of around $26 million in our community.”



An election must be held before June.



Premier Rachel Notley is expected to call the election after the throne speech March 18.



Ground was broken Sept. 24, 2018 for the new consolidated campus scheduled to open in fall 2020.



Funding of $21.6 million was announced March 27, 2017 by the New Democratic Party government.



Construction is set to start in the spring.



Funding of $5.2 million for a new dialysis clinic in the hospital was announced Feb. 6 and scheduled to open in 2020.



Another important issue for Panasiuk is to secure provincial funding for broadband in the region.



“Without provincial support, getting the town connected will be economically difficult,” Panasiuk says.



“During the election I would like to see us get a commitment to fund those projects from all political parties.”



College board chair Daniel Vandermeulen is more optimistic about the new campus.



“We hope funding won’t be jeopardized and we’d be surprised if it did,” he says.



He says construction is set to start in April and the college has awarded tenders.



Funding for broadband and potable water are the main priorities for Big Lakes County.



“The county would like the government to fund broadband and rural water distribution,” Reeve Richard Simard says.



“The county plans to move forward with broadband and we would like the government to come out with a provincial broadband strategy and subsequent funding for communities.”



Big Lakes County is already leading a pilot project to construct broadband in the region that includes High Prairie, Swan Hills and Indigenous communities in the county.",Leaders fear new gov’t could change priorities,southpeacenews.com,http://southpeacenews.com/leaders-fear-new-govt-could-change-priorities/

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) will not be there, her senior adviser told JNS.

“Senator Gillibrand was not planning to speak at the policy conference and will not be attending,” said Glen Caplin. “As she does every year, she will meet separately with her New York constituents.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro are not slated to go to the conference, known as the largest annual pro-Israel gathering, reported the Associated Press.

Harris addressed the 2017 policy conference.

Sanders skipped the conference in 2016 as a presidential candidate. He reportedly offered to address the conference remotely, citing scheduling conflicts, but was denied by AIPAC. Instead, Sanders released a speech of what he would’ve said had he been in attendance.

Sanders’s policy director Josh Orton confirmed his upcoming absence, saying the senator is “concerned about the platform AIPAC is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a two-state solution.”

Citing a scheduling conflict, former Rep. John Delaney will not be in attendance.

“He’s attended the conference every year since he’s been in Congress, and he very much looks forward to being back next year,” deputy press secretary Ahmed Elsayed told the AP.

Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., who has formed an exploratory committee, also relayed via a spokesperson that he will not be at the AIPAC conference, reported The New York Jewish Week.

JNS reached out to the remaining candidates to see whether or not they plan on attending, but has not received comment. They include Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen.

Or was it just another slip of the tongue by the former vice-president with a reputation for veering off script?

In a keynote speech at a dinner for the Delaware Democratic Party, Biden boasted Saturday that he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.” The only problem is that Biden hasn’t announced whether he will launch a third run for the White House, despite repeatedly teasing the possibility.

He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then adding “I didn’t mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.

Although Biden has been known to go off script, his remark is likely to be viewed as a Washington-style gaffe — a case of accidentally telling the truth.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going.

We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.

A new Israel political advocacy organization called Pro-Israel America has been launched in the US to help voters identify pro-Israel Congressional candidates to vote for and donate to their political campaigns.



The organization formally launched on Tuesday and announced its endorsement of 27 candidates for races for 2020 Congressional races, including 13 Republicans and 14 Democrats who have been strong advocates for the US-Israel alliance.

Speaking to The Jerusalem Post, Executive Director of Pro-Israel America Jeff Mendelsohn said that there were “growing challenges” to the US-Israel relationship and that there is a need to get more pro-Israel members of the public involved in efforts to bolster it.Concern has been voiced of late regarding support in the Democratic Party for Israel and a new poll by the Pew Research Center published last week found that support for Israel among Democrats is at a two-decade low.Pro-Palestinian freshmen members of Congress, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, have shaken the Jewish establishment by strongly challenging US and Democratic support for Israel, although antisemitic statements made by the pair have generated considerable push-back.Mendelsohn, who has previously worked as the national outreach director for AIPAC, remains positive, however, that support for Israel and America’s relationship with the Jewish state within the Democratic Party is still high.“Democrats in Congress remain strong in their support for Israel, and while there are always people who disagree, there is still tremendous support for the relationship,” he said.Mendelsohn argued that there is an untapped wellspring of support for Israel among the general US public, and that Pro-Israel America was coming to “galvanize” that support and provide a mechanism for such people to express that support.The organization’s website will serve as a resource to help people identify which candidates in their districts are pro-Israel and which have been endorsed by the organization. It will also provide the means to donate to such candidates’ political campaigns directly or through the Pro-Israel America PAC itself.“We see a need and an opportunity to get more people involved in the process on both sides of the aisle, and to create a one-stop shop to get them information about candidates and congressional races, and provide voters with online resource to show the opinions of the candidates,” said Mendelsohn.The organization will not, however, be targeting candidates it believes are unsupportive of the US-Israel relationship. The organization was endorsed by former congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and former senator Joe Lieberman.

Addressing a press conference here, Sabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajam (SASS) General Secretary Erode Rajan said that they have been meeting various parties in the national capital with their 18-point charter of demands and whoever agrees to it will get its full support.

“There are about 4.5-5 crore devotees of Ayyappa from southern states and elsewhere. Every devotee has at least four voters in his/her family, that makes it 20 crore voters in all… We have decided that whoever supports our demands, will get our backing. We will issue instructions to the devotees to that effect,” he said.

The SASS gave its charter to the Communist Party of India-Marxist, which leads the Left Democratic Front government in the state, on Tuesday, and will give the same to the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress on Wednesday. It said it expected to get a reply from them within two to three days.

The decision was taken at a National Executive meeting held by the SASS during February 23-24 in Bengaluru.

A controversy erupted in Kerala after the Supreme Court’s September 28, 2018 verdict allowing women of all ages entry to Sabarimala, the ancient temple of deity Ayyappa, who is considered a celibate according to legends.

The temple has become a hotbed for clashes between the Ayyappa devotees who are against the decision and those who support it.

The other demands of the Samajam include, taking Sabarimala and other temples connected with it taken out of government control and handed over to an autonomous body made up of devotees and temple authorities.

The resolution is seen to benefit the BJP, which has been opposing the entry of women to Sabarimala and is now very likely to accept the demands also.

Getty Images Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announces her presidential bid in front of a crowd gathered at Boom Island Park on Feb. 10, 2019, in Minneapolis.

Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said President Donald Trump's rhetoric exacerbated tensions and called for him to condemn bigotry against Muslims.

""I don't think you can actually take each of the murderous acts and say what role Donald Trump played, but I can tell you this: his rhetoric doesn't help,"" Klobuchar said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""And many of these people, whether it was the person who tried to bomb Barack Obama or this murderer in New Zealand, have cited Donald Trump along the way.""

Klobuchar spoke with CNN from Iowa as she vies for her party's presidential nomination to challenge Trump next year. She said after the recent attack on Muslims in New Zealand, it was ""on all of us to condemn this hate,"" including Trump.

""He, at the very least, should be giving strong statements, public speeches, defending Muslims in this world,"" Klobuchar said.

Trump said on Friday after the shooting he had called New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but when asked about white nationalism, he said he did not regard it as a growing threat.

Available data suggest white nationalism is a rising, violent threat in the United States, as CNN noted in a fact check on Trump's comments.

In Sunday's interview, Klobuchar also defended the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, who Trump attacked on Twitter over the weekend. Klobuchar called the tweets ""outrageous"" and invoked McCain's memory as she called for unity in the wake of the New Zealand massacre.

""John believed, as I believe, that when a tragedy happens like in New Zealand, you do all you can to reach out to that country and you do all you can to stand up for the simple belief that people are different in our country, but we were all part of a greater America,"" Klobuchar said.",Klobuchar after New Zealand attack: Trump's 'rhetoric doesn't help',channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/klobuchar-after-new-zealand-attack-trumps-rhetoric-doesnt-help/1060178778

Speaking to reporters before beginning the third day of her campaign along the river Ganga on Wednesday, she said, “BJP has systematically attacked every democratic institution in the country in the last five years. You all know it better than I do.

“So I think the Prime Minister should stop thinking that people are fools and understand that they see through all his antics.”

On Wednesday, Priyanka, who is also Congress’ in-charge of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, is in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency, Varanasi.

Starting her day with an interaction with party workers at the Chunar Fort, she paid tributes to Lal Bahadur Shastri at the Shastri Chowk and Shastri Memorial, the house of the former Prime Minister in his ancestral village Ramnagar.

Congress workers followed her around raising slogans like “Gali gali me shor hai, chowkidar’ chor hai” and “Dahan karne Modi ki Lanka, aa gai behen Priyanka”.

Locals seemed motivated by the Congress leader’s arrival in their midst, with many pointing out her resemblance to her grandmother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

Sanjay Kumar said, “Her arrival augurs a change. People are looking for a new ideology. Now people want to get away from the politics of temple and mosque.”

“We have felt helpless in the last five years, we feel cheated by the government,” he added.

Shahnawaz, another local told IANS, “The BJP has not lived up to our expecations. We see a hope in Priyanka Gandhi and the Congress.”

Priyanka took the boat ride from the Ramnagar Ghat to Assi Ghat, where she will interact with the locals — mainly fishermen, people of the Jain community and women.

Later in the day, the Congress leader will offer prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple on the Dashashwamedh Ghat.

This will be Priyanka’s fourth temple visit since March 18, when she kicked off her river ride from Prayagraj on Monday.

On Monday, she visited the famous Hanuman Mandir in Prayagraj, followed by trips to the Sita Samahit Sthal temple in Bhadohi’s Sitamarhi and the Vindhyavashini temple in Vindhyachal on the second day of her campaign. She also offered a chadar at Kantit Sharif dargah on Tuesday.

The Congress leader will also meet her party workers in Varanasi and visit the homes of three Central Reserve Force Police (CRPF) troopers who died in the February 14 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama.

She will meet the family members of Avadhesh Yadav in Chandauli district. On her way back to Varanasi, she will meet the families of Vishal Pandey and Ramesh Yadav.

8:55 p.m.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren supports a new flag for Mississippi, which is the only state to have Confederate imagery on it.

Warren made the comment Monday at a CNN town hall broadcast from Jackson, the state’s capital, in the middle of a three-day swing through the South. The Mississippi state flag’s use of a Confederate battle emblem was legally challenged in 2017, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

The Massachusetts senator gave a succinct answer to the appreciative crowd in Mississippi when asked about the state flag: “Yes,” Warren said, the state should choose a new one.

___

8:35 p.m.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is embracing a congressional proposal to study a framework for reparations to African-Americans hurt by the legacy of slavery as the best way to begin a “national, full-blown conversation” on the issue.

Warren first voiced support for reparations last month, becoming one of three 2020 Democratic candidates to do so. But her comments about a study on reparations, made Monday night during a CNN town hall broadcast from Mississippi, mark a keener focus from the Massachusetts senator on her preferred route to tackle the thorny question of how best to deal with systemic racial inequality.

The Democratic field’s ongoing debate over reparations comes as African-American voters are poised to exert significant influence over the selection of the party’s nominee to take on President Donald Trump.

The political constituencies of Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir (11.1%) of former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti, Kottayam (12.3%) of Kerala ...","A new technique can measure by parliamentary constituency in India, which has the world’s largest number of malnourished children, according to a new study.

The analysis shows 72 of 543 parliamentary constituencies in the top two quintiles (20%) of prevalence of child indicators: stunting, low weight for age, wasting and anaemia. Of these, 12 constituencies are in Jharkhand, 19 in Madhya Pradesh, 10 in Karnataka, eight in Uttar Pradesh and six in Rajasthan.

Many experience multiple forms of malnutrition, which should be addressed “on priority”, says the study, published January 2019 in the journal Economic and Political Weekly.

Currently, since the boundaries of Lok Sabha constituencies and districts do not overlap, constituencies’ performance cannot be measured because data are measured by district.

Malnutrition retards learning, employability and economic growth. Yet, in a country with 46.6 million stunted children--about one third of the world’s burden, which will make India lose up to $46 billion by 2030--malnutrition has almost never been an electoral issue.

“We wanted to initiate a discussion around the importance of collecting data at the political constituency level and the value of making political constituency identifiers available in routinely collected surveys and the Census,” said SV Subramanian, a co-author and professor of population health and geography, Harvard University, in an email interview. “What better way to make research outcomes more relevant to policymakers than by measuring indicators in areas where policymakers are directly responsible?”

The means for stunted (low height for age), underweight (with low weight for age), wasted (low weight for height) and anaemic (low haemoglobin) children are 35.9%, 33.5%, 20.7% and 56.8%, respectively, meaning almost a third of children under five are stunted and underweight, a fifth are wasted and more than half are anaemic.

Across parliamentary constituencies nationwide, the proportion of stunted children under five ranged from 15% to 63.6%; of underweight children from 11.1% to 60.9%; of wasted children from 5.9% to 39.6%; and of anaemic children from 17.8% to 83.6%.

Multiple forms of malnutrition were observed especially in Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, India’s sixth- and fifth-poorest states by per capita income, and should be addressed with the “highest priority”, said the authors, who developed new methods to calculate malnutrition data--available only by district--by parliamentary constituency, which do not overlay on district boundaries.

How are high-profile constituencies doing?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh fares worse on malnutrition indicators than the constituencies of eight cabinet colleagues. For children under five, Varanasi has a stunting prevalence of 43.1%, higher than average of 35.9% and ranking 124 from the bottom.

While these indicators do not directly reflect the performance of members of parliament (MPs) elected in 2014, since they are based on the latest national family health survey--which was conducted in 2015-16, and nutrition indicators take years to change--they do reveal the nutrition status of the constituency.

Modi was elected from Varanasi for the first time in 2014, but the constituency has been with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 2009. A majority of Modi’s eight cabinet ministers from the Lok Sabha have constituencies in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

Among other parties, Karnataka’s Gulbarga constituency of the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, the Congress party’s Mallikarjun Kharge, fared the worst among 18 high-profile constituencies--analysed by IndiaSpend based on the paper--with 49.7% prevalence--one in every two children being stunted.

INC president Rahul Gandhi’s Amethi constituency in Uttar Pradesh and his Congress party colleague Jyotiraditya Scindia’s Guna in Madhya Pradesh ranked second and third from the bottom by stunting, after Gulbarga among those we compared.

Kharge has been elected from the same seat since 2009, Gandhi since 2004 and Scindia since 2002.

Thiruvananthapuram (18.5%) in Kerala, the Lok Sabha constituency of the Congress party’s Shashi Tharoor, and Telangana’s Hyderabad (20.6%) constituency of All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen’s Asaduddin Owaisi, are the best performers by stunting among 18 high-profile constituencies we compared. Tharoor has been elected from Thiruvananthapuram since 2009 and Owaisi from Hyderabad since 2004.

Best and worst constituencies by malnutrition

IndiaSpend used the findings of study and added data on members of parliament for each constituency, and visualised them on maps below.

Stunting: Parliamentary constituencies in central and northern India--especially Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, together home to about 400 million or 31% of Indians--have the highest proportion of stunted children under five years.

Constituencies with the highest proportion of stunted children are all in Uttar Pradesh: Bahraich (63.6%) of Sadhvi Savitri Bai Phule who quit the BJP to join the Congress in March 2019, Shrawasti (61.3%) of BJP’s Daddan Mishra, and Kaisarganj (59.7%) of BJP’s Brijbhushan Sharan Singh.

Parliamentary constituencies in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have the lowest burden of stunting, with the lowest all in Kerala: Kollam (15%) of the Revolutionary Socialist Party’s N K Premachandran, and Alappuzha and Mavelikkara (15.4%) of the INC’s K C Venugopal and Suresh Kodikunnil, respectively.

Underweight: Prevalence of low-weight-for-age follows the same trend as stunting. Parliamentary constituencies with the highest proportion of underweight children are Singhbhum in Jharkhand (60.9%) of the BJP’s Laxman Giluwa, Purulia in West Bengal (54.1%) of the All India Trinamool Congress’ Mriganka Mahato, and Budaun in Uttar Pradesh (52.7%) of the Samajwadi Party’s Dharmendra Yadav.

Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura have the lowest proportion of underweight children.

The political constituencies of Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir (11.1%) of former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti, Kottayam (12.3%) of Kerala Congress’ Jose K Mani (who has since been nominated to the upper house), and Inner Manipur (12.5%) of INC’s Thokchom Meinya have the lowest proportion of underweight children.

Why measuring malnutrition by constituency matters

In 1993, the government began the member of parliament local area development scheme (MPLADS), which gives each member of parliament Rs 5 crore for development projects in their parliamentary constituency. Over 26 years to 2016, MPs have received Rs 31,833 crore in all.

Among the uses for MPLADs money for health purposes have been purchase of equipment for local hospitals, ambulances, hearses, outdoor gyms, etc. as per the paper.

Measuring malnutrition data by constituency could not only help MPs make informed choices but provide more information to voters, which would decrease the likelihood that the funds would be used for political considerations, the authors said.

“We hope that voters, advocates, and fellow policy makers will use this data to hold MPs accountable for the health of their constituents,” said Subramanian, on behalf of seven co-authors. “Our methodology provides a framework for replicating our study for infinitely many population indicators, for instance wealth, literacy, crime, life expectancy, etc.”

Malnutrition data and political accountability

As the Harvard researchers did with malnutrition data, future studies could similarly analyse the relationship between parliamentary constituencies and population indicators, voting behaviour, approval ratings, duration of tenure, political dynasties and other performance indicators, the authors said.

“Political constituency-wise data has great potential for research,” said Rahul Verma, fellow at the New Delhi think-tank Centre for Policy Research. “For example it will allow us to study the relationship between electoral patterns and development indicators, whether voter turnout rates are related to the infrastructure development of the constituencies, etc.”

Whether this information could improve political accountability or increase voter awareness is unclear, said Verma, who was not associated with the Harvard study. “However, this kind of research is welcome and even though the results or methodology may not be perfect it is worthwhile to analyse this data,” he said.

Data by political constituency on development indicators can improve accountability, but it is better if these data consider the performance of development programmes than an indicator such as child growth, which takes time to change, said Purnima Menon, senior research fellow with the Institute for Food and Policy Research, a research advocacy.

“For example, how health and ICDS [Integrated Child Development Services] services, school enrolment and quality of services work in their constituency, these are more actionable in the time frames that MPs and MLAs are in power and they likely have more instruments available to change some of these,” said Menon.

The Associated Press





And then there was one more. And maybe one more still to come?

The large crop of Democrats who want to be president grew, technically, when New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand changed her status Sunday from exploring a 2020 White House run to becoming a full-fledged candidate. She'd spent more than a month visiting states to gauge support for a campaign, so voters likely considered her already in the race.

Not yet in, but perhaps tantalizingly close is former Vice-President Joe Biden, who told Delaware Democrats in a speech Saturday night that he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.” He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then added, “I didn't mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.

Biden has been known to go off script, so it not clear whether his remark could turn out to be a case of accidentally telling the truth.

But on Sunday, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who was at the Delaware Democrats' dinner, told ABC's “This Week,” ”Well, I'm very optimistic that Joe Biden will soonformally announce his campaign for the presidency.“

One hopeful, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, said he has met a fundraising threshold to participate in this summer's debates. He said he has received donations from more than 65,000 individual donors.

The Democratic National Committee said last month up to 20 candidates can qualify for the debates by collecting donations from at least 65,000 individuals, with at least 200 unique donors in at least 20 states. They also can qualify by reaching 1 per cent support in at least three national or early primary state polls.

In an email to supporters, Buttigieg said “we weren't even close” to 65,000 donors when the party announced the requirement, but that more than 76,000 people have now donated.

The debates will be held in June and July.

Another busy day of weekend campaigning has former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke in Wisconsin, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in Iowa and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in Tennessee.","New York Sen.

There have also been ...","Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has faced massive criticism from Germany's local authorities after his federal budget plans show he wants to slash their means for integrating refugees and asylum-seekers.

But at a press conference on Wednesday after a meeting of Angela Merkel's cabinet, Scholz insisted that his plans fit in with the budgets already agreed with the local governments. ""We have made over €4 billion ($4.5 billion) available this year,"" Scholz said, presenting the main points of his 2020 budget, and his plans until 2023. ""The question is now how we work with the room that was agreed.""

The final 2020 budget is due to be finalized in June, with Scholz planning to raise the country's annual spending by 1.7 percent to €362.6 billion ($411.6 billion).

Several federal government budget regulations for refugees are set to expire at the end of 2019 (though, as Scholz pointed out, these rulings were already an extension of what was offered in 2018) and the government is out to streamline allowances: currently amounting to a €670 flat fee per person going through the asylum process, as well as fees for integration work, and for support for accommodating recognized refugees.

Scholz, of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), plans to replace those payments with a single fee per asylum-seeker to cover the first five years after their arrival. Local governments have said this will effectively halve their current budget for refugees.

Local authorities have warned that cuts could make it more difficult for them to integrate asylum-seekers

Reigniting anger over refugees

This proposal raised a storm of objections from regional governments: even those run by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Merkel's own party and the nominally more fiscally conservative part of her coalition.

The CDU state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, said that Scholz's proposals would only ""provoke tax hikes from local authorities for refugees."" This would, he predicted to the Rheinische Post newspaper on Tuesday, ""spark a conflict that we are were only just able to assuage with some effort.""

The criticism was echoed by Helmut Dedy, head of the Association of German Cities, which represents local governments at national level. ""The federal and state governments must find a way of meeting the real costs of local authorities of the refugees,"" he told the DPA news agency.

Scholz countered on Wednesday that the government was in constant talks with the local governments, and that Germany needed time to come up with long-term plans for asylum-seekers anyway.

""I don't think it would serve anyone's interests if we say we'll do it in 2021 like this, and then in 2022 like that, and in 2023 we'll see,"" he told reporters. ""Instead maybe it'd be good if we came to an arrangement, now that the number of refugees has gone down and there's less pressure, so that if in 2027 there's a new situation where we have great challenges to face we don't have to renegotiate all these questions.""

There have also been complaints from other conservative-led departments, most notably the Defense Ministry which may not be getting enough extra money to meet Germany's promise to raise military spending to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2025.

Merkel defended the budget plans on Tuesday, saying that the medium-term plans being presented by Scholz did not necessarily represent real spending on the military over the next few years. ""The real spending is what is important, and they have always been corrected upwards,"" she said at a conference on Tuesday.

Germany has promised to raise its defense spending over the next few years

Development Minister Gerd Müller, of the Christian Social Union (CSU), has also said he would only agree to the new budget with reservations since his budget is projected to drop by €7 billion over the next four years.

The 'black zero'

Conservative politicians are perhaps still smarting from the departure in 2017 of veteran CDU Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who took a special pride in balancing the country's books, maintaining what Germans like to call die schwarze Null – ""the black zero.""

In fact, Scholz has also pledged that Germany would take on no new debts under the new budget, despite presiding over a weaker economy and therefore a lower tax yield than his predecessor.

Yet some CDU politicians are grumbling that Scholz is being inconsistent: ""If on the one hand, he says that the times of plenty are over, but on the other hand says Germany can afford nearly everything … that doesn't fit together,"" the CDU's Eckhardt Rehberg told rbb public radio. ""I expect clear priorities from a finance minister and a stringent budget line, as we came to expect from Wolfgang Schäuble.""

Predictably, Scholz's SPD colleagues defended their minister. Speaking to the ARD public broadcaster on Wednesday morning, SPD budget policy spokesman Johannes Kahrs rejected the criticism, arguing, ""I think Olaf Scholz has done everything right if everyone is complaining.""",Germany to cut refugee cash in new budget,dw.com,https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-cut-refugee-cash-in-new-budget/a-47987401

As a young bartender of limited means, she was able to not only win the Democratic nomination for her constituency in New York City, she defeated Joe Crowley, one of the most ...","Angela Merkel has announced that this will be her last term as German chancellor. This has created some concern, as many credit her with navigating her country, the European Union and even the global community through many stormy waters in recent years.

When we look around the world, however, we see that there is no reason to fear. Numerous politicians of tremendous integrity are stepping forward. What’s striking is how many of these leaders are women.

Though Elizabeth May remains the only Green Party member of Parliament, non-partisan Canadians tend to trust her word above all others with regard to happenings in government.

In 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau purposely chose a significant number of women to form his cabinet. Is it a coincidence that among them are the very people who have put their own careers on the line by questioning the ethics of his administration?

The recent mid-term congressional elections in the United States also unleashed the power of women of integrity in politics. The number of women now serving in both houses of Congress is 127, the highest in history.

Of the 116 women recently elected, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been the most visible. However, she is not the only person challenging the status quo. Other new members in the U.S. include the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress, Indigenous women and representatives of other significant minority groups.

The vast majority of American citizens have watched their democratic rights diminish over the last several decades as the result of the influence of corporatist lobbyists, who pay for ‘their guy’ to get elected, as well as by their own increasing political apathy.

These new congressional representatives, however, are stepping forward and saying, “Enough is enough! This is a democracy, of the people, by the people and for the people, and our government is failing us. We need to make changes.”

They’re empowering the common person to take part in the political process.

What’s also incredibly hopeful is the similarity in background of many of the new representatives. A significant number are relatively young women from immigrant backgrounds. They seem to have come from nowhere in the last few years to take their places in one of the most powerful and influential law-making bodies in the world.

The fact is they didn’t come out of nowhere and that’s what’s most encouraging. They have a history of grassroots social activism and community involvement.

Ocasio-Cortez sparked tremendous hope and interest due to the uniqueness of her story. As a young bartender of limited means, she was able to not only win the Democratic nomination for her constituency in New York City, she defeated Joe Crowley, one of the most powerful Democrats in the House of Representatives. Her approach required limited financial investment and relied on a message of empowerment to previously disempowered citizens.

Of course, it’s not only women who are capable of leading with integrity, and it’s not only the young who have the courage to stand up to corruption. Every citizen, elected or not, has the responsibility of holding their government accountable.

It is, however, encouraging and inspiring to see women take on these roles in our legislatures.

The Year of the Woman in 2018 was one of significant change. Those who put themselves on the line to be champions of integrity deserve our support, and they call on all of us to be active citizens and do the right thing.

Addressing the Muslim community, she stressed, ""New Zealand mourns with you, we are one.""

People across the country observed the Muslim call to prayer, with thousands gathering at Hagley Park opposite the Al Noor mosque, where many died last week. Thousands more were listening in on radio or watching on television as the event was broadcast live. The prayer was followed by two minutes of silence.

A day earlier, Ardern announced a ban on sales of ""military-style"" semi-automatic firearms and high-capacity magazines. ""Every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack on Friday will be banned,"" she said.

Later Friday, thousands of people gathered for a mass funeral to bury 26 of the victims of the mosque attacks. The funeral took place at a Muslim cemetery where more than a dozen of the 50 killed last week had already been laid to rest.

At the Al Noor mosque on Friday, hundreds of Muslim men sat in socks or bare feet readying for the prayer. One man in the front row was in a Christchurch Hospital wheelchair.

The Al Noor mosque's imam, Gamal Fouda, thanked New Zealanders for their support.

""This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology. ... But, instead, we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable,"" the imam said.

""We are broken-hearted but we are not broken. We are alive. We are together. We are determined to not let anyone divide us,"" he added as the crowd erupted with applause.

Fahim Imam, 33, returned to his hometown for the service. He left Christchurch three years ago and now lives in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city.

""It's just amazing to see how the country and the community have come together - blows my mind, actually,"" Imam said before the event.

When he got off the plane Friday morning, he saw someone holding a sign that said ""jenaza,"" denoting Muslim funeral prayer. He said others were offering free rides to and from the prayer service.

""The moment I landed in Christchurch, I could feel the love here. I've never felt more proud to be a Muslim, or a Kiwi for that matter. It makes me really happy to be able to say that I'm a New Zealander,"" Imam said.

He called it surreal to see the mosque where he used to pray surrounded by flowers.

Forty-two people died at the Al Noor mosque and seven at the nearby Linwood mosque. One person shot at one of the mosques died later at a hospital.

The gun legislation is supported not only by Ardern's liberal Labour Party but also the conservative opposition National Party, so it's expected to pass into law. New Zealand does not have a constitutional right to bear arms.

Among those planning to attend Friday's observance was Samier Dandan, the president of the Lebanese Muslim Association in Sydney and part of a 15-strong delegation of Muslim leaders that had flown to Christchurch.

""It was an ugly act of terrorism that occurred in a beautiful, peaceful city,"" Dandan said.

He said his pain couldn't compare with that of the families he'd been visiting who had lost loves ones. He was inspired by their resilience, he said.

""And I've got to give all my respect to the New Zealand prime minister, with her position and her actions, and it speaks loud,"" he said.

Ismat Fatimah, 46, said it was sad to look at the Al Noor mosque, which was still surrounded by construction barricades, armed police officers and a huge mound of flowers and messages.

""We're feeling stronger than before, and we are one,"" she said.

She said she prayed for the people who died.

""I'm just imagining what would be happening last Friday,"" she said. ""People were running around so scared and helpless. It's just not right.""

Erum Hafeez, 18 said she felt comforted by the overwhelming response from New Zealanders: ""We are embraced by the community of New Zealand, we are not left behind and alone.""

The budget tabled by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, the Liberal government’s last before an October election in which such efforts are expected to feature, would allocate $19.4 million over four years to launch and run a Digital Democracy Project to “support research and policy development on online disinformation in the Canadian context.”

It said that foreign influence and disinformation campaigns had in recent years “created new avenues for malicious actors to interfere with the democratic process, as evidenced by numerous attempts to influence election outcomes around the world, including in well-established Western democracies.”

The funding adds to a $7.5 million Digital Citizen Initiative commitment to support digital, news, and civic literacy programs and tools.

The creation of false news and the often automated distribution of such content on social media sites has been cited as a factor in the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. election and in Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in the same year.

The 2016 U.S. election also featured hacking of political party networks, as did the French presidential election of Emmanuel Macron in 2017.

The budget also provides for $4.2 million in additional funding over three years for the Communications Security Establishment to provide cyber security advice and guidance to Canadian political parties and election administrators.

The government said the investment in a Digital Democracy Project would also enable Canada to lead an international effort to develop guiding principles that would then be adopted as a framework for “efficient cooperation between governments, civil society organizations, and online platforms.”",Morneau offers new money to fight spread of false news,National Observer,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/03/19/news/morneau-offers-new-money-fight-spread-false-news

“We would specifically like her to sign on the Green New Deal, and to take a pledge with 100 other congress people not to take fossil fuel money,” said Michael Smith, a 60-year-old La Jolla resident and volunteer with SanDiego350.

“I’m concerned that our political representatives aren’t taking the climate crisis seriously enough,” he added. “As a result, I have real fears that my kids and grand kids are not going to have a habitable planet to live on.”

In response to the protesters, Davis released this statement: “The Green New Deal is an excellent aspirational piece, but it is not legislation. I look forward to working with the community and my colleagues in Congress to look at all the elements of the Green New Deal as climate change legislation progresses.”

The resolution, spearheaded by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for, among other things, pumping federal funding into renewable energy and creating new jobs. The overarching goal of the deal is to phase out fossil fuels while reducing economic inequality.

I have real fears that my kids and grand kids are not going to have a habitable planet to live on. — Michael Smith, a 60-year-old La Jolla resident and volunteer with SanDiego350

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has set up a vote on the Green New Deal later this month. While the Republican-dominated Senate isn’t expected to pass the resolution, the vote could serve to draw battle lines within the Democratic Party between moderates and its more progressive wing.

Climate activists across the country have held up the resolution as a major test for lawmakers, ramping up pressure in recent months on members of congress who have supported action on climate change but have stopped short of endorsing the resolution, such as San Diego-based representatives Davis and Scott Peters.

Representatives Juan Vargas and Mike Levin, both representing parts of the San Diego region, have voiced strong support for the Green New Deal.

The issue is shaping up to be a significant talking point in the 2020 presidential election. While Democratic hopefuls have seen it as a way to brandish their liberal credentials. Republicans have tried to brand the call to action as a socialist takeover.

If Green New Deal legislation eventually emerges, it will likely raise many tricky issues, such as whether to embrace nuclear power and how to address the economic fate of workers currently employed in the fossil fuel industry.

Tokyo will introduce the new visas in April in the hope of increasing the number of foreign workers with certain skills available to 14 industries said to be suffering from labor shortages.

According to the sources, the initial-round tests for the Specified Skill Type 1 visa for those hoping to work in the nursing care industry, which has the most serious shortage of labor, will be held in Manila from April 13 to 14. Their knowledge of Japanese words used specifically in nursing services will be examined as well.

The industry is expected to accept up to 60,000 foreign workers in five years through the new visas.

Skill tests will be conducted in Tokyo and Osaka on April 25 for prospective workers in the food service industry, and in Sapporo, Tokyo, Fukuoka and four other cities on April 14 for those hoping to work in the hotel industry, the sources said.

Foreigners who have completed three-year on-the-job training programs can obtain a Type 1 visa without taking the skill tests.

Tests will be held for the nursing care, food service and hotel industries first because the three sectors lack such training programs, the sources said, adding that tests in the remaining industries will take place in May.

Initially, skill tests were expected to be held in Vietnam to accept workers in the caregiving and restaurant industries, but none are scheduled to be held there because the country has yet to conclude a treaty with Japan to eliminate malevolent job brokers, the sources explained.

This spring, Ryerson University’s Faculty of Arts is launching the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson ...","× Expand John Garrison Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson Instructors believe the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson is an opportunity to elevate historically underrepresented groups.

In Canada, there are 338 members of parliament, 751 members of provincial and territorial legislatures and some 25,000 municipal councillors and mayors. Add to that the number of people who ran for office but were not elected, and Max Cameron, the director of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI), says there are currently more than 75,000 people across the country who are actively thinking about entering politics.

But Cameron believes that number could be higher, and its cohort more diverse, if only Canadians had a better understanding of the entry points and inner-workings of politics.

“There are so many good people who would never go into politics because they don’t find it appealing. They’re deterred by the idea of living in a fish bowl where everyone is looking at you or not wanting to deal with the attacks,” says Cameron. “But without those good people, it’s affecting the way our institutions are functioning.”

With this in mind, through the CSDI, the University of British Columbia launched a non-partisan “boot camp” in 2013 that teaches participants about the day-to-day life of Canadian politicians at the federal, provincial and city level, as well as experimenting with new concepts to improve our democratic institutions.

This spring, Ryerson University’s Faculty of Arts is launching the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson (IFLR), a program modelled after CSDI’s boot camp. Applications are now open and are due by April 1. The program, which costs $1,200, runs over three weekends in May and June and is open to anyone.

Unlike most professions, there’s no concrete training for politicians. The boot camp prepares the participants for the real world of politics, from learning the basics of parliamentary practices and procedures, to how to answer media questions, to how to pass legislation and work with other political parties. The participants also get advice from elected officials, scholars and political journalists who offer mentorship and share their experiences. So far, former NDP MP Peggy Nash and journalist Martin Regg Cohn are confirmed for the Ryerson program.

During the final weekend, participants will head to Ottawa for a mock parliamentary session at the House of Commons. The students will break into political parties, run caucus meetings and try to pass legislation, while also keeping up to date on breaking news and fielding questions from journalists.

Although some of the UBC program’s alumni have gone onto become politicians – like Heather Sweet who was elected to Alberta’s legislature, and Allison Patton, who is on Surrey’s city council – others have gone onto become elected officials in unions or as civil servants. “Whether a participant decides to run afterwards or not, they’ll know much better what the job of a parliamentarian entails,” says Cameron.

Hailey Graham participated in the UBC program in 2013 with political aspirations. “Politics is definitely for me and I think the Institute helped me realize it’s not for me right now, but one day,” says Graham, who is currently in law school in Vancouver.

One of the most enlightening experiences for Graham was learning how to become more self-reflective, something that’s prompted by the instructors throughout the program.

“One of my passions is to have more women in politics, so part of the reflective piece for me was thinking, ‘Who’s taking up space?’ or ‘Who is putting themselves forward into leadership positions right away?’ and ‘How do those people end up getting elected?’” says Graham. “The boot camp highlights those inconsistencies [between different groups of people].”

Cameron says integrating the self-reflective element – something the CSDI picked up from UBC’s medical school – is a way for participants to become better politicians. “It gives them the tools to listen, be more empathetic, find common ground and be able to work with people across party lines,” he says.

Instructors at both Ryerson and UBC’s programs believe that the boot camp is also an opportunity to help elevate groups who have historically been underrepresented in politics, like women, people of colour and LGBTQ- communities.

“For people who haven’t had a political voice or have been marginalized, [IFLR] helps them find ways in which they can articulate their own concerns and do it in the legislature,” says Pamela Sugiman, dean of Ryerson’s Faculty of Arts.

Cameron agrees.

“If you don’t encourage the people who are underrepresented to acquire the skills to be effective statespeople, then politics will be dominated by the same families and social classes as always. Part of our hope for the boot camp is to encourage more inclusion.”

The federal Liberals introduced the third budget of their government on Tuesday, with promises of new help for first-time homebuyers, seniors and digital news organizations.



All of it was announced without any plan for a balanced budget in the foreseeable future, even if the Liberals are re-elected.

The budget marked the last one that the Liberals will deliver before Canadians go to the polls on Oct. 21.

So now seems an appropriate time to look at what the Liberals have promised over their time in government — what they pledged when they were campaigning, what they said they would spend in their first budget, and see which ones they kept or didn't manage to achieve over their time in office.

Here are some commitments that the Liberals made in the 2015 election campaign, their first budget in office, the most recent one, and how they've panned out for Canadians:

Deficit

Campaign: In its 2015 campaign platform, the Liberal Party envisioned a fiscal approach with two anchors: balancing the budget by 2019 and reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 27 per cent. They expected a ""modest short-term deficit of less than $10 billion in each of the next two fiscal years — less than half the average [Stephen] Harper deficit of over $20 billion per year.""

Budget 2016: The deficit promise was pretty much abandoned out of the gate, with Budget 2016 unveiling a plan to remain in the red for the foreseeable future. Far from balancing the budget, the Liberals expected to run a deficit of $29.4 billion in 2016-17 , which would reduce to $29 billion in 2017-18, finally falling to $14.3 billion by 2020-21 — thoguh it's not clear whether these figures include a contingency reserve. From 2016 through 2018, projected deficits were eventually expected to run well above the averages seen when Harper was prime minister — a time in which Canada was grappling with a global recession. By the time of this budget, the government had pledged to ensure that the ""hard-fought gains attained in the 1990s and 2000s"" were preserved. The new numbers — for deficit, too — were based in downward projections in a survey of private sector economists that was conducted in 2016, compared to another one that was conducted two years prior.

Budget 2019: The latest budget betrayed no expectation to put Canada back in the black. It showed a more modest deficit than was expected for 2017-18 — $14.9 billion vs. $29 billion — but estimates are higher for future fiscal years. While the 2016 budget projected that the deficit would hit $17.7 billion in 2019-20, now the Liberals expect it to hit $19.8 billion. There's a similar story for the years 2020-21 — initially pegged at $14.3 billion, the deficit is now expected to hit $19.7 billion before falling to $9.8 billion in 2023-24. In other words, the Liberals expect to keep Canada in deficit right up to the end of their second term, if they win re-election.

Verdict: Unachieved, citing new economic projections.

Federal debt-to-GDP ratio

Campaign: The Liberals' election platform cited federal debt-to-GDP ratio as the second of its two fiscal anchors, pledging to reduce it to 27 per cent. ""In every year of our plan, federal debt-to-GDP will continue to fall,"" it said.

Budget 2016: Like the deficit, this pledge was also essentially abandoned in the government's first budget. The promise to reduce the ratio to 27 per cent became a projection that it would remain above 30 per cent for six years. The government noted, however, that Canada's federal debt-to-GDP ratio remains the lowest among G7 countries.

Budget 2019: Like the deficit, the latest budget doesn't foresee the debt-to-GDP ratio falling to 27 per cent in the foreseeable future. The ratio is expected to remain above 30 per cent up to 2022-23, when it's projected to fall to 29.3 per cent and then 28.6 per cent the following year.

Verdict: Unachieved, citing new economic projections.

Canada Child Benefit

Campaign: The Liberals pitched a Canada Child Benefit (CCB) as a replacement for Stephen Harper's Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB). The new benefit, tied to income, would provide a typical family of four with an extra $2,500 in tax-free help each year, and help to lift 315,000 Canadian children out of poverty, the platform said.

Budget 2016: The government's first budget introduced the CCB, pledging to target it to low- and middle-income families that needed more help, while those with higher incomes would receive fewer benefits. The budget estimated that nine out of 10 families would receive more in child benefits than under the existing system. The CCB would leave about 300,000 fewer children in poverty in 2016-17 compared to 2014-15.

Budget 2019: The government cited the ""income-boosting effects"" of the CCB for helping to achieve a targeted 20 per cent reduction of poverty ""three years ahead of time."" This included pulling 278,000 children out of poverty in 2017, as compared to 2015 — a statistic in line with the projection in the 2016 budget. Bloomberg noted that the CCB helped to drive poverty to ""new lows,"" with child poverty alone reaching its ""lowest level in at least a decade.""

Verdict: Reports indicate that there are, indeed, fewer Canadians under 18 living in poverty following the introduction of the CCB.

Infrastructure

Campaign: The Liberals pledged a 10-year federal investment in infrastructure of $125 billion, up from $65 billion. This pledge included investing $20 billion more in public transit and $20 billion more in Canada's ""social infrastructure,"" which refers to projects that help make communities ""good places to live.""

2016 budget: The government's first budget unveiled a plan to invest over $120 billion in infrastructure, in an effort to deliver ""sustained economic growth for years to come."" This investment would ""modernize and rehabilitate"" public transit, as well as water and wastewater systems, help to protect infrastructure against the effects of climate change and provide affordable housing.

2019 budget: The government cited the approvals of over 33,000 infrastructure projects in various communities and said the ""vast majority"" are already underway. ""More than $7 billion of the $19.9 billion committed to projects"" within communities had been ""fully invested"" in infrastructure such as ""new highways, bridges, buses, water treatment plants and community centres."" The latest budget now said the government was investing more than $180 billion over 12 years to ""build infrastructure in communities across the country,"" with additional investment expected to support as many as 42,000 jobs by 2020-21. However, the infrastructure program was criticized in a March 2018 report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), which said that half the money set aside for its first phase hadn't been linked to any project. The PBO found that, out of $14.4 billion that had been budgeted for Phase One, only $7.2 billion had been committed to a project. Further spending had been pushed to future years, the PBO noted. In December, Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said the government was overhauling how it approved funding for projects.

Even the prime minister can get a little a peckish from time to time.

During the first hour of Wednesday night’s marathon voting session in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was called out by a member of the Conservatives for surreptitiously eating during the proceedings.

“We all know that the rules of this House do not permit us to eat in this place and I can’t help but observe that during the last vote a number of people were eating in their seats including the minister of defence, the minister of Canadian heritage, and the prime minister who appeared to be hiding a bagel in his desk,” Conservative MP Scott Reid announced.

As per the House’s Rules of Decorum, members are permitted to “refresh themselves with glasses of water during debate, but the consumption of any other beverage or food is not allowed.”

Reid gave one last parting shot at the prime minister when he stated: “Mr. Speaker, the prime minister has already stained this place with corruption, he does not need to stain it with mustard as well.”

The Conservative politician was referencing the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal that continues to dog the Liberals more than a month after it became public.

The SNC-Lavalin affair is also the reason why Members of Parliament were in the House of Commons on Wednesday night. The Liberal majority shot down a Conservative motion calling on the prime minister to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify again about the scandal.

This led to a Conservative-sponsored filibuster that has continued into Thursday morning.

In response to Reid’s accusation, Trudeau stood up and acknowledged he had eaten during the session.

It was a chocolate bar and I apologize,” Trudeau stated as members of his party suppressed smiles behind him.",PM Trudeau apologizes for eating chocolate bar during voting marathon,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/pm-trudeau-apologizes-for-eating-chocolate-bar-during-voting-marathon-1.4345501

Over the course of the SNC-Lavalin affair, Justin Trudeau’s feminist credentials have been seriously challenged — and rightly so.

Every time the Prime Minister has had the opportunity to do the right thing and support the women in his caucus who are speaking truth to power – he fails.

Let’s look at the facts.

Last month, Jody Wilson-Raybould used her voice to paint a picture of how Justin Trudeau and his office carried out a campaign of sustained, inappropriate and unethical political pressure in order to interfere in a criminal prosecution.

Her testimony was backed up with copious notes and facts.

This was her truth, and it was extremely credible.

Unsurprisingly, guess what Justin Trudeau’s response to these allegations were?

She experienced it differently.

What the Prime Minister fails to understand is that Canadians are not buying that excuse anymore, and frankly are getting sick and tired of it.

Now — as incredible and powerful as Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was — we cannot forget that the Prime Minister is using his power and his office to ensure that Canadians never hear the full story.

During the testimony of Mrs. Wilson-Raybould, she stated repeatedly that she should could not speak to certain matters due to the gag order placed on her by Justin Trudeau.

These matters pertain to key aspects of the SNC-Lavalin affair, of which Canadians deserve to know the truth.

What I can’t stand, and what is extremely hypocritical, is the fact that two of the individuals implicated in the SNC-Lavalin affair testified to things that Jody Wilson-Raybould could not.

Both Gerry Butts, the Prime Minister’s top advisor, and Michael Wernick, the head of Canada’s public service, talked about events that were outside the waiver that the Prime Minister gave to Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Now, I don’t know about Justin Trudeau, but I was raised to be fair and allow everyone to say their piece.

That’s why Canada’s Conservatives, under the leadership of Andrew Scheer, launched the #LetHerSpeak campaign — to give Mrs. Wilson-Raybould a fighting chance and to tell her side of the story.

Since then, Canada’s Conservatives have given Trudeau the opportunity on two occasions to do the right thing and #LetHerSpeak.

The first was at the Justice Committee.

And guess what? The Liberals used their majority to silence Jody Wilson-Raybould.

The next was in the House of Commons — where we asked the Prime Minister to lift the gag order and let her testify at the Justice Committee.

And big surprise — the Trudeau government used their majority to vote against the motion.

So where does it leave us with this whole affair? It is clear by Justin Trudeau’s repeated denial, deflection, and unwillingness to allow Jody Wilson-Raybould to speak that he is engaged in a massive cover-up.

It means that Justin Trudeau cares more about his own job, than allowing Canadians to get the whole truth.

It means that Justin Trudeau is afraid of what Jody Wilson-Raybould has to say.

And it means that I won’t stop fighting until Jody Wilson-Raybould is allowed to tell her whole, unscripted, and unedited truth.

Because that’s what Canadians want and deserve.

In a interview with Maclean’s Magazine, published Thursday morning, former president of the Treasury Board Jane Philpott explained her decision to resign as a cabinet member and said that “there’s been an attempt to shut down the story” by Trudeau and his advisers.

At issue is the claim by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould that she was subjected to a “consistent and sustained effort” between September and December 2018 to pressure her into changing her decision not to intervene in the criminal case of SNC-Lavalin to help the Montreal firm escape a potential conviction for corruption charges.

Trudeau said in his view, Wilson-Raybould has been allowed to speak already.

“The issue is the issue of pressure that the attorney general may have experienced while she was attorney general on SNC Lavalin,” Trudeau said when asked repeatedly about the assertions.

He added that he thinks Wilson-Raybould has been able to give “full testimony regarding the former attorney general’s time as attorney general in regards to the Lavalin situation.”

WATCH BELOW: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that he is “pleased to have a diversity of voices” when asked why MPs Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould remain in the Liberal caucaus.



Trudeau waived cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege following intense pressure from critics demanding answers to the allegations.

But the waiver for Wilson-Raybould only allowed her to speak about what happened while she was attorney general.

She was shuffled out of that post on Jan. 14, 2019, something she says she believes was a direct result of refusing to intervene to cut SNC-Lavalin a deal.

However, she remained a member of the cabinet in her new position of minister of veterans affairs until she resigned on Feb. 12.

That means if there were any further discussions of the SNC-Lavalin case around the cabinet table, Wilson-Raybould would likely have heard it up until she resigned. A waiver covering her final month in cabinet would authorize her to speak about whether there were ongoing discussions on the matter.

Attorney General David Lametti, who replaced her in the job, has refused to rule out offering the company a deal to avoid a criminal trial and potential conviction.

Philpott resigned following the testimony of Wilson-Raybould at the House of Commons justice committee that had been conducting a limited probe of the matter up until it decided to drop its examination of the issue on Monday.

WATCH: Jane Philpott resigns from Trudeau’s cabinet over SNC-Lavalin affair fallout

Philpott said in her resignation letter that she had “lost confidence” in the prime minister’s handling of the allegations.

While she has remained tight-lipped since then, her interview with Maclean’s marked the first time she has publicly commented on her ongoing concerns.

“My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,” Philpott told Maclean’s in her first extended interview since her resignation.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.”

Philpott’s new public statements fanned the flames of a scandal the government is desperate to douse, and which the Opposition Conservatives are doing their best to keep alive. They’ve forced the House of Commons to sit all night, voting line by line on the Liberal government’s spending plans.

The Liberal majority in the House shot down a Conservative motion calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to let Wilson-Raybould testify more fully about what she experienced through the fall and into the early winter, especially what prompted her to resign from cabinet altogether after she was shuffled from the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in January.

The motion was defeated by a vote of 161-134, with both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould absent.

That set the stage for the Conservative-sponsored filibuster that began Wednesday night and continued through Thursday morning.

Since any vote involving government spending is automatically a confidence vote, Liberals were required to be out in force to avoid potential defeat of the government. The voting could theoretically last 36 hours, but the Conservatives have only to keep it going until just after 10 a.m. today to scrub the remainder of the parliamentary day.

A day of committee meetings scheduled for Thursday has already been cancelled.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada remains welcoming to newcomers even as his government takes steps to curb the influx of asylum seekers coming into the country at unofficial entry points.

Speaking at a news conference in Mississauga, Ont., on Thursday, the prime minister said Canadians continue to be “overwhelmingly in favour” of immigration even though the issue has become “politically charged” here and south of the border.

“One of the reasons Canadians do have confidence in immigration as a positive force in our country is because they have confidence in our immigration system,” he said.

Federal budget 2019: Liberals earmark nearly $1.2-billion over five years to tackle border challenges

“We are dealing with larger than usual numbers and have had to make investments to account for that but the integrity of our immigration system continues to hold.”

More than 40,000 people have crossed into Canada on foot through fields and forests since 2017.

Trudeau’s comments come days after his government presented a budget that includes a new border-enforcement strategy aimed at detecting, intercepting and removing irregular migrants.

The plan, which is expected to cost $1.18 billion over five years, includes more funding for the Canada Border Services Agency and the RCMP to beef up enforcement at the border, as well as money to speed up the processing of asylum claims.

Some provinces, particularly Quebec and Ontario, have called on Ottawa to reimburse them for hundreds of millions of dollars in housing and other expenses they say have been incurred in accommodating the flow of asylum seekers.

The budget did not set aside money for provincial immigration costs, but Trudeau said Thursday his government will continue to work with provinces and municipalities to relieve that pressure.

Meanwhile, Border Security Minister Bill Blair said over the weekend he was in talks with lawmakers in the United States to close a loophole in Canada’s border agreement with the U.S. that some say encourages asylum seekers to avoid official checkpoints.

He fell back on talking points about diversity, and attacking former PM and Conservative leader Stephen Harper.

“We recognize that a diversity of perspectives, of experiences, of opinions, is extraordinarily important,” Trudeau said.

Yes the Liberals under Justin Trudeau welcome diversity — as long as women shut up and do as they are told.

Trudeau was forced to react to the ongoing scandal once again after Jane Philpott came forward on Thursday in an interview with Macleans Magazine to say there was more to the SNC story.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system,” Philpott told Paul Wells of Macleans.

Philpott said her resignation was directly tied to the government’s handling of the SNC file, saying she could no longer keep cabinet solidarity with the PM and how he was portraying the issue.

“I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history,” Philpott said.

Trudeau denied there was more to learn from ongoing hearings, or allowing the justice committee to recall former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.

His MPs on that committee used their majority to end further hearings into the scandal — one that has led to the resignation of two top cabinet ministers resign and Trudeau’s top political advisor, as well as the retirement of Canada’s top bureaucrat amid claims he acted inappropriately.

Oh, and this week Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes announced she would leave the Liberal caucus and sit as an independent.

Five people resigning or leaving office in one way or another, and Trudeau insists nothing happened.

If nothing happened, why won’t he allow Wilson-Raybould to testify again and remove the remainder of the gag order he has on her.

Not only did the Liberals use their majority on the justice committee to block her, they also decided they would rather sit through a marathon voting session than allow Wilson-Raybould to speak.

In response to the Liberals shutting down committee hearings, the Conservatives forced hundreds of amendments to be voted on — taking more than 24 hours to plough through them all.

Yet all through the two-day session, the Conservatives offered a way out to the Liberals: let Wilson-Raybould appear before committee again and let her speak freely.

The Liberals decided they would rather spend all night voting, and waste millions of taxpayer dollars doing so, than let her speak.

Wilson-Raybould has said she has more to say, Philpott says Canadians have more to learn about this and the PM says don’t listen to those pesky women.

So much for the days when Trudeau would say that women should be believed when they come forward.

The sad fact for Trudeau is that Canadians believe Wilson-Raybould over him, and would likely believe Philpott when she says there is more to be learned.

Trudeau is desperately trying to hide something, there is part of the story he doesn’t want us to hear — but hear it we must.

The SNC-Lavalin case was, in fact, responsible for Members of Parliament gathering in the House of Commons on Wednesday night. The Liberal majority rejected a Conservative motion which directed Trudeau to permit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify about the scandal once again.

The worst part is that we usually can’t do anything about it because, well, it’s not always appropriate to whip out our favourite snack and start chowing down.

But sometimes you just have to bend those rules. And that’s exactly what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did.

The Prime Minister was attending the marathon voting session when, during the last vote, he appeared to be hiding a bagel in his desk, according to Conservative MP Scott Reid.

Trudeau responded to Reid’s claim and acknowledged he had, in fact, been eating during the session.

“I apologize,” Trudeau said. “It was a chocolate bar and I apologize.”

Members of his party tried not to laugh as he addressed the situation and you can’t blame them for wanting to. It’s kind of hilarious to think of our country’s leader sneaking chocolate into the House of Commons.

Unfortunately for Trudeau, the House of Commons doesn’t permit food or eating. In fact, the Decorum states that members are permitted to “refresh themselves with glasses of water during debate, but the consumption of any other beverage or food is not allowed.”

In an explosive interview with Maclean's — her first media interview since she resigned from the Liberal cabinet on Mar. 4 — Philpott said there is ""much more"" to the SNC-Lavalin affair and Canadians have concerns about the government's attempts to ""shut down"" the story.

Philpott pointed to Commons justice committee testimony by Gerry Butts, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary, in which Butts referenced a Jan. 6 meeting she had with Trudeau about the company's efforts to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that would allow it to avoid a trial on bribery charges.

""I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the prime minister a month before the public knew about it. Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?"" she told Maclean's.

Trudeau was asked about that meeting during a news conference in Mississauga, Ont. Thursday morning. He said the discussion was about appointing Philpott as Treasury Board president and moving Wilson-Raybould to fill her role as Indigenous Services minister. The prime minister said Philpott asked if Wilson-Raybould's shuffle from the justice minister and attorney general's role was in relation to the SNC-Lavalin issue.

""I told her no, it was not,"" Trudeau said.

At that point, Trudeau said, they talked about how Philpott could assist Wilson-Raybould in her new role.

""It was a good and positive conversation,"" he said.

PM Justin Trudeau describes his January 6th meeting with former member of cabinet Jane Philpott as a 'good and positive conversation'. 1:07

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking a DPA that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Despite tensions in the Liberal caucus over Philpott and Wilson-Raybould remaining in the fold, Trudeau said again today that both MPs remain supportive of the Liberal agenda.

CBC News reported Wednesday that Philpott faced tough questions during an Ontario caucus meeting. She addressed the group at the beginning of the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled and was described by people in the room as ""rough"" and ""uncomfortable.""

Philpott — widely considered to be one of the most competent and respected ministers in the Trudeau government — resigned from the Liberal cabinet March 4, saying in a public statement that she had lost confidence in how the Trudeau government was handling the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Today, pressure mounted publicly on Philpott to clear the air.

Long-time Liberal MP John McKay said ""confidence is confidence"" and acknowledged that MPs are beginning to see that the SNC-Lavalin matter has ""political consequences.""

""It's one thing to take a hit from the opposition or circumstances beyond caucus or cabinet. It's another thing to take political hits from your own people,"" he said.

Judy Sgro, another Toronto veteran Liberal MP, said Philpott could simply use her parliamentary privilege to say what she wants in the House of Commons instead of spreading ""innuendo.""

""She's well aware of how we all feel. We don't want to damage the party, we've got a lot of work to do,"" she said.

""They're under no restrictions. They can walk into the House of Commons right now and say parliamentary privilege and say anything they want.""

Parliamentary uproar

The Maclean's interview was published in the midst of a parliamentary uproar over the Liberals' move to shut down the Commons justice committee's probe of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Philpott said she believes Canadians need answers to maintain their confidence in the independence of the justice system.

""My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,"" she told journalist Paul Wells. ""I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.""

The House of Commons is currently engaged in a marathon voting session — a parliamentary tactic deployed by the Conservatives to protest the Liberals shutting down the committee investigation before former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould could be recalled to testify for a second time.

During the interview with Maclean's, Phlipott said Wilson-Raybould may not have resigned as justice minister and attorney general as she was enduring inappropriate pressure to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution because she ""had her finger in the dike."" She may have felt that her resignation could put the independence of the justice system at risk, Philpott said.

""Another answer to that is, from the perspective of somebody who is under pressure and perhaps being harassed, it's incredibly hard – if you talk to people who are harassed in any capacity, to maintain relationships and to find the right time to be able to speak up about the fact that you are being treated that way,"" Philpott said.

""So you know, I think if you look at examples of other types of bullying or harassment, it's not necessarily as easy as people might think to speak to those who are inflicting it upon you.""

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said she's angry that the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a so-called gag order on Liberal MP Jane Philpott over the SNC-Lavalin controversy. 1:03

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said the Maclean's interview points to a ""culture of intimidation"" within the Trudeau government. She accused Trudeau of imposing a ""gag order"" on Philpott and Wilson-Raybould in an attempt to contain the SNC-Lavalin story.

""How can we be serious about making Parliament Hill a place for women to work if these are the sorts of stories that Canadians see coming out, if no action is taken?"" she asked.

Trudeau called 'fake feminist'

Conservatives labelled Trudeau a ""fake feminist"" for blocking the former ministers from fully telling their story. Trudeau waived cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould, but only for her time as attorney general and justice minister.

The waiver does not cover the period after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs and her subsequent resignation from cabinet.

Rempel said blocking both women from speaking fully shows a gender issue is at play.

""Any Canadian woman, regardless of stripe, should be outraged by what is happening to these women,"" she said. ""It's disgusting.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the Philpott interview is more evidence of a ""serious problem"" that merits a full public airing.

Each of the filibuster session’s 257 motions opposed different lines of those bills that needed to be voted on before the estimates themselves can actually face a vote.

Paola Loriggio, The Canadian Press





MISSISSAUGA, Ont. -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada remains welcoming to newcomers even as his government takes steps to curb the influx of asylum seekers coming into the country at unofficial entry points.

Speaking at a news conference in Mississauga, Ont., on Thursday, the prime minister said Canadians continue to be ""overwhelmingly in favour"" of immigration even though the issue has become ""politically charged"" here and south of the border.

""One of the reasons Canadians do have confidence in immigration as a positive force in our country is because they have confidence in our immigration system,"" he said.

""We are dealing with larger than usual numbers and have had to make investments to account for that but the integrity of our immigration system continues to hold.""

More than 40,000 people have crossed into Canada on foot through fields and forests since 2017.

Trudeau's comments come days after his government presented a budget that includes a new border-enforcement strategy aimed at detecting, intercepting and removing irregular migrants.

The plan, which is expected to cost $1.18 billion over five years, includes more funding for the Canada Border Services Agency and the RCMP to beef up enforcement at the border, as well as money to speed up the processing of asylum claims.

Some provinces, particularly Quebec and Ontario, have called on Ottawa to reimburse them for hundreds of millions of dollars in housing and other expenses they say have been incurred in accommodating the flow of asylum seekers.

The budget did not set aside money for provincial immigration costs, but Trudeau said Thursday his government will continue to work with provinces and municipalities to relieve that pressure.

Meanwhile, Border Security Minister Bill Blair said over the weekend he was in talks with lawmakers in the United States to close a loophole in Canada's border agreement with the U.S. that some say encourages asylum seekers to avoid official checkpoints.

Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers can't claim refugee status in Canada if they arrive at an official border crossing from a country deemed to be safe, such as the U.S. -- but they can do so from inside Canada.

Blair has said that extending the agreement to those who cross irregularly from the U.S. could help remove the incentive.",Trudeau says Canada is still welcoming newcomers despite plan to beef up border,CP24,https://www.cp24.com/news/trudeau-says-canada-is-still-welcoming-newcomers-despite-plan-to-beef-up-border-1.4346359

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

“There’s much more to the story that should be told,” former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott told Macleans’ magazine in an interview released on Thursday.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” she said. Philpott added that she and Wilson-Raybould had more to say but did not elaborate. Philpott, a close political ally of Wilson-Raybould, quit on March 4.

Trudeau, who has denied any political interference to protect SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial, indicated he felt Canadians had already heard enough.

Wilson-Raybould had the chance to “share completely” her thoughts during almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month, he told reporters in Mississauga, Ontario when asked about Philpott’s remarks.

The crisis may threaten Trudeau’s reelection chances in the upcoming October vote. Polls show the center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

As well as the two ministers, the affair has claimed Trudeau’s closest political aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy. A Liberal legislator who backed Wilson-Raybould quit on Wednesday to sit as an independent.

Trudeau suffered further potential embarrassment on Thursday when SNC-Lavalin Chief Executive Neil Bruce denied he had told government officials that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if the firm was found guilty of offering bribes to Libyan officials.

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, which wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

“Until we are able to put this behind us, it’s pretty difficult to grow our Canadian workforce,” Bruce told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Asked whether he had specified the number of jobs that could be at risk, he replied: “No, we never gave a number.”

A court conviction would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal government contracts for 10 years.

Bruce said if the company’s share price continued to suffer, it might become a takeover target.

SNC-Lavalin’s headquarters are in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats in the October election to retain a majority government.

Trudeau has dismissed calls for a public inquiry, noting the House of Commons justice committee was probing the matter. That committee, dominated by Liberal legislators, shut down its inquiry on Tuesday, saying no more action was needed.

190,,2019-03-22T01:39:00.0000000Z,"Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are allies in “sabotaging” Alberta and their efforts will be met with constitutional and legal challenges, UCP leader Jason Kenney said ...","Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are allies in “sabotaging” Alberta and their efforts will be met with constitutional and legal challenges, UCP leader Jason Kenney said Thursday.

Notley, meanwhile, later warned of the threat of “American-style” health care under a UCP government.

With a backdrop of Calgary’s downtown skyline, where office vacancy rate is between 25 and 30 per cent, Kenney lashed into the premier, calling her an accomplice in keeping that space empty and the city’s employment rate Canada’s highest.

The carbon tax meant to ease the way for pipelines and Notley’s failure to support the Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipelines are incriminating evidence, said the UCP leader.

“Rachel Notley sold out to Justin Trudeau and all we got in exchange is a carbon tax and no pipelines,” said Kenney, who also mentioned the proposed federal Bill C-69 that critics contend will make it far more difficult to build energy projects.

“Notley can’t even bring herself to call for a full repeal of Bill C-69.”

Alberta’s economy took a huge nosedive when oil prices plunged globally in late 2014, months before the NDP took power, but Kenney argues other oil-producing jurisdictions have seen greater recovery since.

If necessary, Kenney said a UCP government will launch a constitutional challenge against the legislation, turn off oil taps to a pipeline-obstructionist B.C., and forge a pro-energy alliance with other provinces.

If a pipeline to tidewater isn’t built by 2021, a UCP government would also hold a provincial referendum on reforming equalization payments he says yields $3 billion annually from Alberta taxpayers that sends $20 billion more a year to federal coffers than it receives.

That referendum would be held Oct. 18, 2021.

“Let’s not give up on Canada because of the Notley-Trudeau alliance, let’s end the alliance,” he said.

It was pointed out to Kenney that it was the Harper government — in which he was a cabinet minister — that forged that equalization formula.

Kenney admitted he was “in the cabinet when there were a couple of different versions of equalization” but that times have changed dramatically since then, with Alberta now facing considerable economic challenges.

“We didn’t have provinces trying to block Alberta pipelines,” he said.

Kenney also said he accepts the scientific consensus that human beings are responsible for climate change, but added he won’t insist his candidates or MLAs — some of whom have voiced skepticism — follow suit.

“There’s a spectrum of views about this and this is not a party with a rigid ideological orthodoxy, this is not an issue that has come up for debate (within the UCP),” he said.

Meanwhile, Alberta will get 2,000 more long-term-care beds if the NDP is re-elected, a plan put at risk by “American-style” health care under the UCP, Rachel Notley said Thursday.

Speaking in Lethbridge, the NDP leader said her government already delivered 2,000 of those beds for seniors after taking power in 2015.

“Despite that increase, we know we need to keep building those,” she said of the $170-million investment.

“When you work your entire life to make Alberta prosper, you deserve a government that stands for you.”

In Lethbridge, and again at a rally in the Calgary-North East riding Thursday evening, Notley took aim at Kenney, who has pushed for privatizing some aspects of health care such as laundry services.

“He wants to privatize large parts of our health-care system,” Notley told a crowd of cheering supporters and candidates in Calgary.

“With an aging population, you can bet that that is going to hurt. And why? Why does he want to hurt people with these cuts? To pay for reckless corporate tax giveaways.”

At the Calgary rally, Notley described Kenney as “dithering” on the Springbank dam project and said the UCP leader wants to freeze education funding.

“With 15,000 more kids entering school every year, that is going to hurt,” Notley said.

On pipelines, Notley told the crowd that: “when times were their toughest, I stood up and I compelled the federal government to step up.

“Mr. Kenney thinks that the way to get a pipeline built is by yelling at the rest of Canada and building a firewall, but here’s the thing: you don’t build pipelines through firewalls,” Notley said. “Mark my words: this pipeline will be built and we are going to be the ones to get it done.”

The NDP leader also brought up the topic of racism and referred to the UCP losing a “star candidate” earlier this week.

“The bottom line is this: racism and hate have no place in today’s Alberta and they have absolutely no place in our legislature,” Notley said.

In a message directed at Albertans who have voted Conservative in the past, Notley positioned the NDP as the “moderate mainstream of today’s Alberta.”

At another rally Thursday evening, Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel took aim at both Notley and Kenney, describing the NDP as a “far left” party and the UCP as a “far right” party. Mandel positioned the Alberta Party as a “centrist party that cares about people and business.”

“They try to represent something that they’re not,” he said of the other two parties. “We’re the only one not misrepresenting, because we are who we are. We’re not something from the right or something from the left; we’re an amalgam of people who want to see this province move forward in an effective and creative way.”

Related

At her announcement in Lethbridge, Notley said more long-term health-care beds will free up spaces in acute-care hospitals that are now too often occupied by seniors.

The groups Friends of Medicare and Public Interest Alberta said that investment is welcome news but questioned how many of those beds would be privately or publicly operated, adding they much prefer the latter.

“It is disappointing that the NDP’s announcement seems to leave the door open to for-profit corporations providing this care, which means more public money being wasted on corporate profits,” said Public Interest Alberta executive director Joel French, who added 1,700 of the previously created 2,000 beds are privately run.

Also on Thursday, Liberal Leader David Khan unveiled an Indigenous policy platform his government would pursue to make juries, the legislature and school curricula more representative of First Nations.

“The time for rhetoric is over and the time for reconciliation is now . . . we must move beyond just apologies toward real healing and real co-operation,” said Khan, who has worked with First Nations as a lawyer.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained under pressure over a corruption scandal on Wednesday as a legislator quit his party's caucus and a pre-election budget aimed at swaying key voters appeared to offer too little to stem the tide of negative news.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also provided a little for key groups such as millennial voters who backed Trudeau in droves in Canada's 2015 election.

The decision by a legislator, who had defended a former minister at the center of a political scandal, to quit the ruling Liberal Party and sit as an independent dealt a fresh blow to Trudeau's embattled government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on the then justice minister to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government's chances of re-election. Polls have shown that Trudeau's Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The latest defection overshadowed Tuesday's budget which divided money between a large number of new initiatives and left few Canadians satisfied.

""It's just too broad,"" said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation. ""They wanted to please lots of people and ... when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody, because you spread it too thin.""

Rob Edel, chief investment officer at Nicola Wealth Management, noted the government did not commit to reducing a budget deficit that is much larger than the Liberals promised. This was ""a political rather than an economic decision,"" he said.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada as well as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce complained about the lack of tax reform. But the center-left Liberals may not care too much as their core supporters are progressive thinkers, women and younger voters. Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed budget measures to help first-time home buyers, including allowing people to withdraw up to C$35,000 from a retirement savings account.

But asked on Wednesday how many younger first-time buyers actually had that much money available, he replied ""that will help some people in the middle income range ... not everyone, for sure.""

The main opposition Conservative Party has relentlessly attacked Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin affair and described the budget as a bribe. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has continuously demanded Trudeau's resignation, which some Conservatives privately worry is the wrong approach.

Two strategists with deep ties to the party said given the complexity of the affair, and former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould's statement that no one involved had broken any laws, Canadians would not necessarily agree that Trudeau should quit now.

Conservative over-confidence or missteps could be the Liberals' best hope for reversing their slumping poll numbers, pollster Nick Nanos said.

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers delayed Morneau's budget presentation for an hour.

Conservatives initially drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers and then walked out en masse, a tactic that did not sit well with some Canadians on social media.

Trudeau was in Mississauga on Thursday to tout the doubling of infrastructure cash that Ottawa will send directly to municipalities rather than the usual funding stream that goes through provinces.

“While many provincial and territorial governments have been working hard to get projects done for Canadians, others have been withholding federal infrastructure dollars. That’s not fair,” Trudeau said.

[READ MORE: Ford pledges to help Scheer defeat Trudeau]

“Here in Ontario it’s been over a year since we signed an agreement with the province for more than $11 billion in federal funding, and we still haven’t received a single project for approval.”

In Tuesday’s federal budget, the Liberals announced a one-time cash infusion of $2.2 billion for municipalities through the federal gas tax fund. In Toronto that means approximately $167 million more for the city, in Mississauga it means approximately $80 million.

In March 2018, the former provincial government signed a $30 billion, decade long, infrastructure funding agreement. The deal was to be cost shared between Ottawa, Queen’s Park and municipalities but none of the money has been released and the federal Liberals lay the blame squarely with Premier Doug Ford’s government.

Last week the province announced it will open one stream of the funding, targeted to small municipalities and First Nations communities. A spokesperson for federal Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne, noted to iPolitics that covers just $250 million of the $11.8 billion that Ottawa committed.

Spokesperson Ann-Clara Vaillancourt also noted that Ontario isn’t alone in lagging behind other provinces and territories. Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick have also been “slower” to put projects forward for approval.

“We’re facing gridlock not just on our roads, but in getting funding to the communities that need it,” Trudeau told reporters today.

“Because this province, and a couple of others, have been unwilling to move forward in partnership with the federal government on infrastructure investments, we decided that doubling this municipal infrastructure transfer, this year, would be a way of getting the much-needed investments.”

Trudeau and Ford have been at loggerheads since Ford took office on issues ranging from funding services for asylum seekers to the carbon tax. Until this month, infrastructure issues, which are typically easier for different governments to co-operate on, had not been among the flash points between the two governments.

Ford’s government is dismissing the criticism from Trudeau as an attempt to shirk responsibility ahead of the fall federal election.

“It’s convenient after four years of Liberals being in power, on the eve of an election, that it is provincial governments impeding the development of infrastructure. Not their own government and their own department making that a political priority,” Stephen Lecce, the parliamentary assistant to the provincial infrastructure minister, said Thursday.

He disputed the federal government’s figure that before Ford took office more than 2,000 projects were approved in Ontario. “Not many are shovel in the ground,” he argued.

“Justin Trudeau has had four years to get infrastructure projects done, and the fact that he can’t point to many examples of success in that respect speaks to his own record,” Lecce said.

But information pointed to by the federal government shows that construction for the majority of products approved by the Liberals has already started.

Detailed statistics provided by the province later in the day show that 1,799 projects, or 89 per cent of them, are already underway.

A spokesperson for provincial Infrastructure Minister Monte McNaughton said the province has only opened one stream of infrastructure funding because of “the limited fiscal and administrative capacity of our municipal partners.”

His spokesperson, Brittany Allison, said the decision was made at the request of municipalities.

Although the cloud of the SNC Lavalin affair still hangs over the Liberal government a little over six months out from an election, it was business as usual for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he presented some key city-building aspects of his budget at the Mississauga Transit Bus Storage and Maintenance Compound on March 21.

Left to right: MP Omar Alghabra, Mayor Bonnie Crombie and Justin Trudeau

At the event, Trudeau, who was joined by Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie and Mississauga-Centre MP Omar Alghabra, announced $80 million for Mississauga from the Federal Gas Tax Fund (GTF).

When the government released its final pre-election budget, it committed to a one-time, doubling of the gas tax fund to $2.2 billion.

""Your city now has more funding to invest in things like transit, transportation, road repairs and new buses,"" Trudeau told MiWay staff, city officials and reporters at the event.

The day the budget was released, Crombie praised the government's commitment to helping municipalities create ""21st century cities.""

“This is an important change and one of the largest fund transfers from the federal government to municipalities. This top-up will help us build strong cities and spur economic growth by helping cities address infrastructure deficits and plan for future transit and roads,” Crombie said.

Interestingly enough, Trudeau told reporters that the doubled funding will go directly to cities, adding that the province—which normally receives and then distributes the funds to municipalities—will not be involved. Typically, funding from the GTF is provided twice a year to provinces and territories, who then go on to divy out the funds accordingly.

As for why, Trudeau told attendees that the current provincial government, led by Doug Ford, has not been interested in partnering with the federal government to invest in major infrastructure projects across Ontario.

At a press event in the Greater Toronto Area on Thursday, Trudeau accused Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government of not co-operating with federal counterparts in addressing the flow of border crossers while heaping praise on neighbouring Quebec, which is home to Roxham Road, the busiest of the illegal border crossings.

“I have to say that the Quebec government has been an extremely good partner in dealing with this,” he said during a visit to Mississauga, Ont.

“On the Ontario side, unfortunately the provincial government has not wanted to engage in any way with the federal government on this issue, despite our repeated attempts to come to a working arrangement, and we have instead worked directly with municipalities.”

The prime minister also credited Toronto Mayor John Tory and Mississauga Mayor and former Liberal MP Bonnie Crombie, who attended Thursday’s event, as “excellent partners” in co-operating with the federal government on the surge of asylum seekers.

“It’s been very positive with municipalities in Ontario and with the province and municipalities in Quebec,” Trudeau said.

The prime minister didn’t offer any further explanation about when the provinces might see their next allotment of federal funding to deal with the asylum issue. In January, the federal government announced that it would give $115 million to provinces and municipalities to help pay for temporary housing for asylum seekers, with $15 million flowing directly to the municipalities. The previous summer, the federal government offered $50 million to Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba to help with temporary housing costs.

Before the announcement of the January funds, the governments of Ontario and Quebec said they had spent $200 million and $300 million, respectively, on irregular migrants.

A spokesperson for Border Security Minister Bill Blair told iPolitics via email that the Ontario government has not clarified the breakdown of the $200 million that it’s asking for “despite repeated requests.”

According to documents tabled in the House of Commons on Monday, the federal government has budgeted almost $500,000 in compensation to be paid directly to houses surrounding Roxham Road, near a popular place of entry for border crossers. It plans to pay $405,000 to 45 households in the area of St-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Que.

Ontario Government House Leader Todd Smith said that his government has been willing to work with the federal government in terms of issues like interprovincial trade, but that “there are some (issues) we think the federal Liberal government isn’t living up to its obligations to the people of Ontario.”

“And we’re always going to stand up for the people of Ontario, because that’s what we were elected to do,” Smith said.

The Government of Canada has tracked 42,000 asylum seekers who have entered Canada from the U.S. through official ports of entry since 2017, with 96 per cent entering through Quebec. The influx (from 2012 to 2016 there were only 34,965 asylum claimants processed by the Canada Border Services Agency) followed an announcement by United States President Donald Trump’s administration that it planned to end a special temporary status that protected individuals fleeing to the U.S.

The government indicated a tougher tone on immigration in the budget it released earlier this week by promising $1.2 billion over five years to speed up processing asylum claims and appeals. The commitment followed months of criticism and doubt from the opposition about the Liberals faith in the Safe Third Country Agreement and how, generally, they’ve dealt with irregular immigrants.

The budget also proposed making changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to discourage and prevent irregular migration.

At an afternoon stop outside a housing development in Ottawa’s eastern suburbs, touting the measures in the new federal budget to make homes more affordable, Trudeau gave what sounded much like a stump speech, talking about “historic investments” in Canadians – getting there after dismissing Conservatives’ complaints that the Liberals should have to answer more for the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“What eats away at the Conservatives the most is that our approach is working,” he said. “Over the past three years, 900,000 Canadians created new jobs. Over the past three years, we’ve seen the lowest employment in 40 years. And we’ve see 825,000 Canadians, including 300,000 kids, lifted out of poverty because of measures this government is taking. And in this budget we just put forward yesterday, from easier access to home-ownership, to support for students, to money directly for seniors, to investments in broadband and high-speed internet access right across the country, we are responding to the priorities that Canadians have. The Conservatives have no plan for the economy, that’s why they want to talk about anything else. We are going to stay focused on delivering for Canadians, as we are today.”

While Trudeau emphasizes what all the government spending has done, the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer say it’s a spree funded by borrowing against the future.

Trudeau’s deficits: Short-term gain, long-term pain

Scheer had given a public speech to his caucus members in Ottawa earlier in the day, portraying Trudeau’s Liberals as a big-spending government with nothing but disdain for the idea of balanced budgets.

During the 2015 campaign, Trudeau warned that a Liberal government would initially run modest deficits, but would balance the books by 2019. That promise went out the window with a budget that projects of 2019-20 deficit of $19.8 billion.

“During the televised leaders’ debate, he said this: ‘I am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way we always have… We will balance the budget in 2019,’ ” Scheer said to the laughter of his colleagues. “Canadians who don’t have family fortunes like him know … that you can’t borrow your way out of debt and you can’t make other people pay for your mistakes.”

Trudeau acknowledged that his government has been borrowing heavily but he emphasized that although the national debt keeps growing, the economy is growing at about the same rate, so the burden isn’t getting harder to bear.

“Canadians need to know that our projections are sustainable,” he said,

Finance Minister Bill Morneau made his own post-budget sales effort, defending the Liberal strategy of investing in consumer confidence in two separate appearances.

The budget Morneau tabled in the House of Commons showcased several measures aimed at helping more would-be homebuyers get into the housing market for the first time; that’s what he focused on in a morning speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

Under the new measures, the government is proposing to pick up five per cent of a mortgage on the purchase of an existing home for households that earn under $120,000 and have been approved for a mortgage no more than four times their income – or 10%, if the house is new, in an attempt to spur construction. The Liberals will also let first-time buyers, and a few others in special circumstances, take up to $35,000 from their tax-free retirement savings accounts to spend on homes.

But Morneau insisted the government has also taken prudent steps to ensure that additional demand in markets like Toronto and Vancouver won’t result in higher prices.

“When we think about the overall homebuyer market, we have roughly half a million home purchases a year, but 100,000 of them are first-time homebuyers,” Morneau told a news conference after a morning speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

“We’re talking about (adding) 20, maybe 30, maybe 40,000 new families, which is really important to those families, but we’ve done the modelling to show (it’s) not an issue around changing demand dynamics.”

In particular, Morneau picked out three other measures in the budget that he said are aimed at preventing a spike in home prices: A Canada Revenue Agency crackdown on real-estate money-laundering, $10 billion in affordable rental construction financing and a $300-million contest of sorts to challenge municipalities to come up with creative solutions to adding housing stock.

In an afternoon appearance back in downtown Ottawa, at just the same time as Trudeau’s, Morneau focused on a program to help workers pay for skills training while keeping their jobs.

“We’re always going to try and encourage Canadians to invest in their own success. Like we’ve put forward in this budget, we’re hoping that people will continue to improve their skills so that they can do better in their current jobs and do better for themselves and their families,” he said. “I’m always going to hope that we can have a higher level of growth. I think that the only way we can do that is by recognizing that what the tools are at our disposal are people. So, if we have highly educated, highly trained people, we’re going to do better.”

And then he echoed Trudeau on how content the Liberals will be to fight the election on their record of borrowing and spending.

“I think what will be happening in the election campaign is Canadians look at what we’ve done over the last four years,” Morneau said. “We made promises that we would invest in Canadians. What they can see is we followed through on those promises.”",Trudeau defends Liberal budget measures as sales effort gets underway,plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/trudeau-defends-liberal-budget-measures-as-sales-effort-gets-underway-182236/

Jane Philpott told Maclean's magazine in an explosive interview published Thursday that ""there's much more to the story that should be told"" about the controversy, but she isn't in a position to elaborate because of ""an attempt to shut down the story"" by the prime minister and his inner circle.

She quit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet earlier this month, saying the government's handling of SNC-Lavalin controversy made circumstances ""untenable"" for her to continue as a minister. Her resignation came weeks after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould left cabinet.

""I made the very difficult decision to step down because my conscience demanded,"" she said in the Maclean's interview.

Watch: PM says ex-ministers still welcome in caucus despite criticism on SNC-Lavalin

Trudeau was asked about Philpott's comments during an infrastructure announcement in Mississauga. He was pressed to defend why Philpott and Wilson-Raybould remain members of the Liberal caucus.

""We recognize that a diversity of perspectives, experiences, opinions, is extraordinarily important if we're going to fully reflect the extraordinary diversity of Canadians,"" he said.

The prime minister told reporters that their intentions to stay in caucus and to run under the Liberal banner in the upcoming election is an indication of their faith in the party.

""We are pleased to have a diversity of voices in the Liberal party.""

Trudeau has been under weeks of pressure from the Opposition to release the former attorney general from remaining solicitor-client privileges and cabinet confidence to allow her to speak about events that happened after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14.

Partial restrictions were waived after the prime minister issued an Order in Council right before Wilson-Raybould's justice committee testimony in February. The order allowed her to speak about what she alleged were ""consistent and sustained"" efforts of political interference to help SNC-Lavalin avoid trial when she was attorney general.

Trudeau has repeatedly said that issuing the order was ""unprecedented"" and satisfactory for the bounds of the justice committee study about what happened up until the January shuffle.

The Opposition are not convinced, and gave notice of 257 motions Wednesday to protest what Tories have called a ""gag order"" over Wilson-Raybould. MP voted throughout the night, taking turns sleeping.

Because the votes relate to government funding, an election would be triggered if Liberals lose even one.

Liberal MP suggests Philpott 'dangling something' is inappropriate

Neither Philpott or Wilson-Raybould were present during the overnight marathon votes. Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an Ontario MP who quit the Liberal caucus earlier in the day, participated in the voting session from her new seat in the back row.

The Canadian Press reported Wednesday that Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were given permission to skip the all-night voting marathon to avoid potential confrontations by sleep-deprived MPs, according to an anonymous source.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel raised the point with reporters Thursday.

""I find it really difficult to watch as two strong female colleagues continue to be shut down when I watch their male colleagues putting words in their mouth,"" she said, calling the prime minister a ""fake feminist.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh again called for a public inquiry to investigate allegations of political interference between the Prime Minister's Office and the former attorney general.

Watch: As MPs pull all-nighter, Philpott breathes fresh life into SNC-Lavalin scandal

Echoing a point Philpott raised in her interview, Singh said if Liberal have nothing to hide, then ""why don't they waive solicitor client privilege."" Philpott herself said Canadians deserve to learn the truth, he said.

Singh claimed, ""If the prime minister was cooperative, the public inquiry would not take very long.""

Some Liberal MPs were more frank than others about the latest layer in the SNC-Lavalin affair — and challenge to caucus morale in an election year.

Toronto MP Adam Vaughan told reporters on Parliament Hill that he wasn't bothered by Philpott's comments. ""She still supports the party, that's good enough for me,"" he said.

Philpott told Maclean's that ""of course"" she wants a Liberal government, adding she doesn't want to see Andrew Scheer become prime minister after the October election.

Vaughan suggested that the Liberal party is ""big enough and strong enough"" to withstand its current internal challenges.

Another Toronto MP, Julie Dzerowicz, said despite Philpott's latest comments, she still regards the former cabinet minister as a valuable colleague and mentor.

I understand from an opposition standpoint that this is a political gift that keeps on giving. Liberal MP John McKay

Despite neither Philpott or Wilson-Raybould having explicitly said in public remarks that they have confidence in Trudeau, Dzerowicz said: ""I think you don't stay in the party if you don't believe in the prime minister.""

Scarborough—Guildwood MP John McKay was borderline critical of Philpott's latest remarks.

""I understand from an opposition standpoint that this is a political gift that keeps on giving,"" he said. Referencing Philpott's interview, he said if someone believes in cabinet confidence, ""then you can't say something like, 'Well there's more to come.'""

He called Philpott and Wilson-Raybould ""really talented and able people"" who were well-liked up until the SNC-Lavalin affair engulfed the government's focus.

When asked if he thought the controversy will pose as a ""significant"" issue in the upcoming issue, he said he wasn't sure. McKay said Liberal MPs are awakening to the reality that each new layer to the controversy increases the risk of ""political consequences.""

""It's one thing to take a hit from the opposition or circumstances beyond caucus or cabinet,"" he said. ""It's another thing to take political hits from your own people""

McKay suggested if Philpott and Wilson-Raybould haven't crossed a line already with their actions, then they're now ""awfully close to that line.""",Trudeau Says Philpott’s Explosive Interview Shows How Liberals Value 'Diversity Of Perspectives',HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/21/jane-philpott-macleans_a_23697974/

It’s possible to imagine a government that would advertise that change as part of a society-wide shift in attitudes ...","Here and there you still find glimpses of an activist and imaginative government. I’ll get to the big numbers, but I was struck, and encouraged, by a smaller one. On page 156 of Bill Morneau’s 460-page 2019 federal budget there’s $30.5 million over five years for expanded access to safe prescription opioids, “protecting people with problematic opioid use from the risks of overdose and death.”

This is legalization of hard drugs by another name, since many of the people who need a safe opioid supply to survive the greatest public-health crisis of our time will now have an easier time getting that supply. Prohibition remains in place, but Justin Trudeau’s Liberals government is building life-saving bypasses around the general policy.

It’s possible to imagine a government that would advertise that change as part of a society-wide shift in attitudes towards addiction and harm reduction, but the policy is more important than the communications strategy, and at least the policy is here.

Like so many such gestures in Budget 2019, it’s also strikingly modest in scope, starting with $1 million in 2019-2020 and ramping up. This is not a lot compared to the $150 million emergency opioid fund of Budget 2018, or the $350 million in total new investment on the file since this plague started slaughtering drug users in 2017.

The sum of a government’s effort, of course, is measured across its term in office, not only in its election-year announcements. Also of course, if Trudeau and Morneau could afford to announce more new stuff they’d do it. They’ve spent just about every dime of the fiscal windfall they won from lower-than-predicted deficits. But in large measure they’re kept from making big marquee announcements by all the big marquee announcements of earlier years.

Note that the opioid money I led with is $30.5 million over 5 years. Or $6-ish million a year. That’s a heartening announcement now, but it’ll be progressively reduced margin of manoeuvre for next year’s finance minister, whoever that will be. Trudeau/Morneau’s enthusiastic embrace of multi-year spending ramp-ups is now, four budgets in, seriously cramping Morneau/Trudeau’s style.

And it continues: $37.4 million over five years for expanded parental leave for PhD and postdoctoral researchers. A $327.5 million support program over 5 years for First Nations postsecondary students. A comparable program for Inuit students at $125.5 million over 10 years. (Why is the Inuit program twice as long as the First Nations program? It’s a mystery.) $315 over five years to “make the Canada Service Corps Canada’s signature national youth service program.” It’s traditional in French-language news outlets to call such wide-angle disbursement of moderate sums “saupoudrage,” or sprinkling. This is a very sprinkly budget.

Some of its provisions are more ambitious. There’s a billion (over only two years) to improve access to exorbitantly expensive drugs for specified rare diseases. (How do TruMorn afford that? By spending the money later: it will begin flowing only in 2022-23.) There’s $224 million right out of the gate, rising to $392 million in five years, to make Canada Student Loans more generous. There’s $2.2 billion, refreshingly free of attached strings, in “much needed infrastructure funds” right now, this year.

Why infrastructure funds would still be “much needed,” four years into the tenure of the third prime minister in a row to make infrastructure spending a personal priority, is an interesting question for another day.

But overall, the impression is of a government that is deeply preoccupied with election-year concerns but can’t shake loose much money to pay for election-year goodies. As a result, MorTru are forced to come up with novel funding for some of their promises. Universal high-speed internet access will be paid, in part, by “new investments by the Canada Infrastructure Bank.”

You remember the Canada Infrastructure Bank. It was the arms-length agency that was designed to attract countless hundreds of billions from Norwegian and Emirati pension funds to pay for game-changing new public infrastructure. Monorails. Spaceports. Now we learn that the Bank is “examining opportunities… to seek to invest $1 billion over the next 10 years and leverage at least $2 billion in additional private sector investment” to pay for this broadband.

How the government knows this, when the Bank has made no public announcement, and how we are to keep calling the bank arms-length when TruMor are clearly manipulating it with their teeny T Rex arms, is another interesting pair of questions for another interesting day.

Perhaps I can be forgiven for being particularly interested in the questions that arose as I read the section on Supporting Canadian Journalism. This is four paragraphs on Page 173 and four more illuminating pages at the very back of the book. In the jargon of my craft, MorTru are burying the lede.

“A strong and independent news media is crucial to a well-functioning democracy,” they write, so they’re giving the news media hundreds of millions of dollars. Never let it be said that irony is dead. The Prime Minister and his finance minister promise “an independent panel of experts” to “recommend… eligibility criteria.” But the eligibility criteria are already laid out in detail in pages 373-376. I’m left wondering what the independent panel is for.

In order to get its share of the federal money, a news organization will need “Qualified Canadian Journalism Organization” status. It’ll need to be incorporated in Canada, operate in Canada, resident in Canada, its chairperson and at least 75 per cent of its directors will have to be Canadian.

It “must not be primarily focused on a particular topic such as industry-specific news, sports, recreation, arts, lifestyle or entertainment.” You’ll be pleased to know your government wants to subsidize nothing but political news. Because that’s not problematic.

To “ensure that registered journalism organizations are not used to promote the views or objectives of any particular person or related group of persons,” a registered organization “must not be factually controlled by a person (or group of persons).” One suspects this line is designed to keep the kitty out of the hands of anyone named Ezra. Its effect on organizations run by people named Jesse, or founded by people named Joe Atkinson, remains a subject for another day.

Somebody has already decided eligible newsroom labour costs will be capped at $55,000 per year; that the tax credits will be available from next January, i.e. for donations this year; that magazines receiving money from the Canada Periodical Fund, such as the one you’re holding in your digital hands, will not qualify for the labour tax credit; that “carrying on a broadcasting undertaking”—Periscope? Twitter Live?—will also be disqualifying; and, again, that the wage subsidy kicks in this year.

My understanding is that the Conservative opposition intends to spend not a dime of the money the Liberals have put aside for this massive subsidy to Canadian political journalism. Which means that some large percentage of the reporters covering this autumn’s federal election campaign will be in a direct conflict of interest. Maybe this won’t affect anyone’s coverage! Maybe it will backfire, and cranky reporters will go extra-hard on the hand that has already budgeted their feeding! But objectively, one of the issues in the next election will be the taxes on the salaries of reporters who are already working this year. I’m sure this won’t be a problem at all. And you believe me, right?

In the past month, Trudeau and his staffers have been swept up in possibly the biggest corruption scandal in modern Canadian history and things just seem to be getting worse — especially if Trudeau is going to keep making tiny mistakes that Conservatives can then blow way out of proportion, like sneaking a snack onto the House floor.

Wednesday night, MPs in the House of Commons met for a marathon voting session after the Liberal government struck down a Conservative motion to have Jody Wilson-Raybould return for another justice committee hearing to respond to the contradictory testimony given by Trudeau’s former Principal Secretary Gerald Butts on the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Conservatives had tabled 257 separate motions to be voted on individually which could have taken over a solid day of debate to get through.

It is part of the House’s Rules of Decorum that “In the Chamber, Members may refresh themselves with glasses of water during debate, but the consumption of any other beverage or food is not allowed.” So it sparked another whole mini scandal when Conservative MP Scott Reid caught the Right Honourable Trudeau sneaking a snack.

“We all know that the rules of the House do not permit us to eat in this place and I can’t help but observing [sic] that during the last vote, a number of people were eating in their seats including the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Prime Minister who appeared to be hiding a bagel in his desk,” Reid said.

“Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has already stained this place with corruption, he does not need to stain it with mustard as well,” he finished. We’re not ones to condone pettiness among our politicians but that was a solid burn.

Trudeau responded with a very tongue-in-cheek apology and clarified that it wasn’t a bagel, it was actually a chocolate bar.

“Indeed, Mr. Speaker, I apologize, it was a chocolate bar, but I apologize, thank you, Mr. Speaker,” the PM said.

Speaker of the House Geoff Regan, reminded Members that there is no eating in the House as both sides got riled up, each claiming partisan victory the petty exchange.

While no one is out here defending Trudeau, the general online consensus was that it was a low move to call him out (however artfully it was done).

The only way to avoid this, writes the columnist, is for Justin Trudeau to“check his ego at the door.” In addition to dropping his ego, Trudeau was also advised to own up and concede that he and his allies messed up and won’t interfere with criminal prosecutions again.

Trudeau ego was likened to that of Wynne who lost all touch with the people and believed she could beat all odds all by herself until Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives came along with a simple three-word slogan: “For the People.” And took the leadership seat away from her.

It took Wynne about a decade to lose the Ontario seat, but it’s taking Trudeau just about three years, and worse still he seems to be in a free-fall just seven months before the elections. At present, a lot of Canadians are disappointed with Trudeau’s recent actions and the actions of his party allies such as PCO head Michael Wernick, especially how they have handled the entire SNC Lavalin scandal, now popularly called LavScam.

""The past few weeks have been an abysmal, slow-motion train wreck in issues management for the Trudeau Government,"" Ottawa-based political analyst YaroslavBaransaid, speaking with CNN.

When he was elected, Trudeau had promised to bring Canada back, but his actions these past few weeks could only be taking Canada backwards, right now Canada is under investigations by The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. They are reviewing the country’s compliance with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. “That’s the kind of review you’d expect of developing countries rife with corruption.” Says Marin. “Interestingly, Trudeau and his bunch of gofers justified harassing Wilson-Raybould into a deferred prosecution agreement by claiming they could save 9,000 jobs. But a country is under an OECD bribery investigation sends bad vibes to international businesses who might want to invest in Canada. Brilliant.”

Worse still, in the face of all this, Trudeau remains unrepentant. He is neither contrite nor apologetic and blames the former attorney general, Wilson-Raybould for not coming to him with her protests. Even after she had given evidence, that she did meet him with her objections.

Recently, Trudeau seems to be busy with any other thing but the issue at hand. Last week, on Wednesday 13th of March when the Justice Committee was to hold an emergency meeting to discuss bringing back Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance. Trudeau’s Liberals used their majority to adjourn the committee’s work to budget day, it is apparent, that they hope that the budget’s news would swallow upLavscam. Trudeau has also been vacationing, going from North Captiva Island to Florida while the image of its government gets even more tainted.

This begs questions about the Prime Minister’s commitment to the core values that got him that federal seat in the first place.If Trudeau keeps this up, Conservative Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer might just be having a smooth ride in the forthcoming elections.","Failure Looms: Trudeau’s Lav-Scam Snowballs, as Federal Elections Approach",Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13605-failure-looms-trudeaus-lav-scam-snowballs-as-federal-elections-approach.html

Trudeau is scheduled on Friday to hold a town hall meeting with Thunder-Bay Superior North MP Patty Hajdu and Thunder Bay-Rainy River MP Don Rusnak at the CJ Sanders Fieldhouse on Lakehead University campus , according to an event posting on Hajdu's parliamentary website.

According to the event posting, doors will open starting at 5 p.m., with the 90-minute event beginning at 7 p.m.

The prime minister most recently visited Thunder Bay in April 2016, where he made an announcement about federal funding for mass-transit projects across the country.

The visit comes days after Rusnak announced he won't be seeking a second term in the House of Commons, despite being nominated Last November as the riding's Liberal candidate.

On days like today, I wish that all federal politicians were required to undergo brain scans, which would be publicly released.

It's because the political crisis that's affecting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shows no signs of going away. And perhaps some brain scans would help clear the air once and for all.

I'll have more on that later in this article.

But here's the central question facing Canadians.

Is Trudeau a con artist—or, as Macleans suggested, an ""imposter""? Or did he genuinely believe he was acting in the public interest when he claimed that 9,000 jobs were in jeopardy if SNC-Lavalin didn't obtain a deferred prosecution agreement?

Here's what we know now.

Yesterday, SNC-Lavalin's CEO, Neil Bruce, rejected Liberal suggestions that 9,000 jobs could vanish without a DPA.

Bruce told Radio-Canada that many of his company's Canadian employees would be snapped up by other engineering and construction companies.

That was also pointed out on this website last month by B.C. resident Phil Le Good. He keeps a close eye on the construction and engineering sector.

Yet the 9,000-jobs line was repeatedly peddled in the media.

The next bombshell on this story came from a former senior cabinet minister, Jane Philpott.

She told Macleans magazine that there's more to the SNC-Lavalin story than has been revealed to date.

She's particularly troubled by the government's insistence on muzzling former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau's cabinet has refused to waive cabinet confidentiality after January 14 so Wilson-Raybould can tell more of her story to the Commons justice committee.

""If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories?"" Philpott declared to journalist Paul Wells.

Moreover, Philpott said it was an ""insult"" for Finance Minister Bill Morneau to suggest that she quit cabinet as an expression of personal friendship with Wilson-Raybould.

So there you have it: two of the most powerful women in Trudeau's cabinet—one a medical doctor, the other a former prosecutor—have walked out on him.

A third, Celina R. Caesar-Chavannes, has quit the Liberal caucus.

Caesar-Chavannes has an undergraduate biology degree from the University of Toronto, an MBA in health-care management, and an executive MLA. She's also been an international research consultant.

These are three very well-educated women, one of whom has extensive experience dealing with offenders in the criminal justice system. Two others have a keen interest in science and health care.

What are their conclusions about Trudeau that the public might not be aware of?

Neuroscience can expose con artists

Now, on to those brain scans.

Last year, the journal Human Brain Mapping published a paper examining ""the neural correlates associated with psychopathy"".

This was done with the help of resting-state functional magnetic resource imaging.

University of New Mexico researcher Kent Kiehl brought a mobile device into a medium-security prison and screened inmates who had previously been diagnosed with psychopathy.

Another member of the research team was University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health assistant psychiatry professor Michael Koenigs.

He said it was the first study to reveal structural and functional differences in the brains of people who had been assessed as psychopaths.

The scans showed reduced connections between the part of the brain associated with empathy and guilt and the part of the brain that mediates fear and anxiety.

Specifically, the research indicated that Factor 1 traits for psychopathy—generally covering selfish, callous, and remorseless use of others—are associated with structural anomalies in the brain.

Factor 1 traits include the interpersonal and affective deficits of psychopathy, such as shallow affect, superficial charm, manipulativeness, and lack of empathy.

These traits are also linked to narcissistic personality disorder, which is characterized by grandiosity and a lack of empathy.

People who score highly in these Factor 1 traits demonstrate low levels of distress, suffer little stress, and have a low suicide rate.

""Factor 1 scores showed both increased and reduced functional connectivity between RSNs [resting-state networks] from seven brain domains (sensorimotor, cerebellar, visual, salience, default mode, executive control, and attentional),"" the researchers stated in the abstract. ""Consistent with hypotheses, RSNs from the paralimbic system-insula, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, orbital frontal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus-were related to Factor 1 scores.""

Factor 2 traits of psychopathy relate to social deviance and sensation seeking. The study could not detect functional network connectivity issues for these characteristics through magnetic-resonance imaging.

To sum up:

* portable functional magnetic resonance imaging machines can detect shortcomings in neural connections;

* some people with character defects demonstrate anomalies in the links between the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with empathy and guilt, and the amygdala;

* the amygdala is an almond-shaped set of neurons in the brain's limbic system that's associated with fear.

It's reasonable to conclude that people with these particular anomalies are likely to be less trustworthy than the average person. At the very least, they're likely to have less empathy.

Isn't that something Canadians deserve to know the next time they walk into the ballot box?

It raises a legitimate question whether anyone entering federal politics should have to undergo this screening.

If we're allowed to have access to their financial-disclosure statements, why not their brain scans?

Especially if this holds the prospect of ferreting out con artists.","The Jane Philpott shocker, neuroscience, and questions about the character of Justin Trudeau",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1217036/jane-philpott-shocker-neuroscience-and-questions-about-character-justin-trudeau

Of all the reasons to give Justin Trudeau a pass on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the one the Liberals and their supporters seem most confident of is the existence of Andrew Scheer.

It’s pretty clear, at this point, that Justin Trudeau and his staff put pressure on the top law enforcement officer in the country to try to affect her decision about publicly prosecuting a large engineering company.

The Liberals are trying to suggest that it’s all a big misunderstanding and that the attorney general misinterpreted some everyday talk about this big issue. We’re all friends here, they say. Nothing to see here, they say.

And certain portions of the public have been more than ready to lap up whatever excuse the Liberals come up with because they are terrified of the thought of Andrew Scheer as prime minister.

Of course, Andrew Scheer’s existence is as relevant as my kid’s conjunctivitis to whether Trudeau acted wrongly or rightly.

If he was wrong, he was wrong even if you don’t want to vote for Scheer (or Singh or Bernier).

RELATED: Scheer makes statement on mosque attacks after backlash for no mention of Muslims

RELATED: 2 years after Quebec mosque killings, Islamophobia continues to rise

But what do you do, when everybody is due a thrashing? Holding your nose at the ballot box is a cliché because we accept that sometimes there is no great option.

If we should electorally punish those who do the wrong thing for political reasons, should we not also punish those who choose not to do the right things for political reasons?

One of the reasons people are so uncomfortable with Scheer is because of his and his party’s rhetoric over the past couple years on the topic of immigration, the border and other Trumpy topics.

Among all the many topics they can choose from, the Conservatives have been loudest about issues that, perhaps unsurprisingly, roil up the relatively tiny portion of Canadians who love to bash out angry caps-locked comments on Facebook.

To keep those folks from fleeing to whatever Maxime Bernier is doing, the Conservatives have railed against a tepid condemnation of Islamophobia and given voice to those fearmongering about a similarly bland United Nations migration agreement that will have not a whit of impact on Canadian policy.

There is little in Scheer’s background to suggest he is not a typical middle-of-the-road Canadian Conservative likely to continue with typically unoffensive Conservative immigration policy. He says the right things when pushed, and needs the votes of the huge number of Canadians who prize this country’s reputation for tolerance.

But recently, Scheer seems to have decided that the best political move is to avoid confronting those people who say Muslim immigrants are to be feared, not welcomed.

As a conservative, Scheer has credibility with those who detest Trudeau and are irrationally afraid of Muslims. At a town hall, John McCain famously defended Barack Obama as a good man, even as he strove to defeat him at the ballot box.

Scheer, similarly, has a chance – one that isn’t open to others – to try to de-radicalize a fearful segment of voters, while making it clear that a change in government won’t alter how welcoming Canada is to Muslims. He could forcefully and repeatedly try to reach that segment of the population and convince them that while he thinks policies should be changed, immigration does not pose a safety risk to Canadians.

He has not yet done so, but it’s still not too late.

Making decisions for political reasons is often, and thankfully, the worst political move of all.

Sometimes it’s best to just do the right thing and sleep well at night.

Since this is an election year, the Trudeau Liberal deficit ...","Guess what was supposed to happen in 2019? Aside from this being an election

year, no more federal budget deficits. At least that was the pledge Justin

Trudeau made when he campaigned for his dad’s old job in Ottawa back in

2015. Since this is an election year, the Trudeau Liberal deficit addiction bears

some scrutiny.

Last time around, he laid out a platform that promised deficits of no more than

$10 billion a year for the first three years and we’d be deficit-free by this year. All

that planned spending during a period of non-economic turmoil was supposed

to bolster Canada’s so-called crumbling infrastructure and presumably cover

Liberal policy commitments.

Well didn’t Justin and his pals blow by that $10 billion in the first eight months,

clocking in at $12.7 billion. That compares to a $1 billion surplus under the previous

regime the year before. And they have been busting through that ceiling every

year since, abandoning any pretext of eliminating budget deficits. More than $75

billion has been added to the federal debt, compared to the $20 billion based on

the Liberal’s election plan.

Most folks have credit cards. If we spend on credit, we are required to make a

minimum payment and cover hefty interest charges.

Governments have to pay interest too, although not nearly as much as we do on

our credit card balances. But it’s okay for them because of a rationalization called

the debt to GDP ratio. That means the debt can pile up as long as the spender

continues to pay interest without refinancing or harming the economy. And it can

be pushed ahead for an eternity.

Not to worry, Trudeau says. The economy is humming, unemployment is low

and business profits are up. Besides, finance minister Bill Morneau contends

deficits and debts aren’t all that important.

Former Prime Minister Paul Martin supports the Trudeau government’s proclivity

for deficits, being a good Liberal and this an election year. He is also aware of

the danger presented by endless deficits and mounting debt.

In 1993, as finance minister, he faced a yearly deficit of $42 billion after successive

governments piled up red ink over the previous 25 years, starting with

Trudeau senior. It was alarming enough for the government to slash $25 billion

from the federal budget in three years and post five budget surpluses, which

allowed the government to ramp up its spending. Laser focus on the debt to GDP

ratio, of course.

But what happens if the economy goes south because of a recession? Or, for

example, an unexpected Trump eruption results in the US scuttling the NAFTA

redo? What if interest rates are hiked? Growing interest payments will impact

productive spending.

Here are some numbers to consider. Canada’s net debt as of 2017-18 was $758.8

billion with a $26 billion interest charge.

A finance department report shows federal deficits until 2040-41. The debt

will be almost erased by 2050, as the ratio drops from 28.5% in 2023-24 to 24% in

2055-56. But this dubious scenario presumes surpluses in the 2040s and 2050s go

directly to reducing the debt. It’s dubious because governments in the past (and

current) always found reasons to put off debt reduction.

By contrast, the 2014 version of the financial report under the Stephen Harper

regime projected decades of consecutive surpluses (perhaps equally dubious).

The Trudeau government wasn’t elected in 2015 on a platform that included

deficits and debt as far as the eye can see. Someone, please, revoke that credit

card. This is short-term gain for long-term pain that saddles future generations

with the risk and the fallout.","Trudeau’s deficits: Short-term gain, long-term pain",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/insights/trudeaus-deficits-short-term-gain-long-term-pain/

But sadly, it has.

And beyond every other reason Butts, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or now ordinary Liberal MP Jody Wilson-Raybould have given you to be displeased with this federal Liberal administration, the inability of the federal government to get anything done may be what ultimately sinks the Liberal ship.

Truth be told, it was unlikely that Butts was going to change anyone’s mind, anyway. There are those who perhaps correctly observe he seemed sincere, forthright and detailed … just as Wilson-Raybould was. He admitted it was likely a mistake to consider Wilson-Raybould for the Indian Affairs portfolio and he may have even scored credibility points in acknowledging how oblivious he and Trudeau had been.

However, neither he nor Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick were particularly effective at explaining away the substance of the matter: The lack of justification for the Prime Minister’s Office applying anything vaguely resembling undue pressure on the former attorney general to get her to consider a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin executives.

The likely reality is that Wednesday’s testimony only solidified already preconceived views that the fear of job losses was a thinly veiled excuse for the underlying political implications of wanting to support a Quebec-based employer. This is unhelpful to a government needing to expand its political base. Rather, it only further infuriates the West … especially given conservative Western politicians’ eagerness to fan those flames.

Long before #LavScam became a hashtag, the Liberals were already sailing into unchartered waters looking for votes in places like Saskatchewan where more seats seemed unlikely.

The sensibility of this always seemed questionable — as puzzling as Trudeau’s proposed pro-carbon tax event rally at Regina’s Canadian Tire South this week. That event, along with an evening Liberal fundraiser, wound up being cancelled so that Trudeau could deal with his ongoing political crisis.

But if Liberal expansion was a lost cause before, it’s been made worse by the perception that SNC-Lavalin has distracted the federal government from issues of importance to the West.

“We see a federal government that is only focused on managing this challenge that they have in Ottawa and we see our relationship with our trading partners around the world deteriorating,” said Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, citing fears Canadian Ambassador to the U.S.David McNaughton’s attention may be diverted from the fight to end steel and aluminum tariffs.

Add to the list this week’s announcement that China has rejected a Canadian canola shipment because of increased tensions between the two countries following the Dec. 1 arrest and pending extradition to the U.S. of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.

Of course, Trudeau and his federal government shouldn’t be faulted for the madness of U.S. President Donald Trump’s steel tariffs or following the rule of law in Meng’s extradition process. Moreover, a political taint accompanies Moe’s criticism that Trudeau is “not the Prime Minister of Quebec” that could be unhelpful in the long run.

There is more than a little irony in former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall’s National Post op-ed piece this week that essentially scolded the Trudeau government for showing political favouritism to a local business and big-time political donor in SNC-Lavalin. Wall is surely aware of what’s going on in Wascana Centre with Brandt Developments that started under his watch.

Nevertheless, Wall, Moe, et. al. appear to be right that federal policies potentially affecting the West’s oil-based jobs don’t get the same attention that the federal Liberal government has afforded SNC-Lavalin’s problems.

The simple reality is, the feds often have to deal with issues not of their own making. When you are pre-occupied by issues of your own making, you have a problem.

Trudeau and his federal Liberal government have turned their problems into big problems for all of us.

Perhaps more importantly, sources familiar with today’s planned event, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an announcement that isn’t yet public, say the prime minister will also announce the opening of a database that Inuit families can soon use to find loved ones who died when they were transported south for treatment.

Oh, yes! A certain fondness for tossing Alberta’s economy under the bus? It almost seems programmed into their DNA.

But what I like best about the Trudeaus — pere et fils — is how their unbridled totalitarianism manages to engender such interesting, but one assumes unintended, social experiments. The elder, for instance, gave us the only —shades of Trump’s “wall”— peacetime implementation of the War Measures Act,which, for those of us who remember the October Crisis, wounded Canadians’ self-image as the nicest people on Earth. Not to be outdone, Trudeau the younger has blessed us with the Wilson-Raybould debacle,which will tell us, come October this year, whether Canadian voterscare more about virtue signaling — i.e. claiming to be pro-women and indigenous peoples — or actual policy, as in actually being pro women and said indigenous peoples.

Now, I don’t profess any professional knowledge of what might happen on October 21st — the National Post’s Andrew Coyne would be the expert to address the current Trudeau government’s travails — but I do havea few questions about some unintended consequences of the recent budget, the part that proposes Canada’s first nationwide rebate/subsidy/call-it-whatever-you-like on electric vehicles.

For instance, while this proposal will no doubt spur further growth in zero-emissions vehicles, what interests me more is that it may finally answer the question that has long dogged pro- and anti-EV protagonists alike: Can EVs ever survive on their own merit? Or will zero emissions vehicles be sucking at the government’s teat forevermore?

Interestingly, I will have a front seat to this experiment since Ontario will be the Liberal Party’s Petri dish. Previous provincial governments, as everyone knows, ladled huge incentives on the EV purchaser, offering consumers as much as $13,000 for buying an electric vehicle. Premier Doug Ford, to much fanfare/controversy/outright derision, nixed all that. Predictably, the dissolution of the incentives hollowed out the EV market. What had grown, at its peak, to more than two per cent of Ontario’s new-car marketplace, was instantly reduced by some 80 per cent.

The question now is:With the return of the incentive — albeit now federally administered and much reduced — will sales return to the previous breakneck pace? Or will the increase in EV sales be commensurate with the modest support the feds are willing to dosh out? If it’s the former, then there may yet be legs to this electric vehicle revolution.

If it’s the latter,it will be further proof that Ontarians were never actually shopping EVs, just the massive rebates that were on offer. If the Ginsu knives and Bowflex home gyms languishing in all our garages teach us anything, it’s that Canadians would probably buy coal-powered cars were they eligible fora $13,000 rebate.

What’s perhaps even more interesting is the Liberal’s choice of $45,000 as the break point for this subsidy — vehicles with a “manufacturer’s suggested retail price” greater than 45-large are not eligible for the federal rebate. While choosing $45,000 as the limit may seem politically astute — so as not seen to be a sop to rich Tesla buyers— it’s horribly obvious that no one in the Liberal finance department spent even a minute researching the actual price of electric vehicles. If they had, they would have quickly determined that $45,000 was a particularly unfortunate/inconvenient/market-altering cut-off.

To wit:While some of the new major players — Nissan’s Leaf and the Chevrolet Bolt, for instance —have base MSRPs just below $45,000, their popular trim levels are all well above that demarcation. For instance, while Chevrolet’s base Bolt EV starts at $44,800, the Premier versions go for $49,800. Indeed, of the 403 Bolts currently for sale on Chevrolet Canada’s online auction, only 54 would qualify for the rebate. Nissan’s Leaf is in the same boat: While the two base modelsdo sneak in under the $45,000 mark, thetwo morepopular versions of the new, longer-range Leaf Plus are both over $45,000. And pity poor Hyundai — the Kona Electric — hardly what anyone would consider a“luxury” vehicle — starts at $45,599 and will not be eligible for the new federal rebate.

Indeed, it’s hard to understand exactly what Mr. Morneau was thinking when he proposed the $45,000 cut-off. Is this, as I alluded to, some not-so-subtle exercise in social engineering, the Liberals expecting automakers to reduce the price of their EVs? Unlikely. Do they hope more Canadians will buy base-model Bolts? Even more unlikely, as we of the Great White Frozen North are famous for preferring fully optioned cars of all kinds. Or did they simply not do their homework, unaware that so many popular EVs lie just outside their arbitrary $45,000 cap?

That certainly would be seem to be the case for proposing a100-per-cent corporate tax deduction, essentially allowing big business to write off up to $55,000 if they buy an EV. Interestingly, along with battery-powered EVs and fuel cell vehicles, this incentive includes plug-in hybrids. The problem with that decision is that while corporations might buy more PHEVs, the employees driving them may not use them as intended.

In the Netherlands, which tried a similar business-oriented subsidy, leasing company Arval reported that corporate-driven Opel Amperas — the European version of our Chevrolet Volt — were consuming 80% more fuel than their government rating. It seems that while Dutch corporations loved the tax exemptions, the people actually driving their plug-in write-offs, not nearly as sold on their emissions-reducing benefits, weren’t bothering to plug them in. Instead, they often drove them as if they were simply gasoline-powered.

And then there’s the contention — proposed by auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers —that any EV subsidy is both regressive and ineffectual. Pretty much everyone agrees that the cars we need to get off the road first are aging, high-emissions gas-guzzlers. And who owns said gas-guzzlers? Why, the very lower-income Canadians the Liberals purport to represent. Perhaps if Mr. Trudeau were less concerned about virtue signaling — and a little more with actually reducing greenhouse gas emissions — he might have incentivized low-income Canadians to trade in the rusting Chevy Impalas and Ford Crown Victorias they’re currently driving on something far less polluting — like, say, a five-year-old Honda Civic.

Peter Collins plans to bring that up Friday with the Prime Minister when Justin Trudeau visits Thunder Bay.

In an interview Wednesday, Collins said one of the first things that stood out for him as he reviewed the budget was the commitment to invest $1.2 billion over three years to improve services for First Nations children.

""Particularly around Jordan's Principle [Jordan's Principle is named after a child from Manitoba who died in hospital at the age of five. It calls on the government of first contact to pay for services and seek reimbursement later so a child does not get caught up in bureaucratic red tape] and the funding that will be injected into that to help young kids and their families when they're struggling to get the health needs that they require,"" Collins said.

However, he said, he's still waiting to see help for disabled young people facing challenges getting into the job market.

""Where do they fit into that budget process? There's never a dollar identified, through the provincial mandate or through the federal mandate. The young people with disabilities want to be employed in our communities,"" Collins stated.

He'll raise the issue with Trudeau, noting that after a previous budget the Prime Minister told him funding for disabled youth to find employment was set aside, but when he checked he found no reference to such an allocation.

Saying that he has a child himself who could use that kind of assistance, Collins said it's an important issue for ""young folk who are struggling"" not just in his own community but in Thunder Bay.

He's also looking for more support for youth with addictions, and funds to build housing for young people living on low incomes, saying it's necessary to help members who want to return to live on the reserve.

""We need housing. We build a subdivision this year, and it's full next year. As our community grows, we need more.""

The Chief expressed cautious optimism that a federal commitment to revitalize Indigenous languages will benefit Fort William.

""You've got 630 First Nations across Canada. If you talk about the $333 million [over five years] what's that break down per community? There's a shortfall there but there's still a lot of work that we can do to start to lay the foundations to get our language back in our community,"" he said.

Collins said he is satisfied ""to a certain degree"" with the process of reconciliation.

""We gave up a treaty that talks about resource-sharing agreements. And we're finally seeing some of that coming to reality. Yes, it's short, but we're happy to be starting on a path to reconciliation.""

He said he's waiting to find out if the federal government might give Fort William additional money from the specific claims process.

""We were capped at $150 million on the boundary claim in particular...are they going to open that up for discussion in the future ?"" Collins asked.

The government said it plans to forgive loans that were given to Indigenous groups to negotiate comprehensive claims and treaties.

""We had to borrow money to settle six claims. We had to borrow up to $6.1 million. We had to pay that back through the settlement agreement. If they are reaching back, hopefully we can get some of that money"" to help build Fort William First Nation, Collins said.",Fort William First Nation chief hopes for chat with PM Trudeau,Tbnewswatch,https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/fort-william-first-nation-chief-hopes-for-chat-with-pm-trudeau-1332329

Heckling from Conservatives over the SNC-Lavalin affair during budget day has not done Opposition leader Andrew Scheer any favours, according to a former Liberal strategist.

""Part of the Opposition's job is to oppose, of course, but the other job is to present themselves as a government-in-waiting — that was not a government-in-waiting,"" said John Duffy, who was an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin, and is the founder of StrategyCorp.

As Finance Minister Bill Morneau delivered his budget speech Tuesday, the beginning of his speech was drowned out by noise from the benches opposite, in protest at the Liberal-majority justice committee shutting down an investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Duffy told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti that the Liberals ""were pretty realistic about what the Opposition was likely to do yesterday.""

""What we didn't expect was the spectacle. The pounding, the stamping, the hooting and hollering … really looking like a tantrum from a daycare centre.""

""I don't think Mr. Scheer did himself any favours in that.""

Conservative MPs banged on desks and jeered loudly during Finance Minister Bill Morneau's budget speech making it nearly impossible to hear what Morneau was trying to say. 0:26

Speaking after the budget was delivered, Scheer said that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was using the budget to distract from the SNC-Lavalin affair, and accusations that former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to intervene in the criminal case against the company.

""Mr. Trudeau's plan is obvious. Massive deficits to distract Canadians from his corruption before the election. Massive tax hikes to pay for them after the election,"" he said.

He added that Canadians ""demand answers on the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal and Conservatives will do everything we can to get them.""

Angela Wright, a freelance political writer and Conservative strategist, said she understands ""where the frustration comes from"" for the Conservatives.

""Of course the government wants to talk about the budget, but they have to know that the Conservatives still want to talk about SNC-Lavalin,"" she told Tremonti.

Canadians should at least be able to hear what the finance minister has to say. - Angela Wright

However, despite their frustrations, they should recognize the importance of the budget, she said.

""If the government wants to deliver the budget, then Canadians should at least be able to hear what the finance minister has to say.""

""Then they can come out and continue to remind Canadians about SNC-Lavalin and the fact they're not going to let the issue go away.""

Leader of the Official Opposition Andrew Scheer threatens emergency actions to ensure Canadians hear the whole story on the SNC-Lavalin affair. 0:34

For their views on the latest from Parliament Hill, and how it could affect voters, Tremonti was joined by:

John Duffy, former Liberal strategist and advisor to former Prime Minister Paul Martin, founder of StrategyCorp, and author of Fights of Our Lives: Elections, Leadership and the Making of Canada.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

The leaders of Canada’s largest labour organization and a prominent national Muslim group say Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is emboldening far-right extremists by failing to call out Islamophobia following the New Zealand mosque shootings and attending events with people who promote hate speech.

Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) president Hassan Yussuff criticized Mr. Scheer’s response to the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last week that left 50 people dead and dozens more injured. Mr. Scheer issued a lengthy statement about the terrorism attacks Friday after his initial Twitter message on the shootings were criticized for failing to mention that the victims were Muslims.

“Unfortunately the opposition leader had to be shamed to do a 180-degree turn to actually acknowledge what happened. Had he not been shamed, I’m not sure he would have changed his position,” Mr. Yussuf said Thursday.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), said Mr. Scheer’s initial decision to avoid saying that the victims were Muslims and the attacks took place at mosques “felt very deliberate.”

“There is a real danger that this kind of association helps to embolden others to feel like they now have licence to act out on their hatred and on their ideologies,” Mr. Gardee said.

Mr. Yussuf also condemned Mr. Scheer for sharing a stage with “racists and bigots” at a protest led by a convoy of pro-pipeline, anti-carbon-tax demonstrators in February. Former Rebel Media personality Faith Goldy also attended the rally on Parliament Hill, where she told Indigenous counterprotesters to leave Canada if they didn’t like it.

Mr. Yussuf said Mr. Scheer should know better than to attend events with right-wing figures such as Ms. Goldy.

Opinion: Trudeau’s politicization of the New Zealand terror attack puts Scheer on the spot

Scheer says he didn’t hear reference to pizzagate conspiracy during Kitchener, Ont., event

Opinion: Can Andrew Scheer bring two sides of the Conservative voter base together?

A spokesman for Mr. Scheer said the Tory leader was “very clear and emphatic” in his condemnation of the anti-Muslim hatred that motivated the New Zealand mosque attacks.

“Further, in his speech to the House of Commons earlier this week, he called for action to defend a concept of Canada rooted in shared civic values, respect for the principle of universal human dignity and freedom of religion for all,” said Brock Harrison, Mr. Scheer’s spokesman.

The CLC and the NCCM shared their concerns at a media conference about the rise of Islamophobia in Canadian workplaces, where they released a new report on the matter.

The report cites a steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslim communities in Canada over the past several years, fuelled by far-right politics at home and abroad. It makes several recommendations aimed at reinforcing the responsibility of employers to educate management and staff about legal obligations around human rights and religious accommodations for Muslims. It also calls on governments to do more to support anti-racism awareness campaigns and develop strategies to combat online hate speech.

“What we’re talking about here is the everyday micro-aggressions that inform this fearful environment that many Canadian Muslims exist in and infiltrates every aspect of their daily life,” said Leila Nasr, NCCM communications co-ordinator.

213,Politics,2019-03-15T18:32:00.0000000Z,OTTAWA -- Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer issued two statements on the terrorist attacks in New Zealand on Friday -- the second after being criticized for not mentioning in the first that the attack was against Muslims at mosques during their Friday prayers.,"

Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer issued two statements on the terrorist attacks in New Zealand on Friday -- the second after being criticized for not mentioning in the first that the attack was against Muslims at mosques during their Friday prayers.

Two Conservative MPs have also cancelled an event on Monday with a British parliamentarian who has been accused of promoting anti-Islamic sentiments ""out of respect"" for Muslims reeling from the attacks that killed 49 people.

Scheer posted to Twitter and Facebook late Thursday evening in Canada as news of the attacks was reported, saying ""freedom has come under attack"" and mentioning ""peaceful worshippers"" and a ""despicable act of evil.""

""All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear,"" he wrote.

But the statement was condemned quickly online for failing to specify that the attack was on Muslims, during prayers at mosques. Some pointed to the fact he did name Coptic Christians and call out anti-Semitism in previous tweets when killers attacked Egyptian churches in 2017 and a synagogue in Pittsburgh last fall.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims criticized the omission in a statement Friday afternoon.

""While some of our elected leaders sadly choose not to mention `Muslim' or `mosque' while denouncing the Christchurch attacks, the reality is that these horrific shootings and the Quebec City mosque attack on Jan. 29, 2017, have left Canadian Muslim communities -- and indeed, Muslims around the world -- feeling very vulnerable and unsafe,"" wrote the Council's executive director Ihsaan Gardee. ""It is therefore essential that our elected leaders speak out clearly and unequivocally against such attacks and name them for the Islamophobic terrorist attacks that they are.""

The statement does not mention Scheer by name but at that point, he was the only Canadian political leader whose public response to the attacks did not mention either Muslims or mosques.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement condemned the attacks as terrorism and said everyone must work to ""confront Islamophobia.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that ""Islamophobia kills.""

Green Leader Elizabeth May did not mention Muslims in her first Tweet but retweeted several others who did.

Former Conservative Maxime Bernier, now the leader of the People's Party of Canada, hadn't posted anything about the attacks at all by late Friday.

Scheer's office did not respond to an initial query about the statement's not mentioning Muslims but after being asked about the statement from the National Council of Canadian Muslims, his spokesman responded with a link to a new statement on Scheer's Facebook page.

""As Canadians are learning the horrific details of last night's terror attack at two New Zealand mosques, I wish to express both my deep sadness at the tragic loss of innocent life and my profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community,"" it said.

It said Conservatives stand with Muslims around the world to ""reaffirm our commitment to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together.""

A month ago, Scheer was criticized for sharing a stage on Parliament Hill with a cross-Canada truck convoy mostly protesting Liberal inaction on the energy industry but which included some people promoting hatred. Scheer said he was only there to support the energy workers, not the ""other elements that tried to associate themselves with the event.""

Those ""elements"" were people affiliated with the Canadian Yellow Vest movement, whose Facebook page included some comments celebrating the New Zealand attacks Friday.

Meanwhile, Conservative MP Garnett Genuis tweeted Friday that Monday's reception with Baroness Caroline Cox, a member of the British House of Lords, has been cancelled.

Genuis, an Edmonton-area MP, and fellow Conservative MP Kelly Block of Saskatchewan were to co-host the reception with Cox, who has shown support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and has said she believes Muslims are trying to destroy Western democracies with Shariah law.

Toronto Liberal MP Judy Sgro pulled out of the event after she found out about Cox's participation. Genuis initially rejected calls to follow suit, calling it a talk on human rights, and accused Sgro on social media of retreating only after she remembered this is an election year.

He said in a statement Friday that Cox's views are subject of ""some debate, and perhaps some confusion.""

""With that said, our friends in the Muslim community are now reeling from one of the most horrific and appalling terrorist attacks to ever target their community,"" he wrote. ""Out of respect for them, now is not the time for a conversation that could been (sic) misconstrued to take place on Parliament Hill. As such, the event will not be proceeding as planned.""","After criticism, Scheer adds word 'Muslim' to statement on New Zealand mosque attacks",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/after-criticism-scheer-adds-word-muslim-to-statement-on-new-zealand-mosque-attacks-1.4338025

At one point during the event in Kitchener, Ont. last night, a member of the audience rose to ask Scheer a two-minute question touching on several subjects, including immigration funding and international aid. He then linked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the mythical conspiracy known as ""pizzagate,"" which gained traction around the 2016 United States presidential election.

""Trudeau gave $600 million to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation is part of child trafficking and child sacrifice, if you study it. It's in the pizzagate,"" he said.

""The PM, if he knows about the foundation, should he be in jail for that one? Also, he needs to pay back the $600 million plus his trips to the Canadians.""

Watch the townhall exchange

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was asked about the government's contribution to the Clinton Foundation during a townhall. He later said he didn't hear a reference to ""pizzagate."" 5:12

The conspiracy theory accuses Clinton and her team of running a child sex ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza shop in Washington, D.C.

Pizzagate is often cited in discussions about the real-life dangers of false news online. In 2016, a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside the restaurant as he attempted to ""self-investigate"" the unfounded internet rumours about Democrats hiding child sex slaves there.

While no one was injured in that incident, a U.S. judge told gunman Edgar Welch that his actions ""literally left psychological wreckage."" Welch was sentenced to four years in prison.

Pizzagate — which the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has called ""a fictitious online conspiracy theory"" — is largely believed to have gained momentum after WikiLeaks released emails from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, mentioning pizza parties and a fundraiser at the Comet restaurant. Some online communities theorized it was code for something more heinous.

In his response to the town hall questioner, Scheer did not say the pizzagate theory was false — although he did pick up on the Clinton Foundation angle to talk about Trudeau spending taxpayers' money on what he called ""personal projects.""

""Yes. Well, I appreciate your concerns on this,"" he replied.

""I can assure you that when you look at where Justin Trudeau has spent money, it's clear that a huge sum of the dollars that he is taken from Canadian taxpayers has gone to his own personal projects.

""You mentioned that the Clinton Foundation ... there are other examples where Justin Trudeau's government has given grants to hire people for groups that are, you know, advocating for their own particular ideology, specifically fighting against things like pipelines and building our infrastructure to be able to get our energy to international markets.""

When asked why he didn't confront the conspiracy theory at the time, Scheer said he didn't hear that part of the question.

""I heard the question was related to the government's, Justin Trudeau's decision to give a grant to the Clinton Foundation. That was what I answered. I didn't hear anything about the other aspect that you just mentioned,"" he told reporters during a stop in Rosser, Man. today.

""I didn't hear that. I heard the Clinton Foundation part of the question, I heard other parts of the question, but I certainly didn't hear that.""​

Watch: Scheer said he didn't hear pizzagate question

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

The Liberal government has pledged $20 million over five years to the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which is affiliated with the foundation.

According to the Global Affairs website, the money is helping the initiative improve access to sexual and reproductive health services for women and girls in Nigeria.

A quick tally of the numbers posted to the government's website shows the previous Conservative government, of which Scheer was a part, actually contributed more to the initiative.

Going back to 2013, the Harper government spent nearly $19 million to help the initiative deliver vaccinations, $14 million on diarrhea treatment and about $460,000 to a fund tuberculosis research project on miners in African countries.

Scheer 'does not keep up with paranoid' theories

A spokesperson for Trudeau accused Scheer of promoting falsehoods, citing his attacks on the federal government's embrace of the UN Global Compact on Migration. Scheer has said he fears the document could exert an influence over Canada's immigration system — even though it is not a treaty and is not binding on the nations that support it.

Spokesperson Eleanore Catenaro also criticized Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" at the recent United We Roll protest with Faith Goldy, a former Rebel Media commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

(Jessica Gresko/Associated Press)

""It's no surprise Andrew Scheer refused to condemn this, given his clear history of promoting conspiracy theories and spreading misleading information, including his comments on the UN migration compact,"" said Catenaro. ""He has also refused to condemn the hateful language at recent events on Parliament Hill at which he shared the stage with far-right groups.""

Scheer's press secretary told CBC News today the Conservative leader ""does not keep up with paranoid, American alt-right conspiracy theories and as such was not familiar with the term until it came up in the questioning today.""

""Since learning about the pizzagate conspiracy, Mr. Scheer obviously believes it is ridiculous and dangerous, and that such conspiracies have no place in our political debate,"" said Daniel Schow in an email.

Trudeau also has been confronted with false allegations during his town hall tours.

Other leaders, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Premier Doug Ford all made specific mention to the victims being Muslim or at prayer in a mosque.

But Scheer’s initial statement suggested it was “freedom” under attack. “Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely without fear,” Scheer wrote Thursday night, adding “there are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred.” The statement was widely criticized on social media and by anti-racism advocates, who pointed to the Conservative party’s past policies — such as the proposed niqab ban and the “barbaric practices” tip line — as well as Scheer’s failing to specifically mention the terrorist attack clearly targeted Muslims.

“Houses of worship, like the two mosques attacked last night, should be places where all people can meet freely and without fear,” a quote attributed to Scheer read. “We stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters to ensure that they remain this way. We must condemn, in the strongest terms possible, the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil.”

Bernie Farber, the head of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, pointed out that it took 15 hours of criticism before Scheer updated his statement. “I don’t want to sound at all political, because the Canadian AntiHate Network is not (political). What we do is we concentrate and we look at … what are the ingredients where hate can develop, and terrorism can develop,” Farber told the Star. “When he puts out a statement that won’t even acknowledge that the people murdered in New Zealand were New Zealand Muslims, when he speaks to a crowd that has a large number of racist and bigots and anti-immigration individuals (at a recent “yellow vest” protest on Parliament Hill) and says not a word? That’s what lets hatred grow.

Details about the Christchurch terrorist’s suspected motivations were available almost immediately, through a number of posts on 8chan, an online message board used by racists and bigots. A “manifesto” attributed to the shooter referenced a number of white supremacist and neo-Nazi tropes. Pictures believed to be of the terrorist’s rifles and ammunition show common far-right ideas and names of killers, including Alexandre Bissonnette, the Quebec City man who killed six Muslim men while at evening prayers in 2017. Scheer faced similar criticism last month for addressing a protest outside Parliament Hill that was also addressed by white nationalist Faith Goldy, a former television personality. The “United We Roll” protest convoy was initially associated with the Canadian version of the “yellow vest” protest movement — which mixes anger over economic challenges facing the oil and gas sector with outright Islamophobia. Organizers downplayed the association after facing media scrutiny. Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @alexboutilier

It’s an overreach, to be sure. But let’s grant Scheer a little latitude for his inflated rhetoric. As opposition leader, he has a duty to focus public attention squarely on the misdeeds of the government of the day.

Mission accomplished.

But eventually, when enough blows have been inflicted on the ruling party to ensure its alleged offences have been exposed and that reforms are being robustly debated, we should step back momentarily — even as the pummelling continues — and reflect on the credibility of the chief pummeller and his party, especially with regards to the intersection of politics and the law.

Recent Conservative history isn’t reassuring on this front. Though he spent time as Speaker of the House of Commons, Scheer was a member of the Stephen Harper government that waged a decade-long battle to bend Canada’s judiciary to the will of a Charter-averse, tough-on-crime Conservative party. The sins of the mentor aren’t his to bear, but Scheer does have to square his accusations about Liberals’ contempt for law with his own party’s record.

(Andrew) Scheer does have to square his accusations about Liberals’ contempt for law with his own party’s record.

And respect for the rule of law — its letter, its spirit, its institutions — was not a strong suit of Harper’s decade-long run as prime minister. He and his lock-step justice ministers oversaw numerous attempts to craft legislation with provisions that clearly violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

To Harper and his allies, it was a brave bid to reassert the dominance of Parliament over what they viewed as an excessively Charter-driven, Liberal-moulded justice system. To critics, it was a Conservative war on the rule of law and core Canadian values.

Remember the name Edgar Schmidt? He was the federal lawyer who took the Harper government to court because the alarms he and his fellow legal experts kept ringing — that planned Conservative legislation on sentencing, prostitution, fighting terrorism and more often failed basic Charter tests — were simply ignored.

There was, under Harper, an unprecedented partisan effort to transform the process for appointing judges — at all levels — to ensure that as many like-minded jurists as possible presided over Canada’s courts.

Remember the name Marc Nadon? He was Harper’s tough-on-crime appointee to a Quebec slot on the Supreme Court in 2013. But Nadon was not truly the senior Quebec jurist required for the appointment in question, as stipulated in the Constitution, as confirmed by the Supreme Court.

Beverley McLachlin, the now-retired chief justice of Canada, had the temerity to try to warn Harper (in line with her responsibilities) that the Nadon appointment was potentially out of order. Harper issued an unprecedented statement accusing the unimpeachable McLachlin of “inappropriate” behaviour — and was roundly condemned by the Canadian legal community for what appeared to be a deliberate attempt to undermine the independence and integrity of the country’s judiciary.

Harper biographer John Ibbitson described the incident as the “nadir” of the former Conservative prime minister’s decade in office: “Not only did he lose the fight; he tarnished his reputation and damaged what should be the sacrosanct separation of powers between executive and judiciary.”

In 2014, when he was Speaker, Scheer was interviewed about the forthcoming 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta and recalled that he’d been gifted a framed copy of the landmark English legal charter when he graduated from high school. It was a great reminder, he observed, of the deep roots of “the separation of powers from the executive to the judiciary.”

We’ve all heard Scheer’s vociferous defence of the rule of law in the context of alleged Liberal wrongdoing. As he seeks the prime ministership, he should be asked pointedly to explain his own party’s past actions and future plans on that front.

He should be asked, too, if he possesses framed copies of the Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Responding to the horrific massacre of Muslims at prayer in New Zealand, the Conservative leader issued a statement Friday afternoon expressing his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community” along with “the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil.” He added: “To the Muslim community around the world and here at home in Canada, we stand with you.”

It was spot on: straightforward, fitting and right. It was also about 15 hours too late, coming as it did only after Scheer had come under intense criticism for the inadequacy of his first response, which spoke vaguely of an attack on “freedom” and unspecified “worshippers.” The appositeness of the second only highlighted the strange, withholding coldness of the first.

Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear. 1/2 — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) March 15, 2019

We cannot know exactly what explains that initial, catastrophic choice of words. But neither is Scheer automatically entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Politicians are in the business of being politic, of saying the right thing at the right time, and nothing goes out over their name without a great deal of thought, not to say calculation.

Other party leaders managed to name the victims — Muslims — and the beliefs — white supremacism, Islamophobia, the familiar, toxic mix of racism, xenophobia and hatred that so often finds Muslims as its target — involved in what was self-evidently an act of terrorism. Why on earth couldn’t Scheer?

The suspicion that this was no accident is not unreasonable, given Scheer’s past statements and actions. Perhaps he truly did not hear the questioner at a recent town hall who invoked “pizzagate,” the lunatic conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was connected to a child sex ring supposedly operating out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria.

But nothing required him to speak at last month’s “United We Roll” rally on Parliament Hill, whose stated purpose — to protest federal environmental policies on behalf of unemployed workers in the oil industry — may have been legitimate, but which had clearly been infiltrated by anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant elements. At the very least, he might have taken the opportunity of his appearance to denounce these views. He did not.

Just as disturbing was Scheer’s recent endorsement of conspiracy-minded interpretations of a United Nations document called the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, an unenforceable statement of good intentions with regard to the handling of immigrants and refugees to which most of the world’s nations agreed last year.

This, on top of his party’s unceasing alarmism on the subject of the asylum seekers entering Canada illegally via our southern border — a legitimate issue, to be sure, and one on which the government may deserve criticism, but nothing like the existential “crisis” of so much Conservative rhetoric.

And before that there was the hysteria over M-103, a non-binding motion — not a bill — condemning Islamophobia that was somehow elevated, via the panic mills of the populist right, into an assault on freedom of speech worthy of a police state. The motion passed two years ago. Not one person has since been carted off for criticizing Islam or faced sanctions of any kind because of M-103.

And before that there was the gratuitous ban on face-coverings at citizenship ceremonies. And the “barbaric practices” snitch line. The federal Conservatives are not by any means the only party to pander to racial and religious intolerance — Dalton McGuinty’s Liberals won an election in Ontario in 2007 on a coded anti-Muslim fear campaign, while the government of Quebec’s baiting of the province’s religious minorities enjoys near all-party support — but they are surely the most consistent. Or were, until Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party came along.

And it seems to be growing worse: as xenophobic and anti-Muslim rhetoric is normalized by repetition on social media and other online sites — most notoriously The Rebel — so a certain section of the public has been radicalized, persuaded that only “globalists” and other elites could oppose such disgraceful sentiments. Exploiting public fears of immigrants and minorities has a long and dishonourable tradition in this country. But exactly what kind of voter did Scheer worry would be put off by explicitly naming the sole victims and declared targets of a mass murderer?

That all of this is happening in the wake of the 2017 murders at a Quebec City mosque — the New Zealand attacker cited it as a model — makes this winking indulgence of the worst elements of the populist right particularly reprehensible.

Obviously neither Scheer nor The Rebel is responsible, in themselves, for the actions of terrorists. But they can be held to account for their part in creating the climate of opinion in which extremists flourish and madmen find inspiration. After Christchurch, after Quebec City, after Brevik and other atrocities, this is hardly a theoretical concern.

None of this is to justify further limits on free speech: we lack the kind of certainty about cause and effect that would even begin to make a case for legal restrictions, and we know from long experience how such laws can be abused. But all of us are morally responsible for the things we say, or do not say. Each of us is part of a moral order it is our duty to sustain — political leaders most of all.

This isn’t about censorship, or political correctness. It’s about judgment, and choices.

He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

Imagine you’re a politician.

Even better, you’re the leader of a political party. The leader of the main opposition party, even. And yet, most Canadians wouldn’t know you if they tripped over you in the tool aisle of the local Canadian Tire.

What to do?

Especially when the Prime Minister—your target—is blessed with a famous name and the considerable advantages of incumbency. How do you shift his spotlight your way?

Short of lighting yourself on fire or dancing nude in the streets—or doing both together, I suppose—there isn’t much any opposition leader can do to up their profile in between election cycles. No, the life of an opposition leader is an endless cycle of low-impact rubber chicken dinners, bingo hall grip and grins, and sessions spent asking the Prime Minister questions he never ever answers.

So Andrew Scheer should count himself blessed that Justin Trudeau has lit himself on fire—an exquisitely engineered fire—over SNC-Lavalin. After all, it’s not every day a sitting Prime Minister cripples himself to the point where even Jagmeet Singh risks becoming competitive.

With Canadians now tuning into politics en masse, SNC is the chance for Scheer to demonstrate he has the royal jelly. When Mike Duffy started giving Stephen Harper nightmares, it was Thomas Mulcair who checked into the public’s imagination, keeping the issue alive with his prosecutorial performances in the House of Commons. And while Mulcair didn’t end up taking the big prize, he did put an afterthought party into pole position by the start of the election.

That is the size of the opportunity now before Scheer.

But if Canadians are impressed by what they’ve seen from Scheer personally in response to SNC, they’re doing a pretty good job of hiding it. While Conservative support has now surpassed that of Trudeau’s Liberals, Scheer’s personal numbers remain below Trudeau’s.

The differential in polling outcomes likely exists because people identify Trudeau much more strongly with his party than Scheer with his, and because the SNC debacle has, to date, been driven more by Trudeau’s missteps than Scheer’s interventions.

To wit, Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation (checks calendar) 12 days ago and Trudeau is (checks pm.gc.ca) still Prime Minister. Canadians will have noticed the misfire.

To be fair, several pundits matched Scheer’s premature call for Trudeau’s ouster, including some not overtly hostile to the Prime Minister, such was the shock of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony at the justice committee. But it’s one thing to get excited to sell papers; it’s another to lose your head in the rush for the head of the country’s government to lose theirs.

The call for Trudeau to go, absent all sides of the story being aired, will have smacked many as opportunism, something for the benefit of Scheer’s party, not his country. Yes, what Wilson-Raybould disclosed was deadly serious, but it wasn’t close to the full story. That Trudeau was—and remains—unwilling to offer a serious response to Wilson-Raybould, or let her speak about the circumstances surrounding her resignation, is the story. Trudeau is hiding something about his intrusion into the justice system.

Looked at through a more practical lens: when Trudeau goes is not even Scheer’s call to make in a majority Parliament. Absent a revolt from the Liberal caucus, or perhaps some criminal charges, Trudeau will be Prime Minister come this fall’s federal election. And while Trudeau’s head would be a helluva trophy, it might be better for a severely tainted Trudeau to lead his troops into that fight. Scheer should focus on inflicting a thousand cuts, not trying to land the killer blow.

What the SNC situation now calls for is a calm and systematic destruction of Trudeau’s arguments, such as he’s made them. The people who don’t follow politics need to see a robust defence of Canada’s institutions and constitutional conventions, along with clear reminders of what will be lost should Trudeau be allowed to skate away from the mess he’s made. Thankfully, the federal court and the OECD are already helping on these fronts; there is no need for Conservatives to over-egg the pudding.

And to Scheer’s credit, he’s showing signs of a recalibration. The Tories now appear ready to savour Trudeau’s pain like a fine wine, not like a beer in a frat house.

A sober and serious opinion piece under Scheer’s name has now appeared in the Toronto Sun, outlining how Trudeau’s deeds belie his words on SNC. The Conservative HQ Twitter feed is also smartly ramping up calls for Trudeau to allow Wilson-Raybould to testify to her resignation from Cabinet (something Wilson-Raybould herself has called for), pushing on an open door for women who now have serious questions about Trudeau’s feminist bonafides. The trick will be to keep up the tone.

With the Liberals now desperate to push the conversation to “pizzagate” and other elements of Michael Wernick’s vaunted social media “vomitorium,” the entire Conservative caucus needs to act like a government in waiting. No matter how good or clever that gut punch on Twitter might feel, the Tories should now heed to their better angels. Let Maxime Bernier’s crowd bray for blood; the SNC earthquake has opened up a deep seam of middle-of-the-road voters. Now it’s time to mine.

With the Prime Minister’s jobs claims now in dispute, the legal arguments for offering a DPA in tatters, and his strategy now to stay quiet and suppress all further testimony from either Wilson-Raybould or his staff, Trudeau has painted himself into an ugly corner. Scheer must satisfy himself with keeping Trudeau in that corner and hemming him in even further, not pushing for an outcome he can’t deliver.

In short, Canadians need to look at Scheer and see a Prime Minister in waiting. Someone with their interests at heart, and not his own, even if the two intersect.

In the wake of the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, what has to be stated loudly and clearly is that Islamophobia has become the last acceptable prejudice in allegedly polite society. And that those who may even reject racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia often still hold on to anti-Muslim views.

In Canada, this is even more evident on the political right, where on social media the reaction of some people to the slaughter of 50 Muslim worshippers (children among them and 40 more in hospital with gunshot wounds) was to blame Muslims for the violence and declare the notion that Islamophobia even exists as an attack on free speech.

There were also those that refused to ask the right questions about why this all happened in the first place. The Christchurch killer was at least in part motivated by the politics of Trump, much like Quebec City mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette. Both were consumed by right-wing groups online and Muslim immigration.

Then there were the responses from our political leaders. The Prime Minister’s was swift, referring directly to the context of the attack as part of a growing problem of white nationalist inspired terrorism. Not so Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who issued a banal tweet, declaring the Christchurch rampage was an attack on “freedom” rather than Muslim worshippers.

It took several hours of outrage and criticism – some privately from other Conservative MPs – for Scheer to issue a second statement the next day on Facebook, one that dared to refer specifically to what had happened and to acknowledge that Muslims had been murdered because of their faith. That was followed by a visit to a mosque in Regina in what looked like a hastily scheduled photo opportunity.

Many of Scheer’s defenders rushed to justify his characterization of the attack, claiming that his critics were too harsh, and that while their leader may not have been specific in his language there was really nothing that should be read into this. That, however, is terribly misleading and disingenuous or even dishonest.

Scheer is not a stupid man, and is fully capable of properly expressing himself. He also knows that a great number of his supporters have at best an ambivalent attitude towards Muslims and often view Islam as a downright threat to what they like to describe as Judeo-Christian values.

Scheer and his senior advisors, such as former Rebel Media executive Hamish Marshall, who will head the Conservative party's 2019 campaign, certainly understand this and don't want to alienate those in their base.

Those among Scheer's supporters in media who condemned the atrocity, argued that far worse things are done to Christians by Muslims in Africa and the Middle East on a regular basis. It’s a classic digression technique.

As someone who has written and broadcast for 20 years about the persecution of Christians by Muslim extremists I know the reality of all this, but it should not be allowed in any way to obscure the horror and danger of the rampant Islamophobia that exists in Western society.

If Scheer tried to be relatively subtle in his response, People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier went further, at first saying nothing at all about Christchurch.

When journalist Stephen Maher quite rightly noted his silence, Bernier responded bizarrely via Twitter. “Some journalists have no decency. Did this one harass me or anybody else when dozens of Christians were massacred in Nigeria and the Philippines weeks ago? Why not? As a rule I don’t comment on these horrible tragedies in other countries. Period.”

Bernier may now be a fringe player in charge of a ragtag party of extremists, but it should be remembered that he was widely viewed at one time as the likely successor to Stephen Harper, and the man who was assumed to be the next leader of the Conservative Party before he lost the leadership race to Scheer on the 13th ballot, with more than 49 per cent of the vote.

He was eventually kicked out of the party and is still viewed as a threat to Scheer's political fortunes. But if Scheer has an Islamophobia problem in his party, Bernier is virtually dependent on the damned thing.

As well as being unethical and irresponsible, the reactions of both Scheer and Bernier are profoundly dangerous. Silence or ambiguity about evil emboldens those who are likely to commit grievous acts and blurs an issue that should be black and white.

Scheer did eventually say the right thing, but his reluctance to do so is what speaks the loudest. As for Bernier, his pandering to bigotry positively roars.

Article ...,"MONTREAL—With only months to go to the federal campaign Justin Trudeau’s re-election hangs on an increasingly frayed Quebec thread. The prime minister’s home province has long been front and centre in his electoral calculations. Absent gains in Quebec to make up for predictable losses in Alberta and Atlantic Canada next fall, the Liberals can almost certainly kiss hopes for a second majority goodbye. And were Trudeau to fail to hold his ground in the province all would likely be lost for his party.

( Jacques Boissinot / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Until the SNC-Lavalin affair, the possibility of Liberal losses in Quebec next fall looked remote. The party enjoyed a double-digit lead on the competition. But over the past month the crisis over the federal government’s handling of the engineering giant’s judicial file has taken a toll. Léger Marketing’s most recent poll — published at mid-week — showed a significant narrowing of the gap between the leading Liberals and the second-place Conservatives. Their lead has shrunk from 18 points in early February to just nine points this month. Andrew Scheer’s Conservative party has been the main beneficiary of the Liberal drop — a sign that further confirms the damage to Trudeau’s brand.

Article Continued Below

When voters start to seriously question a prime minister’s competence, they tend to turn to the most likely alternative on offer and, at this juncture, no one sees an NDP government in-the-making in the poll numbers. There is more support for the prime minister’s SNC-Lavalin narrative in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada but as in the rest of the country, an overwhelming majority feel Trudeau has not been up to the challenge of managing the crisis. That being said, the Conservatives would be prudent not to count their Quebec eggs before they hatch. Their path to doing well in Quebec in the election is strewn with major obstacles. On SNC-Lavalin, they are treading on slippery ground. None of their key arguments is winning the day in public opinion. One in two Quebecers disagrees with Scheer’s contention that Trudeau should resign. Twenty-nine per cent agree. That’s almost the same proportion that would have voted for the Conservatives in an election held this month. There is not much juice to be had from continuing to squeeze the resignation lemon.

Fifty-nine per cent believe the engineering firm should be offered a remediation agreement rather than be exposed to the risk of a criminal conviction and a 10-year ban on bidding on federal contracts. And a majority feels that Quebec-bashing is in play in the heated rhetoric that has attended the affair outside the province.

Article Continued Below

The SNC-Lavalin matter also finds the Conservatives at odds with Quebec’s political class. Coalition Avenir Québec Premier François Legault is the leading champion of the notion that SNC-Lavalin should be offered a negotiated plea. The developments of the past month have not altered his determination to ensure the firm maintains its head office in Montreal. A decade and a half ago the sponsorship scandal almost killed the federal Liberal brand in Quebec. By comparison, the impact of the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair on the ruling party could be ephemeral. Chances are the showdown between the prime minister and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will not have a lot of traction in Quebec in next fall’s election or at least a lot less than the issue that is shaping up to turn into the real ballot box question. On Friday, tens of thousands of young Quebecers took to the streets to ask for more action on climate change. This is not a movement akin to the 2012 so-called maple spring that paralyzed the province’s campuses for months on end. The protests are not about any specific government or party policy…yet. But it would not take much to transform this youth movement into a larger populist one. Legault for one is scrambling to avoid becoming the target of such a movement. He has already traded the rookie he had initially appointed as his environment minister for a more politically savvy one. The environment will be a main theme at the first post-victory CAQ convention later this spring. Scheer, on the other hand, has promised that the first act in office of a Conservative government would be to revoke the Liberal carbon-pricing policy. He is touting himself as a pipeline champion. He has yet to confirm that he would — as prime minister — honour Canada’s signature on the Paris accord on climate change. All of the above will be a hard sell in the province whose voters — according to polls — are the most likely to rank the environment as a top priority. In next fall’s election, Scheer may have a harder time getting a pass from Quebecers for the Conservative missing-in-action approach to climate change than Trudeau for his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair Chantal Hébert is a columnist based in Ottawa covering politics.

""We stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters to ensure that they remain this way. We must condemn, in the strongest terms possible, the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil.""

Scheer ended his statement with a message for Muslim communities in Canada and internationally. The Conservative party is committed ""to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together,"" he said.

Other Tories quicker to denounce violence toward Muslims

Attacks on freedom is political rhetoric that has been embraced by fringe conservative groups to amplify anti-globalist and anti-immigrant messages. In Canada, these viewpoints have been notably represented by Yellow Vests Canada, a spinoff group inspired from the French anti-government movement.

Yellow Vests Canada members have spread messages advocating violence against politicians and hatred toward Muslims. The group was associated with last month's United We Roll convoy, which culminated with a rally on Parliament Hill. Scheer and People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier were invited speakers who addressed the crown on the main stage.

White nationalist Faith Goldy was also at the rally, but did not address the crowd from the main stage. She briefly gave some remarks from a scissor lift which served as an impromptu stage set on a flatbed truck parked on the street.

Some of the Scheer's federal conservative peers, such as Ontario Premier Doug Ford and former federal leadership candidates Michael Chong and Lisa Raitt, chose more explicit language off the bat.

'Muslims suffer unimaginable loss and pain' in places of worship: PM

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement Friday condemning the terrorist attack on two Christchurch mosques.

The gunman, whose identity has yet to be confirmed by police, reportedly had Quebec mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette's name written on a magazine clip, suggesting inspiration from the Canadian tragedy that killed six people and left 19 injured.

""Far too often, Muslims suffer unimaginable loss and pain in the places where they should feel safest,"" Trudeau said. ""Canada remembers too well the sorrow we felt when a senseless attack on the Centre culturel islamique de Québec in Ste-Foy claimed the lives of many innocent people gathered in prayer.""

Trudeau continued to state how Canada will continue to work with New Zealand to ""take action against violent extremism.""

""Hate has no place anywhere,"" he said. ""We must all confront Islamophobia and work to create a world in which all people—no matter their faith, where they live, or where they were born—can feel safe and secure.""

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is slated to deliver his budget speech at 4 p.m. in the House of Commons, but Scheer repeatedly sidestepped questions about what, if anything, the Opposition could or would do to delay the presentation.

Scheer called the government's budget ""a political prop"" in its ""unprecedented cover-up"" of the affair that has rocked the Liberal cabinet and prompted Trudeau's top adviser and the country's most senior public servant to resign.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs unsuccessfully pressed the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday to recall former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould so she could shed more light on the simmering controversy.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin finds itself at the centre of a national political storm over allegations prime ministerial aides crossed a line in leaning on Wilson-Raybould to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs say Canadians need to hear more about the affair.

""What happened today is absolutely outrageous,"" said Conservative committee member Michael Cooper.

""If there was ever evidence needed that Liberal MPs on the justice committee are agents of the prime minister, doing the work of the prime minister to cover-up the prime minister's misdeeds, then one need only look at what happened at this meeting today where the Liberals have shut down the process.""

Liberals on the justice committee wrote to the chairman, fellow Liberal Anthony Housefather, this week to say the committee had done its job and should move on to other business.

""As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings,"" says the letter. ""Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all rules and laws were followed. Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.""

Liberal committee member Randy Boissonault reiterated the contents of the letter following the meeting, saying Tuesday's session was the 10th in five weeks, amounting to 13 hours of testimony given by 10 witnesses.

""We have heard from many of the key players in this matter,"" he said.

The Liberal members tabled a motion Tuesday calling for the committee to begin a study of the rise of hate crimes in Canada.

They say the federal ethics commissioner, who has launched a probe of the SNC-Lavalin matter, is best suited to investigate the political controversy.

They also note former justice minister Anne McLellan has been appointed to explore the relationship between the government and the minister of justice, who plays a second role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

But the opposition would have none of it.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said the committee should hold town-hall meetings on SNC-Lavalin and hear from Canadians about the affair.

Wilson-Raybould has a right to reply to other witnesses including Gerald Butts, the former top adviser to Trudeau, Raitt said in objecting to the Liberal effort to move on.

""They're controlling what is being said, they're controlling who is being heard from, they're controlling whether or not we study a topic. This is really egregious and absolutely shameful.""

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin called it ""yet another effort to change the channel"" by the government.

SNC-Lavalin faces legal trouble over allegations it paid millions of dollars in bribes to obtain government business in Libya. The company unsuccessfully pressed the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a ""remediation agreement,"" a legal means of holding an organization to account for wrongdoing without a formal finding of guilt.

The director told SNC-Lavalin in October that negotiating a remediation agreement would be inappropriate in this particular case.

Wilson-Raybould has told the justice committee she was relentlessly pressured to ensure the Montreal engineering giant was invited to negotiate an agreement. She was shuffled from the justice portfolio in January, becoming veterans affairs minister.

Trudeau has denied that any undue pressure was placed on Wilson-Raybould.

She has testified at the justice committee for nearly four hours, but has indicated there is more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Butts, once considered Trudeau's right-hand man, quit his job as principal secretary, saying he did not want to be a distraction from the government's agenda. In addition, Jane Philpott left cabinet over the government's handling of the controversy.

The SNC-Lavalin affair claimed its fourth resignation Monday as Michael Wernick announced he will step down as the country's top public servant, having concluded he's lost the trust of opposition parties.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

The SNC-Lavalin controversy has exposed a crisis of moral and ethical leadership in Trudeau’s office, Scheer said at a news conference in Ottawa, adding an online campaign is underway to support Wilson-Raybould.

“Justin Trudeau must let her speak,” he said.

MPs are to hold an emergency session of the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday and Wilson-Raybould has previously said she would be willing to return to provide additional testimony.

Scheer said Liberal MPs on the committee need to support Wilson-Raybould coming back to shed additional light on the scandal, suggesting if they do not, it would suggest the prime minister “has something to hide.”

“Previously, it was only after intense pressure that Liberal MPs on the justice committee allowed this investigation to start, and only after intense pressure from Canadians did Justin Trudeau even partially allow Ms. Wilson-Raybould to speak,” Scheer said.

“We’re hoping that this campaign will have the same effect — that the pressure will force Justin Trudeau to allow her to come and testify.”

Wilson-Raybould previously told the justice committee she was subjected to relentless, inappropriate pressure to stop the trial of the engineering giant on bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya.

Trudeau partly waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality so Wilson-Raybould could speak publicly, but not about communication with Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions.

Last week, Trudeau’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts testified that he believed no one from the Prime Minister’s Office had done anything wrong.

Butts also said that Wilson-Raybould never complained about improper pressure to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin until Trudeau decided to move her out of her cabinet role as justice minister.

Scheer said Sunday it is clear the “real Justin Trudeau” is being exposed to Canadians, adding that the prime minister is not displaying good leadership.

On Saturday, a spokesman for the Prime Minister’s Office acknowledged Trudeau had “emotional” conversations with Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes, but denied her claims the encounters were “hostile” or that Trudeau yelled at her.

Caesar-Chavannes told the Globe and Mail in an interview that Trudeau was angry when she told him on Feb. 12 of her plans to announce she was not running in the October federal election.

She alleges he yelled at her in that conversation and she responded by shouting back at him, however she added the prime minister later apologized.

Caesar-Chavannes also detailed another encounter with Trudeau in the House of Commons a week later, in which she describes him as acting hostile toward her.

The various allegations make it clear the “false presentation” that Trudeau has presented to Canadians is “falling apart,” Scheer said.

My concern is not that the Conservatives wish to return tax money to taxpayers hands, my concern is with how they intend to do it. Scheer says ...","It seems the Conservatives in Canada got their heads together and made several significant policy announcements – significant not in the sense that, when isolated, these policy changes will affect anyone much, but significant because of the signal they send as to which direction Conservatives want to take Canada. The Manitoba Pallister government announced that it will be reducing the PST by 1% and it will not charge PST of the Federal Carbon tax. Andrew Scheer announced that a federal Conservative government will return the GST collected on home heating.

My concern is not that the Conservatives wish to return tax money to taxpayers hands, my concern is with how they intend to do it. Scheer says “Heating your home in winter isn’t a luxury for Canadians. It is a necessity. We don’t tax other basic necessities like groceries and we shouldn’t be taxing home heating.” Of course Scheer is correct when he says heating our homes in the Canadian winter is not a luxury, but it does not follow that the appropriate response is to reimburse Canadians for the cost of heating.

We all know that there are many ways of lowering our energy bill. We can lower the thermostat and wear a sweater, we can add insulation to the house, we can choose to live in a smaller house, we can choose to share living space in some way, we can install a high efficiency furnace, we can heat with a renewable energy source – and our government can give us a rebate on the energy we buy. The difference between the first options listed and the government rebate is that the first options actually result in greater energy efficiency, the result is real savings, whereas the latter, the government rebate, simply transfers money from the government pocket to the homeowner pocket. The government rebate does not result in a real saving.

But it is worse than that. The proposed rebate on the tax paid on heating expense is really a counter incentive.

To the family looking for help purchasing basic human needs such as groceries and home heating, it does not matter whether the extra $100 or $200 comes as a rebate on heating costs or as a reduction on income tax.

The reduction in income tax is not likely to create any incentive to modify behaviour. In terms of behavioural change, so a reduction in income tax is a neutral. It will put more money into the hands of the ordinary person, but that rebate money is unlikely to change his behaviour. However high heating costs will encourage a change in behaviour. Families facing high heating costs will look for ways of reducing their energy consumption. This is a good thing.

Furthermore, the heating tax rebate will, in effect, penalize those who have already done the right thing and reduced their heating cost. A homeowner who has expended the capital cost and built a net zero house, a house where all heat energy is generated from solar, will get no government rebate becasue he has bought no fuel.

Granted, $100 or $200 per year is not enough money to produce much of an incentive. A true incentive would need to be more substantial. This is why we have, in previous columns, criticized the Liberal Carbon Tax as being too timid. But this recent announcement from Mr. Scheer seems to be indicating which direction the Conservatives are moving.

While criticizing the Liberal Carbon Tax, Mr. Scheer has been unwilling to tell Canadians how Conservatives will deal with carbon emissions. If this recent announcement is an indication of what to expect from the Federal Conservatives, we and our children are in big trouble indeed. Nature does not negotiate.

At the age of 26, in 2005, Rannells made his Broadway debut in the chorus of Hairspray. “Even though it’s not the thing that people know me from,” the actor said, the minor theatrical role was “a huge moment” in his life that has shaped the rest of his acting career.

“My dream was to be on Broadway,” Rannells said in an interview Tuesday on BuzzFeed News’ Twitter morning show AM to DM. “I just wanted to be in a Broadway show. I never got more specific, like, I want to be the lead or I want to open a show. I just wanted to be on Broadway.”

“[Landing the Hairspray role] kept me sort of on the right path and kept me focused,” Rannells said. “Of course, then when you achieve a dream you swap it out with a new one…but I didn’t want to minimize the fact that was also a big deal and sometimes those wins don’t always take the shape that you think they’re going to.”



“It’s not always like holding an Oscar in your hand,” Rannells said, speaking about how he achieved his goal of performing on Broadway. “Sometimes it’s something that’s a little smaller and a little more contained and personal.”

In a recent New York Times essay, the actor revealed that his then-boyfriend dumped him out of jealousy that Rannells landed the role and not him.

Rather than a political memoir, it’s being billed as a story about “how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.” The title alludes to Singh’s oft-invoked call for “love and courage,” which he deployed in a viral response to a heckler at a 2017 NDP leadership campaign event. After taking the reins of the federal party, Singh earned a seat in the House of Commons in a byelection last month.

His sights are now set on the post of prime minister as Canadians prepare to vote in this fall’s federal election. “This book is the story of my family and my personal experiences growing up — sometimes difficult ones. I often felt alone, unworthy, ashamed,” Singh said in a statement. “I hope this book helps some people feel less alone and know that they deserve love and happiness, no matter what they’ve gone through.” Love & Courage is set to hit bookstores on April 23.

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection -- made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart -- ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

He did so in the face of withering critiques, notably from former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as to his prospects and abilities, as well as a dominant narrative that suggested the Liberal Party of Canada was quickly usurping the NDP as Canada’s leading progressive voice. We are better as a country with Jagmeet Singh in Parliament.

Now the bad news. Though he is now leader of a political party with significant representation in Quebec, Singh soon wouldn’t be allowed to guard prisoners, police the streets, serve as a judge — or even teach schoolchildren in the province. That’s because the provincial government plans on banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain civil servants, teachers included, in the name of secularism.

And were Singh to show up at the National Assembly to protest the forthcoming legislation, he wouldn’t be allowed in. Unlike Canadian Parliament, the National Assembly still considers the kirpan, the ceremonial dagger worn by many practising Sikh men, to be a dangerous weapon. He wouldn’t make it past the X-ray machines.

I bring all of this up not to relive the long and often tiresome debate about the place and space allowed religious minorities in Quebec, but rather to illustrate the uniquely challenging political context Singh now finds himself in the very province that helped launch the NDP’s rebirth eight years ago.

In a few months’ time, Singh will be tasked with campaigning in a province that overwhelmingly supports the above-mentioned legislation. It has the potential to be a jarring spectacle. Policy-wise, the NDP under Singh, an unabashedly progressive counterpoint to Thomas Mulcair’s Liberalesque leadership, is the stuff of dreams to the province’s centre-left electorate. Yet it is tough not to see the party’s sudden and inherent disadvantage: its leader happens to be a brown guy in a turban.

Quebec’s political class is obsessed with identity issues like immigration, which took up an outsized proportion of the oxygen during the last provincial election, according to Influence Communication, a Quebec-based media analysis firm. For this you can at once point to history (francophone Quebecers’ collective and existential worry about the survival of their language and culture) and blame politicians for exploiting this worry for political gain.

This tinder is regularly turned to flame by way of certain columnists — almost all of whom are from the Journal de Montréal — who tend to portray Quebec’s religious minorities as an invading horde bent on undermining Quebec’s proudly secular society.

The end result is a zealous rejection of conspicuous religiosity. Consider how some 61 per cent of Quebecers, far and away the largest percentage of respondents in the country, say the wearing of the turban or other religious symbol by teachers is “unacceptable,” according to a national Léger Marketing poll published last December. Never mind that at least three teachers’ unions have said the government’s proposed ban is patently unworkable. The decade-long politicization of the issue has ensured gut feeling, not cold logic, rules the day.

Singh is about to step into this politically perilous breach, his religion conspicuously displayed. To be fair, he has a lot going for him. He’s good on TV and great on the stage — a necessity in the Trudeau age of campaigning. Most important, his French is excellent. And on the island of Montreal, at least, he has a multicultural beachhead where his appearance is an advantage, or at least less of a disadvantage.

But beyond our fair city? I worry we aren’t yet ready for a leader like Jagmeet Singh. I can only hope I’m proven wrong.

Check out Jagmeet’s first question and what Canadians are saying about this exciting and historic day!

Jagmeet Singh was sworn in to the House of Commons as Burnaby South’s newest MP on Sunday, March 17! Surrounded by family, friends, and our NDP Team, Jagmeet became the first racialized leader of a Canadian political party to be sworn in to the House.

People across the country watched as Jagmeet took his seat in the House and aksed his first question on Monday, March 18. He talked about the people he’s met who are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of housing – worried about how they’ll be able to make rent, pay their mortgage, or whether their kids and grandkids will ever be able to own a home.

He pressed Trudeau on refusing to address the housing crisis – and asked him to commit to half a million new units of affordable housing.

Jagmeet is in the House to fight for us. While Trudeau’s Liberal government keeps siding with their rich friends, Jagmeet and our NDP team are pushing for the solutions everyday people need now.

People across the country supported Jagmeet online, using #JagmeetintheHouse to share their excitement and hopes for the future. Here’s what people had to say:

Singh is the first racialized leader in the Commons in Canadian history.

ANALYSIS: Near-record ‘incumbency disadvantage’ is yet another headache for Jagmeet Singh’s NDP

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn’t able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

Singh won his new Burnaby South seat in a February byelection sparked by the departure of former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who ran for mayor of Vancouver.

New Democrats are hoping Singh’s presence in the House of Commons will help the party turn the page on a difficult period, marked by challenges with morale and fundraising.

This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto.

Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation.

But he may have to wait a few more months – until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign – for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

The NDP leader’s belated entry in the Commons comes at a time when the current Parliament is on its last legs - with its most productive days behind it.

Tuesday’s budget – the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office – marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future.

In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda.

One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more.

But the SNC-Lavalin affair – and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction – has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic.

As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue.

Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring.

So might Singh.

The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives.

It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage.

Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000.

On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals.

Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner.

Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago.

Like Clark, who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs, the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.

In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of New Democrat MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at nine per cent, two points ahead of the NDP.

The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall.

As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

On March 17, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was officially sworn in as the MP for Burnaby South. The election of the first racialized federal party leader to Parliament is of great historic significance.

Wanting to do my part, I travelled to BC to campaign for Singh. I wanted to make a positive contribution to the effort in light of the gloomy press coverage (some predicting Singh’s demise) that was hanging over the campaign like a dark cloud.

I was eager to know what people on the ground were thinking and feeling about the by-election. It quickly became apparent that young people engineering Singh’s operation were enthusiastic, dedicated and curious.

There were also some of the more seasoned organizers. One who flew in from Brampton proudly told me that he just got accepted into law school at the University of Ottawa, my alma mater. I asked how it felt. He said it paled in comparison to the idea of Singh winning the riding. People were nervous as they confronted the weight of history.

This was no casual by-election. The media, taking the attitude of “do or die,” reminded us of that every day. This was an election that would either usher in a new era in Canadian politics or turn back the clock for under-represented communities.

So when the polls closed and the results finally poured in, the scene was electric at the Hilton Vancouver Hotel. We did it. The moment to shift the national discourse into an unapologetically progressive direction is here.

There is a real opportunity for an NDP breakthrough in this volatile political climate, but it must articulate a bold and truly transformative agenda on climate change, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, electoral reform, criminal justice reform, pharmacare and the housing crisis. The plight of working-class people across this country demands aggressive no-nonsense representation.

In Burnaby, Singh was able to appeal to a multiracial working class constituency with a left-populist campaign that focused on the fundamental unfairness of the economy and issues of housing affordability. Throughout his political career, he has demonstrated an ability to appeal to marginalized communities that represent a growing share of the electorate.

Many activists on Singh’s campaign were inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing women of colour recently elected to congress in the U.S. who are challenging conventional wisdom and calling for a Green New Deal, free tuition, medicare for all and immigration reform.

There are lessons to be learned here from this new group of political leaders south of the border. It’s time for a new generation of progressive activists in this country, ones who boldly stand for social and economic justice and reflect the diversity of modern Canada, to step forward.

He is the first leader of a major political party in Canada’s parliament who is not white, a distinction that Singh acknowledged after question period as something he never could have imagined when he was growing up.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is introduced by NDP MP Peter Julian and Ruth Ellen Brosseau as he takes his place in the House of Commons on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

“It’s an incredible honour. I’m humbled. I’m blown away by the immensity of the role I’ve been granted,” said Singh, a former criminal lawyer who was born in Scarborough and is the son of immigrants from India. “If I could have in some way broken down barriers for people, I would have done something good with my life,” he said. Singh’s debut in the Commons is a result of his Feb. 25 byelection victory in Burnaby South, the British Columbia riding he moved to last year in a bid to win his first federal seat. He used the occasion to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the government’s affordable housing plan, demanded the Liberals increase carbon price charges on heavy polluters, and repeat his party’s call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

For Singh, the moment comes at a challenging time for the party he leads. Fundraising has sunk from $18 million in 2015 to around $5 million last year, while the party has taken out a $12 million mortgage on its national headquarters, the Jack Layton Building. Meanwhile, about a quarter of the party’s caucus has resigned their seats or announced they won’t run in the general election this fall, including veterans like B.C. MPs Nathan Cullen and Murray Rankin, Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Ontario stalwarts David Christopherson and Irene Mathyssen.

Singh himself has received negative attention for communications stumbles, including occasions when he seemed unaware of his own party’s position on issues like the Liberal government gun legislation and the question of whether Canada was right to recognize Venezuela’s opposition leader as the country’s legitimate president. In the months leading up to his byelection run, as Singh toured the country in a series of “JagMeet and Greet” events, many NDP insiders argued he needed a seat in the Commons to change the narrative that had settled in over the first year of his leadership. On Monday, Singh finally appeared in the House, tapping the breast of his suit and waving to his family as he was escorted to take his seat at the head of the NDP benches. His younger brother, Ontario MPP Gurratan Singh, said afterwards that it was “an historic and momentous occasion for all Canadians.” He looked on from the public gallery with Singh’s wife and parents, and wore a yellow turban that matched his brother’s on the Commons floor below. “For people who don’t see themselves represented in politics, today was a milestone,” he said. Singh spent much of question period listening intently. During the opening exchange between Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, he pressed his earpiece against his head and took notes. Later, after he had asked his own questions, Singh got up and left for a few minutes. When he returned, he briefly walked down the wrong aisle and had to double back to get to his seat. He has seven months to learn where it is before he has to win it again. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @aballinga

Singh entered the chamber to applause from fellow New Democrats after being officially sworn in the day before.

He won a byelection in Burnaby South on Feb. 25 to replace former MP and current mayor of Vancouver Kennedy Stewart.

Singh also made history as the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Parliament.

Singh used his first speaking opportunity during question period to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on housing.

He repeated a story he told many times during the byelection campaign, saying he met a teacher forced to live in her parents’ basement due to Burnaby’s unaffordable housing market.

Singh asked Trudeau whether the Liberal government would commit to building 500,000 new homes, alluding to the NDP’s proposal to do so over the next 10 years.

Trudeau welcomed Singh to Ottawa and said he hopes New Democrats back the Liberal government’s ongoing efforts to create affordable housing.

Singh also joined many Conservative MPs in calling on Trudeau to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify in front of the justice committee for a second time to address the the SNC-Lavalin affair. He also repeated his call for the Liberals to launch a public inquiry into the case.

“For Canadians watching at home, this doesn't look any different than when the Conservatives were in power – special access for powerful corporations, a closed door for everyone else,” he said. “Why is this prime minister so afraid to launch a public inquiry?”

Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger deflected the calls from the opposition parties, saying Wilson-Raybould already had her chance to speak.

Singh also addressed the mosque shooting that killed 50 and injured dozens more in New Zealand last week. An avowed white supremacist has been charged in the massacre.

“That attack reverberated across the world. Though it happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, the pain impacted all of us,” he said. “It hurts here in Canada, where Muslim brothers and sisters – our friends, our close ones, people who work with us – are thinking about their own loved ones when they go to masjid, when they go to prayer, and how much it hurts to know that you're being targeted for being who you are.”

Singh said the attack was borne of white supremacist and Islamophobic hatred.

“Hate knows no bounds. Once hate is allowed to grow, it consumes all in its path. Hate is like a fire – once it's allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everything,” he said.

Singh joined Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer in condemning Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, but said Canada must go further by addressing the root causes of such hatred.

When people refer to migrants as “illegal” or “barbaric,” they dehumanize them, he said.

“The purpose is to dehumanize and then, once you dehumanize, it leads to fear and hatred,” he said. “Let's be conscious of the words we use so we never create any ground for hate to grow.”

Singh made the comments after Trudeau and Scheer made their own statements condemning the attack and expressing solidarity with the people of New Zealand and Muslims around the world.

Trudeau addressed the various forms of prejudice and discrimination he said lead to terrorist attacks around the world.

“It's anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, anti-black, anti-Indigenous, misogynistic, homophobic – the list goes on and on,” he said. “This rhetoric is dangerous, hateful and vile; it lives and festers online, spilling out into the real world with deadly consequences.”

Scheer expressed similar sentiments.

He said the attack in New Zealand was reminiscent of the 2017 attack on a Quebec City mosque in which a white nationalist killed six men in their place of worship.

Scheer called for unity among political parties in condemning hateful ideologies.

“I say to my colleagues in all parties, we certainly have our differences on important policy matters that deserve rigorous and spirited debate, but on this – the very compassion and humanity of our Canadian society – there can be no debate,” he said.","Jagmeet Singh presses on housing, calls out dehumanizing language in Parliamentary debut",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/news/jagmeet-singh-presses-on-housing-calls-out-dehumanizing-language-in-parliamentary-debut-1.23667389

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

Anyone who followed the 2013 B.C. election or the recently Nanaimo byelection will know that polls can be pretty unreliable.

So keep this in mind while reading the results of a Nanos Research poll posted today that has the federal NDP – led by new Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh getting a pretty big bump in support.

The latest Nanos federal ballot tracking has the Conservatives at 35.5 per cent, followed by the Liberals at 32.6 per cent, the NDP at 19.9 percent, the BQ at 3.2 per cent, the Greens at 7.7 per cent and the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) at 0.5 per cent.

The NDP for the longest time has been mired at 13 to 14 per cent, with the party also struggling to raise money.

So to have a showing at nearly 20 per cent is to be considered positive news. The CBC’s poll tracker – which aggregates all publicly available polling data – has the NDP at 15.9 per cent.

The bad news for Singh is the other number Nanos had.

Nanos tracking has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the preferred choice as PM at 30.3 per cent of Canadians followed by Scheer (27.3%), Singh (8.9%), May (7.2%) and Bernier (2.8%). Twenty-two per cent of Canadians were unsure whom they preferred.

So Singh is way down the list and has a lot of work to do. Things could get better now that he is an MP and gets to speak in the House of Commons. He needs to build his profile and fast because October is getting closer and closer.

Singh is getting huge assists from Trudeau with SNC-Lavalin and Scheer with his blunder after the New Zealand massacre.

Let’s see what he can do with these missteps.

For theNanos poll, the data is based on a dual frame (land + cell-lines) random telephone interviews using live agents of 1,000 Canadians using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week, 18 years of age and over. The random sample of 1,000 respondents may be weighted by age and gender using the latest census information for Canada. The interviews are compiled into a four week rolling average of 1,000 interviews, where each week the oldest group of 250 interviews is dropped and a new group of 250 interviews is added.

A random telephone survey of 1,000 Canadians is accurate ±3.1 percentage points, plus or minus, 19 times out of 20.","NDP surges in poll, but Jagmeet Singh's own rating stays in single digits",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/opinion/blogs/ndp-surges-in-poll-but-jagmeet-singh-s-own-rating-stays-in-single-digits-1.23668370

Sporting a bright yellow turban, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh entered the House of Commons for the first time as an MP Monday to loud cheers.

Singh is the first minority leader in the Commons in Canadian history.

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

Singh won his new Burnaby South seat in a February byelection sparked by the departure of former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who ran for mayor of Vancouver.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons will help the party turn the page on a difficult period, marked by challenges with morale and fundraising.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney ...,"OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

Calgary university cancels event by ex-Muslim, here's why As the Alberta provincial election campaign kicks off, Rachel Notley's New Democrats are in a tough spot.","© Amber Bracken/Canadian Press Jason Kenney's United Conservatives enter the Alberta election campaign with a wide lead in the polls.

As the Alberta provincial election campaign kicks off, Rachel Notley's New Democrats are in a tough spot. They trail the United Conservatives by a significant margin and the polls suggest the NDP would be booted from office if the election were held today.

But the election is still more than three weeks away and there is reason for Notley to believe her fortunes could improve. The trend line is inching in her direction and she's more popular than her party; UCP Leader Jason Kenney, her chief rival, is less popular than his.

Nevertheless, the New Democrats have a serious challenge ahead of them. That trend line has a long way to go before the election looks competitive, let alone one the NDP is in a position to win.

The CBC's Alberta Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data, puts the United Conservatives ahead with 50 per cent support among decided voters, followed by the New Democrats at 35.3 per cent.

The Alberta Party trails at a distance with 7.4 per cent, while the Liberals are polling at 4.8 per cent of the vote.

This is not significantly different than where things stood on election night four years ago. The Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties, which merged to form the UCP in 2017, combined for 52 per cent of the vote in 2015, only two percentage points higher than where the UCP stands today. The NDP, which captured 40.6 per cent of the vote, is down only about five points — still putting it on track for the second best performance in the party's history.

But the lack of a divided right changes the electoral math dramatically. With current levels of support, the Alberta Poll Tracker estimates the UCP would win between 61 and 76 seats — far more than the 44 needed to secure a majority government. The NDP would win between 11 and 25 seats, with the Alberta Party and Liberals in the running for no more than one apiece.

A polling error of the same magnitude as the one that occurred in the 2012 election — when Wildrose was given a wide lead in the last polls of the campaign, only for the PCs to hold onto to power — if repeated in Alberta next month, would still only put the UCP and NDP roughly tied. Even that scenario would be unlikely to re-elect the New Democrats due to their concentration of support in Edmonton.

NDP's strength in Edmonton, UCP everywhere else

That is where Notley's party still has its greatest strength. The Alberta Poll Tracker puts the NDP at 44.6 per cent in the city, with the UCP a few points back at 40 per cent. That level of support would likely divide Edmonton between the two parties in terms of seats.

But in the rest of the province, the UCP holds sway. In Calgary, Kenney's party is ahead by about 22 points in the Poll Tracker, with 54 per cent support compared to 32 per cent. That puts every seat in range of the UCP, while the New Democrats are in contention to hold just a handful of theirs.

Outside of the two cities, the United Conservatives are ahead by about 27 points. With between 28 and 31 seats, the rural areas of the province alone could put the UCP three-quarters of the way to a majority government.

Thin silver linings for the NDP

However, there are some silver linings for Notley in the numbers.

The most important one is that she is a plus for her party while Kenney is a minus. A Leger survey conducted between March 7 and 12 found the two party leaders virtually tied on the question of who Albertans think would make the best premier, with Notley at 33 per cent and Kenney at 32 per cent.

Taking into account the undecideds in the Leger poll on both the voting intentions and best premier questions, this suggests that Notley is about four percentage points more popular than the NDP. Kenney is two points less popular than the UCP.

© Dave Chidley/Canadian Press Dave Chidley/Canadian Press

The difference was even starker in an Ipsos/Global News poll conducted between Mar. 15 and 17. It found Kenney at 33 per cent on the best premier question and Notley not far behind at 30 per cent, but again this suggests that Notley scores two points higher than the NDP among all voters. Kenney scores nine points worse than the UCP.

The hope for the NDP is that Notley is able to pull her party's support up while Kenney drags the UCP's down. This is clearly the party's strategy in the campaign so far, as the NDP leader's name takes prominence in the party's branding and her political attacks target Kenney personally.

The trend lines are also heading in a positive direction for the NDP, if marginally so. Leger puts the party up two points since last year, while ThinkHQ shows it up eight points since the end of 2017.

The inevitability of the UCP?

But the margin the NDP has to overcome remains enormous. While Kenney's personal popularity doesn't help the United Conservatives, the unpopularity of the NDP government might prove too much of an anchor weighing Notley down. In the Ipsos survey, just 31 per cent of Albertans said the NDP deserved re-election — losing numbers in a two-horse race.

The impact of the latest controversies surrounding Kenney's successful bid for the UCP leadership have yet to be fully recorded in the polls. They could sap UCP support further. But the 2018 Ontario election campaign, which ended with Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives defeating Kathleen Wynne's Liberals, showed that unpopular opposition leaders hobbled by controversy can still win big when voters want to see the incumbent government ousted.

The UCP has led in voting intentions since it was created and not once since coming to power have the New Democrats matched their 2015 election score in the polls. Even that probably wouldn't be enough to secure a victory when the right is no longer divided.

The potential for Notley to turn this into a competitive race exists. But she has a long way to go to cast doubt on the inevitability of a victory by Jason Kenney and the United Conservatives.",Rachel Notley's NDP starts Alberta campaign with big hill to climb,cbc.ca on MSN.ca,https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/politics/rachel-notleys-ndp-starts-alberta-campaign-with-big-hill-to-climb/ar-BBV2YEb?li=AA521o

When asked during a news conference earlier in the day, Notley was quick to link the need to restore democracy to the emerging UCP leadership controversies.

""There is a very significant scandal right now,"" said Notley.

""At its very best, it amounts to very dark backroom politics focused on thwarting democracy.""

The NDP is framing the imminent election campaign as a clear choice between Notley and Kenney.

That's how the NDP see it, that's how they'll play it, and that's what their entire re-election hope hangs on.

A fighting chance

If the NDP had been feeling a little beaten up after trailing the upstart UCP since before the party was born, you'd never know it from the crowd reaction at the Sunday afternoon rally in Edmonton-Strathcona.

In the distant background were several NDP candidates, many of them cabinet ministers. But they were just faces in the crowd, and weren't even introduced.

It was all about Notley.

She raised familiar themes about policy differences between the NDP and UCP on education, and about needing a credit card to pay for healthcare.

And then, subtle digs against Kenney — and some all-out attacks against him.

It is alleged that during the 2017 UCP leadership race, Kenney's campaign worked alongside Jeff Callaway's campaign to attack and undermine Brian Jean.

Both Kenney and Callaway have denied collaborating in a kamikaze campaign.

Kenney chalks up his team's interactions with Callaway's team during the leadership race to normal communications of one camp looking for second-ballot support.

Notley sees it differently, and so do her NDP supporters.

It's a turn of events that has galvanized the NDP — at least for now.

Leaders the 'centrepiece' of party

Andy Knight, a University of Alberta political science professor, says pinning all hopes on Notley is a ""very smart"" approach by the NDP.

""I think the political leader of the party will be looked at very seriously,"" said Knight, who co-wrote a book on political leadership in 2009, The Ashgate Research Companion to Political Leadership.

The leaders, said Knight, are the ""centrepieces"" for the vision and integrity of the party.

""At the end of the day, I think the leader still is going to be the one that's most important for the people around the province who are voting.""

Knight characterized Kenney as a smart political operative, a ""political animal"" who likely had the best chance of winning the UCP leadership race from the get-go.

Kenney, who steamrolled his agenda to unite a fragmented political right in Alberta, was widely praised in political circles for finally bringing together various brands of conservatives under one banner.

Kenney first won the PC leadership, then brokered a deal with the Wildrose and eventually became the first UCP leader in a landslide.

But now, some former enemies in the Alberta conservative movement are uniting against Kenney.

As just one example: Brian Jean is once again talking to his former rival Derek Fildebrandt, who leads the upstart Freedom Conservative Party. Neither have anything good to say about Kenney these days.

These painful memories were dredged up for many in Alberta on Thursday, with the NDP releasing a video that resurrects United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney’s past of working to overturn spousal rights for gay couples in San Francisco decades ago. While the emotional video is a political attack against Kenney, it has drawn strong, if sometimes divided, reactions from the province’s LGBTQ community. Some say it sheds a light on Kenney’s past that has had a lasting, negative impact on the community, and called for “real reconciliation” from the UCP leader. But conservative LGBTQ folks say Kenney’s track record with the community has improved, and the past should remain in the past. Titled Jason Kenney’s Real Record, the video was screened to members of the LGBTQ community on Thursday afternoon in both Edmonton and Calgary. It tells the story of a San Francisco man identified as Gary Solak, who lost his partner, James Ross, at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s.

The overturning of a law that extended spousal rights to same-sex couples at the time meant that Solak, who still lives in San Francisco, had no access to the home he shared with his partner after his death to retrieve personal items, according to the video. Kenney lobbied for the overturn of those rights during his time as a university student in San Francisco. The video was funded by the Alberta NDP campaign, and was filmed within the last month. “The decisions that politicians make have lasting impacts,” Sarah Hoffman, outgoing deputy premier, said when introducing the video, which the party has dubbed as a short documentary. At a rally earlier on Thursday in Calgary, Kenney responded to the controversy surrounding his previous political activism against same-sex rights and said his views have evolved since he was a university student. “It’s true that back when these were matters of political contention, that I supported the traditional definition of marriage, as did virtually every political party and political leader in every country in the democratic West,” Kenney said. “It’s also true that social, political and legal consensus on that question has changed dramatically, and I accept that.”

Among those struck by the video was Michael Phair, a well-known gay rights activist and former Edmonton city councillor, who was invited to one of the screenings on Thursday. Phair also served as the first openly gay politician in Alberta. “Unfortunately for me, it brings back very difficult memories,” Phair, who lived in San Francisco during the AIDS epidemic, said. “Everyone died in those days.” Phair added he believes Kenney’s actions from decades ago still hold weight in the upcoming provincial election. “I think that pain and the way that people were treated ... that is something that doesn’t go away without a whole lot of reconciliation work, and some direct response of coming to terms with what you did at that time,” he said.

Those comments were echoed by Louden, who said he is yet to see a sincere apology from Kenney on his past actions toward the LGBTQ community. “He needs to be really, really clear; specifically, intentionally and explicitly state his support for the (LGBTQ) community,” Louden said. “That’s the minimum that I would accept from him.” Louden said he has voted conservative in the past, but has become more left-leaning over the years. He will not be voting for the UCP in the April 16 election, he said, largely due to Kenney’s history with the LGBTQ community. “He seemed so damned proud of it,” Louden said of Kenney’s role in overturning spousal rights for LGBTQ people. “That really infuriates me.”

But for Harrison Fleming, a communications adviser for the UCP caucus and a member of LGBTTory, a group representing LGBTQ conservatives, Kenney’s past actions are not reflective of the politician he is today. “What happened 30 years ago, I mean, that’s quite frankly 30 years ago when probably more than half of Canada was opposed to gay marriage,” Fleming said. He added Kenney’s track record since then, especially as federal immigration minister, proves that his views have changed. He particularly cites Kenney’s efforts to protect LGBTQ Iranians by granting them refugee status in Canada. “Society has moved forward … Conservatives as a whole have moved forward,” Fleming said. Fleming added that while LGBTQ issues are important for members of the community, it’s “patronizing” to assume some will vote solely on social issues, and that LGBTQ people care just as much about issues relating to the economic welfare of the province. “There’s no one person who clearly identifies the experience that (LGBTQ) people have,” Fleming said.

The political divide between members of the LGBTQ community comes up frequently in conversation within the personal circles of both Louder and Mark Chiang, an LGBTQ minister at Edmonton’s St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church. But Chiang said his passion about social issues affecting his community is now at the forefront after viewing the Alberta NDP’s video on Kenney’s history. “I do have some gay friends who would be more economically conservative, and we play this balance of how important are the social issues,” Chiang said. “This video reminded me that, for me, the social issues outweigh the economic ones.” Chiang added that in light of the video, he hopes to see a thorough response from Kenney on his past actions against same-sex rights. “It’s his chance to tell that story,” he said.

And, ironically, the predicted slowdown is largely attributed to some key — yet controversial — taxation measures the NDP has introduced into law.

Last week, two financial institutions released economic analyses that both zeroed in on B.C.’s economy, and both projected it will slow down significantly because of the cooling of the province’s real estate market.

READ MORE: Few incentives in spending-heavy B.C. budget, global downturn worries business leaders

Central 1 Credit Union concluded the province’s economy will, in fact, have three years of weak economic growth after several years of robust annual growth of more than three per cent GDP.

Its deputy chief economist, Bryan Yu, said in a news release that “economic growth is being held hostage by the housing market slump, which is deeper than previously forecast.”

As a result, Central 1 is now forecasting the provincial economy will grow by just 2.2 per cent in the coming year, then 2.4 per cent in 2020 and 2.8 per cent in 2021.

READ MORE: Economic growth to slow in B.C. this year: Central 1 Credit Union

Yu’s report predicted “a substantial rebound (in home sales) is not expected. This downturn will be modest compared to previous episodes, reflecting a policy-induced downturn, rather than economic-recession induced downturn.”

Meanwhile, TD Economics had a more pessimistic assessment, projecting B.C.’s economic growth to be just 1.4 per cent this year and two per cent next year. Again, the chief villain is the slumping real estate sector.

“B.C.’s deepening housing market slowdown is likely to put a larger damper on growth this year,” it said in its provincial economic forecast. “The province’s housing market has been the most hard-hit by the implementation of tighter rules, rising interest rates and B.C. government policy measures.”

WATCH: Housing market downturn threatens B.C. economy

To be sure, neither of these projected scenarios constitute being anything close to a recession, but this may still spell bad news for the government’s three-year fiscal plan. The lower the economic growth rate, the fewer tax dollars are available for collection, and that plan projects an increase of almost $4.5 billion in tax revenue over that period.

To her credit, Finance Minister Carole James has taken a prudent approach to financial planning, and I have noted in this space before that she has built into her budgets enough elbow room to withstand some poorer-than-expected revenue estimates.

Still, what’s disappointing about this situation is that measures such as the speculation tax, the increase in the foreign buyers tax and the higher tax on high-end homes was supposed to make housing — both at the ownership and tenancy level — more affordable.

Instead, for now anyways, while house prices have dropped they have not dropped to the point of making homes actually affordable for most folks. A house that drops in price from $3 million to $2 million can hardly be viewed as becoming suddenly affordable.

And rents haven’t declined much, either, and remain unattainable for many. So it now looks like the government’s housing policies (which do not place much emphasis on increasing the supply of housing) are not only not meeting the affordability targets, but are instead having the biggest impact at slowing down the provincial economy.

Now, none of this may come back to haunt the NDP government. Both financial institutions are predicting employment levels will remain high (the government’s infrastructure program is considered to be providing a cushion to any economic slowdown).

“With more Albertans unemployed and the unemployment rate climbing higher yet again, it’s clear that the NDP plan simply isn’t working,” UCP MLA Ric McIver said in a March 8 news release. “High-tax, high-debt, anti-growth NDP policies are failing Albertans by hurting job creation.”

UCP Leader Jason Kenney shared a message on Twitter on March 9, saying: “The premier keeps telling Albertans that things are getting better but nearly 50,000 full-time jobs have been lost in the last four months alone.”

Is this true? Have that many jobs been lost in Alberta in the last four months? And are NDP policies at fault?

What is the allegation?

The UCP used Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey, which shows the number of full-time jobs in Alberta fell from 1,954,000 in November 2018 to 1,906,300 in February 2019, a net loss of 47,700.

A UCP spokesperson adds: “There are now 182,500 unemployed Albertans — 43,000 more than when the NDP took office… Alberta’s unemployment rate climbed to 7.3 per cent, the highest of any province outside of Atlantic Canada, and now even higher than Nova Scotia.”

What are the facts?

The UCP’s numbers are correct, but there are some important things to note:

While the province’s unemployment rate is high, Alberta also has the highest employment rate in Canada, sitting at 66.5 per cent in February 2019. To compare, Nova Scotia’s employment rate for the same month was 58.1 per cent.

“The unemployment rate measures how many people are looking for work as a share of a province or a city’s labour force,” said Trevor Tombe, an associate professor of economics and research fellow at the school of public policy at the University of Calgary. “So if people withdraw from the labour force — give up searching, for example — then they aren’t counted as unemployed.”

READ MORE: Alberta added 24,000 jobs in November, provincial unemployment drops to 6.3%

“Alberta has a high unemployment rate — certainly higher than it was prior to the recession and higher than many other provinces — but as a share of the population, more Albertans are employed than any other province by a pretty wide margin.

“Our employment rate is higher than anywhere else,” Tombe said. “But our unemployment rate is elevated despite that because so many more Albertans participate in the labour market than elsewhere.”

2. The four-month period the UCP is using (November 2018 to February 2019) also saw part-time employment increase by 21,000 jobs.

3. The margin of error for Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey is huge.

“Just to give you a sense of scale, in any given month, you should think of the estimate for full-time employment as +/- 28,000,” Tombe said. “Just like we look at a poll and we see that a certain party has a given amount of support +/- 3 or 4 points 19 times out of 20, that margin of error for full-time employment is +/- 28,000.”

WATCH BELOW (Jan. 8, 2019): When it comes to jobs in Alberta, what is really going on? Several headlines over the past few weeks have sent mixed messages. But they’re all true, using Statistics Canada numbers. Global News at Noon speaks to economist Trevor Tombe for some important context on the situation.

What do the experts say?

So, while the 48,000 number is accurate, Tombe says it doesn’t tell the whole story.

“It does show that full-time employment between November and February fell by 48,000, roughly,” he said. “Where that kind of misses the mark is that it’s kind of cherry-picking some of the dates.

“If you had instead looked at October to February, or December to February, you’d have got a number more around 15,000.”

READ MORE: Alberta unemployment steady at 6.7 % in August; Calgary has second highest unemployment rate in Canada

It’s more meaningful to look at longer-term trends in this kind of data, Tombe said.

“Recovery was fairly strong in 2017, with improvements across the board and large drops in the unemployment rate… But it’s fair to say the recovery has stalled at the end of 2018 as we go into 2019.”

READ MORE: Low oil prices to have negative effect on Canadian economy – but not as bad as 2015: BOC

And can changes in employment or unemployment rates be credited to or blamed on specific government? While parties of all stripes tend to make the correlation, Tombe says it’s a difficult jump.

“It’s not uncommon for opposition parties everywhere to blame governments every time bad economic news comes up and it is equally common for governments to claim credit for good news,” he said.

“I think both arguments are exaggerating the effect of policy on short-run movements in the economy.”

“For Alberta, the recession was not due to government policy; it was due to the big drop in the price of oil. And the recovery during 2017 was also not due to government policy. And the slowdown in the pace of recovery, I’d say has a lot more to do with market access concerns, and rising oil price differentials than any particular action taken by the Alberta government.”

What else should I know?

“When the price of oil collapsed from $100/bbl to $25/bbl, we made the decision to invest in the services that Albertans relied on and build the much-needed schools and hospitals to put Albertans back to work,” an NDP spokesperson told Global News.

“As a result, since the depths of the recessions, Alberta has created over 80,000 new full-time jobs, mostly in the private sector.

“Oil prices have been staying lower for longer and market access issues persists. That’s why our government is taking action by investing in upgrading our natural resources and diversifying our economy.”

Kenney has promised that, if elected, the UCP would lower the 12 per cent corporate income tax rate by one point a year until it reaches eight per cent in 2022. He said cutting the rate will help grow businesses and jobs, and that will in turn create more revenue from other taxes to make up for the cut.

""I don't think we appreciate what is actually coming,"" Kate Ervine, a Saint Mary's University professor with expertise in political ecology and carbon markets.

Ervine was at the legislature Tuesday to speak in support of an NDP bill that would create an economic plan focused on green jobs.

The bill would create a 15-person task force representing a variety of sectors and communities to develop a plan to transition the province to a greener economy.

It also calls for a reduction of the province's greenhouse gas emissions to at least 50 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The province is currently 30 per cent below 2005 levels.

""The economic era of fossil fuels is rapidly yielding to a new economic era,"" said NDP Leader Gary Burrill.

Financial forecasts for the next 20 years show that $7.8 trillion will be invested in renewable energy in the United States, while a fraction of that will go toward fossil fuels, he said.

NDP Leader Gary Burrill says Nova Scotia needs to have a plan to help the province's businesses operate in a green economy. (CBC)

""Nova Scotia's economic present, our prospects, our future, depend upon our success in making this great transition.""

Part of the aim of the bill is recognizing people working in fossil fuel-related industries will eventually see fewer job prospects and will need support in terms of training and other options as they transition toward jobs more in step with a green economy.

""We can't simply tell people that change is coming and hope that they accept it,"" said Ervine.

Jobs in the technology and green sectors were the fastest growing in the country last year, she said.

""We're tapping into something that actually is happening, and it makes no sense not to do that.""

Ervine pointed to Spain, where the government is working with unions representing coal industry workers to help them transition for a time when the coal mines shut down.

Premier Stephen McNeil said the government continues to work toward further expansion of the green economy in Nova Scotia.

Efficiency Nova Scotia is expecting growth of five per cent in its GDP, he said, adding many of the agency's programs are geared toward supporting small businesses that help people reduce their carbon footprint.

""We believe not only can we do what's right for the environment, but we can also continue to grow the economy,"" said McNeil.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Goals and Sustainability Act, which governs a variety of reduction targets for the province, is due for its regularly scheduled review. Environment Minister Margaret Miller said that work is happening now and will be completed later this year.

Miller said she expects part of that work will look at the issue of green jobs.

But I’ll let others do ...,"I could spend time arguing about the risks of the NDP’s campaign promise to double down on its energy diversification strategy by offering more subsidies to industry.

But I’ll let others do the job, such as a senior Alberta bureaucrat.

Or legendary oilman Jim Gray.

“Given the current fiscal situation … it would be questionable to introduce subsidies to the petrochemical industry at this point,” stated a ministerial briefing note prepared for Finance Minister Joe Ceci in November 2015 about the idea of offering incentives to kick-start petrochemical sector investment.

“This proposed incentive program cannot be justified on economic merit alone.”

Ouch.

The advice from the unnamed senior civil servant, in a memo obtained by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, was written in response to a proposal to offer $500 million in grants or royalty tax credits to coax more investment into Alberta’s petrochemical industry.

The NDP eventually unveiled a different program to provide $500 million in royalty credits in late 2016, triggering two large petrochemical facilities to be built in Alberta’s Industrial Heartland area.

Last year, the provincial government expanded its energy diversification efforts to offer more subsidies, including grants and loan guarantees, to entice development of partial upgrading facilities, more petrochemical complexes and new natural gas infrastructure.

It pushed the costs to $3.6 billion.

On the election campaign trail Wednesday, NDP Leader Rachel Notley doubled the amount, promising to boost the incentives to $7 billion over the next decade if her party wins the April 16 election.

“It’s time we start acting like resource owners once again in Alberta, as we did under Premier Lougheed,” Notley said in a statement.

The NDP maintains the idea will eventually trigger 70,000 jobs and stimulate $75 billion in investment by 2030.

It sounds alluring, until you hear the other side.

Here’s another zinger from the internal government document.

“Alberta’s tax system is focused on keeping taxes low for all industries. The proposed incentive program means government is selecting certain stakeholders to receive direct support,” it states.

“There is no guarantee that the incentive program will actually lead to additional investment and could benefit projects that would have gone ahead regardless of the incentives.”

Now, the first phase of the program did succeed in attracting private-sector investment.

Inter Pipeline is building a $3.5-billion petrochemical plant after being offered up to $200 million in royalty tax credits.

Calgary-based Pembina Pipeline is teaming up with the petrochemical unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corp. to build a $4.5-billion dehydrogenation and polypropylene facility.

It made the decision after being offered up to $300 million in royalty tax credits, which are only paid out once the plant is operating.

NDP officials say of the remaining $950 million available under the existing petrochemical diversification program, it’s hoping to stimulate construction of massive ethane-cracking plants.

“We are seriously considering two proposals for world-scale ethane (crackers) that would double our current ethane production,” said one campaign official.

Two such complexes could see an investment worth an estimated $18 billion, potentially leveraged by $950 million in incentives, he said.

But where does Alberta draw the line in the game of offering subsidies to a few private-sector players?

And how could the public money be better used? There are many demands on the public purse.

“Get the economic fundamentals right, cut the red tape, get investment confidence back in Alberta, instead of picking a handful of winners and losers,” United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney told reporters when asked about the program.

Putting taxpayer money on the table through loan guarantees and grants carries a degree of risk, as was seen in the losses Albertans endured in the 1990s with the bi-provincial upgrader.

The province invested $404 million and sold out its position for $32 million four years later.

“History within Alberta has shown us these economic diversification government-led projects have burned Albertans,” said Franco Terrazzano of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.

The NDP points out the internal government analysis from 2015 is stale – dated almost four years ago — and economic conditions have changed, as did the program.

Natural gas supplies are plentiful and the province has cheap feedstock to entice petrochemical industry investment.

A more compelling case can be made for investing in new partial upgrading technology, which would lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the amount of diluent needed to ship bitumen by pipeline, benefiting many players in the oilpatch, not just one company.

However, the NDP contends a broad energy diversification strategy is needed to add greater value to our natural resources and more jobs in Alberta.

They frequently invoke the name of former Tory premier Lougheed, who succeeded in expanding the petrochemical industry more than four decades ago by using incentives and other government assurances.

Today, other jurisdictions in the United States are offering even larger incentives.

Without them, no facilities have been built in Alberta over the past two decades, said David Chappell, chair of the Resource Diversification Council, which represents petrochemical and midstream companies.

But these arguments don’t convince Gray, co-founder of Canadian Hunter Exploration and a friend of Lougheed’s.

A member of the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, Gray points out the Lougheed government had some successes adding value to Alberta’s resources, but there were also costly missteps.

“Whenever there has to be a subsidy or has to be tax credits or royalty credits, whatever, you can almost be assured those things are sailing into difficult water,” he said Thursday.

“It’s a dangerous game and you play it at your risk.”

I couldn’t have said it better myself.

Trash Jason Kenney and trash him good.

Make the United Conservative leader into such a horrible person you could not possibly vote for him.

The Notley NDP doesn’t just think Kenney has bad ideas they think he is bad.

The NDP say he is not fit to be premier. They say he doesn’t have the character. They say he is cruel.

One day, Notley & Co. roll out 30 seconds of old video.

It’s Kenney from about 20 years ago talking about something from 30 years ago.

On the video Kenney says he was part of a campaign leading to a vote where the majority in San Francisco said No to a gay spousal law.

A voice in the video says he was stopping dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex partners in hospital.

The next day, Thursday, the Notley NDP release a 10-minute documentary where they put in a slightly longer video of Kenney followed by heart-wrenching interviews of people who lived through the AIDS crisis of 30 years ago.

The people interviewed are then shown the Kenney video. They don’t like it and say so.

The 10 minutes ends with those interviewed in San Francisco more or less saying don’t vote for Kenney. Then there’s a final quotation from Notley.

Now Kenney points out he volunteered at an AIDS hospice 30 years ago. He and others saw the vote campaign as being about the definition of marriage not about limiting partners from visiting loved ones in hospital.

Back then, says Kenney, almost every leader in the democratic world backed the traditional man-woman definition of marriage.

Kenney says he does not stand by his comments from long ago and he is against any discrimination. As the federal immigration minister he set up a program where gay men facing execution in Iran could come to Canada.

Well, this is where the election campaign has come and Kenney has clearly had enough.

The UCP leader speaks of what he believes the NDP is up to this week.

He speaks of the “overheated politics of personal destruction” and “U.S.-style attack politics” and an NDP government that’s “run out of fumes” and is desperate because “they know they have only four weeks left.”

“I think it’s sad that, in what may well be the dying days of this government, they’re embarrassing themselves,” says Kenney.

“I would ask them to think about the dignity of the offices they hold.”

Kenney says he’s not perfect. He’s made mistakes. He has said things he regrets.

But he says the Notley NDP are trying to change the channel from what Albertans think of as the big issues — jobs, the economy and pipelines.

Kenney expects the “fear and smear” to ramp up, telling us to wait until the last week of this ballot battle when it will get real hot.

In Calgary in the present, a long way from San Francisco, with the tall towers and the empty offices of downtown in the background, Kenney rolls out ugly economic statistics.

Kenney says Notley sold Alberta out to Justin Trudeau, with us paying a carbon tax and still no pipeline to the coast.

“If the premier wants to be judged on her effectiveness on pipelines I think she’d better watch out for the verdict of Albertans in four weeks.”

Kenney pledges if he’s premier and Trudeau’s No More Pipelines law goes through, Alberta will take the feds to court.

And if the B.C. government doesn’t play nice on the Trans Mountain pipeline Alberta will turn off the taps.

He will demand a fair deal for Alberta and, if push comes to shove, put equalization on the table.

Kenney advises Albertans not to be bamboozled by the Notley NDP.

“They thought the folks working in the office towers were a problem. They were the enemy,” says the UCP leader.

“They demonized the people who used to work in those office towers and that is one of the reasons they’re one-third empty today. The industry took the hint.”

All of this does not stop us from hearing the Stupid Question of the campaign.

Does Kenney condemn white supremacy?

Guess what. Kenney condemns white supremacists.

There wasn’t one question for those, including Notley, who claim Kenney allegedly cheated to win his party’s leadership.

It is obvious Kenney wants to clear the air, once and for all.

“Albertans deserve better than a premier and her ministers basically channelling the angry voices of Twitter.”

NDP Leader Rachel Notley is promising to spend $7 billion over 10 years on incentives for companies willing to build petrochemical and upgrading facilities in Alberta if she is re-elected.

The investment would nearly double the $3.6 billion in incentives already committed by Notley's government.

Campaigning on Wednesday, Notley said the additional investment would encourage $75 billion in investment and 70,000 jobs by 2030.

Notley made her announcement at Cessco, an Edmonton company building components for the petrochemical industry.

The component displayed at the news conference was headed to a $300-million gas-to-plastics plant being built near Fort Saskatchewan, which Notley said was aided by a $200-million royalty credit.

""We own the resources in this province and so it is on us to develop them,"" Notley said.

The NDP leader said her government's $1 billion in incentives over the last three years has triggered nearly $13 billion in new private sector investment.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 12 to eight per cent over four years, which he said would create 55,000 jobs.

Notley said this tax ""giveaway"" is ""in return for nothing.""

""His plan is phony, discredited, magical thinking,"" she said. ""Quite frankly, he's selling snake oil. He doesn't have a plan to help you. He will just make Alberta and Albertans more vulnerable to boom and busts in the long run.""

This was the first stop for Notley on Wednesday. She is also making campaign appearances in Red Deer and Lethbridge.

The online poll of 1,196 people conducted March 14 to 17 by ThinkHQ Public Affairs states that provincewide, Jason Kenney’s UCP has 49 per cent of decided support with the NDP second at 38 per cent, a gap that has narrowed by three points in the past month.

In Calgary, meanwhile, the UCP has 54 per cent support, while the NDP trails at 33 per cent.

While the NDP has an 18-point advantage in Edmonton, where they fared well in the 2015 election, the governing party is stuck with Calgary numbers they had four years ago, but with no vote split on the right, said ThinkHQ president Marc Henry.

“The math and geography is hard (for the NDP) . . . How do you make it up in 27 days where you’ve been in the last four years,” he said.

“They have to have a lopsided gain from the undecideds.”

That undecided vote stands at 22 per cent, which provides some flexibility, said Henry, but the danger for the NDP is that 50 per cent of those polled say the governing party has had a negative effect on their lives.

“When that’s double the opposite, that’s a problem,” he said.

And while the NDP has made gains in popularity, those have largely been in areas where they were already leading, which doesn’t help their seat count, said Henry.

“That makes your vote very inefficient,” he said.

He noted the tail end of the poll was conducted just as evidence was emerging suggesting collusion between UCP Leader Jason Kenney’s 2017 leadership campaign and that of one-time Wildrose party president Jeff Callaway.

Kenney continues to deny the Callaway campaign was run to benefit his own, but Henry said the impact of honesty in the campaign could still fall along partisan lines.

At her campaign launch in Calgary on Tuesday, Premier Rachel Notley was asked if she could overcome years of negative polling in a four-week campaign.

“Polls don’t decide elections, voters do,” she said.

She also defended her government’s record in helping the city during the economic doldrums, citing major infrastructure projects it has funded along with efforts at diversification, including $100 million for high-tech ventures.

But Henry said of 30 Calgary-area seats, there are probably only six the NDP has a chance of winning, “and the NDP isn’t leading in any of them.”

The governing party could be competitive in a few ridings in the province’s north and in Lethbridge, but the UCP generally has rural areas locked up, added Henry.

The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

But Day Two of the election campaign, Premier Notley told us to stay tuned to what Sarah Hoffman had to say.

Enter Hoffman, the NDP deputy premier, whose job in this good cop/bad cop movie is to be the bad cop.

You know the NDP strategy. Trash Jason Kenney and trash him good. Make the United Conservative leader into a scary, shadowy character voters won’t go anywhere near.

You know, the kind of guy you might see on a Most Wanted poster in the old movies.

So the Notley NDP go back to the archives and dust off some material we already saw when it made the political rounds a few months ago.

It is a few seconds of video from about 20 years ago. The subject is something from 30 years ago.

Yes, 30 years ago. No statute of limitations here.

In the video clip going on social media and TV, the young Kenney talks about his days on campus in San Francisco and how he “helped to lead an ultimately successful initiative which led to a referendum which overturned the first gay spousal law in North America.”

Yes, back in those days, the majority in San Francisco were on the same side as Kenney.

The video plays on, ominous music in the background.

A voice says Kenney bragged about stopping dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex spouses in the hospital.

More from the voice, telling us Kenney has been campaigning against people’s rights his whole life.

The voice asks the NDP question in this election campaign. Is this a premier?

By the way, the United Conservative question in this campaign is: Are you better off than you were four years ago?

Anyway, we all know Kenney’s views have changed. Newshound mention this fact. Hoffman says he’s not showing remorse.

She says Kenney on the video is bragging and boasting in making his statement of 20 years ago. Hoffman adds same-sex couples were denied hospital visitation rights.

“I believe Jason Kenney is unfit to be premier,” says Hoffman. “That video speaks volumes to his character.”

She uses words like cruel and hateful and talks about his smile.

Hoffman says she’s not sure why Notley is not doing this hit.

“I know why it’s me, I don’t know why it’s not her,” says Hoffman, when pushed by the press for not answering the question.

The deputy premier says the NDP will be sharing more information about the United Conservative leader.

Meanwhile, yours truly became a teeny tiny part of this mud wrestling scene when NDP bigshot Jeremy Nolais takes to Twitter and says your humble scribbler has an election strategy.

Me? A strategy?

Nolais, a supposed heavy hitter in the NDP braintrust, says little old me is trying to suppress “an ever-growing scandal that calls into question our open elections and Jason Kenney’s willingness to calmly lie to the people of Alberta.”

Is this so-called scandal an ever-growing one? Pray tell, what is the smoking gun? That Kenney’s people and supporters of a guy named Jeff Callaway sometimes worked together in the United Conservative leadership race.

That won’t be the decider at the ballot box for most folks. Unless more stuff comes out, this dog won’t hunt.

Ah, it’s only Day Two.

This is a day where a ThinkHQ nosecount shows the NDP way behind in Calgary and everywhere else in the province but Edmonton.

This is a day where Kenney once again takes aim at the carbon tax the Notley NDP didn’t tell us about in the last ballot battle, four years ago.

Imagine that.

The UCP leader once again vows to fight Trudeau and goes after Notley for lecturing Albertans about taking the bus and walking.

“This from a premier driven around in a gas-guzzling SUV.”

This is a day where Notley has an event at a fabricating plant and when the president of the company is asked if he supports the NDP he says “a lot of Albertans are questioning who to vote for next.”

Not exactly a ringing endorsement.

And this is a day where the NDP criticize Kenney and then quote former Wildrose leader Brian Jean.

The NDP and Jean. Strange bedfellows, indeed.

Notley once again speaks of Kenney lying and cheating to become his party’s leader.

Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement:

Today I join all New Democrats to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

Every day, too many of our neighbours and community members – people of colour, Indigenous peoples, refugees and immigrants – are harmed, harassed, and denied their rights and access to services just for the way they look or where they are from.

Recent anti-immigrant and anti-refugee sentiments are fueling the sparks of intolerance. Harmful political rhetoric is justifying violent acts against racialized people in Canada and around the world.

This isn't right, and we cannot stand by as it happens. We have an obligation to stand up and speak out with conviction to counter racism, hatred and intolerance.

The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is an opportunity to recognize that the Canadian reality doesn’t always match the image of tolerance that we project onto the world.

Hate and discrimination spread like a fire, once they are allowed to grow. We need to come together as people who refuse to allow these sentiments to propagate in our homes.

The NDP stands in solidarity against racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and hate in all its forms. We call racism and discrimination by their names, not explain them away with excuses. We believe that reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is an action policy, and that eliminating systemic discrimination means creating inclusive workplaces, communities, policies and laws.

On this day, and throughout the year, we must be tireless in working to put an end to all discriminatory practices.",NDP Statement on International Day For The Elimination Of Racial Discrimination,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-statement-international-day-elimination-racial-discrimination-2

As the saying goes, however, one week is a long time in politics, never mind four weeks, so anything could happen.

Nevertheless, UCP Leader Jason Kenney has long vowed that Bill 1 of his government would be to repeal the NDP government’s carbon tax — or as he calls it, the “tax on everything.”

Just how much of an effect will getting rid of the carbon tax have on struggling families and businesses?

My family’s latest bill — dated March 4 — shows that between Jan. 24 and Feb. 22 we used $69.53 worth of natural gas. The carbon levy cost an additional $54.79 — a whopping 78.8 per cent of the cost of the gas we used. Once all of the fees — delivery charges, rate riders, municipal franchise fee, GST and other costs — were added up, the bill came to $231.28. In other words, the carbon tax made up almost one-quarter of the cost of my entire bill — or 23.69 per cent, to be exact.

It was very cold in Calgary during that billing time, but these percentages of the cost of the carbon tax on our bill is not unusual. While this tax does not represent a huge hardship for me and my family, it does for many Albertans.

For 84-year-old widow Edith (who has asked that her last name not be used since she lives alone), the carbon tax has been hard, even though she keeps her bungalow near the University of Calgary “cooler than is always comfortable” most of the time.

“For me, getting rid of the carbon tax will be a godsend,” says Edith. “More government spending on programs doesn’t help me. What I really need is for the government to leave just a bit more of my own money in my own pocket,” said the healthy great-grandmother, who is originally from small-town Saskatchewan. She says she’ll be voting UCP on April 10 when the advance polls open.

On Wednesday, Kenney was campaigning in Lethbridge talking to the Sailer brothers, who took him on a tour of their 40-year-old family business, Southland Trailers.

Jason Sailer, 34, says the carbon tax costs their company around $7,000 a month.

“We have a couple of paint booths that use a lot of natural gas to dry the paint,” said Sailer.

“We believe in reinvesting money in our business for new equipment and to hire new people, and (the carbon tax) is just one more thing taking away from that pot,” said the 34-year-old father of a two-year-old boy.

Hiring more people means more money flowing into government coffers and more money for hospitals and education. And these aren’t minimum-wage jobs. Southland Trailer’s 180 employees make anywhere from about $18 to $38 per hour.

“We’re going to try to continue to expand as long as there’s demand for our products,” said Sailer. “Most of our competitors are out of the U.S, so the more competitive we can be the more we can expand and the more people we can hire.”

The NDP argues that getting rid of the tax will mean less revenue for government coffers, but many economists say lowering costs for businesses means more people working, more taxes and more government revenues.

“They just told me that the UCP’s Job Creation Tax Cut would also help them invest in expansion and hiring more members of their team; and that our Red Tape Reduction Action Plan and Open for Business Act will be a big help, too,” Kenney wrote on his Facebook page.

Meanwhile, the NDP launched a Kenney attack ad based on a speech he gave 20 years ago.

While a ThinkHQ poll and an Ipsos poll were both conducted before news coverage of a large document dump confirming reports of the “kamikaze candidate” scandal swirling around the UCP for weeks, the numbers show those who plan to vote UCP are largely unmoved.

ThinkHQ president Marc Henry said party vote intentions have been pretty stable over the past 18 months despite several controversies over UCP riding races, and allegations that UCP leadership hopeful Jeff Callaway simply ran in the 2017 race as a “stalking horse” candidate to help criticize Kenney’s main leadership rival, Brian Jean, so Kenney could appear to remain above the fray.

The RCMP is also investigating allegations of improper campaign donations.

“Those scandals are meaningful to some voters but what they’re really interested in is jobs, pipelines and the economy, so the risk for the NDP is if all you do is talk about Jason Kenney and how terrible he is, in many respects you’re talking past voters,” he said.

Provincewide, the UCP have 49 per cent support and the NDP has 38 per cent, according to ThinkHQ. The poll puts the NDP ahead in Edmonton, with 52 per cent of the vote to the UCP’s 34 per cent. In every other region of the province, the UCP is leading by large numbers, including in Calgary where the UCP leads with 54 per cent to the NDP’s 33 per cent.

“There are some voters whose overriding objective of the campaign is to get rid of the NDP. Almost half of Alberta voters say the NDP government has had a negative impact on their lives personally, and that’s a dangerous number because that’s as basic a ballot question as you can have,” said Henry.

According to the Ipsos poll, the race in Edmonton is at a statistical tie — 44 per cent NDP vs. 43 per cent UCP. In Calgary, the UCP has a sizable lead of 57 per cent versus 32 per cent for the NDP.

In short, voters will be asked to choose between a murky scandal involving internal party politics, or the scandal of the carbon tax that the NDP never campaigned on and that has hurt so many people and businesses.

It’s the same with the provincial election. I’ll be glad when it’s over, so we can all stop pretending the NDP have a path to re-election.

Is it possible the NDP could pull out a surprise victory on April 16? Yeah, I suppose it’s possible.

But the site SportsClubStats.com pegs the Oil’s postseason chances at just 1.3 per cent, even if they go 7-2-0 in their final nine games. And I think the NDP’s chances of repeating as government are lower than that.

Just look at the numbers.

There are 87 seats in the Alberta legislature, which means 44 are needed to form a majority government.

There are 25 seats in the Edmonton region and 24 in the city of Calgary. The rest of the province has 38.

In the last election, the NDP won all the Edmonton seats and 15 of the Calgary ones. They also swept Lethbridge and Red Deer. That gave Rachel Notley and her candidates 44 (a majority) to start with. They only won 10 more in all the rest of Alberta, but they didn’t need that many.

However, this time, the NDP will be unable to repeat that.

They will lose all the Edmonton suburbs. And I will be shocked if they hold on to more than two seats in Calgary.

Indeed, there is a greater chance they will be wiped out completely in Calgary than win even two seats there. There is no appetite for one single day more of NDP rule in the hollowed-out office towers, empty restaurants and half-full corporate parking lots in Calgary.

So with suburban Edmonton seats such as Sherwood Park, Spruce Grove and Leduc (there are six in total) plus at least 22 Calgary seats, the UCP would already be at 28 seats before we even get to the 38 “rural” seats.

To get a majority, the UCP would need to win only 16 of those 38 — and they will win at least 30, and more likely 35 or more. (From inside the bubble of Edmonton, it’s hard to fathom just how unpopular the NDP are everywhere else in the province.)

That means, even before votes are counted in Edmonton, the UCP should have a majority sewn up.

Couldn’t the Alberta Party split the anti-NDP vote with the UCP, especially with the UCP’s leadership controversy? Wouldn’t that permit either a few New Democrats to sneak up the middle or maybe allow Stephen Mandel and his party to win a surprising number of seats?

I don’t think so — except maybe in Edmonton.

Outside Edmonton (even only as far outside as Nisku and Namao), the first priority of voters will be to get rid of the NDP. Any controversy or party that gets in the way of that goal will be pushed aside.

Besides, outside Edmonton, if the Alberta Party splits the vote with anyone, it will be with the NDP, not the UCP. Alberta Party voters are largely old Redford Tories who voted NDP in 2015 because they were fed up with their own party but couldn’t stomach a conservative alternative (Wildrose). If they won’t vote NDP again this time, yet can’t bring themselves to return to the right (UCP), they will be a loss for the Notley party, not the UCP.

In Edmonton, there might be enough voters who cannot vote either NDP or UCP to hand the Alberta Party a few seats. But if that happens, they will simply be battling with the NDP over who gets to finish a distant second.",GUNTER: Let's stop pretending the NDP can win another provincial election,Edmonton Sun,https://edmontonsun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-lets-stop-pretending-the-ndp-can-win-another-provincial-election

“Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson pans speculation tax at West Vancouver yacht club chat,” reported the North Shore News Thursday atop a report on his speech to the local chamber of commerce.

An Opposition leader who the populist-led New Democrats have framed as an elitist. Who played into the stereotype with a comment on the “wacky fun” of renting, which he later had to repudiate.

Now he chooses to deliver a speech on the admittedly half-baked speculation tax at the yacht club in West Vancouver of all places?

“Surprisingly, this isn’t satire written by me,” wrote Jeffrey Ferrier, a self-styled “progressive” and one of several who posted the story on Twitter.

“Wow,” returned Global TV correspondent Keith Baldrey, himself a columnist in the North Shore News. “Does no one do advance work for the Libs any more? A yacht club — especially the West Van one — is the last place a politician with an elitist image problem should go anywhere near.”

Stung, members of the Opposition caucus rode to Wilkinson’s defence.

“But this was a local chamber of commerce event,” protested former cabinet minister Rich Coleman. “When my chamber invites me I don’t tell them where to hold it. It is important to respect local volunteer groups, it is their decision.”

“Come on, Keith,” tweeted Michelle Stilwell, another former cabinet minister. “Why not focus on the issue of a half-baked speculation tax that doesn’t actually target speculators but makes 1.4 million British Columbians prove themselves otherwise?”

Picking up on the what-about-ism theme was former minister Shirley Bond: “How about when John Horgan calls (Liberal MLA) Jackie Tegart a ‘whiner’ for representing constituents and a bill introduced by (Liberal) Stephanie Cadieux is a ‘political stunt’? No comment???”

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the latest in the SNC-Lavalin affair, as well as challenges facing Education Minister Rob Fleming on Surrey school portables and Vancouver school closures, as well as the future of the NDP minority government now that it has survived confidence votes on the throne speech and budget.

But as experienced politicians know — or should know — telling a reporter that he/she should be writing about something other than what he/she is writing about is not a proven media management strategy.

“The physical location/backdrop of a political leader’s appearance during an election campaign is chosen with deliberate, strategic care,” wrote Baldrey by way of reply to several Liberals. “That’s because they matter when it comes to shaping messages and image.”

Yet from this case and others, it would appear the Liberals can’t be bothered with optics, making it easier for opponents to define Wilkinson.

Before long, the exchange veered into ridicule.

When I wrote of the Liberals that “they do protest too much,” someone tweeted back: “I believe in West Vancouver it’s pronounced ‘doth.’”

Also riffing on the Liberal gaffe was one who posted a video of Thurston Howell III, the parody billionaire played by Jim Backus on the old Gilligan’s Island TV show.

The New Democrats played it for laughs as well.

“B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson sailed into the West Vancouver Yacht Club yesterday to say ahoy to about two-dozen members of the exclusive group,” read the press release from a government caucus that is still more quick-witted at the job of opposing than the official Opposition.

And so on, through Wilkinson “tying himself into knots” and “his priority is to buoy the richest two per cent and leave everyone else lost at sea,” and “instead of throwing people a lifeline, Wilkinson is making them walk the plank.”

Great fun unless you happen to be on the Wilkinson defence team.

Reaching, someone in Liberal ranks noticed that attorney general David Eby had spoken at the “ritzy” Vancouver Club, and wasn’t that the same thing?

Plus there was this, from Opposition house leader Mary Polak: “Someone should advise Horgan not to speak at the B.C. Fed convention.”

Both missed the point.

Getting cozy with the Vancouver Club is not one of the unfortunate stereotypes associated with Eby. That appearance by the wealth-taxing, lawyer-bashing attorney general was more of a case of a politician venturing into the lion’s den.

And the annual convention of the 500,000-member B.C. Federation of Labour is a somewhat more broadly based venue than the West Van yacht club, whomever is hosting.

A more apt comparison would be to Environment Minister George Heyman’s attendance at a celebratory dinner with anti-pipeline activists last January, just after he announced B.C. would restrict shipments of heavy oil from Alberta.

Not only did his government have to pull back the threat, but reporting on the appearance helped put Heyman in the activist camp himself.

Or consider how the story was played when Adrian Dix, who’d admitted forging a memo in the casino scandal, was caught without a ticket on SkyTrain.

As for Horgan, one of his vulnerabilities is a quick temper. Though he’s kept it in check lately, he made the news more than once when he lost it during his days in Opposition.

Every leader has weaknesses, some more unfortunate than others. A key political art is to turn one’s weaknesses into strengths, or failing that, to avoid reinforcing the stereotype.

Wilkinson knows very well that the NDP will indulge the class warfare theme every chance it gets.

“It’s a good way to generate stories about people who are deemed to be well off and how they are going to be kicked around a bit,” he told the chamber crowd. “That’s good politics for the NDP.”

Kicking Wilkinson around is even better politics for the New Democrats. Once more this week, he played right into their hands.

CALGARY -- It was back to the future at a United Conservative campaign rally in Calgary where leader Jason Kenney stirred up the crowd by talking about the old national energy program.

Kenney reminded supporters last night that the NEP brought in by former prime minister Pierre Trudeau in 1980 ravaged Alberta's energy industry and economy.

And he says the policies of Alberta's NDP government and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have been doing the same thing.

Kenney says Premier Rachel Notley has sold Alberta out to the federal Liberals and it is time for a bright new day under his leadership.

Notley was also in the key election battleground city, firing up her supporters at her own rally by promising to protect education and health care and promoting her plan to diversify the economy.

Notley says there is no place for right-wing extremism, racism or hate in Alberta, especially in the legislature.

She says she doesn't believe Kenney is racist, but says his party has a problem with racism.","Leaders of NDP, United Conservatives rally troops in key Calgary battleground",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/leaders-of-ndp-united-conservatives-rally-troops-in-key-calgary-battleground-1.4347230

And, ironically, the predicted slowdown is largely attributed to its new taxation measures.

article continues below

Two financial institutions released economic analyses that zeroed in on B.C.’s economy, with both projecting it will slow down significantly due to the cooling of the province’s real estate market.

Central 1 Credit Union concluded the province’s economy will have three years of weak economic growth after several years of robust annual growth of more than three-per-cent GDP.

Its deputy chief economist, Bryan Yu, said in a news release that “economic growth is being held hostage by the housing market slump, which is deeper than previously forecast.”

As a result, Central 1 is now forecasting the provincial economy will grow by just 2.2 per cent in the coming year, then 2.4 per cent in 2020 and 2.8 per cent in 2021.

TD Economics had a more pessimistic assessment, projecting B.C.’s economic growth to be just 1.4 per cent this year and two per cent next year. Again, the chief villain is the slumping real estate sector.

“B.C.’s deepening housing market slowdown is likely to put a larger damper on growth this year,” it said in its provincial economic forecast. “The province’s housing market has been the most hard-hit by the implementation of tighter rules, rising interest rates and B.C. government policy measures.”

To be sure, neither of these projected scenarios constitute being anything close to a recession, but this may spell bad news for the government’s three-year fiscal plan. The lower the economic growth, the fewer tax dollars are available. That plan projects an increase of almost $4.5 billion in tax revenue over that period.

What’s disappointing about this situation is that measures such as the speculation tax, the increase in the foreign buyers tax and the higher tax on high-end homes were supposed to make housing more affordable.

Instead, while house prices and some rents have dropped, they haven’t dropped to the point of making homes actually affordable.

So it now looks like the government’s housing policies (which do not place much emphasis on increasing the supply of housing) are not only not meeting the affordability targets, but are instead having the biggest impact at slowing down the provincial economy

Now, none of this may come back to haunt the NDP. Both financial institutions are predicting employment levels will remain high with the government’s infrastructure program considered to be providing a cushion to any slowdown.

As well, the BC Liberals continue to struggle to find their identity as an Opposition party and party leader Andrew Wilkinson has had a bad run of foot-in-mouth-itis in recent days.

But after experiencing relatively sunny days during their first 20 months in office, things may be about to get a little darker for the NDP government.

Katherine DeClerq, CTV News Toronto





The Ontario New Democratic Party is continuing to call for a public inquiry into the hiring of Toronto Police Supt. Ron Taverner as Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Commissioner after an integrity commissioner report said the process was “flawed.”

Integrity Commissioner J. David Wake launched an investigation into the hiring of Taverner following numerous complaints and accusations of political interference. The report, which was issued on Wednesday, found that Premier Doug Ford’s conduct in the recruitment process was “not improper.”

“He could not have had any improper purpose in the approval of the selection committee's recommendation on the basis of what he knew at the time,” Wake wrote.

The report did, however, raise concerns regarding communications between top civil servants about the hiring process.

The report found that Steve Orsini, the secretary of the cabinet, was in constant conversation with Ford’s Chief of Staff Dean French about where Taverner stood in the hiring process. The commissioner said that Orsini felt pressured to recommend a Ford family friend for the position.

Both Orsini and French admitted that the appointment of Taverner did not involve an independent hiring process, the report found.

""There seemed to be a tacit acknowledgment by the secretary that Mr. French was rooting for Mr. Taverner's success,” Wake wrote. “Anyone examining these messages would have serious doubts as to the fairness of the process to the other candidates.""

“This report is damning in every way and that is why it is necessary that we have a public inquiry,” Opposition Leader Andrea Horwath told reporters on Thursday. “The government took advantage of a weak process to have Mr. Ford’s best friend become the OPP commissioner and that stinks all the way around.”

Former OPP deputy commissioner Brad Blair, who was fired by the provincial government nearly three weeks ago, said that he feels the entire process was “rigged” in favour of Taverner.

Blair’s lawyer said that he is pursuing a wrongful termination proceeding against the provincial government.

“This saga is not over,” said Julian Falconer over the phone.

Taverner withdrew his name from consideration for the job earlier this month.

Chartier said the province's ongoing additions and mental health crisis needs more than what the government has put forward.

""There are 22 new [inpatient addictions] treatment beds being added but we don't have any details yet on how that will better support crystal meth addiction,"" she said, noting the treatment of meth requires a different approach from alcohol or other drugs.

""This government has had its head buried deeply in the sand when it comes to crystal meth and opioid addiction.""

Chartier said crime statistics have indicated a growing meth problem for years. Furthermore, she noted not everyone needs inpatient treatment.

""They need support in-community,"" she said. ""They need access to addictions counselors.""

Chartier also criticized the one per cent increase for community-based organizations.

""These are people who are working directly with mental health patients and they got nothing really, and they haven't gotten anything in five years,"" she said.

""Those organizations that provide frontline mental health care like crisis intervention services only have seen a three per cent increase in five years.""

She said the province planned to cut ten per cent from its CBOs in 2017, but backtracked after public outcry.

""We're playing catch up with every other jurisdiction. Every other province is moving the bar and we are chasing after them.""

Mental health patients a 'token project': activist

Advocates like Jae Blakley are also skeptical about what will actually change.

""I think putting a token bit of money into mental health at this point is just an election strategy,"" the mental health activist said. He's spent 12 years in and out of the mental health system.

""Mental health patients are a token project. It's easy to throw money at us and say things are getting better.""

In one of numerous spending announcements yesterday, the province said its seven-bed temporary mental health assessment unit at Saskatoon's Royal University Hospital will be made permanent. It's using $1.5 million for this and renaming it the Mental Health Short Stay Unit.

Blakley criticized how it's historically operated and he worries problems will persist despite the name change.

""To keep the physical space open that's one thing, but to actually operate it correctly is a totally different matter,"" he said.

Blakley said the unit was supposed to help provide people in crisis quick access to treatment. However, he said his friends have waited hours in the emergency room because they couldn't get in.

The date was announced in a statement late Wednesday evening.

It states that all NDP members in good standing as of March 18th and who reside in the Victoria federal electoral district are eligible to vote at the meeting.

The deadline for nomination candidates to submit their application packages is Wednesday, March 27th at 2 p.m. PST.

The winner will succeed current MP Murray Rankin, who announced on February 28th that he would not be running in this October’s federal election.

Rankin was first elected in a by-election in 2012, succeeding NDP MP Denise Savoie who had served since 2006.

So far the only person to confirm they will seek the nomination is Laurel Collins.

The first-term Victoria city councillor announced her candidacy on March 6th.

A time and place for the nomination meeting will be announced in the coming days.

The Liberals and Conservatives have yet to announce when their nomination meetings will be held.

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham has launched the second phase of her remake of an NDP icon, the Agricultural Land Commission.

B.C. Agriculture Minister Lana Popham has launched the second phase of her remake of an NDP icon, the Agricultural Land Commission.

In a determined push to plow under changes made since the Dave Barrett government hastily imposed the Agricultural Land Reserve in the early 1970s, Popham has introduced a new batch of legislative amendments. It’s an effort to stop what she claims is pressure from speculators, buying farmland and trying to get it sprung from the ALR so they can grow houses on it.

The latest amendments dissolve the regional ALC panels set up to bring local knowledge to the table. The whole show will again be run from Burnaby, with token regional appointees on a central politburo, sorry, commission.

When Popham proudly unveiled the amendments a couple of weeks ago, there was an awkward moment. The bill includes a new definition of “person,” changing it to a provincial or local government or their agencies. People, specifically farmers, will not be persons once the NDP-Green coalition pushes this nanny-state vision through.

It’s awkward because Bill 15 was presented the day before International Women’s Day, celebrating the 90th anniversary of the “persons case” where five pioneering women won the right to vote in Canada. In B.C., women remain persons, unless they’re farmers.

Horrible optics aside, it’s a minor change. Property owners applying to exclude land from the ALR have long had to obtain the view of their local government, to see if an exclusion fits with community plans for roads and utilities. Soon only state entities will be able to apply to remove land, if and when they see fit to judge the property owner’s wishes.

After I reported this, Popham sent me a lengthy statement, including the following:

“Over the last few years, we’ve seen people buying land in the ALR, only to turn around and immediately apply to get it pulled out of the ALR so they can develop it. This volume of applications to review has become burdensome to both local governments and the ALC, since in many cases exclusion applications are not approved as they are for development purposes.”

In other words, local governments and the ALC continue to protect farmland, as required by the “old government” legislation. I asked the ALC for its latest data on this crushing volume of speculator applications since it stopped posting archived decisions after Popham took charge.

In 2018, there was a grand total of 39 applications to remove land province-wide. One of two in the Interior region was approved. On Vancouver Island, four applications flooded in and all were refused. Same in the Kootenay region.

In the Okanagan, the commission grappled with 11 applications, turning away six. On the South Coast, there were 14, with nine refused. The numbers are even lower for 2017. The ALC annual report shows a steep decline in applications since the 1990s.

Here is current ALC staffing: A Popham-appointed chair and 18 commissioners oversee staff consisting of a CEO, director of policy and planning and director of operations. Kim Grout, the current CEO, made $185,096 plus benefits last year.

Under them are three senior policy planners, a policy planner, policy analyst and six planning officers. On the operations side, there are two co-ordinators, four compliance and enforcement officers, an office manager and six technical and support staff.

Popham intends to hire more enforcement “boots on the ground” to cope with the speculator crisis she wants you to think is happening.

More than 2,100 long-term care spaces have been opened for seniors over the last four years. But on Thursday, Premier Rachel Notley announced her government would add 2,000 more over the next five years.

That pledge came during a campaign appearance in Lethbridge, weeks after a new westside facility was announced by the Covenant Health organization. A number of nurses and seniors’ care providers joined her for the event.

“Building 2,000 new long-term care beds will improve seniors’ care, help families and give our health-care providers the support they deserve,” she said.

It will also free up beds in Alberta hospitals, she said. The cost was pegged at $170 million.

When their working years are done, Notley said Albertans deserve “a dignified and well-cared-for future.”

“That’s on the minds of many, many Albertans.”

By caring for aging people in long-term facilities, Notley said they would receive the specialized care they need – while doctors, nurses, paramedics and others at acute-care facilities would have more time to help the sick.

“My plan will ensure that the nurses, doctors and all health-care professionals that provide these critical services are well supported,” she said.

But those would not be priorities for a Jason Kenney government, she pointed out.

That would put “all these things at risk.”

“Albertans can count on me to defend and protect patient care,” she pledged.

Kenney favours American-style health care, Notley said. That would mean good care – for those who could afford it.

For Albertans who aren’t well off, “it would be devastating.”

It’s unlikely to pass — but according to these Indigenous experts, the bill serves as an important test for Doug Ford’s government","Ontario’s legislative assembly will consider a familiar question this month: How can we best respect Indigenous rights? On March 6, NDP Indigenous relations and reconciliation critic Sol Mamakwa introduced a private member’s bill — Bill 76 — which calls for laws in Ontario to be in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. On Thursday, the bill will go to second reading. If it passes, it will then head to committee. (Like the vast majority of private member’s bills, however, Bill 76 is very unlikely to pass.)



“There are numerous, needless deaths and unnecessary suffering happening in our communities that would not be acceptable anywhere in Ontario — or in Canada, for that matter,” Mamakwa says. “In the house, I always ask why they treat our people differently. That’s what this is; it’s a test for the government.” (The government did not provide comment on Bill 76 when asked by TVO.org.)



UNDRIP outlines the “minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of the Indigenous peoples,” focusing on such issues as the right to self-determination and prior and informed consent on matters related to Indigenous and treaty rights.



Stay up to date! Get Current Affairs & Documentaries email updates in your inbox every morning.

When UNDRIP was first adopted by the UN in 2007, Stephen Harper’s federal government praised it as an “aspirational document” but nonetheless voted against it. Justin Trudeau campaigned in support of it, and his government removed Canada’s objector status in 2016. But, two months later, then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould called it “unworkable” and a “political distraction to undertaking the hard work actually required to implement it back home in communities.”



Without guidance from the federal government, provinces have been left to determine their own course. British Columbia recently committed to formally legislating UNDRIP. In Ontario, many Indigenous people are skeptical of the government’s commitment to Indigenous issues. Since the June election, the Progressive Conservative government has slashed the Indigenous Culture Fund, reneged on a previous commitment to introduce Indigenous-focused curriculum updates, and merged the formerly independent Indigenous affairs cabinet portfolio with energy, northern development, and mines.



TVO.org spoke with three Indigenous experts about the importance of the bill, its chances of becoming law, and the impact its success or failure in the house would have on the relationship between Indigenous people and the province.



Scott Robertson



Scott Robertson, a lawyer and the president of the Indigenous Bar Association, hopes that the government will pass Bill 76, but he isn’t confident that will happen.



“The government of Ontario would have to take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Ontario are consistent with UNDRIP,” says Robertson. “I’m not getting the cozy feeling from Premier Ford that he would be interested in taking on that initiative or the responsibility.”



For one thing, there’s the issue of feasibility. Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act says that the federal government has authority over “Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians.” Robertson says that, while the province may indicate that it would be able to satisfy many of these requirements, they ultimately could fall under the federal government’s jurisdiction.



Specific sections, such as Article 19, could also prove problematic, he notes. Article 19 states that the Crown must “obtain [Indigenous peoples] free, prior and informed consent” on anything that affects Indigenous and treaty rights — and that could transfer a huge amount of power from the province to Indigenous people.



In situations involving resource extraction, for example, “You’d actually have to get the Indigenous group to say, ‘Yes, we approve,’” says Robertson. “Not just the consultation of showing up to a board meeting, giving some notes, some papers, and saying, ‘This is what our project will be like — hope you like it.’”



Robertson notes that, if Bill 76 fails to pass, Indigenous and treaty rights will remain protected by Section 35 of the Constitution Act (1982). “Indigenous rights are enshrined in Section 35, which is a lot more comforting than an UNDRIP document,” he says.



But, Robertson says, if the government rejects this bill, it will be signalling that it doesn’t want to help Indigenous people: “They want to create a system whereby it becomes so intolerable, [Indigenous people have to] leave the reserve and give up the rights to their land.”



Lindsay (Swooping Hawk) Kretchmer



Lindsay (Swooping Hawk) Kretchmer says that Ontario should support UNDRIP in part because of the size of the province’s Indigenous population. “Stats Canada data from 2016 put Ontario as number one in the country for overall Indigenous population,” she says. “The time to take stock of these realities is now — the bill may have implications, but doing nothing has far greater consequences.”



Kretchmer, the executive director of the Toronto Aboriginal Support Services Council and a former Indigenous affairs consultant with the city, says that if Bill 76 were to pass, it would transform current policymaking, creating a legal framework for Indigenous self-determination.



“UNDRIP would be used as the underpinnings of new laws to redress historical injustices in a manner that eradicates our contemporary challenges, allowing us to build our own path forward parallel to that of our Canadian friends,” says Kretchmer.



But she’s not optimistic about the bill’s chances, believing that it will fail “due to a longstanding, uninformed opinion on Indigenous people that evokes fear among decision-makers that we just might get one step too close to actually regaining more than a Section 35 mention.”



She is glad, though, that, at the very least, the bill will force the government to take a firm position. “It puts the current leadership in a position to make a clear choice on where they stand with Indigenous rights-based issues.”



Aylan Couchie



On February 23, artist and writer Aylan Couchie published an open letter to Doug Ford, addressing cuts to the Indigenous Culture Fund (ICF), which was created by the Liberals in 2017 to support Indigenous communities, culture, and ways of life through community-based work. “We are concerned the Ontario PC government does not realize what it is they have cut and, we fear, are looking to completely dismantle,” she wrote.



Couchie sees programs such as those funded by the ICF as critical to reconciliation because of the community work they support — language revitalization, traditional harvesting, food security — and points to Bill 76 as one way to protect them.



She believes that cuts to the ICF are counter to the spirit of UNDRIP. “ICF can be seen as Ontario’s commitment to upholding the declaration,” says Couchie. “It covers 14 different Articles, like Article 8 — how we have the right to not be ‘subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of culture.’”

If Bill 76 isn’t passed, she fears that the government will continue to roll back Indigenous funding.



“[Bill 76] is going to impact too many ministries, and Doug Ford won’t be able to make the cuts that he’s making right now,” says Couchie. “It’s not conducive to [the PCs’] end goal.”



She does, however, think that Mamakwa’s move to present Bill 76 was a smart one, regardless of the outcome. “I think the bill is mostly just to show exactly where Ford lies,” Couchie says. “I don’t think it ever had a hope in hell, and I don’t think Sol thought it had a hope in hell. I think it’s just to highlight that the government is not going to be working with Indigenous people or for Indigenous people.”

By The Canadian Press on March 19, 2019.

CALGARY – Alberta Premier Rachel Notley has called an election for April 16.

Notley asked cheering supporters standing behind her in Calgary this morning if they are ready to fight for an Alberta that benefits everyone.

A new session of the legislature began Monday with a throne speech that focused on the NDP government’s accomplishments in the last four years – from building schools, roads and hospitals to providing more supports for seniors, students and those in need.

It also criticized the former Progressive Conservative government, and said the New Democrats have been working to overcome the failures of the past.

The spring election will be the first for the United Conservative Party and its leader Jason Kenney, a federal cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper.

The United Conservatives were Kenney’s answer to unite the right, and were born out of a merger of the Alberta Tories and what was the Opposition Wildrose Party.

By law, the election had to be held by May 31.

OTTAWA - A new poll conducted by Leger for The Canadian Press suggests the governing federal Liberals have lost ground to the Conservatives over the past month.

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled after the federal budget was released Tuesday said they would vote for Justin Trudeau's Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of about three percentage points from February.

That compared with 37 per cent who said they would back the Conservatives under leader Andrew Scheer, a one-point increase from February, while 12 per cent said they would vote NDP and eight per cent the Greens.

Scheer also jumped ahead of Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister as the Tory leader got the backing of 25 per cent of respondents compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau, who has been struggling to contain damage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

As for the budget, which the Liberals are hoping will help turn the page on SNC-Lavalin, 12 per cent of respondents said it was good and 19 per cent that it was bad, but 39 per cent said they didn't really know about it.

Leger's internet-based survey, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples, was conducted March 19 and 20 using computer-assisted web-interviewing technology and heard from 1,529 Canadians who are eligible to vote and were recruited from the firm's online panel.",New Leger poll suggests federal Liberals lagging Conservatives,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/new-leger-poll-suggests-federal-liberals-lagging-conservatives-1.4345939
288,Politics,2019-03-21T17:30:00.0000000Z,"The Liberal government is pouring $135 million over six years ... The transition measures fall short of recommendations made by the former Canadian Forces ombudsman and, in some cases, those of the House of Commons veterans committee.","The Liberal government is pouring $135 million over six years into the system that attempts to smooth veterans' transition from uniforms to civilian life.

It's one of a series of relatively small measures for the veterans community contained in Finance Minister Bill Morneau's new budget — the Trudeau government's last fiscal plan before this year's election.

The transition measures fall short of recommendations made by the former Canadian Forces ombudsman and, in some cases, those of the House of Commons veterans committee.

Other initiatives in the budget include a $150 million, five-year survivors fund for veterans' spouses who married over the age of 60, and long-awaited recognition for Metis who fought in the Second World War.

Both of those plans appear to be aimed at key demographics the Liberals hope to capture in the fall election.

More significant, though, is the fact that the budget put money behind many of the transition initiatives announced last fall by Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and then-veterans minister Seamus O'Reagan.

Both the Department of National Defence and Veterans Affairs are focused on improving what has been described as a chaotic transition system — one which sometimes forces veterans to wait months for their military pensions, benefits and rehabilitation to kick in.

The budget contains a number of previously announced initiatives, including better training and a transition guide for retiring members.

What it doesn't contain is a specific reference to a personalized ""consigner service,"" which would shepherd soldiers, sailors and aircrew through the complicated system of forms, benefits and eligibility rules involved in retiring from the military.

That's something former ombudsman Gary Walbourne recommended. The federal government has promised already to turn it into a pilot program, but there's no mention of a pilot in the budget document.

Disability benefits backlog

The budget also is silent on how to resolve an enormous backlog of disability benefits applications, which was estimated at roughly 40,000 files last November.

Instead, the budget offered a series of new, relatively small initiatives to underscore what the Liberal government has done for veterans. Many veterans abandoned the Conservatives in the last election but have grown increasingly restless and disillusioned since.

Prominent among the previously-announced plans in the new budget is the upcoming implementation of the so-called pension-for-life plan — a major promise made by the Liberals in the last election.

The $3.6 billion investment was announced in the 2018 budget, with a rollout scheduled for April 1, 2019.

Among the new proposals is a $150 million, five-year survivor's fund for the spouses of veterans who married after age 60.

And as part of its reconciliation effort with the aboriginal community, Ottawa has set aside $30 million to recognize Metis veterans who fought for Canada in the Second World War.

That plan has been the subject of long, detailed negotiations with the Metis community, which has urged the federal government to move quickly because of the dwindling number of living former soldiers.",Liberals look to shore up veterans vote with transition cash,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/budget-2019-veterans-military-1.5063254

OTTAWA – With a federal election looming this fall, the Liberals and Conservatives are bracing for an ideological battle that pits the merits of balancing the books against spending on consumer confidence – and many Canadians may actually agree with both of them, a new poll suggests.

The Leger poll was conducted for The Canadian Press this week shortly after the government released its latest federal budget, which promises billions in new spending on measures like job retraining, services for seniors and incentives for first-time homebuyers.

The budget also leaves government coffers with average annual deficit of around $18 billion over the last four years – a far cry from the modest deficits and balanced 2019 books that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during the 2015 election campaign.

The Liberals argue the spending is necessary to make a real difference in the lives of Canadians, while Conservatives accuse the government of wasting money and saddling future generations with unnecessary debt.

Both messages, however, resonated with Canadians, the Leger poll suggests: while a substantial percentage of respondents agreed the Liberal deficits were bad, many also expressed support for the centrepiece spending measures featured in Tuesday’s spending blueprint.

Some 44 per cent of respondents said they believed the decision to run four years of deficits was the wrong call, while 20 per cent called it the right move and 35 per cent were not sure.

A large majority also voiced support for some big-ticket items in Tuesday’s budget, including a plan to expand high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas of Canada, which garnered the support of 76 per cent of respondents, and a suite of measures to help workers to learn new job skills, which got a thumbs-up from three quarters of those polled.

Measures in the budget designed to make it easier for more Canadian families to buy their first home got a 68 per cent approval rating, while 55 per cent cheered proposed financial incentives to foster electric-vehicle sales.

As for the budget itself, 12 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied, while 19 per cent felt the opposite. The remainder of respondents either said they didn’t know, or remained neutral – an amorphous body of swing votes the parties will no doubt be courting as the election clock ticks down to October.

“If you’re the Liberals, the clear story is to say: ‘Well, we needed to go into deficit to help the economy and do all of these great things that you agree with,'” said Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.

“The story for the Conservatives is to say: ‘It’s not right. We can’t do this, period.’ So I believe we’ll hear a lot about not necessarily the budget, but about public finances more generally in the weeks to come. And I think that will be a ballot-box question.”

Leger’s internet-based survey, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples, was conducted March 19 and 20 using computer-assisted web-interviewing technology.

It heard from 1,513 Canadians who are eligible to vote and were recruited from the firm’s online panel. The results were weighted to reflect age, gender, mother tongue, region and level of education to reflect the makeup of Canada’s population.

The poll also suggested the Liberals have been bleeding support over the past month as the government struggled to contain the damage caused by the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair.

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled said they would vote for the Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of three percentage points from February and a total loss of eight percentage points since November.

Yet while 37 per cent said they would back the Conservatives – a one-point bump from February and four-point increase since November – Bourque said most of the gain has come from voters in the West and may not translate into a big gain of seats in Parliament.

The NDP and Greens, meanwhile, saw their support increase by two points from February to 14 and 10 per cent, respectively, which Bourque said could represent trouble for the Liberals.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer also jumped ahead of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister, earning the support of 25 per cent of respondents, compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who made his debut in the House of Commons this week, stood at eight per cent while Green party Leader Elizabeth May was supported by seven per cent of respondents. People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier came in at four per cent.

The results are surprising, said Bourque: none of the leaders are as popular as their parties, which suggests that while the shine may have come off Trudeau, that popularity has yet to migrate to anyone else.

“It’s as if right now there is a bit of a void in terms of leadership,” Bourque said.

“There’s not one clear person who’s driving support like Jack Layton did in 2011, like Justin Trudeau did in 2015 â€¦ who is kind of pulling support up for their political party.”

290,,2019-03-21T02:36:00.0000000Z,"The spending blueprint says the Liberals have approved more than 33,000 projects worth ... Even more spending will flow through funds managed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The federation's president, Mayor Vicki-May Hamm of Magog, Que.,","OTTAWA — A one-time $2.2-billion windfall in the federal budget to help Canadian cities improve roads, bridges, highways and water systems won't become an annual tradition, Finance Minister Bill Morneau warned Wednesday, even in the face of problems getting the first projects off the ground.

Tuesday's multibillion-dollar top-up will double the money cities receive this year through the federal gas-tax fund, which sends money directly to municipalities each year.

The spending blueprint says the Liberals have approved more than 33,000 projects worth about $19.9 billion in federal financing under new and existing infrastructure programs, but also acknowledges spending has been slower than anticipated, including ""some jurisdictions being slower to prioritize projects.""

Morneau called out four provinces on Tuesday in explaining the Liberals' decision to use the gas-tax fund to kickstart more projects, naming Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick — provinces with conservative-minded governments that don't always co-operate readily with the federal Liberals.

Topping up the fund was the appropriate response, Morneau said Wednesday at a post-budget event in Toronto.

""We haven't been able to do exactly what we expected and that was the reason for the municipal infrastructure top-up,"" he said.

""What you shouldn't do is take this as a conclusion on how we will go forward, but what it is, is an important way for us to move forward now in getting some projects that are stalled going.""

Federal infrastructure funding is regularly subject to delays because funds only flow once receipts are filed, which causes a lag between when work occurs and money is paid out.

An internal analysis of the Liberal program pointed to several issues to explain the pace of spending: too many low-value projects requiring the same detailed review as those much larger in size and delays in getting provincial and territorial project recommendations.

Elections in Ontario and New Brunswick last year paused provincial project approvals during the campaign. There are also delays in approvals when a new government is elected — as was the case in Ontario and New Brunswick — as new office holders learn their files and review government operations.

Even more spending will flow through funds managed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The federation's president, Mayor Vicki-May Hamm of Magog, Que., said the measures are a direct response to pleas from cities to modernize their relationship with Ottawa so they don't have to rely solely on the provinces.

Under the federal Liberal government's infrastructure program, federal spending will top $186 billion over the next decade.

How successful the plan has been to date is an area of contention between the Liberals and the parliamentary budget watchdog, who most recently questioned anew whether increases in federal spending have created the jobs promised by the government.

Other investments have, according to provinces, fallen short of what was required, particularly on rural broadband internet service. Provinces had asked the Liberals to find a way for the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance work, and pressed for better co-ordination in spending to connect remote or rural communities.

The Liberals created the bank in 2017 to take $35 billion in federal financing and use it to leverage three to four times that from the private sector to help pay for major highways, bridges, and water and electrical systems. To get private money involved, projects needed to produce revenue streams — tolls, for instance. Fees for internet service are already typical, but serving remote, sparsely populated areas with high-speed lines is a financial challenge.

On Tuesday, the Liberals added a new component to the Crown agency, earmarking $1 billion over 10 years for rural broadband, but mandating the bank find at least $2 billion more in private capital for the initiative. It was part of a plan to deliver up to $6 billion over a decade to connect everyone in the country to high-speed internet by 2030.

Rural Economic Development Minister Bernadette Jordan said in an interview that federal departments, other governments, telecommunications companies and others in the private sector needed to co-ordinate work ""to make sure that we do meet those objectives.""

""We have to look at every possible way to leverage the money because this is a huge project,"" she said.

""Connecting Canada is not going to be an easy, overnight fix. We've said that from day one. But we have a plan, we know which way we need to go with it and we know we have to work together in order to achieve it.""

Tonight, on the finale of season two of TVO’s Political Blind Date, a Conservative and a Liberal stand on the Canadian-American border, and on opposing sides of this question.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, about the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which outlines what each country is obligated to do with asylum seekers arriving in each country.

Political Blind Date sets up two opposing politicians on a “date” to discuss some of the most divisive and pressing issues facing Canada. The topic of asylum seekers has become more prevalent with an increase in refugees crossing Canada’s southern border due to the hostile attitude toward immigrants percolating in the U.S. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, Chair of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee, thinks more resources should go to the processing of refugee claims. Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus, shadow minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, believes refugees shouldn’t be given more aid if they’re crossing illegally.

The two meet first for a coffee at Le Cafe in Hemmingford, Quebec. When Paul-Hus says that he might delve into French if English is insufficient for him to explain an idea, Oliphant mentions that his husband is from Rimouski. “When we’re arguing, he argues in French and I argue in English,” Oliphant says. He gestures across the table between him and Paul-Hus, and they both laugh. But will they end up arguing? Yes. Almost immediately. Oliphant takes issue with Paul-Hus describing asylum seekers’ border crossing as “illegal.” Using himself as an example, he explains that if he went into the U.S. and then came back to Canada at an “irregular border-crossing,” it would be illegal.

But, he said, “it is very clear in Canadian law and international law, that if you seek asylum on the other side, it’s not illegal.” To Paul-Hus, this is a “loophole” in the rules. He points out that the refugees are crossing from the U.S., and should have applied for refugee status there instead of Canada.

According to the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the country where they first arrive. Conservatives want to change the agreement with the U.S. to allow Canada to send those claiming refugee status after crossing at irregular locations back to the U.S.

Rob Oliphant, Liberal MP from Toronto, talks with his date, Pierre Paul-Hus, Conservative MP from Quebec and Shadow Minister for Public Safety, while standing at the north side of Roxham Road, the Quebec location where the majority of border crossings have happened over the last two years for irregular asylum claimants.

The filibuster was triggered in protest of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s refusal to offer a blanket waiver of privilege and confidentiality that ex-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould has claimed is necessary if she is to fully tell her side of the story.

WATCH: Philpott says there’s ‘much more’ to the SNC-Lavalin affair

Late Thursday afternoon, Conservatives believed they had caught the Liberals shorthanded, with not enough of them ready to vote to pass one item.

Since spending votes are confidence measures, the government would have fallen had any of the spending measures been defeated.

Liberals quickly flooded into the chamber, male MPs hastily doing up their neckties for decorum.

READ MORE: MPs continue voting marathon as Conservative protest shutdown of SNC-Lavalin probe

Assistant deputy speaker Anthony Rota, an Ontario Liberal then in the chair, cited a Commons rule to say that it’s not the speaker’s duty to police whether members were in the chamber at the critical time to be eligible to vote. Liberals eventually carried the motion, as opposition MPs heckled.

The marathon voting session also came as a former Liberal minister fanned the flames of the SNC-Lavalin fire.

Jane Philpott, who resigned early this month as Treasury Board president, told Maclean’s that she raised concerns with Trudeau, during a Jan. 6 discussion about an imminent cabinet shuffle, that Wilson-Raybould was being moved out of Justice because of her refusal to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the prime minister a month before the public knew about it. Why would I have felt that there was a reason why Minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?” she said.

“My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story.”

But Philpott actually appears to already be free to talk about that Jan. 6 conversation with Trudeau: The government has waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality for last fall, when Wilson-Raybould alleges she was improperly pressured, until Jan. 14, when she was moved to the Veterans Affairs portfolio. The waiver applies not just to Wilson-Raybould but to “any persons who directly participated in discussions with her” relating to the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for alleged corrupt practices in Libya.

That waiver allowed Wilson-Raybould to testify for nearly four hours before the House of Commons justice committee.

WATCH: Trudeau confirms he spoke with Philpott and JWR about new roles

Trudeau rejected Thursday the opposition parties’ contention, echoed by Philpott, that a broader waiver is required to cover the period between Jan. 14 and Wilson-Raybould’s resignation from cabinet a month later.

“It was extremely important that the former attorney general be allowed to share completely her perspectives, her experiences on this issue, and that is what she was able to do,” he said after an announcement in Mississauga, pumping up the latest budget’s promise to invest $2.2 billion more in municipal infrastructure projects.

“The issue at question is the issue of pressure around the Lavalin issue while she was attorney general and she got to speak fully to that.”

Trudeau also gave his version of the Jan. 6 conversation with Philpott, during which he informed her she would be moving to Treasury Board and that Wilson-Raybould would be taking her place at Indigenous Services. His version echoed the testimony of his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, to the justice committee.

“She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision and I told her no, it was not,” Trudeau said. “She then mentioned it might be a challenge for Jody Wilson-Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services and I asked her for her help, which she gladly offered to give, in explaining to Jody Wilson-Raybould how exciting this job was and what a great thing it would be for her to have that role.”

Wilson-Raybould ultimately turned down the move to Indigenous Services and Trudeau moved her instead to Veterans Affairs. She resigned a month later.

READ MORE: Conservatives lay groundwork for marathon filibuster after Liberals shut down SNC-Lavalin probe

Neither Philpott nor Wilson-Raybould voted Wednesday on a Conservative motion calling for a broader waiver. Nor did they speak during debate on the motion in the Commons, where anything they said would have been protected by parliamentary privilege.

While she conceded speaking up in the Commons is “technically possible,” Philpott told Maclean’s that debates wouldn’t give the ex-ministers the “hours of time” needed to fully tell their stories.

Since any vote involving government spending is automatically a confidence vote, Liberals were required to be out in force throughout the all-night, all-day voting marathon to avoid potential defeat of the government. But although Philpott and Wilson-Raybould remain members of the Liberal caucus, they were exempted from having to show up, in the interests of not exacerbating tensions with their sleep-deprived colleagues.

WATCH: Singh — If Trudeau has nothing to hide, why won’t he let Philpott speak?

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel construed that as further evidence of a “culture of intimidation” against the former ministers who’ve “been put under a gag order” by Trudeau.

“I find it really difficult to watch as two strong female colleagues continue to be shut down,” she said.

However, Trudeau continued to try to paper over tensions among Liberal caucus members, even after Philpott’s intervention added fuel to the fire. He continued to say the ex-ministers are welcome to remain in the Liberal caucus, despite their criticisms of him just seven months before an election.

While they disagree over the SNC-Lavalin matter, Trudeau said all Liberals are united on the “big things” like investing in the middle class, fighting climate change and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pounced on Philpott’s interview to bolster his call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“If the prime minister and the Liberal government has nothing to hide, why don’t they waive all solicitor-client privilege and call for all witnesses to testify and answer all questions that Canadians have. If they have nothing to hide, why won’t they do that?” Singh said.

The filibuster resulted in the cancellation of Thursday’s question period and scheduled debate on government bills. Committee meetings were also cancelled as the filibuster continued into the night with no end in sight.

Only a couple of dozen opposition MPs needed to be in the chamber at one time so they had plenty of opportunity to grab a few hours of sleep.

The Liberals, however, were forced to keep most of their MPs in the chamber at all times, to avoid being caught short on any of the votes.

Most Liberal MPs had laptops on their desks and appeared to be doing work, reading or, in some cases, watching movies. A few read books. One, Toronto-area MP Jennifer O’Connell, sat with a blanket wrapped around her legs. They were periodically allowed to leave the chamber to catch a few winks on cots, as reinforcements replaced them.

The Conservatives periodically offered to end the vote marathon, if Trudeau would agree to waive confidentiality and let Wilson-Raybould and all others involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair testify fully. The Liberals rejected each offer and the voting resumed.","House of Commons voting marathon ends, after Liberals nearly lost a confidence motion",Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5083783/house-of-commons-voting-marathon-liberals-confidence/

OTTAWA – The Liberals will happily run on their economic record in the upcoming federal election campaign, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday, despite the billions of dollars they’ve added to the national debt.

At an afternoon stop outside a housing development in Ottawa’s eastern suburbs, touting the measures in the new federal budget to make homes more affordable, Trudeau gave what sounded much like a stump speech, talking about “historic investments” in Canadians – getting there after dismissing Conservatives’ complaints that the Liberals should have to answer more for the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“What eats away at the Conservatives the most is that our approach is working,” he said. “Over the past three years, 900,000 Canadians created new jobs. Over the past three years, we’ve seen the lowest employment in 40 years. And we’ve see 825,000 Canadians, including 300,000 kids, lifted out of poverty because of measures this government is taking. And in this budget we just put forward yesterday, from easier access to home-ownership, to support for students, to money directly for seniors, to investments in broadband and high-speed internet access right across the country, we are responding to the priorities that Canadians have. The Conservatives have no plan for the economy, that’s why they want to talk about anything else. We are going to stay focused on delivering for Canadians, as we are today.”

While Trudeau emphasizes what all the government spending has done, the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer say it’s a spree funded by borrowing against the future.

Scheer had given a public speech to his caucus members in Ottawa earlier in the day, portraying Trudeau’s Liberals as a big-spending government with nothing but disdain for the idea of balanced budgets.

During the 2015 campaign, Trudeau warned that a Liberal government would initially run modest deficits, but would balance the books by 2019. That promise went out the window Tuesday with a budget that projects of 2019-20 deficit of $19.8 billion.

“During the televised leaders’ debate, he said this: ‘I am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way we always have… We will balance the budget in 2019,’ ” Scheer said to the laughter of his colleagues. “Canadians who don’t have family fortunes like him know … that you can’t borrow your way out of debt and you can’t make other people pay for your mistakes.”

Trudeau acknowledged that his government has been borrowing heavily but he emphasized that although the national debt keeps growing, the economy is growing at about the same rate, so the burden isn’t getting harder to bear.

“Canadians need to know that our projections are sustainable,” he said,

Finance Minister Bill Morneau made his own post-budget sales effort Wednesday, defending the Liberal strategy of investing in consumer confidence.

The budget Morneau tabled Tuesday in the House of Commons showcased several measures aimed at helping more would-be homebuyers get into the housing market for the first time; that’s what he focused on in a morning speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

Under the new measures, the government is proposing to pick up five per cent of a mortgage on the purchase of an existing home for households that earn under $120,000 and have been approved for a mortgage no more than four times their income – or 10 per cent, if the house is new, in an attempt to spur construction. The Liberals will also let first-time buyers, and a few others in special circumstances, take up to $35,000 from their tax-free retirement savings accounts to spend on homes.

But Morneau is insisting the government has also taken prudent steps to ensure that additional demand in markets like Toronto and Vancouver won’t result in higher prices.

“When we think about the overall homebuyer market, we have roughly half a million home purchases a year, but 100,000 of them are first-time homebuyers,” Morneau told a news conference after a morning speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

“We’re talking about (adding) 20, maybe 30, maybe 40,000 new families, which is really important to those families, but we’ve done the modelling to show (it’s) not an issue around changing demand dynamics.”

In particular, Morneau picked out three other measures in the budget that he said are aimed at preventing a spike in home prices: A Canada Revenue Agency crackdown on real-estate money-laundering, $10 billion in affordable rental construction financing and a $300-million contest of sorts to challenge municipalities to come up with creative solutions to adding housing stock.

“All these measures to increase supply, which is fundamentally what we need in markets like Toronto and Vancouver, and then very targeted issues around how we can help first-time homebuyers,” he said. “We’ve been carefully able to help those families without changing the overall dynamics.”

Between trade agreements already in effect — with the European Union and Pacific Rim trading partners — and the still-unratified rewrite of the North American free trade agreement, dairy farmers have said they believe at least ten per cent of Canada's dairy market has been given up to foreign suppliers going forward.

Poultry and egg farmers are also at risk of losing significant shares of their supply-managed markets to American producers if the new NAFTA proceeds.

Now, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's 2019 budget is pledging up to $3.9 billion for an income-protection program for those sectors, along with a measure to protect the value of farmers' quota investments.

""There's recognition that harm has been done. And that those revenue losses will be ongoing in the dairy industry,"" said David Wiens, who represents Manitoba on the board of the Dairy Farmers of Canada.

While this prospect of help is welcome, ""to be in a situation where we're having to receive compensation from the government would not have been the choice of any dairy farmer in the country.""

Dairy concessions were the price Canada had to pay to be part of all three of these trade deals. Wiens said farmers were asked to ""take one for the team"" for the sake of the country's overall economic growth.

The protected market they're losing is unlikely to return.

""We've taken a look at some of those things that are causing people to worry,"" Morneau told reporters earlier in the day, framing the overall approach of his final budget before October's election.

These sectors definitely were worried. Farmers and processors urged the Liberals to commit to compensation comparable to what Stephen Harper's government announced when Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations concluded in the middle of the 2015 federal election campaign.

The Conservatives said at the time that Harper's cabinet had approved a compensation package in advance — one worth up to $4.3 billion if necessary, depending on the real losses the industry sustained over the deal's first decade.

But when the Liberals took power, they claimed this spending was never finalized. Nothing close to a compensation package of that magnitude has been offered since.

Limited 'innovation' funds

One aspect of the Conservative plan — funding to help farmers and processors compete by upgrading their equipment and improving their efficiency — was replicated when the Liberals announced $350 million to offset the threat of competition from European cheese imports after the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) was signed in the fall of 2016.

That funding was completely distributed almost immediately after it became available.

When Canada's concessions in the new NAFTA deal were finalized late last year, the Liberals launched a consultation process with the dairy industry to work out what additional help would be needed to keep the industry sustainable over the longer term.

Officials said Tuesday that process isn't over. In the meantime, this federal budget shows what's being offered to counter the negative effects of both CETA and the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), both of which took effect at the end of the year:

Up to $2.15 billion in ""support to sustain the incomes of eligible dairy, poultry and egg farmers"" that will be ""available in the coming years to deal with income losses associated with these agreements.""

A $1.5 billion ""quota value guarantee program"" to protect the value of investments made by farmers if they are forced to sell their quota at reduced prices because new foreign competition has undermined the value of quota in what is now a less-protected market.

It's the same approach the Tories took to trade compensation: one pool of funds available for demonstrated income losses and to help rural communities with the transition, and a second pool to protect farmers and commercial lenders (who may have financed farm investments) from reduced quota values.

""The structure of it is very similar, almost identical,"" said Rachel Curran, who was Stephen Harper's director of policy at the time. ""It looks like the aid package for farmers was essentially lifted from the 2015 campaign announcement.""

Farmers wait 3 years for similar offer

Answering a reporter's question during a press briefing ahead of the budget's release, Morneau acknowledged in French that he was continuing the approach of the previous government. He said the exact details haven't been worked out.

Budget documents offer no timelines or criteria for these funds.The Finance Department also says work continues on addressing the needs of processors, who aren't covered by this funding for producers.

The government is also studying the ""potential future impacts"" of the new NAFTA.

The revised North American trade deal not only gives up a share of the Canadian dairy market, it also implements export caps and requires the dismantling of Canada's competitive price class for dairy ingredients — two concessions that may threaten the industry's future more than new competition from imported products.

Wiens said dairy farmers didn't know this budget measure was coming, and they haven't really seen enough details to comment fully.

The timeline for this assistance may be key: ""If this is paid out over many years it will have less of an impact than if it's paid out aggressively,"" he said.

Marie-Claude Bibeau, who represents a riding in Quebec's Eastern Townships that includes many dairy farmers, became Canada's first female agriculture minister in the March 1 cabinet shuffle. She said she's very ""close to the producers in Quebec"" and it's a ""huge privilege"" to represent their interests. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)

Wiens said farmers will work with whatever the government of the day is, and don't need to get into whatever politics may be playing out. But ""if the government declares support for our industry and for supply management, then we expect that it should be followed up with the reality of their actions.""

Pre-empting election threats?

The Conservatives' $4.3 billion package from 2015 was criticized as overly-generous, Curran said. ""It was expected, at that point, that actual losses [from the TPP] would not be anywhere near those numbers.""

The concessions made in the new NAFTA are larger than those Canada made to get the former TPP, she noted.

But offering $3.9 billion without real details? ""This looks like almost a last-minute insertion,"" Curran said, calling it a ""defensive cover-off.""

""It's almost certainly a response to supply-managed farmers, who are well-organized, and well-funded, and they have no hesitation running advertising campaigns against the government or criticizing the government if they feel that they're not being properly supported,"" she said.

""This was almost certainly put in place to forestall that in advance of the 2019 election. Guaranteed.""",Liberals dust off Conservative playbook for a worried dairy sector,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/budget-2019-dairy-compensation-1.5063245

It is not the Opposition ...,"The Liberals have dropped their shiny new pre-election budget, and most have had time to digest it, analyzing if there is anything special inside for them.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was hoping the festivities would distract from Jody Wilson-Raybould and the SNC-Lavalin scandal after the Liberal-majority justice committee ruled against letting the former attorney general speak again, effectively shutting down the committee investigating the issue.

However, it appears once the pomp and circumstance of the budget have faded, Canadians will still want answers that only Wilson-Raybould and the PM can provide.

In other words, this is not going away.

LISTEN: Scott says “it’s not the opposition and the media keeping this story alive, It’s a lost and fumbling Liberal Government”

One of those questions is why the former attorney general was fired, although the reason appears to be because she wouldn’t give SNC-Lavalin the get-out-of-jail-free card the Liberals wanted in order to secure their votes in Quebec.

Another is whether current Attorney General David Lametti will do what Wilson-Raybould refused to do and grant the Liberals their wish.

Liberal supporters have said it is the Opposition and those who simply dislike Trudeau who are keeping this story alive for political gain.

I would disagree with that.

It is the Liberals who are keeping this story alive by failing to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak and by continuing to drag out the narrative on a daily basis with their shabby handling of the affair.

Delaying the justice committee’s decision not to let Wilson-Raybould speak until the day of the budget and the sudden early retirement of Michael Wernick, the supposedly unbiased clerk of the Privy Council (who got to testify twice), are just two of the latest examples of keeping this story in the headlines.

It’s not just the average Canadian who is losing confidence in Trudeau — it continues within his own party.

It is not the Opposition and the media who are keeping this story alive; it is a lost and fumbling Liberal government again shooting itself in the foot.

Jane Philpott told Maclean's magazine in an explosive interview published Thursday that ""there's much more to the story that should be told"" about the controversy, but she isn't in a position to elaborate because of ""an attempt to shut down the story"" by the prime minister and his inner circle.

She quit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet earlier this month, saying the government's handling of SNC-Lavalin controversy made circumstances ""untenable"" for her to continue as a minister. Her resignation came weeks after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould left cabinet.

""I made the very difficult decision to step down because my conscience demanded,"" she said in the Maclean's interview.

Watch: PM says ex-ministers still welcome in caucus despite criticism on SNC-Lavalin

Trudeau was asked about Philpott's comments during an infrastructure announcement in Mississauga. He was pressed to defend why Philpott and Wilson-Raybould remain members of the Liberal caucus.

""We recognize that a diversity of perspectives, experiences, opinions, is extraordinarily important if we're going to fully reflect the extraordinary diversity of Canadians,"" he said.

The prime minister told reporters that their intentions to stay in caucus and to run under the Liberal banner in the upcoming election is an indication of their faith in the party.

""We are pleased to have a diversity of voices in the Liberal party.""

Trudeau has been under weeks of pressure from the Opposition to release the former attorney general from remaining solicitor-client privileges and cabinet confidence to allow her to speak about events that happened after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14.

Partial restrictions were waived after the prime minister issued an Order in Council right before Wilson-Raybould's justice committee testimony in February. The order allowed her to speak about what she alleged were ""consistent and sustained"" efforts of political interference to help SNC-Lavalin avoid trial when she was attorney general.

Trudeau has repeatedly said that issuing the order was ""unprecedented"" and satisfactory for the bounds of the justice committee study about what happened up until the January shuffle.

The Opposition are not convinced, and gave notice of 257 motions Wednesday to protest what Tories have called a ""gag order"" over Wilson-Raybould. MP voted throughout the night, taking turns sleeping.

Because the votes relate to government funding, an election would be triggered if Liberals lose even one.

Liberal MP suggests Philpott 'dangling something' is inappropriate

Neither Philpott or Wilson-Raybould were present during the overnight marathon votes. Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an Ontario MP who quit the Liberal caucus earlier in the day, participated in the voting session from her new seat in the back row.

The Canadian Press reported Wednesday that Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were given permission to skip the all-night voting marathon to avoid potential confrontations by sleep-deprived MPs, according to an anonymous source.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel raised the point with reporters Thursday.

""I find it really difficult to watch as two strong female colleagues continue to be shut down when I watch their male colleagues putting words in their mouth,"" she said, calling the prime minister a ""fake feminist.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh again called for a public inquiry to investigate allegations of political interference between the Prime Minister's Office and the former attorney general.

Watch: As MPs pull all-nighter, Philpott breathes fresh life into SNC-Lavalin scandal

Echoing a point Philpott raised in her interview, Singh said if Liberal have nothing to hide, then ""why don't they waive solicitor client privilege."" Philpott herself said Canadians deserve to learn the truth, he said.

Singh claimed, ""If the prime minister was cooperative, the public inquiry would not take very long.""

Some Liberal MPs were more frank than others about the latest layer in the SNC-Lavalin affair — and challenge to caucus morale in an election year.

Toronto MP Adam Vaughan told reporters on Parliament Hill that he wasn't bothered by Philpott's comments. ""She still supports the party, that's good enough for me,"" he said.

Philpott told Maclean's that ""of course"" she wants a Liberal government, adding she doesn't want to see Andrew Scheer become prime minister after the October election.

Vaughan suggested that the Liberal party is ""big enough and strong enough"" to withstand its current internal challenges.

Another Toronto MP, Julie Dzerowicz, said despite Philpott's latest comments, she still regards the former cabinet minister as a valuable colleague and mentor.

I understand from an opposition standpoint that this is a political gift that keeps on giving. Liberal MP John McKay

Despite neither Philpott or Wilson-Raybould having explicitly said in public remarks that they have confidence in Trudeau, Dzerowicz said: ""I think you don't stay in the party if you don't believe in the prime minister.""

Scarborough—Guildwood MP John McKay was borderline critical of Philpott's latest remarks.

""I understand from an opposition standpoint that this is a political gift that keeps on giving,"" he said. Referencing Philpott's interview, he said if someone believes in cabinet confidence, ""then you can't say something like, 'Well there's more to come.'""

He called Philpott and Wilson-Raybould ""really talented and able people"" who were well-liked up until the SNC-Lavalin affair engulfed the government's focus.

When asked if he thought the controversy will pose as a ""significant"" issue in the upcoming issue, he said he wasn't sure. McKay said Liberal MPs are awakening to the reality that each new layer to the controversy increases the risk of ""political consequences.""

""It's one thing to take a hit from the opposition or circumstances beyond caucus or cabinet,"" he said. ""It's another thing to take political hits from your own people""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian cabinet minister, who had quit in protest over the government's handling of a corruption scandal, said she and others had more to say about the matter, indicating more pain to come for embattled Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, last year to ensure that construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

""There's much more to the story that should be told,"" former treasury board president, Jane Philpott, told Macleans' magazine in an interview released on Thursday.

""I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,"" she said. Philpott added that she and Wilson-Raybould had more to say but did not elaborate further. Philpott, a close political ally of Wilson-Raybould, quit on March 4.

Trudeau has denied any political interference to protect SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial.

The crisis may threaten Trudeau's reelection chances in the upcoming October vote. Polls show Trudeau's center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win the election, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

As well as the two ministers, the affair has claimed Trudeau's closest political aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy. A Liberal legislator who backed Wilson-Raybould quit on Wednesday to sit as an independent.

Trudeau suffered further potential embarrassment on Thursday when SNC-Lavalin Chief Executive Neil Bruce denied he had told government officials that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if the firm was found guilty of offering bribes to Libyan officials.

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the firm, which wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

""Until we are able to put this behind us, it's pretty difficult to grow our Canadian workforce,"" Bruce told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday.

Asked whether he had mentioned a specific number of jobs that could be at risk, he replied: ""No, we never gave a number.""

A court conviction would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal government contracts for 10 years.

Bruce added that if the company's share price continued to suffer, it might become a takeover target. He played down comments by officials that the company might move abroad.

SNC-Lavalin's headquarters are in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats in the October election to retain a majority government.

Trudeau has dismissed calls for a public inquiry, noting the House of Commons justice committee was probing the matter. That committee - dominated by Liberal legislators - shut down its inquiry on Tuesday, saying no more action was needed.

In protest, the Conservatives forced the House to sit through the night on Wednesday casting votes on hundreds of confidence motions. The marathon continued into Thursday.

""We'll keep fighting and we hope Canadians join us in this cause and raise their voices,"" Conservative legislator Michelle Rempel told reporters.

OTTAWA — The federal Liberals are promising to spend more than $250 million to revamp the body Canadians turn to with disputes over access to federal benefits, partially restoring the system that existed before the Conservatives created the Social Security Tribunal.

The tribunal hears appeals of government decisions on things like eligibility for employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan that, before 2013, were overseen by four separate bodies.

Key changes included cutting the number of people hearing most cases from three to one, and replacing part-time hearing officials in many places with full-time staff in fewer locations.

In an interview this week, Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said the government will bring back the three-person hearings for the first layer of benefit appeals — in a body separate from the tribunal — and retain the tribunal's single arbitrator for the second, and final, layer.

He said the changes respond to rare agreement from labour and employer groups that some sort of return to the three-panel hearing system was needed.

Tuesday's federal budget proposes spending $253.8 million over five years, beginning in April, to make the system easier to navigate and shorten decision times. Details about when changes will happen are to be rolled out later.

""So despite the fact that it was not in my mandate letter, we did feel that it was important to transform the system and there will, therefore, be a return to a tripartite system — more fair, more respectful, faster, (and) more collaborative.""

When the Conservatives unveiled their plans to create the Social Security Tribunal, they argued it would streamline the appeals process and save millions of dollars.

A report last year from consulting firm KPMG estimated the tribunal saved federal coffers about $22.6 million a year, but waits for decisions also shot up as the tribunal was undermanned and overwhelmed with cases and didn't have a proper transition plan.

Average timelines for decisions increased from approximately 44 days to more than 200, and in the worst case, average wait times of 884 days for decisions on CPP disability benefits that were highlighted in a critical 2016 auditor general's report.

What the Liberals heard in closed-door meetings and consultations with stakeholders, labour and employers groups, as well as experts over the last three years were calls for a return to the system as it existed before the tribunal's creation.

At the same time, the KPMG report warned against that, arguing the tribunal could be improved, and some who worked in the system felt things were much better than what existed before.

Allowing the House justice committee to hear more testimony, and ...","In my mind’s eye, I like to imagine the Prime Minister, in his office with his staff, planning out how the next few days are going to finally get the Liberals back on track.

After a rough few weeks, the PM enthuses, they have a plan! There’s going to be a budget, presumably full of pre-election goodies, something to help shore up their fading poll numbers.

And Anne McLellan, former Liberal MP and cabinet minister, is going to do a review of some of the issues raised in the SNC-Lavalin controversy. It’s going to be amazing. Just what this government needs.

And then the Prime Minister glances at his phone, reads a text message and frowns. “Wernick did what?!” he mumbles.

He quit, that’s what. Michael Wernick, the now-outgoing clerk of the Privacy Council (the most senior civil servant in Ottawa) announced that, due to his recent central role in the controversy, he’ll be retiring. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Wernick wrote, “It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties. … It is essential that Canadians continue to see their world leading public service as non-partisan and there to provide excellent services to Canadians and the governments they elect.”

For those keeping score at home, this is the fourth resignation thus far in the ongoing scandal that the Prime Minister insists is all just a wee breakdown in communication.

I was mostly kidding above, for the record. I’m sure the Prime Minister’s Office wasn’t exactly floored by Wernick’s announcement, nor would they have been stunned by the declaration of the Liberal majority on the House justice committee that there’s no reason to invite Jody Wilson-Raybould back to testify again. That was me just indulging my sense of whimsy. But what is true is that as much as the Liberals would like the SNC-Lavalin affair to be over, they seem weirdly determined to keep it alive.

The Liberals can’t be pleased that the SNC-Lavalin affair has now lasted as long as a Biblical wandering-of-the-desert. And it’s not that they haven’t tried to move on. It’s just that they don’t seem to be very good at it. They’d better hope that the budget absolutely knocks it out of the park with the voters, because the opposition isn’t going to give up on this.

And the Liberals themselves haven’t exactly set things up for a rapid conclusion. The five members of the House justice committee, having decided that 13 hours of testimony is the absolute maximum that Canadians could bear, seem set to shut their investigation down. (That’s three hours and fifteen minutes of testimony per resignation to date.) In their letter to the committee chair, the majority wrote, “As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings.”

On Tuesday, the committee’s Liberal majority, voted, as expected, to suspend its probe, leading to both opposition parties pledging to do all they could to get answers. Andrew Scheer even mused about finding ways to delay the budget speech. So that’s going well.

And then there’s the matter of Anne McLellan, the former Liberal deputy prime minister, MP and herself a former minister of justice and attorney general. The Prime Minister announced on Monday that McLellan will report by June 30 on whether the justice minister and attorney general job should be split. This isn’t the first time the government has turned to McLellan; she prepared an exhaustive, very serious and almost unreadably boring report on cannabis reform ahead of last October’s legalization. No doubt she’ll produce something similar this time. It will be well researched, thoughtful and helpful.

It will not, in any way, answer the questions Canadians have about the government’s recent conduct.

That’s a feature, to be clear, not a bug. The Prime Minister, much like the Liberals on the justice committee, want this to be over. They want to move on, to the budget first, and then whatever comes after that. Appointing McLellan is supposed to signal that it’s time to get back to work and focus on the future.

The problem, of course, is that while McLellan might be a great person to write a report, she’s a terrible person to put this affair to bed. It’s not just that she’s a partisan Liberal by virtue of her past positions. She remains active in the party. And as a general rule, if you want to convince Canadians that you’re taking an issue seriously and seeking an independent voice, don’t go to someone who has to immediately back out of the fundraiser they’re hosting for your party in just a few days.

It’s bizarre. Forty days (and counting) is probably testing the outer limits of the average Canadian’s patience with any scandal. Allowing the House justice committee to hear more testimony, and appointing someone more neutral to draft up recommendations, could well have crushed what remaining interest they have.

But the Liberals didn’t do that. Instead, they’re going out of their way to limit how much more Canadians will learn. Funny, that.

Masse accuses Liberals of leaving the auto sector in the dust

The Trudeau Liberals are being accused of abandoning the Canadian auto industry.

Windsor West MP Brian Masse said the $5,000 rebate for electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles announced in Tuesday’s budget does nothing for the Windsor-built Chrysler Pacifica. He said the federal budget is subsidizing foreign-built vehicles.

“I was shocked and appalled in the 2019 Liberal federal budget that provides subsidies to purchase vehicles built in other countries,” Masse said in a news release Wednesday night.

Masse said the budget has no new money for investment in the auto sector or the supply chain to take advantage of new opportunities in Detroit and establishes another corporate tax giveaway that does nothing to strengthen Canadian producers or support autoworkers.

He said the incentive only applies to vehicles priced below $45,000 and the only Canadian built vehicle that could be considered, is the Chrysler Pacifica Plug-in Hybrid, which has a list price of $51,000. Masse added all the other vehicles available in the market are foreign built.

Masse wrote the Minister of Innovation requesting a working group to ensure Ontario-based suppliers can take advantage of Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s recently announced $6.5 billion investment in five facilities in the Detroit area to build and assemble new SUV and truck models.

The new funding includes more than $15-million over five years to create a Canadian Centre for Energy Information, an apparent effort to redress what experts have long called a woeful lack of understanding of the country’s energy landscape and efforts to combat climate change.

But despite the spending bump, some critics are already worrying the money falls short of what Canada needs to fix its data deficit, which often leaves the country lagging peers such as Britain and the United States in the availability of core statistics.

Tuesday’s budget commitments come amid a continuing Globe and Mail series looking at Canada’s chronic shortage of public data. For example, we don’t know the annual marriage and divorce rate, how far Canadians drive, how many long-term-care homes exist in the country or how much doctors are paid by drug companies, among dozens of other blind spots.

In response to The Globe’s reporting, the Liberal government declined to make any firm commitments to fill these data gaps, even while acknowledging that Canada has many.

The Globe and Mail has uncovered myriad data deficits, culled from dozens of interviews, research reports, government documents, international searches and feedback from our own newsroom. Here’s a list of what we found, which we’ll be adding to as the investigation continues. Order by: Sorted | Latest All

Other Show 10 more * By data gap, we mean areas at the national level in which data are not collected or readily accessible. These could be areas where there is no ability to compare across provinces or cities, where the existing information is years out of date, published infrequently or not comparable with prior years.

Still, a hub for energy stats is something academics have been urging for years. The budget promises about $3-million a year for Natural Resources Canada to collaborate with Statistics Canada on a website that will compile energy numbers from across levels of government, and look to collect missing data.

Nicholas Rivers, a Canada Research Chair in climate and energy policy at the University of Ottawa, says such gaps pockmark the field. Numbers on how much gasoline is sold in various provinces are often out of date and full of unexplained holes, for example.

But while Mr. Rivers approved of the government’s proposed data hub in principle, he said its budget appears inadequate to the challenge facing the country. He noted that, in 2016, the U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration had annual funding of US$122-million, or an order of magnitude more than what Ottawa is providing for the new centre.

Three million dollars ""is not nothing, but it’s not transformative either,” he said. “I would be disappointed if this is just a reorganization of existing resources with a new website.”

There are similar concerns around the $1.5-million over five years that has been allocated to collecting more standardized data around gender equality.

“It is great that the federal government is beginning to shine a light on the lack of data to inform gender-aware policy-making,” said Sarah Kaplan, director of the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. “But the funding is likely to be highly inadequate to develop the kinds of data required. It is unclear to me if standardizing frameworks is as important as identifying what new types of data need to be collected or what new analyses need to be performed.”

The budget contains several other passels of money for data collection by different ministries, including around housing supply and organ donation. It promises $79-million over seven years for education, health and other surveys in Indigenous communities, to be led by the First Nations Information Governance Centre (FNIGC) – a commitment the group’s executive director Jonathan Dewar applauded.

“As a First Nations-led non-profit committed to helping First Nations achieve data sovereignty, FNIGC welcomes the announcement in the federal budget of permanent and ongoing funding for our current survey efforts,” he said.

Still, relatively little new money in this budget goes directly to Statscan – despite previous Liberal efforts to restore funding to the national statistical agency that had been cut by Stephen Harper’s Conservatives.

“It’s a disappointment,” said Wayne Smith, former chief statistician at Statscan, adding that he had expected to see more reinvestment in the agency’s base funding. “There’s not going to be a fundamental change in the availability of data without new funding.”

The Liberals will also let first-time buyers, and a few others in special circumstances, take ...","OTTAWA — Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau kicked off his post-budget sales effort Wednesday, defending his Liberal government's strategy of investing in consumer confidence and deflecting suggestions that it could lead to higher home prices in overheated urban markets.

The budget Morneau tabled Tuesday in the House of Commons, his last before Canadian voters go to the polls this fall, showcased several measures aimed at helping more would-be homebuyers get into the housing market for the first time.

Under the new measures, the government is proposing to pick up five per cent of a mortgage on the purchase of an existing home for households that earn under $120,000 and have been approved for a mortgage no more than four times their income — or 10 per cent, if the house is new, in an attempt to spur construction. The Liberals will also let first-time buyers, and a few others in special circumstances, take up to $35,000 from their tax-free retirement savings accounts to spend on homes.

But Morneau is insisting the government has also taken prudent steps to ensure that additional demand in markets like Toronto and Vancouver won't result in higher prices.

""When we think about the overall homebuyer market, we have roughly half a million home purchases a year, but 100,000 of them are first-time homebuyers,"" Morneau told a news conference after a speech to the Empire Club in Toronto.

""We're talking about (adding) 20, maybe 30, maybe 40,000 new families, which is really important to those families, but we've done the modelling to show (it's) not an issue around changing demand dynamics.""

In particular, Morneau singled out three other measures in the budget that he said are aimed at preventing a spike in home prices: A Canada Revenue Agency crackdown on real-estate money-laundering, $10 billion in affordable rental construction financing and a $300-million contest of sorts to challenge municipalities to come up with creative solutions to adding housing stock.

""All these measures to increase supply, which is fundamentally what we need in markets like Toronto and Vancouver, and then very targeted issues around how we can help first-time homebuyers,"" he said. ""We've been carefully able to help those families without changing the overall dynamics.""

Even as Morneau spoke, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was addressing caucus members in Ottawa, portraying Justin Trudeau's Liberals as a big-spending government with nothing but disdain for the idea of balanced budgets.

During the 2015 campaign, Trudeau warned that a Liberal government would initially run modest deficits, but would balance the books by 2019. That promise went out the window Tuesday with a budget that projects of 2019-20 deficit of $19.8 billion.

""During the televised leaders' debate, he said this: 'I am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way we always have... We will balance the budget in 2019,'"" Scheer said to the laughter of his caucus colleagues. ""Canadians who don't have family fortunes like him know ... that you can't borrow your way out of debt and you can't make other people pay for your mistakes.""

Morneau, however, made it clear the Liberals believe they can justify that decision on the campaign trail.

""First and foremost, we want to make sure we make the investments that give people the optimism for the future, and that is our first priority,"" he said. ""That approach has clearly worked — we have a much better situation for Canadians with better job numbers and fewer people struggling to get by than we had three and a half years ago; we're going to keep investing in that way.""

Rather than focusing on the raw deficit, the Liberals prefer to talk about Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio, or what the finance minister described Wednesday as ""debt as a function of our economy"" — a lens that puts a much rosier tinge on the federal books.

""We have, as I've mentioned, the lowest amount of debt as a function of our economy among G7 countries; that amount of debt as a function of our economy has been reduced each year we've been in office,"" Morneau said.

""That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately.""

On the housing measures in the budget, Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Wednesday that they could be seen as an extension of the National Housing Strategy, which deals with demand as well as supply. The strategy is a 10-year, $40-billion plan.

Duclos said the caps on the proposed mortgage-sharing program should send a signal to developers “to invest in the type of homes that first-time homebuyers are willing and interested and able to buy.""

There are already providers in the country offering these “shared-equity mortgages,” including developers that take a stake in units to reduce monthly mortgage costs for owners. When a unit is sold for a profit, they share in the gains; the opposite is true when a unit is sold for a loss.

When federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau finally got to his feet in the Commons Tuesday, it was to rain money down on crucial blocks of voters that helped the Liberals form the government four years ago, and who they’ll need again to win this fall.

The big picture was a $23-billion deluge of new spending that — by the time it fell across a multitude of worthy causes and recipients — landed mostly as a soft sprinkling. The budget spreads the largesse a mile wide and an inch deep.

It is by definition an election budget. There won’t be another before Canadians vote in October. But does it do enough to arrest the Liberals’ current slide down the polls greased by the SNC-Lavalin affair? That, of course, remains to be seen.

The Liberals have more going for them than this budget, and it starts with the Conservatives. When things look bleakest for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government, the Conservatives can be counted on to rush their breathless leader Andrew Scheer in front of a bank of microphones and, almost magically, Justin starts looking pretty good again.

Or they hatch a scheme to draw attention to themselves and give Canadians pause, like their display Tuesday concurrent with the budget speech.

Earlier Tuesday, the opposition Conservatives and NDP lost their attempt to reignite the SNC-Lavalin fire by having the justice committee recall star witness Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Perhaps because they are more practised in the art of accepting defeat graciously, the NDP did.

The Conservatives, on the other hand, took their tantrum into the Commons. They whooped, hollered and pounded their desks to drown out the finance minister and when they grew tired of annoying every Canadian who tuned in the CBC to hear the budget, with typical juvenile disinterest they left the House.

If you’re wondering what would possess a political party to turn itself into a circus sideshow when it wants to be seen as the government-in-waiting, the Conservatives will likely tell you it seemed like a good idea at the time. So did slipping on socks in case it gets chilly later, but still going with the sandals.

But back to the budget the Conservatives ignored, except to claim it was somehow part of the SNC-Lavalin “coverup,” a line their leader dutifully delivered and kept his record of overreaching on the affair perfect.

For fiscal conservatives, there’s lots to dislike in this budget and the Conservatives will eventually get around to not liking $20-billion deficits, which is exactly where the Liberals want them.

If you don’t like the deficit, what would you cut, is the question the budget is designed to force the Conservatives to answer, and to make it easier for them it’s multiple choice.

There’s help for millennials who are ready but not able to buy their first home; big bucks for municipal infrastructure; a new job skills training plan; lower interest on student loans; more money for low-income seniors; subsidies for farmers hurt by the new North America trade deal; and a total of more than $8 billion over five years to improve the living conditions of Indigenous people and advance the reconciliation agenda.

The housing initiatives, along with some tentative steps toward a national pharmacare program, take a bite out of the NDP’s lunch.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh immediately said both of those budget initiatives are far too timid to address the needs of Canadians. That’s fine with Liberals. With the New Democrats stuck in the mid-teens in national polls, the Liberals know they don’t need to do much to hang on to the progressive voters they won over in 2015. If their disagreement with the NDP boils down to a matter of degree, Liberals know that most of those voters will stick with them, if only to avert the risk of a Conservative government.

The government is billing this budget as a remedy for the anxiety Canadians are feeling about the future.

The budget states: “To facilitate internal trade, the Government intends to remove the federal requirement that alcohol moving from one province to another be sold or consigned to a provincial liquor authority. Provinces and territories would continue to be able to regulate the sale and distribution of alcohol within their boundaries.”

Derek From, staff lawyer at the Canadian Constitution Foundation, tells CTVNews.ca that although “the devil is in the details” the proposal “sounds very promising.”

At present, the prohibition-era Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act states that liquor can’t cross provincial boundaries “except such as has been purchased by or on behalf of, and that is consigned to Her Majesty or the executive government of, the province into which it is being imported.”

This is likely the law the Liberals are planning to change, according to From.

“Best case scenario is a restaurant in downtown Toronto that wants to have access to a really nice wine in B.C., but it’s not on the shelf in any of the stores in Ontario” will be able to “just get online and order it and have it directly shipped to them,” he said.

Dan Paszkowski, president of the Canadian Vintners Association, says he believes the Liberals intend to let consumers order wines from other provinces directly to their homes, rather than going through a provincial government agency like Ontario’s LCBO or Quebec’s SAQ.

“If you ordered a case of wine from British Columbia it (currently) would have to go through the LCBO,” he told CTV’s Power Play. “With this, you wouldn’t have to go through the LCBO -- and hopefully avoid the tax.”

From said he believes the case of Gerard Comeau, whom the CCF defended at the Supreme Court of Canada, brought the interprovincial trade barriers to the public’s attention.

Comeau was fined $292.40 in 2012 for transporting several cases of beer and some liquor into New Brunswick from Quebec. He fought the ticket all the way to the supreme court and lost. The court said that provinces have the right to incidentally burden free trade with laws that have other valid purposes like protecting health or safety.

From said the change would be a win for producers and consumers. “There’s no one who doesn’t benefit,” he said.

Am I the only one asking why the federal Liberals continue to pander to Canadian dairy farmers (the majority of whom are in Quebec and Ontario)?

In addition to a quarter-billion-dollar fund allotted in 2016, the new budget gives yet another $3.65 billion to feed this “forever at the trough” cartel. That’s about $4 billion that is little more than a payment of political patronage to a cohort whose products Canadians are forced (by virtue of the supply management system) to pay exorbitant prices for.

Why does the federal government continue to support a dairy cartel by protecting their high prices, by paying cartel members billions (as in the current budget) every time we sign a trade deal to minimally increase dairy imports and even by allowing the dairy major processors to control and profit from the majority of (duty-free) dairy imports from the new trade partners?

As Canadians take time to prepare their income-tax returns, they might pause a minute or two to consider how the Liberal government spends their tax dollars.

But maybe it’s just me.

Is that what happened? Canadians need to know.","I am not seeking re-election this fall. Representing Victoria has been exhilarating — constituents never hesitate to express their views. And they have been especially concerned about what appears to be political interference in the administration of our criminal justice system.

I have been the vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Until recently, our committee functioned well. A spirit of collegiality infused our deliberations. Our reports regularly contained unanimous recommendations. However, all that changed with our study into allegations of attempted interference with the former attorney-general’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified that she experienced “consistent and sustained pressure” to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. And that pressure appears to have emanated from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Clerk of the Privy Council and from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself. Sadly, the Liberals on the committee confirmed on Tuesday that they are not interested in finding out what happened: they pushed through a motion to end our study. No other witnesses, including Wilson-Raybould, will be able to speak.

It is difficult to overstate how serious this is. The former attorney-general testified that veiled threats were made to browbeat her to take into account partisan political considerations in deciding whether a criminal prosecution should proceed. And when she refused to relent, she was removed from her position. This would be contrary to the rule-of-law principle, something that is enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Is that what happened? Canadians need to know.

Wilson-Raybould made clear that she still had crucial evidence to provide but was prohibited from speaking about why she resigned from cabinet. Three times I asked the committee to invite her to return and be permitted by the prime minister to speak to contradictory testimony given by Trudeau’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and — until he resigned on Monday — the senior public servant in Canada, Michael Wernick. I also moved that all those implicated in her testimony appear. These motions were all defeated by the Liberal majority.

So now there can be doubt: The Liberals are not interested in finding out what happened. Instead, their only goal seems to be containing the political fallout. Although the prime minister always says that the committee is master of its own procedure, Canadians can now see that the Liberals are being controlled. The prime minister has repeatedly lauded our committee as the place where answers can be found — now we know this isn’t true.

I was truly disheartened to have a front-row seat at this political theatre. I watched the Liberals clumsily cherry-pick witnesses and adjourn an emergency meeting on a whim. All of this culminated in their feeble attempt to use budget day as a fig leaf to conceal the truth.

Words like “cover up” are no longer rhetorical.

The Liberals’ partisanship, the lack of transparency and the dismissive tone applied to the serious allegations should give all Canadians pause. After all, two highly respected cabinet ministers — Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott — have quit the cabinet over this issue.

I have tried to keep an open mind, to be nonpartisan and to seek the truth for Canadians. Yet I have been stonewalled by Liberal colleagues more concerned with damage control than determining whether there was inappropriate political interference. The NDP has called for a public inquiry. Now that the Justice Committee has failed utterly to do its job, that call is even more urgent.

Speaking the day after the document was released, Kitchen said the budget was an example of the government trying to get people to look at shiny objects “by flashing money all over the place.”

article continues below

He was particularly critical of the deficit, which is approaching $20 billion, and he sees no plan by the government to reduce it.

Kitchen also doesn’t see anything in the document specifically for Souris-Moose Mountain.

“The budget doesn’t help our coal workers, it doesn’t help our power workers, it doesn’t help our farmers and it doesn’t help our oil and gas,” said Kitchen. “The only talk for oil gas was about money spent on consultations for pipelines. No money actually for a pipeline.”

He also said there was no money for farmers looking to get their crops in the ground. Kitchen claimed the word “farmers” was only used 18 times in the 461-page document.

The budget does have money for dairy, egg and poultry farmers who lose money because of Canada's recent free-trade agreements, with $2.15 billion over the coming years for supply-managed farmers.

There is also money for pork farmers affected by African swine fever.

There was also minimal spending in the budget for the 10 recommendations from the Task Force on Just Transition for Canadian Coal Power Workers and Communities, which were released last week.

“This budget basically looked at possibly three of them, and in those three, one was a re-announcement of money that was in last year’s budget … put forward for some information centres in Alberta.”

There will be a considerable amount of money needed for skills training and pension bridging in communities affected by the phase-out of coal power, he said.

There could be some additional money coming to communities through gas tax funding.

Kitchen believes the Liberals are using the budget to try to deflect from the SNC-Lavalin scandal that broke in February.

“They’re trying to change the channel, and basically put out money here, there and everywhere, and as they do that, they distract voters with their own money,” said Kitchen. “We have put forward plans, and as we roll towards the election, we will continue to add more parts to the agenda.”",Kitchen critical of federal Liberals budget,Estevan Mercury,https://www.estevanmercury.ca/news/regional/kitchen-critical-of-federal-liberals-budget-1.23671465
309,World,2019-03-21T08:00:00.0000000Z,The Canadian Forces has 540 soldiers in Latvia and leads a NATO battlegroup there. They have been in Latvia since mid-2017 and the Liberal government says they will remain there until 2023.,"The Canadian government has added its voice to condemning an annual parade held in Latvia to honour members of the Nazi SS, warning it opposes such events glorifying Adolf Hitler’s regime.

Around 1,000 people marched in the parade in Riga on March 16 to honour the Latvian SS divisions which fought for the Nazis in the Second World War. Some in the parade wore swastikas and other Nazi insignias.

The parade has been controversial for decades, with the United Nations, European Parliament and various politicians raising concerns about event while Jewish groups have called on Latvia to put a halt to the gathering.

Amy Mills, a spokeswoman for Global Affairs Canada, said the Canadian government seeks to promote tolerance and respect for human rights. “Canada is strongly opposed to the glorification of Nazism and all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, intolerance and extremism,” Mills said. ”That is why we condemn the parade to commemorate the Latvian SS Brigade held in Latvia on March 16th.”

“We do not tolerate antisemitism of any form, at any time, or in any place and are deeply concerned about new and resurgent forms of antisemitism and discrimination worldwide, rooted in a misguided belief that diversity is a threat,” she added.

Mills said Canada’s close relationship with Latvia includes discussions on the development of an “inclusive Latvia.”

“Every country must come to grips with difficult periods in its past,” she added.

The Canadian Forces has 540 soldiers in Latvia and leads a NATO battlegroup there. They have been in Latvia since mid-2017 and the Liberal government says they will remain there until 2023.

Hitler ordered the creation of the Latvian SS divisions in 1943, with the initial core of the force made up of members of Latvian units such as the Arajs Kommando, which participated in the murder of 26,000 Jews. Other Latvians were conscripted to join the force.

Some members of the Latvian SS Division were among the last hold-outs of Hitler’s regime, defending parts of Berlin during the final days of fighting in the Second World War.

The Latvian government has defended the parade, noting that “16 March is not an official remembrance day, and people, on their own private initiative, pay their respects to the fallen soldiers.”

The Latvian government also has on its website a 14-page document that argues Russian “disinformation” is behind efforts to paint the gathering in an unfavorable light.

“The Latvian Legion as a military formation has no relation to the Holocaust or war crimes,” the document from Latvian historians noted.

The document did, however, acknowledge that some members who served in the Latvian SS units were tried after the war for their participation in the Holocaust but suggests those killings of innocent people were done before they joined the SS formation.

The Embassy of Latvia in Canada has also pushed back against criticism of members of the Latvian SS units and the annual parade. It recently labelled a Ottawa Citizen commentary describing the participation of Latvians in the SS division and the Holocaust as a “threat to democracy in the world.”

“One must study history in order to understand the truth,” the embassy added in a tweet.

The Latvian historians state 80 to 85 per cent of those Latvians who served in the SS division were conscripted and had strong anti-German sentiments. Many Latvians see those who fought in the SS unit as heroes since they battled the Soviets. The Soviet Union, at the time, was allied with the U.S., Britain, Canada and other nations who formed an alliance to defeat Nazi Germany and the nations that supported Hitler.

B’nai Brith Canada has also raised concerns about the parade and other events in Latvia. In the summer of 2018 B’nai Brith Canada’s chief executive officer Michael Mostyn called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to use his trip to Latvia that year to push back against that country’s glorification of Nazi collaborators as well as attempts to deny the nation’s role in the Holocaust. “We must challenge all those who distort the historical record on governments, military units or organizations that fought with, supported or sympathized with the Nazis during World War II,” Mostyn wrote to Trudeau. “This includes government leaders who acquiesce in, or fail to condemn, a process of Nazi glorification that amounts to Holocaust distortion.”

In 2014 the Israeli government raised concerns about a musical being performed in Latvia that celebrated the life of Nazi war criminal Herbert Cukurs. Cukurs was a key member in the Arajs Kommando and was known as the “Butcher of Riga.” A number of Holocaust survivors have directly linked Cukurs to the murder of Jews. Cukurs is a national hero in Latvia.

Concerns have also been raised about similar events in other nations. In late April 2018 more than 50 members of the U.S. Congress condemned Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to glorify those Ukrainians who collaborated with the Nazis. The letter, signed by both Republicans and Democrats, outlined concerns about ongoing ceremonies to glorify leaders of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army as well as 14th SS Galizien Division.

In 2018 the Trudeau government removed a number of Russian diplomats from Canada, citing their efforts that outed Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s Ukrainian-born grandfather, Michael Chomiak, as a Nazi collaborator. Trudeau said the Russians were “sharing scurrilous stories” about Freeland on social media.

Chomiak edited a newspaper for the Nazis which included anti-Semitic essays and cartoons as well as articles highlighting the need for Ukrainians to join the SS. The Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust, which has copies of Chomiak’s publication in its archives, describes it as a “collaborator” newspaper.

After a $5.6 billion ...","Quebec continues to swim in cash, and the Coalition Avenir Quebec government found itself in the enviable position Thursday of being able to spend lavishly in its first budget, using billions left over by its Liberal predecessors. After a $5.6 billion-surplus in the previous fiscal year, Finance Minister Eric Girard’s 2019-20 budget increases overall spending by 5 per cent, pays down debt and begins phasing out an unpopular daycare fee increase imposed by the Liberals. Girard projects that Quebec will end the fiscal year with a $2.5-billion surplus, the province’s fifth consecutive year without a deficit. The budget contains a pessimistic note, however, as the province’s economic outlook is set to darken with lower growth and a labour shortage that risks being aggravated by the new government’s immigration policy. Economic growth is forecast at 1.8 per cent in 2019 and 1.5 per cent in 2020, down from 2.3 per cent in 2018. “This is the last budget with room to manoeuvre,” said Liberal finance critic Carlos Leitao, whose four preceding years as finance minister helped the province balance its books.

Even Girard began his remarks to reporters Thursday acknowledging that the Liberals left the province’s books in good shape, though he credited “generous” federal transfers and the strong global economy instead of his predecessor. Leitao said “federal transfers helped, but the biggest component was indeed, our own revenues that were much higher than expected because the economy was functioning well and employment was high.” Total revenues for the coming fiscal year are forecast at $115.6 billion, including $24.9 billion in federal transfers. Leitao said the current government is going to have budget troubles after this fiscal year if it doesn’t get spending under control.

Despite widespread labour shortages across the province and an aging population, Premier Francois Legault is moving ahead with a 20-per-cent reduction in immigration in 2019. Girard’s budget includes measures to soften the blow, such as tax credits to encourage seniors to stay in the workforce and money for immigrants to find jobs that meet their skills. The Legault government has justified the immigration cuts by saying too many newcomers are failing to integrate into Quebec society and find work that matches their skills. Girard told reporters Thursday the reduction in annual immigration will help solve the problem of labour shortages across the province, not make it worse. He said any reduction is “temporary” and will serve to “improve all our programs.” When the programs improve, he argued, Quebec will increase the number of annual immigrants and they will be better integrated into the workforce. The budget includes $730 million over five years to “promote better integration” of immigrants. Girard said that cash envelope includes $146 million for “a personalized program for every immigrant in this province.” Details about the personalized services will be announced at a later date, he said.

Girard’s budget follows through on election promises to invest more in education and health, portfolios that will benefit from spending increases of 5.1 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively, in 2019-20. There are no income tax reductions, but roughly 140,000 families will pay less beginning this year for childcare. The Liberals introduced additional fees for daycare spots tied to family income. Households making less than $50,000 a year currently pay $8.25 a day, per child, while a family making $200,000 pays more than $22 a day, per child. The Coalition’s new plan reduces all additional contributions for middle-class and wealthier families and by 2022, every Quebec family, regardless of income, will pay roughly $9 a day. The budget also allocates $200 million in 2019-20 toward reducing school tax rates, part of a three-year initiative to establish a single rate across the province. Quebec’s economic health has led to its debt burden being the lowest in 20 years. The province’s gross debt in 2019 stands at roughly $200 billion, or 46.1 per cent of gross domestic product. That is still the second-highest percentage in Canada, after Newfoundland and Labrador. The budget also addresses Legault’s policy on corporate head offices, a sensitive issue in a province that has seen many company headquarters leave Montreal over the decades. The government plans to spend $1 billion to help “strategic businesses” and to retain head offices. Girard said “the program wasn’t designed for SNC-Lavalin,” but it could be used to keep the embattled company in Montreal. Observers say the engineering and construction giant could be at risk of takeover, in part because of an upcoming criminal trial on corruption charges. Girard said Quebec needs to give itself the means to buy shares in companies the province considers important to the economy. “I have been the treasurer of the National Bank of Canada,” Girard told reporters, about his former employer with its headquarters in Montreal. “When you have a head office on your territory this is where the decisions are made. It’s important and we want to support that.”",Quebec tables fifth consecutive balanced budget using billions left over from Liberals,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/03/21/quebec-tables-fifth-consecutive-balanced-budget-using-billions-left-over-from-liberals.html

Five new ways to save on your taxes in the Federal Budget Liberals leave themselves little wiggle room in the event of a ...,"In a move that appears to target some of the country’s highest earners in the corporate sector, the Liberal government will introduce a new measure that will limit the tax-deductible amount on employee stock option plans to just $200,000 from the current uncapped amount.

The new rule, however, will apply only to “large, long-established, mature firms,” according to the budget document.

Startups and “emerging Canadian businesses” will be exempt from the rule, in order to help businesses that might not have the means to attract top talent due to profitability and cash flow issues.

Stock options that have been exercised are effectively taxed at half of an individual’s personal income tax rate. They are used by many companies to compensate top-level executives that are in a high tax bracket.

For instance, if an employee is granted 100,000 in options at a price of $50 and in two years, that share price has gone up to $70, the employee who exercises her options will reap a benefit of $2 million ($20 x 100,000). Under the current system, that employee is eligible to claim a tax deduction on $1 million of the benefit.

Now, regardless of how many shares an employee of an established firm is awarded, or how much the share price goes up, only $200,000 in employee stock option grants will receive tax-preferred treatment.

“The idea is to take away some of the advantages that high-income earners currently enjoy, and introduce more tax symmetry into the system,” said Carmela Pallotto, tax partner at auditing firm KPMG.

In 2017, 2,330 individuals earning over $1 million claimed approximately $1.3 billion in employee stock option deductions. By contrast, 20,140 individuals with an income of less than $200,000 claimed just $120 million in stock option deductions, or six per cent of the aggregate amount.

“When examining the evidence, it is clear that the employee stock option deduction is highly regressive,” the budget stated.

“The government does not believe that employee stock options should be used as a tax-preferred method of compensation of executives of large, mature companies.”

More details about the measure, including when it comes into effect, will be announced next summer.

Some tax experts have raised concerns about what is meant by “large, long-established and mature firms.”

“What is really unclear to me right now, is who is a mature company? Who is a start-up? The government has to clarify this differentiation and make sure it is done fairly,” Bruce Ball, vice-president of taxation at Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, said.

Ball also questioned whether this new system would be competitive when compared to stock option deduction incentives in other countries. The government is claiming that this new stock option tax treatment is a move that is “aligned” with the United States.

One of the other caveats outlined by the Liberals in the imposition of the stock option deduction cap is that it would not apply retroactively, meaning that current employees of legacy companies with handsome stock option compensation packages will not be affected.

“To me, that raises the question that if a company grants options tomorrow, can they potentially grandfathered? Some companies may immediately start thinking about what they can do to accelerate granting options,” KPMG’s Pallotto said.

The stock option deduction cap is in fact, not a new proposal by the Liberals. In the fall of 2015, Finance Minister Bill Morneau floated the idea of a $100,000 stock option deduction cap, but decided against implementing it at the time.

The Liberals claim that their efforts to improve the “fairness of the tax system” over the last three years has enabled the government to recoup $3 billion in revenue, which they say has been reinvested in tax reductions and benefits geared towards the middle class.

MIAMI – Canadian qualifier Felix Auger-Aliassime rallied for a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 win over fellow qualifier Casper Ruud of Norway in a first-round match at the Miami Open on Thursday.

The 18-year-old from Montreal notched six breaks after a slow start and won 78 per cent of his points on first serve, as compared to just 62 per cent for Ruud.

Auger-Aliassime has improved his ranking to 57th in the world after a string of strong results in recent weeks, but still had to qualify because his ranking wasn’t high enough at the entry deadline.

The Canadian will face Marton Fucsovics of Hungary in the second round.

Auger-Aliassime will be joined in the second round by No. 12 seed Milos Raonic of Thornhill, Ont., and No. 20 seed Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., who received first-round byes.

On the women’s side, 18-year-old Bianca Andreescu of Mississauga, Ont., was facing Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania in a first-round match on Thursday.

It was Andreescu’s first match since completing an improbable run to the BNP Paribas Open title on Sunday in Indian Wells, Calif.

The company had very recently confirmed ...","Nearly everyone now knows the story of how Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, has alleged that she was unduly pressured by Trudeau and other senior officials to offer a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Trudeau knew all this yet still interfered so strongly with the SNC-Lavalin case, it makes a lot of sense to think that he was only doing so, to protect his political interests.",SNC-Lavalin Scam Was Never About Saving Canadian Jobs,Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13606-snc-lavalin-scam-was-never-about-saving-canadian-jobs.html

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “thumbing his nose” at Canadians, and said the official Opposition would use “every tool available to us” to hold the government accountable in Parliament.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is slated to deliver his budget speech at 4 p.m. in the House of Commons, but Scheer repeatedly sidestepped questions about what, if anything, the Opposition could or would do to delay the presentation.

Scheer called the government’s budget “a political prop” in its “unprecedented cover-up” of the affair that has rocked the Liberal cabinet and prompted Trudeau’s top adviser and the country’s most senior public servant to resign.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs unsuccessfully pressed the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday to recall former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould so she could shed more light on the simmering controversy.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin finds itself at the centre of a national political storm over allegations prime ministerial aides crossed a line in leaning on Wilson-Raybould to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs say Canadians need to hear more about the affair.

“What happened today is absolutely outrageous,” said Conservative committee member Michael Cooper.

“If there was ever evidence needed that Liberal MPs on the justice committee are agents of the prime minister, doing the work of the prime minister to cover-up the prime minister’s misdeeds, then one need only look at what happened at this meeting today where the Liberals have shut down the process.”

Liberals on the justice committee wrote to the chairman, fellow Liberal Anthony Housefather, this week to say the committee had done its job and should move on to other business.

“As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings,” says the letter. “Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all rules and laws were followed. Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.”

Liberal committee member Randy Boissonault reiterated the contents of the letter following the meeting, saying Tuesday’s session was the 10th in five weeks, amounting to 13 hours of testimony given by 10 witnesses.

“We have heard from many of the key players in this matter,” he said.

The Liberal members tabled a motion Tuesday calling for the committee to begin a study of the rise of hate crimes in Canada.

They say the federal ethics commissioner, who has launched a probe of the SNC-Lavalin matter, is best suited to investigate the political controversy.

They also note former justice minister Anne McLellan has been appointed to explore the relationship between the government and the minister of justice, who plays a second role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

But the opposition would have none of it.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said the committee should hold town-hall meetings on SNC-Lavalin and hear from Canadians about the affair.

Wilson-Raybould has a right to reply to other witnesses including Gerald Butts, the former top adviser to Trudeau, Raitt said in objecting to the Liberal effort to move on.

“They’re controlling what is being said, they’re controlling who is being heard from, they’re controlling whether or not we study a topic. This is really egregious and absolutely shameful.”

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin called it “yet another effort to change the channel” by the government.

SNC-Lavalin faces legal trouble over allegations it paid millions of dollars in bribes to obtain government business in Libya. The company unsuccessfully pressed the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a “remediation agreement,” a legal means of holding an organization to account for wrongdoing without a formal finding of guilt.

The director told SNC-Lavalin in October that negotiating a remediation agreement would be inappropriate in this particular case.

Wilson-Raybould has told the justice committee she was relentlessly pressured to ensure the Montreal engineering giant was invited to negotiate an agreement. She was shuffled from the justice portfolio in January, becoming veterans affairs minister.

Trudeau has denied that any undue pressure was placed on Wilson-Raybould.

She has testified at the justice committee for nearly four hours, but has indicated there is more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Butts, once considered Trudeau’s right-hand man, quit his job as principal secretary, saying he did not want to be a distraction from the government’s agenda. In addition, Jane Philpott left cabinet over the government’s handling of the controversy.

The SNC-Lavalin affair claimed its fourth resignation Monday as Michael Wernick announced he will step down as the country’s top public servant, having concluded he’s lost the trust of opposition parties.

Canada, Public Goods • March 22, 2019 • Dudley Paul

Education Minister Lisa Thompson, walked up to the podium at the Ontario Science Centre on Friday to tell Ontarians about her plan for education. But first, she took a shot at the Liberal Party. Liberal “ideology” she claimed, got it wrong on education from the “social experiment” of the 2015 sexual education curriculum to Discovery Math. It was “not a moment too soon” she said, that the government of Doug Ford stepped in to set Ontario schools on a new “sustainable path.”



Sustainable for whom?

Let’s face it, Ontario schools sinking under twenty years of Liberal and Tory cuts and underfunding are in for something much worse.

Here’s an outline of what Ms. Thompson is planning.

Sexual Education

During the election last May, the so-called “sex-ed curriculum” had to go, as far as the Tories were concerned. Doug Ford said the Liberals had introduced a “sex curriculum based on ideology.” Once elected, he immediately shut it down and even introduced a “snitch line” so people could call and rat out teachers if they taught the banned curriculum.

Turns out it was only an election ploy, after all. Ms. Thompson isn’t going to do much to change the curriculum. It will introduce the idea of consent in grades 2 and 3 and kids will still learn about their body parts in grade 1. But she’ll push gender identity to grade 8 since younger boys and girls are still considered to be too young to learn that there are a variety of families in the community, including those with two moms or two dads, one mom, one dad and so on.

She has introduced an opt-out plan for parents who don’t want their children to learn about certain topics. This was already in place, so she didn’t introduce anything.

Curriculum of Indigenous Peoples

Curriculum writing for Indigenous peoples’ history was one of the first things the Ford government stopped last summer when it sent home the writing team of native people from across the province who were supposed to develop it. It’s now somehow reappeared ready for a May release – though, as recently as September, the Ministry wasn’t planning to recall the writing team. So, file this one under the category: Believe it when you see it.

Math

From a government that gave up $3-billion in potential funds from a cap and trade agreement for greenhouse gases, it’s rich that Ms. Thompson wants to introduce financial literacy in the classroom as part of the Ministry’s new math strategy. Mind you, it’s already threaded through the existing math curriculum as part of its practical applications and the minister wasn’t providing many details about how things are going to be different. The Tories are also going to introduce Ontario students to “back to basics” math. There’s no mention of what that means or how they are going to do it.

Ms. Thompson plans to have teachers spend more time on Science Technology Engineering and Math, (STEM) though she didn’t go into any detail. Again, it’s already taught throughout the Science curriculum, though the backgrounder to her announcement mentions a grade 10 career studies course geared to STEM in industry.

Banning Cell Phones

You know a government is up to something, when it sets out to distract people with non-issues like banning cell phones. School boards already have strategies to keep them out of classrooms when they’re just going to distract kids. Ryan Bird, spokesperson for the Toronto District School Board (TDSB), says that the board encourages the use of technology like smartphones in the classrooms. It “might make sense in one classroom and not in another.” That’s why decisions to ban them depend on circumstances at each TDSB school. The same is true at the Toronto Catholic Board. Principals and teachers are quite capable of making the call.

Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO)

Having just appointed failed PC candidate Cameron Montgomery to head EQAO at a salary of $140,000 per year (previous stipend was about $5,000 per year) it’s no surprise that the Ministry won’t be doing the right thing and dumping the testing agency, which has for so long misrepresented skills of students across the province.

What’s interesting here though is that the government wants to the EQAO to delve into more personal areas than reading, writing and math: “transferrable skills like collaboration, problem solving and citizenship.” The research group People for Education, with backing from the Liberals, has been pushing this bad idea for some time. It’s called “Measuring What Matters,” and is based on the illusion that qualities like compassion, social responsibility, reflection and collaboration may be distilled into bullet points and assessed in some valid way. Put that idea into the hands of a business-driven Tory government and it takes on an even more sinister meaning.

But, here’s that part that must have motivated Lisa Thompson to show up for an 8:30 a.m. announcement. This is where we get into lowering expectations and cutting education.

Hiring Practices

Too many young teachers she explained, have been passed over for jobs because hiring prioritizes seniority not skills – something that she’s going to change. It’s just not true. Ontario regulation 274/12 does outline rules for seniority, but it’s also clear about the interview process and required qualifications. Nonetheless, seniority matters to education workers of all kinds who don’t want their careers decided by whether or not some school board administrator likes them or not.

And this from a government blazing new trails for cronyism. See EQAO above.

Are Ms. Thompson and her boss getting ready to take on the unions representing teachers and education workers?

E-Learning

Starting in 2021 the Ministry will phase in the requirement that students go online to take four out of the 30 credits they need to get their Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). The press backgrounder said this is because the government is “committed to modernizing education and supporting students and families in innovative ways to enhance their success.” Really? How does sitting alone in front of a computer, enhance anything?

How will the Ministry or school boards monitor learning? What will happen to students who can’t afford up-to-date computers? There wasn’t any information about that.

Let’s just read this as the Ministry wanting to cut teachers by putting kids online, not in classrooms. Maybe this is the way, the Ford government plans to handle the school repair backlog.

Skilled Trades

There’s already a programme called Specialist High Skills Majors for grade 11 and 12 students who might be interested in “apprenticeship training, college, university or the workplace.” They can get credits toward their diploma while earning industry certifications and skills.

Ms. Thompson managed to keep a straight face when she proclaimed that the Liberals were “elitist” focusing only on university preparation. Then she went on to introduce this programme as her own. She might as well say that the Tories are “for the people.”

To underscore such cynicism, you only have to remember that just a few weeks ago the Ford government made it more expensive for students to attend post-secondary schools

Class Size

This is the big one:

Kindergarten to grade 3 class size caps will remain the same. The school board average class size for these grades will be the same. All day kindergarten will continue. This is most likely the result of parent groups pushing back hard after Minister Thompson mused about doing away with class size caps.

Grades 4 to 8 will have 1 more student on average per class.

Secondary schools’ average class size will jump from 22 to 28. Since this is negotiated locally by the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation (OSSTF), the Ministry simply cut funds to the school boards to support a ratio of 1 teacher for every 28 students not 1 for 22.

How many teachers will be lost? According to Lisa Thompson, “not one teacher will lose their job (sic).”

She doesn’t mention attrition – retirements, people looking for other work and so on. So, the real figure, according to OSSTF President Harvey Bischoff, looks more like 3,630 teaching jobs lost to education across the province – 800 to 1 000 here in Toronto. NDP education critic Marit Stiles estimates that in 4 years Ontario will have 10,000 less teachers and other educators working with students across the province.

Funding

The Local Priorities Fund established in 2017 is gone. It came out of labour negotiations to provide $325.4-million (2018 figures) for more special education staff to help kids with special needs. According to an April 2017 memo from the assistant deputy minister in charge of finance, it would provide 875 special education teachers cross the province along with up to 1,800 education workers (2017 figures).

Cutting this program is bizarre. The Ministry is pushing kids on the autism spectrum into the schools on April 1. True, they’re getting the $12,300 every child gets to attend school. But, there’s no sign of stable money for the future and given these students’ massive need for support, principals and teachers are left scrambling to cope with the changes. By cutting this special fund for kids, it just makes a bad situation worse.

The Cost Adjustment Allocation is gone as well. It was supposed to provide supplemental funding for education workers, but the Ministry has downloaded that task to school boards. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Ontario estimates this to be a loss of $63.6-million.

The Human Resource Transition Supplement that also came from the 2017 negotiated settlements to help school boards meet the resulting staffing changes, is also history. That’s another $10-million gone, according to CUPE.

By Ms. Thompson’s own reckoning, there will be a 1 per cent cut to the education budget – that comes to $250-million dollars. Over 4 years that sort of cut could add up to $1-billion – that’s the 4 per cent slice the Tories were talking about three months ago.

Let’s not forget the $25-million cut to Education Program – Other (EP-O) funds back in January. Then there’s the matter of $16-billion in repairs that schools need to keep operating properly. No mention of those items anywhere in Ms. Thompson’s announcement.

Look at this mess and you might recall that night a few weeks ago when Doug Ford’s Tories fed themselves a $1,250 a plate dinner and raised $4-million for the party in one evening. It was furious parents and educators on one side of the line, well-off Tories seeking a place at the trough on the other – epitomising narcissism and greed.

This is the result of that massive egotism – destruction dressed up as concern for children and hypocrisy masquerading as policy from a government that is nothing more than an empty bag to hold power for business interests. They alone will profit from this government. •

A protesting First Nations woman who was pushed to the ground during Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Climate Action Rally at the Danforth Music Hall on March 4, says the prime minister “witnessed” her being assaulted, and “did nothing.”

The woman is 26-year-old Vanessa Gray, a community organizer from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation. In a press release written a few days after the incident, Gray said it is disturbing that many of the people who attended the event, including Trudeau himself, did nothing.

At the event, Trudeau was interrupted several times during his speech by hecklers and protestors in the crowd, who were immediately ushered out by security.

Gray said she went to ensure that the voices of Indigenous people were present and draw attention to the ongoing colonial and environmental violence that indigenous people experience in Canada.

Before arriving at the event, Gray hid a Canadian flag in her shirt that said, “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.”

She said it was to remind those at the event that ground zero of environmental violence is occurring right now on unceded land.

Videos and photographs of the incident have been making the rounds online.

During Trudeau’s speech, Gray threw her flag and shouted “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.” Seconds later, an older white man, in a blue shirt, pushed her down to the floor.

“Shocked, but not deterred I rose up and continued to speak, ‘No Justice on Stolen Native Land.’ I said this over and over until security pulled me from the rally,” she wrote in her statement.

While Gray was quickly escorted out, the man, who is yet to be identified, remained inside the event and continued to cheer Trudeau on.

In a video taken during the event, Trudeau can be seen witnessing the scuffle and uttering “Oh boy, oh boy,” moments after Gray is pushed to the ground.

Gray has been speaking up against environmental violence for eight years.

She and her lawyer Nick Cake, with Millars Law, are considering her legal options. Cake said they are in a preliminary stage and are reviewing all options and working to determine the best possible path.

“Our options include filing a police report because police didn’t take any action on that day. Another avenue will be civil remedies that may be available. Another would be to leverage a conversation between Vanessa and the prime minister’s office,” he said.

“Situations like this have a way of fizzling off and falling off into the background and essentially being forgotten about. It’s our intention to keep this fresh and to keep it going so it does not become outdated or a situation that lacks the public’s interest,” Cake said.

In an email statement, Liberal Party spokesperson Parker Lund said the safety of all Canadians attending such events is a top priority and that the incident has been brought to their attention. The party is taking steps to review the matter with the appropriate authorities and staff, Lund said.",Woman pushed at Liberal rally at Danforth Music Hall considering legal options,Beach Metro Community News,https://www.beachmetro.com/2019/03/21/woman-pushed-at-liberal-rally-at-danforth-music-hall-considering-legal-options/

320,Politics,2019-03-21T04:07:00.0000000Z,"Growing up in Cape Breton, you used to feel that if someone’s parents were Liberals, they were always going to vote ... One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy ...","In conversation with The Journal after her Community Matters town hall meeting in Ashcroft on March 5, Green Party of Canada leader and Saanich-Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May was asked whether the Green Party had more work to do to get away from the idea that they are mainly concerned with a single issue.

“Absolutely. Right now Canadians are looking around and thinking ‘I don’t feel like I want to vote “fill in the blank”.’ A lot of people are no longer as rooted in one party only. Growing up in Cape Breton, you used to feel that if someone’s parents were Liberals, they were always going to vote Liberal. It was almost genetic.

“That’s changing. People are looking around and thinking ‘Where do I want to put my vote? Who’s earned my vote?’ And almost by process of elimination people find themselves looking at the Green Party with new eyes. So we really have to explain ourselves. We’ve always had credible platforms, budgeted programs that are more detailed and fiscally sound than other parties. But a lot of people don’t know that, because the media coverage hasn’t shown us as the viable option. Now they are.

“Going into the 2019 election we do have work to do. We have an obligation to offer Canadians a viable alternative that answers the questions that they have.”

One of the main questions, May said, was to do with the idea that the Greens are against the economy; that if you care about the environment you are somehow against the economy. “That isn’t valid, but it’s been pitted like that for so long that people have a tendency to assume that’s going to be a problem in voting Green.”

May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada have set a standard for being hard-working and ethical. “We’re open to ideas, and wanting to cooperate with others. That’s one of the key things that makes us different from other parties. We want to get the best of the ideas from everybody and work on them together.”

Asked if she wanted to predict how many Green Party candidates might be elected in October, May said it was hard to say. “When I look at the variables I see that a lot is in flux. I’m not trying to be deliberately cagey, but look at what happened to the NDP in Quebec in 2011. That could happen for us this time.

“In the Outremont by election [on Feb. 25] we placed ahead of the Conservatives and ahead of the Bloc Québécois. That’s the best showing the Greens have ever had in Outremont. It’s not the same as saying we’re poised to win Outremont, but for the first time the Quebec media began to say ‘Wait a minute, the Greens could win seats in Quebec.’ Once people begin to say we could win, that’s when voters begin to think ‘Oh, it’s not a wasted vote,’ and they begin to look at our candidates differently.”

May said that she had expected the subject of trains to come up at the town hall in Ashcroft, but not to the extent that it did, and that she had learned a lot. She added that conversation in rural New Brunswick regarding trains was a lot like the one in Ashcroft, although with more emphasis on the inadequacies of passenger travel.

“Where you find a lot of conversation around rail safety is in Montreal, where people are still reeling from Lac-Mégantic.”

Regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair, May said that she did not expect to see any further cabinet resignations, and wondered how much pressure had to be put on every remaining member of cabinet to get their signature on a letter of support for the Prime Minister. “There may be some unhappy [people] who signed that.”

May planned to fly to Ottawa overnight on March 5 to attend the Justice Committee meeting on March 6 to ask questions. “I have a lot of questions, and I hope we make some headway in answering the key bits where there’s missing information.”

May had nothing but praise for the ethics and intelligence of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, both of whom have resigned from Cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin affair. “They’re both really impressive, and they’ve both done the thing that people with integrity will do. The extent to which that wasn’t anticipated by the old boys’ club that really runs things is fascinating.

“The gender analysis of this episode, when it’s all over, will be really, really interesting. The pressure … in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, there were a lot of men pressuring her. And Bill Morneau’s response to Jane Philpott leaving was ‘I know they were close friends.’ They’re both women. Women apparently, according to Bill Morneau, form little pinky-pacts where if one goes the other has to go too.

“No, that’s not the case. These are people of integrity, and in our political system it’s so rare for a cabinet minister to step out of that post.”

May said she was doing a lot of digging into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and had a lot of questions. “Where’s the evidence and analysis that would suggest that SNC-Lavalin could fold and all these people could lose their jobs? I don’t see it. There’s a lot to dig into here before I’ll feel as if I know what happened.”

Former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick recently had a dire warning about the upcoming election, saying that he worried about the “rising tide of incitements to violence” and that he feared “somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign”. May called the words a “diversionary tactic”, and said “I don’t think that’s Canada, and I think Michael Wernick’s testimony was unhelpful. Anything that gives oxygen to the idea that we’d take violent actions against people in private life I don’t appreciate, as a person in public life.

“I hope the election won’t be ugly. Of all the leaders of parties and of all the party strategies so far, it’s Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives who’ve been willing to play footsie with white supremacists, willing to run fear-based campaigns. We’ll see if the election unfolds in ways that elevate discourse, or move us closer to the kinds of things that go on in the U.S.”

May said that she is concerned about the potential for social media sites like Facebook to have paid-for advertising and the spreading of fake news designed to advantage one party over another. “Canadians, as intelligent and critical thinkers … I think the best defence against that kind of thing happening is to actually be prepared to be a watchdog. If they see something where they go back to the original media site over some claim that strikes them as unlikely, and it turns out it’s a manipulated propaganda site, they’re going to get on board a campaign that does #don’tbelievethisnewssite. Whatever it takes to say ‘We need to make decisions based on information from reliable news sources, not propaganda websites.'”

Current infrastructure funding, where the costs are split between the federal and provincial governments and municipalities, sees the federal government paying 50 per cent, the provincial government paying 33 per cent, and the municipality paying 17 per cent. The federal government considers a “rural community” to be anything under a population of 100,000, putting Ashcroft in the same boat as Kamloops. The difficulty that very small communities have in raising their 17 per cent share of infrastructure funding was pointed out to May.

“This is a big issue in my riding too,” said May. “A municipal government is still treated as if it’s a child of a province. Most of the critical infrastructure needs are found at [the municipal] level of government. One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments and First Nations.

“The access to a tax base is so small for municipalities compared to the provinces and feds. The split clearly isn’t sensible. You’re not going to find the tax base here to raise the kind of money that’s needed to gain access to infrastructure funding. But every community in Canada has a huge infrastructure deficit. There’s a better way to deal with it, and cost-sharing isn’t it.

“Infrastructure projects for small and rural municipalities should be 100 per cent federal. Just get it done, because it’s such a barrier when rural municipalities first have to beg the province and then find their 17 per cent. It’s not workable.”

May said that she had had a wonderful visit to the area. “The school, the theatre production of Shrek: I’ve been very fortunate to have had a lot of really great experiences of connecting with community. I visited the screwdriver factory and got my own personalized screwdriver with my name on it.

“Visiting Ashcroft, it’s clear that the number one asset of this community is the community spirit of talented people who love living where they live.

“Small communities are capable of doing amazing things, and Ashcroft is a great example of that. Really impressive.”

Fitting, as this year’s show, which runs at the downtown convention centre through Sunday, is awash in green vehicles as never before.

The Nissan Leaf was named 2019 Canadian Green Car of the Year, while the Jaguar I-Pace took the 2019 Canadian Green Utility Vehicle of the Year title. At the recent Toronto Auto Show, the I-Pace claimed 2019 utility vehicle of the year honours, marking the first time an all-electric claimed that honour.

“It’s important for many Canadian drivers to be environmentally aware, and AJAC’s Green Vehicle of the Year awards help them to make the responsible choice when it’s time to buy a new car or utility vehicle,“ AJAC president Mark Richardson said in a release. “If they can save money on fuel while also driving a vehicle with low emissions – or no emissions at all – then everybody wins.”

Entries to the awards must meet the standard requirements for initial entry into the Canadian Car of the Year awards program, and additional criteria for fuel efficiency based on the entry’s size, powertrain and purpose.

All entries are tested by AJAC journalists, and evaluation takes place over months on different road surfaces and road conditions throughout the year and during AJAC’s autumn Test Fest event. The journalists score all eligible entries on parameters including recharge time, driving range, vehicle dynamics, market significance, and overall value. Each of the scores is then weighted for relevance to the vehicle and category in question. The winning score also represents how the vehicle stacks up to its market segment competition, whether green or otherwise.",Leaf and I-Pace top AJAC Green Awards podium,blogs.driving.ca,https://driving.ca/jaguar/auto-shows/vancouver-auto-show/leaf-and-i-pace-top-ajac-green-awards-podium

The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- A new report by a green energy think tank calls for increased investment in electric buses to both reduce emissions and boost Canada's growing manufacturing base of the vehicles.

The report by Clean Energy Canada says that while Canada is a leading manufacturer of electric buses, transit authorities are behind international peers.

China is by far the leader in electric buses with about 99 per cent the world's e-buses, including Shenzhen's more than 16,000-strong fleet. Other cities have also committed to moving in that direction, including Amsterdam that is aiming to transition to zero-emissions buses by 2025 and Los Angeles by 2030.

Several Canadian cities have also set fully-renewable fleet targets, but on less aggressive timelines. Montreal is aiming for 2040, Toronto by 2042 and Vancouver by 2050, the report notes.

The report's call for more buses comes the same week as a study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance Ltd. found the world's electric buses will displace about 270,000 barrels a day of diesel by the end of this year as the heavily used vehicles have an outsized impact on fuel demand.

Clean Energy's report notes Canada has several leading manufacturers of electric buses, including Winnipeg-based New Flyer, Vancouver-based GreenPower, and Quebec-based Lion Electric Co. and Nova Bus, that could be boosted by increased domestic demand.",Green think tank calls for Canada to boost electric buses,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/autos/green-think-tank-calls-for-canada-to-boost-electric-buses-1.4345723

Seventy Canadian journalists voted on this year’s winners, taking into account everything from a car’s fuel economy (or EV economy), to the various green initiatives undertaken by its manufacturer.

The other finalists for the Utility Vehicle of the Year award were the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV. It wasn’t enough to defeat the I-Pace, however, which adds this award to a collection that includes the European Car of the Year and overall Canadian Utility Vehicle of the Year, also voted on by AJAC.

“It’s been a incredible journey for this vehicle,” said Aleksandra Bulat, Manager of Experiential and Partnerships at Jaguar Land Rover Canada. “We are overjoyed it is now one of the most awarded vehicles by AJAC, along with its overall Utility of the Year Award.”

Our review of the 2019 Nissan LEAF

See our Guide to all-electric vehicles in Canada in 2019

The Nissan LEAF has been just as popular here in Canada as it’s been in other markets, and continues to be a reference in the segment. But in 2019 the model faces some stiffer competition, notably from the new Kona Electric and of course the wee Chevrolet Bolt, which both benefit from a substantially longer range (415 km for the former, 383 km for the latter) on a full charge. The LEAF has a range of 241 km.

In response, Nissan has produced an extended-range version called the LEAF PLUS (363 km of range) that is just coming on the market now. It will be interesting to see if the boost in range is enough to keep consumers on board with this model, which does a have a ton of other qualities going for it – a fact confirmed by the AJAC jury.

Another factor the LEAF has going for it? Its starting price of $36,398 makes it eligible for the new EV rebate program just announced by the Canadian federal government as part of its new election-year budget. That program, yet to be implemented, will set a price limit of $45,000 CAD for eligibility for the EV rebate. That makes the much-talked new Kona Electric (starting price of $45,599) ineligible.

If and when the new EV rebate program is up and running, that should give the LEAF quite a leg up on the increasingly stiff competition it faces.

Michael Green is president and CEO of Canada Health Infoway ...","To adapt to our increasingly just-in-time lives, the Canadian health care system is moving increasingly toward digitization. This necessary modernization of health care means better patient outcomes as well as improved insight into future health-care decisions.

Despite the personal and system-wide benefits of a digital health-care system, what cannot be ignored is that your health information has value to people wishing to take advantage or use the information inappropriately.

The fact remains that Canadians may also be unwittingly sharing their health information. Whether it’s apps that are used, mailing lists that are joined, or online surveys, what is really being tracked is personal health information that tells unscrupulous users information you may not want them to know. If the fine print in the privacy agreement isn’t read and understood, it’s hard to know where your information goes and how it’s used.

Thieves collect personal data such as home addresses and contact information, but also details of physical or mental conditions and prescribed medications. Individuals can be threatened with public exposure of their data, especially those in high-profile positions, and future health benefit claims or even border crossings could be affected.

Compromised personal health data has a much greater and lasting impact. When a credit card is stolen, card numbers are changed and charges in question are typically reimbursed. Conversely, your health record stays with you for life, leaving you more vulnerable to future problems.

Just like Canadians have not shied away from online banking or commerce, the answer isn’t to fear a digital health system either. The benefits to patients, professionals and the overall system are far too great, but we also can’t bury our head in the sand when it comes to privacy or the selling of personal health-care data.

Instead, we must look at ways to protect Canadians while increasing the digital health options available to them. One such tool is Infoway’s PrescribeIT, a paperless e-prescription service that enables prescribers to securely transmit a prescription to a patient’s pharmacy of choice. As a not-for-profit service funded by the federal government, it ensures all personal health information is secure, confidential and only used for its intended purpose.

Finally, the protection of personal data, and especially health data, must be a priority for everyone. Data drives decisions, it allows us to react to new trends in care and system needs, but we can’t let data drive profit at the expense of the patient.

Physicians, pharmacists and all health-care professionals must continue to take an active role in protecting their patients’ data, while at the same time patients must ask questions about how their information is kept safe, secure and guarded against commercial misuse. During Fraud Prevention Month, we have an opportunity to look at where the data in our health system is now and map out a plan that keeps the system healthy and safe for all.

Michael Green is president and CEO of Canada Health Infoway, which helps to improve the health of Canadians by working with partners to accelerate the development, adoption and effective use of digital health solutions across Canada. Established in 2001, Infoway is an independent, not-for-profit organization funded by the federal government.

One of them is the return of a rebate granted for the purchase of a ""green"" vehicle, this for the first time in 11 years. This time around, the incentive will be offered on vehicles that are either electric or powered by hydrogen.

There is a catch, however; the suggested retail price of these must be less than $45,000. This is clearly a calculated choice being made by the government. Setting this price limit eliminates some of the most popular vehicles in this category, such as the Tesla Model 3 and the Hyundai Kona Electric. The two popular models are offered at $47,600 and $45,599, respectively.

A limit of $50,000 would have covered many more EV models, but it would also have cost the government more. In total, the government has allocated $300 million to Transport Canada for this new measure, which is relatively little considering the rapidly growing interest in EVs.

Residents of Quebec and British Columbia can forget about benefiting from up to $13,000 in discounts on purchase of a Kona Electric, after adding the provincial rebate currently in place there.

That ceiling does leave other choices, like the Nissan LEAF.

No date has yet been announced for the implementation of the incentive program, and we’re unlikely to see consumers stampeding to dealerships to make a purchase before learning more. We’ll have to wait and see how quickly the program is up and running, and whether that happens before the election in fall of this year.

It’s too early to tell whether this announcement amounts to more than election-year posturing. For one, the program could eventually encompass plug-in hybrid products as well. The government has not confirmed it, but reports are that this could happen.

One thing’s for sure, however; there will be lot of people watching what the government does in this dossier very, very closely.

It reported that German industrial giant Siemens AG is teaming up with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to build an underground 560-kilometre transmission line that will carry power from Iowa to the Chicago area. It will be called the SOO Green Renewable Rail.

The prices of publicly traded wind and solar companies have been edging higher, but they are still undervalued compared to the broad market, according to some experts. ( MARTIN BERNETTI / AFP/GETTY IMAGES FILE PHOTO )

So, what’s so special about another power line, even if it’s underground? Just that the electricity it carries will be wind and solar generated. When it’s completed, hopefully by 2024, the line will be capable of transmitting 2,100 megawatts, which the Journal says is the equivalent of a large nuclear power plant. Although two European companies are undertaking the project, there’s a Canadian connection. Most of the route will run along a Canadian Pacific railroad corridor, which should make it easier to obtain the necessary permits. I found this story intriguing because I had no idea that solar and wind generation had reached such a substantial scale. I had been under the mistaken impression that green energy initiatives were still small-scale ventures that relied heavily on government subsidies to survive.

Not so, says John A. Cook, president of Greenchip Financial Corp., which specializes in this type of investing. “Last year there was $340 billion invested in wind and solar energy projects – more than for all other types of electrical generation,” he told me in a phone interview. He noted that in December, the Alberta Government signed three contracts to provide 600 megawatts of wind generation to the province for the next 20 years (enough to power 255,000 homes). “The remarkable part of this story is the unsubsidized auction price of 3.7 cents per kWh,” he says. “This is about half where wind generation was at only a year ago and is almost as cheap as solar. It is also half what a new natural gas or coal plant could produce these electrons at. The breakthrough can be attributed to technological advances, the good Alberta wind regime, and the low cost of capital large developers now bring. For several reasons, solar will continue to grow faster than wind, but 3.7 cents is a game changer.” Greenchip is a sub-advisor to the recently launched Mackenzie Global Environmental Equities Fund. It has only been around since October, so we don’t have much history to work with. However, the year-to-date gain of 13.25 per cent (to March 11) is impressive. The portfolio is basically the same as the 11-year-old Greenchip Global Equity Fund, which is only open to accredited investors ($250,000 and up).

That Greenchip portfolio consists of several familiar names such as Siemens, Panasonic, Hitachi and Johnson Controls, plus a lot of companies that few people have ever heard of. The largest position is in JinkoSolar, a small-cap producer of solar modules, based in Shanghai. Although the prices of publicly traded wind and solar companies have been edging higher, they are still undervalued compared to the broad market, says Cook. It may be hard to believe, but the market capitalization all the listed solar manufacturers in the Greenchip portfolio is just over $10 billion. A single cannabis company, Canopy Growth, has a market cap more than double that.

One reason for the depressed value of solar and wind stocks is that relatively few analysts cover them. Also, environmental sectors generally experience higher levels of technological and regulatory change, which is often missed by investors. Finally, due to the sector’s high growth potential and disruptive nature, individual companies or sub-sectors are susceptible to excessive hype and/or cynicism. The net result, Cook contends, are “incredibly attractive” valuations. So, how do you participate in this energy revolution? There are four Canadian mutual funds that focus on these companies. They include the Mackenzie fund already mentioned, the NEI Environmental Leaders Fund, the Desjardins Societerra Environment Fund (a fund that invests in bonds issued by “responsible” companies), and the AGF Global Sustainable Growth Equity Fund. It’s been around the longest and shows a 10-year average annual return of 9.9 per cent. The portfolio goes well beyond energy to include health care, basic materials, consumer cyclicals, etc. Surprisingly, I could not find a single Canadian-based ETF that focuses on this area. There are several in the U.S., however. One of the largest is the Invesco Solar ETF, which invests in a portfolio of U.S. and international companies that produce solar power or build components for the industry. Its 10-year record is in negative territory but for the first two months of this year it was ahead an amazing 34.85 per cent. Another strong performer this year is the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, which was up 17 per cent for 2019 as of March 11. Here again, the 10-year return is negative. Investors have taken a long time to understand this business, but they finally are catching on. Amazingly, this is all happening in a world where the President of the United States is a climate change skeptic, whose policies seek to weaken the development of alternative power sources and, instead, revitalize the coal industry. Clearly, his plans are not working. Alternative energy momentum is building, and investors are increasingly looking to get in on the action.

Monday qualifier David Hearn of Brantford ...","This week’s Valspar Championship is playing right into Nick Taylor’s hands.

Taylor, from Abbotsford, B.C., is looking forward to taking on the difficult Copperhead Course at the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club in Palm Harbor, Fla., this week at the Valspar because it is just that — a challenging par-71 7,340 yards.

“It’s typically a difficult golf course. You have to keep it in play. Par’s not going to hurt you,” said Taylor on Wednesday. “I just prefer courses where 2- or 3-under par is a great score instead of being a shootout like some tournaments where the winner is 20- to 25-under.

“Here, 10- to 14- under is where winners have been and it’s where I would prefer it if I were to pick a tournament.”

The timing is great for Taylor, too. He’s coming off his strongest performance of the season, tying for 16th at 10 under at the hyper-competitive Players Championship.

“My iron play was really solid all week, made a few mistakes the first day. I felt the greens were tough in the afternoon,” said Taylor, who shot a 73 in the first round but recovered with a 69-69-67 line the rest of the way. “I played really well the last three days and cashed in a lot of opportunities on the Sunday to have my best round of the week so that was pretty much the difference.”

Pleased with his overall performance, Taylor isn’t looking to tweak anything about his game, instead focusing on maintaining what brought him success at the Players to the Valspar.

Taylor will be joined by seven other Canadians at the Valspar Championship, matching the record for Canadians at a PGA Tour event outside of the RBC Canadian Open. Monday qualifier David Hearn of Brantford, Ont., Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, dual citizen Austin Connelly, Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., Adam Svensson of Surrey, B.C., and Ben Silverman of Thornhill, Ont., will also play, with the latter being added to the field on Wednesday.

Already a tough course, Taylor played nine holes on Tuesday at Copperhead and another nine at the Pro-Am and said that the greens are firm.

“Early in the morning was a little chilly, but the course is in great shape,” said Taylor. “The greens are fast and pretty firm. If the weather holds up it might be tough.”

LPGA TOUR — Brooke Henderson of Smiths Falls, Ont., took in the Arizona Coyotes game on Saturday, since she was already in Phoenix ahead of the Founders Cup as the LPGA Tour begins its North American season. She’ll be joined in the tournament by fellow Canadians Brittany Marchand (Orangeville, Ont.), Alena Sharp (Hamilton), Jaclyn Lee (Calgary) and Anne-Catherine Tanguay (Quebec City).

WEB.COM TOUR — The Web.com Tour returns after a five-week break with the Chitimacha Louisiana Open at Le Triomphe Golf and Country Club in Broussard, La. Ottawa’s Brad Fritsch, Calgary’s Ryan Yip, Mike Weir of Brights Grove, Ont., Toronto’s Albin Choi and Michael Gligic of Burlington, Ont., are all in the field.

As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.","OTTAWA—For his first question in the House of Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh asked the prime minister whether he was going to make housing more affordable for Canadians. This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto. Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is recognized in the House of Commons before taking his place before question period on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. The prime minister and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh, Chantal Hébert writes. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair. With the resignation of clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick — one of the main protagonists in the controversy — announced just minutes before question period, the focus promptly returned to the topic that has consumed Canadian politics for the past five weeks. Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation. But he may have to wait a few more months — until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign — for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

Article Continued Below

Tuesday’s budget — the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office — marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future. In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Article Continued Below

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda. One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more. But the SNC-Lavalin affair — and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction — has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic. As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue. Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh. The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives. It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage. Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000. On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals. Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner. Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago. Like Clark who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks. In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of NDP MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at 9 per cent, two points ahead of the NDP. The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall. As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

Hydroponics are systems for growing plants in water— without soil. The co-op's food is growing in a greenhouse made out of an upgraded shipping container from Ottawa-based company The Growcer.

The Growcer's greenhouses use water enriched with nutrients, an artificial light source and carbon dioxide to grow plants ""as quickly as possible,"" said Corey Ellis, a company co-founder. He said the greenhouses can grow seeds into full plants in about six weeks.

The sea cans are outfitted to keep plants growing when outside temperatures drop as low as -52 C. Ellis said the greenhouses use about as much electricity as an air conditioner that's running 24/7.

He said the Yellowknife Co-op should be able to stock its vegetables the same day they are harvested, ""which is pretty unique and I think something [customers] will really appreciate.""

The Yellowknife Co-op's sea can greenhouse isn't the first in the North. Ellis said his company has installed them in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, and Kuujjuaq, Que., as well.

Right now, the Co-op is growing kale, spinach and bok choi, as well as a variety of lettuces and herbs.

Nelson said the plants are pesticide-free and when harvested, are expected to be fresher and last longer than their counterparts trucked up from the South.

If all goes well, he said, the store will harvest about 400 plants a week.

Nelson said the idea is not to produce a cheaper vegetable.

""Power and heat up here isn't cheap, so this isn't something to subsidize produce here,"" he said. ""Produce is cheap, it's no different than other locations in the South.""

Owner: Celine Zhang

The food

“I think we’re the first restaurant to bring real Southern Chinese food to Toronto,” says Celine Zhang, who also co-owns Canada’s only other Green Tea franchise, located in Markham (there are 80 locations in China, however). Green Tea is part of the new crop of mainland Chinese chains that have set their expansion sights on the Canadian market. It specializes in Hangzhou-style food, which is known for its ingredient-forward dishes that aren’t overly spicy or greasy: it’s a fresh, light cuisine. “A lot of the dishes are a little sweet, too,” says Zhang. “We add sugar to almost everything to bring out the flavour.”

The drinks

Despite being called Green Tea Restaurant, the focus here is on the fresh-made juices, which include watermelon and pear, along with blends popular in China like cogongrass root and sugar cane. The one tea on offer is longjing, a pan-roasted green tea from Hangzhou.

The space

Zhang took what was previously a bare-bones dim sum place and brought it to life with Southern Chinese–inspired décor, decorative blonde wood and wall murals depicting traditional buildings commonly found in Zhejiang province. “I wanted the space to feel young so it would appeal to students and young professionals,” says Zhang, who says their Markham location abides by a more traditional Chinese aesthetic, which she thinks is a bit dark and heavy.","What’s on the menu at Green Tea, Chinatown’s new place for Hangzhou-style dishes",Toronto Life,https://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/whats-menu-green-tea-chinatowns-new-place-hangzhou-style-dishes/

With just 21 sleeps until the NHL’s draft lottery, here’s something else that’s exciting to Vancouver Canucks fans, the musings and meditations on the world of sports.

• The news that the CFL and CFLPA are considering revisions to the player ratio has been floating around the league for a couple of months, but it surfaced violently last week as negotiations opened for a new CBA.

Traditionalists, predictably, had a conniption, claiming the league would sell out its birthright if the ratio was altered. The league, they argue, derives its character and identity from its Canadian content and if the number of Canadian starters is reduced from seven to five, the league will lose its soul.

You can understand their outrage to a point but, in this case the economic considerations of an adjustment outweigh those issues which concern the flag and back bacon. The CFL is a lot of things — not least of which is a uniquely Canadian institution — but it’s also a second-tier professional league trying to survive in a brutally competitive market.

The ratio, unfortunately, distorts the league’s business model. Once you get past the quarterbacks, the highest-paid players aren’t the league’s stars but tend to be veteran Canadians who can play at or near an all-star level. The proposal to reduce their number doesn’t eradicate the Canadiana aspect of the league. But it does reduce the inflationary pressure involved with those players.

The CFL will also argue that expansion will open more jobs to all players, irrespective of their passport, and when you come right down to it, it seems the millennial audience the league is trying to reach isn’t as concerned with the game’s history as their parents and grandparents.

The league is trying to rebrand itself as a global entity which can attract players from all over the world. This is a necessary step in that process.

Now, if they come after the rouge they’ll have a fight on their hands.

• If the Players Championship isn’t the fifth major, it easily qualifies as the fifth-most important tournament in world golf and you can make the case it’s as prestigious as the PGA. It served up another beauty this week, a 16-man battle royal from which Rory McIlroy emerged as the survivor. The new March start date also serves as a brilliant kickoff to the golf season for anyone who lives north of St. Louis.

It has its own history, its own setting and its own unique story to tell each year. Basically, it’s The Masters Lite. which is a pretty good thing to be.

• During Wednesday’s Canucks-Rangers tilt, I made the observation on Twitter that, while the bar isn’t exactly high, Tyler Motte qualifies as one of the more positive stories of this Canucks season.

Didn’t realize this was a hugely controversial position.

Motte, in fact, sets up as a test case in the ongoing debate over analytics. The eyeball test sees the 24-year-old winger as a fourth-liner who kills penalties, has scored nine goals this season and plays the game with speed and tenacity. Among other things, he leads the Canucks in hits by a huge margin.

Again, this is as much a commentary on the rest of the team as Motte.

As for his fancy stats, they are, well, terrible. I’d argue that’s a result of playing most of the season with Jay Beagle and Loui Eriksson in a matchup role, but the analytics folk believe his underlying data is a reflection of Motte as a player. At least that’s what they mentioned on Wednesday in the calm, reasoned language which makes Twitter such a fun place to inhabit.

We can revisit this one this time next year and if I’m wrong, it won’t be the first time.

Travis Green, by the way, likes Motte so take it up with him.

• Ran into an NHL scout in Dallas who spends a lot of time working the NCAA. Here’s his take on Canucks prospect Tyler Madden, who’s just finishing his freshman year at Northeastern.

“The kid’s a stud. I don’t care about his weight (Madden goes a buck fifty-five on a good day). He’ll play and he’s a winner.”

• And finally, it’s been an up-and-down season for Luke Schenn, and that’s putting it mildly. In his career, a larger stardom has eluded the fifth-overall pick in the 2008 draft but, until this season, he spent 10 years in the NHL as a reliable stay-at-home defencemen.

Then things changed, abruptly, and the speed of the game and Schenn’s own limitations made him an expendable commodity. He’s played for four teams this season — Anaheim and the Canucks in the NHL; San Diego and Utica in the AHL — and, as much as anyone, he understands his situation.

“You don’t ask questions,” said the 29-year-old. “When you get in the lineup, you just try to play to the best of your capability. Being in the position I have been this year, I don’t take anything for granted. I just want to enjoy it and have fun.

“When you’re a young guy, you can be naive to the way things can be. When you’re younger, you take certain situations and opportunities for granted. When you get older you learn to appreciate them a lot more, knowing they’re not going to be there forever.”

Schenn drew into the Canucks’ lineup on Sunday because of the injury to Chris Tanev. He also understands the hazards of playing the style he shares with Tanev.

“It would be nice to sit on the half-wall and run the power play but it’s just not in the cards for guys like myself and him,” he said with a laugh. “I did it a couple of times in the minors where you run the power play and you think, man, it would be nice to be doing this my whole career. You’d feel a lot less beaten down.

“But you have to play to your strengths and that’s part of it, taking hits, making hits, blocking shots.”

Good Canadian kid there.

Brett Bundale, The Canadian Press





It started with a chance encounter in a coffee shop. He was charming and attractive, and everything he said mirrored her life.

The relationship developed into a romance but the seduction ended months later in apparent deception, an elaborate scheme by an alleged serial con man to whom she lost thousands of dollars.

""Everything he said to me was a lie,"" says Andrea Speranza, an athletic 49-year-old with long brown hair. ""I couldn't understand how he could make love to me with the sole purpose of ripping me off.""

She has since found multiple alleged victims of Marcel Andre Vautour, a man with a criminal record, warrants for his arrest and several aliases.

His suspected victims say he targets busy career women between the ages of 45 and 50, leaving a trail of broken hearts and empty bank accounts across the country.

The Canadian Press has spoken with three women across the country who say they fell victim to his romantic schemes, and one man who was promised a job and ended up losing tens of thousands of dollars. Each alleged victim has positively identified photos of the same person.

Vautour did not respond to requests for comment by phone, email or social media. None of the new allegations against him have been proven in court.

Speranza says she's sharing her story to prevent more people from falling victim to his alleged scams.

""I want to stop him from hurting more people,"" Speranza says. ""I'm going to catch a criminal.""

Originally from Ontario, Speranza had a hardscrabble childhood.

Despite her hard upbringing, she graduated from university and moved to Nova Scotia, where she became a firefighter and one of the first female captains in Halifax.

Speranza has dedicated her life to helping others, running an award-winning camp that educates girls about emergency services careers.

When she met a man who called himself March Hebert last summer, they seemed like kindred spirits.

He told her a story about his difficult family life, saying his parents struggled with addictions. But he turned his life around, worked on offshore oil rigs, and purchased hundreds of acres in rural Nova Scotia to build a youth-at-risk facility.

""It was almost like everything about my life he was saying back to me,"" Speranza says.

She says she now realizes it wasn't a chance encounter. He targeted her, she says, using a well-honed script and asking pointed questions to develop a plan.

It started off very casually -- she wasn't looking for a relationship. But she was attracted to his desire to help youth and to give back to the community.

The five-foot-eight, 185-pound man with green eyes and a disarming smile eventually persuaded her to hang out. They went hiking and kayaking, and attended charity events.

He told her she was beautiful. She made him a better person. She was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was falling hard and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

""Everything was just perfect,"" she says. ""He was super accommodating and helpful and complimentary. Nothing I could say or do was wrong.""

Speranza now believes he targeted her to invest in his apparently fabricated youth-at-risk facility. When she instead offered to help him apply for grants, she believes he implemented an exit strategy.

He said he suffered from Crohn's disease and one day he called her to say he'd been hospitalized.

She recalls him saying he was OK, but his wallet had been stolen. He needed money to buy costly medication. Then he had to go to Toronto to get his dog from his ex, and borrowed money for a train ticket and hotel room. He promised to pay her back.

She gave him $5,000.

""He ghosted me after that,"" Speranza says, adding that he never repaid her. ""I pride myself on good decisions. But I had no inkling whatsoever.""

She filed a police report and encouraged another alleged victim she met, Jean-Baptiste Joachin, to do the same.

The French citizen had met Vautour at a hostel in Quebec City and had travelled with him to Halifax, where he was promised a job on an offshore rig.

Joachin allegedly paid Vautour thousands of dollars for training courses. He also opened up Canadian bank accounts and credit cards, which Vautour had access to.

By the time Vautour skipped town last fall, Joachin had lost $30,000.

""He completely blindsided me,"" Joachin said. ""Everything he told me was bullshit.""

Halifax police spokesman John MacLeod confirmed the force has received two complaints of fraud based on case file numbers provided to The Canadian Press by Speranza and Joachin. But he said one incident had been closed while the second was deemed a civil matter.

Meanwhile, Speranza has discovered more alleged victims in other provinces through social media. They exchanged photos of the fraudster to confirm his identity, and have shared information about their cases.

Together, they've pieced together a string of allegations against Vautour across the country.

The Canadian Press has contacted police forces, court houses and justice departments in several provinces and has confirmed he's a wanted man with a criminal past.

Documents obtained from Quebec's Justice Department show Vautour pleaded guilty in 2005 to unauthorized use of credit card data and received a suspended sentence of one year's probation.

In 2015, Quebec courts issued an arrest warrant for Vautour for fraud.

Victoria Law Courts confirmed a warrant for the arrest of Vautour was issued in 2001, and executed in 2009. He pleaded guilty in August 2009 to obtaining by false pretence and served a six-month conditional sentence in the community, followed by two and half years of probation.

Meanwhile, West Kelowna RCMP said they are aware of a recent incident and have a police file open on the matter. But spokesman Jesse O'Donaghey said specific details are not released until charges are laid by Crown counsel.

The Winnipeg Police Service confirmed Vautour is currently the subject of two arrest warrants. Const. Rob Carver said the charges pending from 1998 include possession of goods obtained by crime over $5,000 and personation.

Records from the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick indicate Vautour was charged in 1996 with stealing a Volkswagen Jetta in Dieppe.

Despite efforts by law enforcement, some alleged victims have launched their own investigations -- even hiring a private investigator.

They've tracked down more than 20 phone numbers, 10 email addresses and multiple physical addresses used by Vautour in Canada and overseas.

The alleged victims have even narrowed down his method.

They say he told them all variations on a theme: He had a successful career either working on offshore rigs, as a remotely operated underwater vehicle operator, or running companies.

He claimed he made it big investing in precious metals, cryptocurrency and cannabis, the alleged victims say. He said he owned a white convertible Porsche, a Ford F-350 truck, a baby blue Aston Martin. He even had pictures to show off his upscale possessions.

""He had money and was well-travelled,"" says Jodi McMullin, a woman from the Okanagan area of B.C. who met him on a dating site in January 2018.

The whirlwind romance moved quickly, and they began planning a future together.

He told her he had been working in Vietnam and wanted to stay with her in Canada. But he had tax issues, and needed help cashing a business cheque.

The businesswoman offered to help him out. When she had doubts, he was always ready with an explanation.

""Every time I questioned him on something, he had a response right away,"" she says. ""There was never any hesitation.""

She provided him with her bank account number, and he deposited a cheque and then pressured her to transfer him the money, she says.

McMullin acquiesced and then left for a wedding in the U.S. When she returned, the cheque -- which she later learned was a fake purchased online -- bounced, she says.

""He ended up stealing just over $45,000 from me,"" she says. ""My trust is shot. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about it.""

Speranza is determined to bring the man she knew as March to justice, launching www.stopthemarchmadness.com in the hopes of preventing romance fraud and encouraging more potential victims to come forward with anecdotes, stories and possible charges against Vautour.

""This man ruins people's lives and I am in the business of saving people's lives,"" the firefighter says. ""I have to stop him.""",Duped Canadian women go after charming alleged con man,Bell Media,https://london.ctvnews.ca/duped-canadian-women-go-after-charming-alleged-con-man-1.4342350

Like many of the pot companies, TGOD has had a great start to 2019, in its case rising 85 per cent since January 1. Now trading in the mid-$4.00 range, the stock is well off its high of $10.24 set last September, but there are reasons to be bullish on the name.

Last month, the company got the nod from Wall Street investment bank Jefferies in its coverage launch of the cannabis space, where TGOD was one of five Buys listed. (They initiated coverage on nine companies.) Rather than trying to be all things to all pot consumers, concentrating on the organic market could be rewarding, according to Jefferies, who gave the stock a price target of $4.65 per share.

Nash agrees. “This is a really interesting cannabis company. It’s the only one that’s certified organic,” he says, in conversation with BNN Bloomberg last Thursday.

“What it comes down to is that the market is still so young on [cannabis], so for consumers that are buying online, I don’t see a huge amount of differentiation involved. What I’m curious to see is once those stores are available and people can go in and touch it and smell it, are they going to have a preference for an organic cannabis option? If the answer is yes, then this company is very, very well situated to capitalize on it,” Nash says.

After a good day on the greens on Friday ...,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Don’t call him Goldilocks, but Corey Conners finally played the par-3 island green at TPC Sawgrass just right.

During the first round of the Players Championship, his shot at the iconic 17th hole was too soft. That day, he intended to fly his ball past the front pin and use the back stop to get it close. Instead, his shot – which he deemed his luckiest of the day – barely made it over the water before nestling nine feet from the hole. He made par.

During round two, Conners hit his target but the late afternoon green was too hard and his ball skipped forward, almost meeting the same watery fate as Tiger Wood’s ball. Conners’ ball mercifully stopped in the sliver of rough between the green and the water. He made another par.

On Saturday, Conners arrived at the 17th tee at three-under for the day, five-under for the championship.

Weekends at the Players are different. There is a lot more fun to be had outside of the ropes, especially at the island green. The VIP suites surrounding the hole bustled with action. Everyone’s spirits raised by, well, spirits. Below on the grassy amphitheatre, much of the grass had been replaced by chairs and blankets; fans camped out in the best seats in the house for an afternoon of water balls and cold beer. Marshals had all but given up keeping the fans quiet, raising their arms before each shot more in surrender than authority.

Coming off a birdie at the par-5 16th, Conners wasn’t thinking about the crowd.

“I don’t really notice the noise, don’t really mind it when it’s consistent like that,” he said after the round.

On Saturday, the wind at 17 had turned into the players, and with the pin at the front left, Conners found it trickier to get close.

“I think for most guys it will be a wedge, but you’ve got to hit a good wedge,” he said. “It’s a gutsy wedge I guess.”

Conners’ playing partner Matt Wallace, not happy with his wedge shots on Saturday, hit nine-iron and it went long. The Englishman’s lower trajectory shot penetrated the wind and sent his ball to the back tier. Conners’ pitching wedge was higher, hit harder by the wind, but landed gently 12 feet from the hole.

Just right.

“It was a perfect shot,” Conners said “Exactly how I wanted it. I maybe thought it was going to land one or two yards further into the green but I hit it really solid.”

Being a golf nut was about to pay dividends for Conners. After watching similar putts on television throughout the years, he knew that his 12-foot putt would stop breaking near the hole, a subtlety not obvious from the green. There was a pitch mark near his line and he knew if he started his ball just to the right of it, it would go in for birdie.

He did, and it did.

“My mind is always thinking about golf,” he said when asked about the changing course conditions. “Last night on the practice green I was rolling some putts and envisioning some of the holes, sitting on the couch back at the house I was thinking about how some of the holes might play, sort of visualizing what I wanted my shot to look like.”

Conners’ Saturday 68 moved him up the leaderboard into a tie for 24th at six-under par. Another good round Sunday will mean a great payday and valuable FedEx Cup points.

But, beware, this course is a bear.

Taylor battles putter, finally wins

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Nick Taylor’s patience is being tested this week at the Players Championship.

The 30-year-old Canadian arrived at TPC Sawgrass feeling great about his putter before promptly missing several short putts in Thursday’s first round. After a good day on the greens on Friday, nothing would drop on Saturday.

“To be honest there was probably three putts today where a foot short I would have bet a lot of money they were going in, and they didn’t,” Taylor said.

Taylor made a total of just 47 feet of putts during round three. His first three birdies came on near-gimmes from 8 inches, 3-feet-7-inches and 1-foot-7-inches. Taylor hit 15 greens in regulation on Saturday and had plenty of mid-range looks at birdie that went unrewarded.

“You keep telling yourself that eventually, they are going to drop,” he said. “If you keep hitting edges and starting on the lines you are choosing that’s really all you can do.”

Despite frustration setting in, Taylor was playing well and was determined to keep giving himself chances. At the brutally difficult 18th hole, Taylor had one last chance to make a putt. He had 10-feet-5-inches for birdie get to five-under for the week and head to Sunday tied for 32nd at the Players Championship.

It dropped. Finally.

Taylor shot 69 at TPC Sawgrass on Saturday while making just one putt from outside of five feet.

(CSE:MMEN) (OTCQX:MMNFF) (FSE: A2JM6N) (“MedMen” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that it has signed a binding term sheet for a senior secured convertible credit facility of up to US$250,000,000 (the “Facility”) from funds managed by Gotham Green Partners (“GGP” or the “Investor”), an investor in the global cannabis industry. Management believes this is the largest investment to date by a single investor in a publicly traded cannabis company with U.S. operations.

“This strategic partnership with Gotham Green Partners represents another key milestone for MedMen and stems from our long-standing relationship with The Cronos Group and GGP’s brand portfolio,” said Adam Bierman, CEO of MedMen. “The growth capital will be used to operationalize the balance of our footprint and we look forward to creating further alignment with GGP and their global cannabis platform.”

“We continue to be impressed with MedMen’s industry leading retail execution and iconic branding. With MedMen’s fortified balance sheet, the Company’s future has never been brighter,” said Jason Adler, managing member of GGP. “We feel fortunate to have the opportunity to take such a significant stake in MedMen and begin to work actively with the management team and the board to help the Company achieve its goals.”

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from drawdowns on the Facility to fund the future capital needs of the business. In addition to funding general working capital, the growth capital will primarily be used to:

Operationalize existing retail licenses, with a focus on Florida, where the Company is licensed for 30 stores

Integrate assets acquired through pending transactions, including those related to PharmaCann, LLC

Accelerate geographic expansion through bolt-on acquisitions and investments in core markets

Support national roll-out of higher-margin in-house branded products

Continue to invest in technology and digital infrastructure, with a focus on delivery and loyalty programs

Consolidate the supply chain and enhance margins by ramping up cultivation and production capabilities

The investment from GGP will be in the form of convertible senior secured notes issued by MM CAN USA, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, totaling up to US$250,000,000 (“Notes”) on a private placement basis pursuant to applicable securities laws exemptions. The Notes will be issuable in three tranches, with each of the second and third tranches being issuable at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions and share price thresholds being achieved by MedMen. The initial tranche will be in the amount of US$100,000,000 (“Tranche I”). The additional US$150,000,000 would be funded in two US$75,000,000 tranches. The second tranche (“Tranche II”) would be available to the Company beginning on the six-month anniversary of the closing date, and the third tranche (“Tranche III”) would be available to the Company beginning on the six-month anniversary of the funding date of Tranche II.

All Notes will have a maturity date of 36 months from the closing date (“Maturity Date”), with a 12-month extension feature available to the Company on certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. Notes will bear interest from their date of issue at LIBOR + 6.0% per annum. During the first 12 months, interest may be paid-in-kind (“PIK”) at the Company’s option such that any amount of PIK interest will be added to the outstanding principal of the Notes. The Company shall have the right after the first year, to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Notes prior to maturity, in whole or in part, upon payment of 105% of the principal amount in the second year and 103% of the principal amount thereafter.

All or a portion of the Notes (including all accrued interest thereon) will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into class B subordinate voting shares of the Company (the “Subordinate Voting Shares”) at any time prior to the close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. The conversion price of each tranche of Notes is as follows:

i) for Tranche I Notes, the conversion price will be equal to 115% of the lesser of (the “Tranche I Reference Price”) (a) US$3.10, which represents the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) on the trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Facility (translated to US dollars), and (b) the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date; and

ii) for Tranche II and Tranche III Notes, the conversion price will be equal to the lesser of (a) 115% of the 20 trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of issue of such tranche, and (b) US$7.00.

The Company may force the conversion of up to 75% of the then outstanding Notes at the applicable conversion price(s) if the volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares (translated to US dollars) is US$8.00 for any 20 consecutive trading day period. If 75% of the then outstanding Notes are converted by the Company, the term of the remaining 25% of the then outstanding Notes will be extended by 12 months.

Upon drawdown of Tranche I, the lenders would be issued share purchase warrants (“Warrants”), each of which would be exercisable to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share. The number of Warrants to be issued will represent an approximate 50% Warrant coverage on the Tranche 1 Notes, certain of which Warrants will have an exercise price per Subordinate Voting Share that will be equal to a 30% premium to the Tranche I Reference Price, and another group of which Warrants will have an exercise price per Subordinate Voting Share that will be equal to a 50% premium to the Tranche I Reference Price. The Warrant coverage on the Tranche II and Tranche III Notes will be similar to those for the Tranche I Notes. The exercise prices for the Warrants on the Tranche II and Tranche III Notes will be equal to the lesser of (a) a 30% or 50% (as the case may be) premium to the 20 trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the drawdowns of such tranches, and (b) US$7.91 or US$9.13 (as the case may be).

The Warrants and any Subordinate Voting Shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants, will be subject to a four month hold period from the date of issuance of the Notes or such Warrants, as applicable, in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws.

The terms of the Facility described in this press release are those set out in a binding term sheet. However, completion of any tranche is subject to further agreements being entered into by the parties, including as to the guarantees and/or the collateral to be provided by MedMen and its applicable subsidiaries to secure its obligations under the Facility. The terms of the Facility, the Notes and the Warrants and the conditions to drawdowns are subject to change as the parties negotiate such definitive documentation. The closing of any tranches will be subject to certain conditions being satisfied including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals and the absence of material adverse changes. The parties are currently anticipating a closing in April. There can be no assurance that the parties will enter into definitive documentation such that the Facility will be available, or if definitive documentation is entered into, that the terms of the Facility, the Notes and the Warrants and the conditions to receiving the proceeds of any of the tranches will be as stated above.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The securities being offered have not been, nor will they be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws.

349,Sports,2019-03-15T16:43:00.0000000Z,"The 2019 calendar features a record-matching 21 stops, with the Canadian Grand Prix taking up its usual slot June 7-9 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. It seems sensible to say the team that has swept ...","The new Formula One season opens in Australia on Sunday with the same old question — can Mercedes be beaten? — and a trunkful of tantalizing subplots.

For one, Montreal’s Lance Stroll carries the colours of a new team and the prospect of a smoother road ahead after a rocky ride in his sophomore campaign last season.

The 2019 calendar features a record-matching 21 stops, with the Canadian Grand Prix taking up its usual slot June 7-9 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.

To get you primed, here are five key storylines to watch as F1 gets set to go in Melbourne:

Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes

It seems sensible to say the team that has swept the drivers’ and constructors’ championships in each of the last five years enters the new season as the clear favourite.

Hamilton, though, doesn’t want you to think that. He’s been playing up Ferrari’s strong form during pre-season tests and insisting the Silver Arrows are behind by as much as half a second per lap, an eternity in F1 terms.

But we’ve heard this before. Last season, too, Ferrari seemed to have the better car at the outset and at certain points during the campaign. And yet, in the end, Hamilton bagged his fifth drivers’ title with two races to spare.

Which goes to show, despite what the detractors say, the car alone doesn’t win championships. The driver must deliver maximum performance, too, at every opportunity, or pretty well close. And so does the team around him.

No one has delivered better on all three fronts — driver, car, team — than Mercedes since the introduction of hybrid-turbo engines in 2014. That’s why they are where they are, and why they will be difficult to displace.

Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari

Hamilton’s hyperbole aside, it’s true Ferrari looked strong in testing and remains the most likely candidate to break the Mercedes stranglehold on F1.

To do that, though, it must avoid repeating the gaffes of last season — both on and off the track — that saw it squander championship points on too many occasions.

Vettel, a four-time champion, must for his part be more like, well, Hamilton, and put in a near-error-free performance if he is to deliver Ferrari its first drivers’ title since 2007.

This time around, it seems, the atmosphere at the Italian stable is more positive and relaxed under new team principal Mattia Binotto, who has replaced the enigmatic Maurizio Arrivabene. That should help.

But Binotto is not the only big change, nor perhaps the most significant.

The highly rated Charles Leclerc is making his much-anticipated debut as Vettel’s teammate, replacing the veteran Kimi Raikkonen, who’s sitting in Leclerc’s old seat at Alfa Romeo.

With the eager and talented Leclerc nipping at his tailpipe, Vettel will have all the more reason to up his game if he wants to remain Ferrari’s No. 1 title contender.

Lance Stroll and Racing Point

If there is something to be learned from Leclerc’s accelerated move to Ferrari, it is that you don’t need a great car to make a big impression.

The lesson is not lost on Stroll, you’d think.

In just one year in F1, Leclerc, 21, managed to show sufficient promise at a mid-level team to have earned him arguably the most coveted seat on the grid.

Stroll, meanwhile, is starting his third year. At 20, it’s fair to say he’s held his own so far. It’s also reasonable to expect a little bit more.

This season offers a fresh start with a new team — Racing Point, the former Force India outfit that was bought out by a group of investors led by his billionaire father.

Given dad’s influence, Stroll will have all the support he needs to step up and stand out, Leclerc-like.

If he doesn’t, the risk is that pretty soon he’ll be seen as just another also-ran.

Robert Kubica and Williams

Kubica, who’s making an improbable return to F1 after eight years, has strong connections to Montreal — both good and bad.

The bad came in 2007, when he was involved in a horrific crash at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, his airborne BMW-Sauber striking a barrier at 300 km/h. Incredibly, he suffered only minor injuries.

The good came the following year when he returned to the scene of the accident to score his first and only F1 win, stunning the packed grandstands that included a great many emotional members of Montreal’s Polish community.

In 2011, another major setback: Kubica sustained major injuries, including a partially severed forearm, in a rally crash in Italy, and his racing days were thought to be over.

But no. Intense rehabilitation and determination have steered him back to an F1 racing seat at age 34, filling the vacancy left by Stroll at Williams.

Watch for the Polish flags to wave once more on Île Notre Dame come June, no matter the result.

Daniel Ricciardo and Renault

F1 drivers take a risk every time they climb into their cockpits, but Ricciardo’s decision to ditch Red Bull in favour of Renault might rank as his biggest gamble yet.

Red Bull is the only team besides Mercedes and Ferrari to have won races since 2014. Ricciardo has seven to his name — his first coming, coincidentally, at the Canadian Grand Prix that year.

There is no evidence Renault is anywhere near ready to challenge for a win — even a podium might be difficult — so it’s a mystery why the Australian has chosen this path.

The closest he has come to an explanation appeared in a Melbourne newspaper this week, where he was quoted as saying “perhaps the love just wasn’t there” during contract negotiations that left him feeling less wanted than his younger and brasher teammate, Max Verstappen.

Ricciardo, who turns 30 on Canada Day, is among the most talented and popular drivers in F1, and it would be a shame to see his career shift into reverse.

Then again, behind his trademark grin, maybe he knows something the rest of us do not about Renault’s prospects, whether in the short or long term.

The five-foot-eight, 185-pound man with green eyes and a disarming smile eventually persuaded her to hang out. They went hiking and kayaking, and attended charity events.","Open this photo in gallery Andrea Speranza, a captain with Halifax Regional Fire & Emergency, visits Shubie Park in Dartmouth, N.S., on March 12, 2019. Speranza says she was the victim of an elaborate scheme by a con man. Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press

It started with a chance encounter in a coffee shop. He was charming and attractive, and everything he said mirrored her life.

The relationship developed into a romance but the seduction ended months later in apparent deception, an elaborate scheme by an alleged serial con man to whom she lost thousands of dollars.

“Everything he said to me was a lie,” says Andrea Speranza, an athletic 49-year-old with long brown hair. “I couldn’t understand how he could make love to me with the sole purpose of ripping me off.”

Story continues below advertisement

She has since found multiple alleged victims of Marcel Andre Vautour, a man with a criminal record, warrants for his arrest and several aliases.

His suspected victims say he targets busy career women between the ages of 45 and 50, leaving a trail of broken hearts and empty bank accounts across the country.

The Canadian Press has spoken with three women across the country who say they fell victim to his romantic schemes, and one man who was promised a job and ended up losing tens of thousands of dollars. Each alleged victim has positively identified photos of the same person.

Vautour did not respond to requests for comment by phone, e-mail or social media. None of the new allegations against him have been proven in court.

Speranza says she’s sharing her story to prevent more people from falling victim to his alleged scams.

“I want to stop him from hurting more people,” Speranza says. “I’m going to catch a criminal.”

Originally from Ontario, Speranza had a hardscrabble childhood.

Story continues below advertisement

Despite her hard upbringing, she graduated from university and moved to Nova Scotia, where she became a firefighter and one of the first female captains in Halifax.

Speranza has dedicated her life to helping others, running an award-winning camp that educates girls about emergency services careers.

When she met a man who called himself March Hebert last summer, they seemed like kindred spirits.

He told her a story about his difficult family life, saying his parents struggled with addictions. But he turned his life around, worked on offshore oil rigs, and purchased hundreds of acres in rural Nova Scotia to build a youth-at-risk facility.

“It was almost like everything about my life he was saying back to me,” Speranza says.

She says she now realizes it wasn’t a chance encounter. He targeted her, she says, using a well-honed script and asking pointed questions to develop a plan.

Story continues below advertisement

It started off very casually – she wasn’t looking for a relationship. But she was attracted to his desire to help youth and to give back to the community.

The five-foot-eight, 185-pound man with green eyes and a disarming smile eventually persuaded her to hang out. They went hiking and kayaking, and attended charity events.

He told her she was beautiful. She made him a better person. She was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was falling hard and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

“Everything was just perfect,” she says. “He was super accommodating and helpful and complimentary. Nothing I could say or do was wrong.”

Speranza now believes he targeted her to invest in his apparently fabricated youth-at-risk facility. When she instead offered to help him apply for grants, she believes he implemented an exit strategy.

He said he suffered from Crohn’s disease and one day he called her to say he’d been hospitalized.

Story continues below advertisement

She recalls him saying he was OK, but his wallet had been stolen. He needed money to buy costly medication. Then he had to go to Toronto to get his dog from his ex, and borrowed money for a train ticket and hotel room. He promised to pay her back.

She gave him $5,000.

“He ghosted me after that,” Speranza says, adding that he never repaid her. “I pride myself on good decisions. But I had no inkling whatsoever.”

She filed a police report and encouraged another alleged victim she met, Jean-Baptiste Joachin, to do the same.

The French citizen had met Vautour at a hostel in Quebec City and had travelled with him to Halifax, where he was promised a job on an offshore rig.

Joachin allegedly paid Vautour thousands of dollars for training courses. He also opened up Canadian bank accounts and credit cards, which Vautour had access to.

Story continues below advertisement

By the time Vautour skipped town last fall, Joachin had lost $30,000.

“He completely blindsided me,” Joachin said.

Halifax police spokesman John MacLeod confirmed the force has received two complaints of fraud based on case file numbers provided to The Canadian Press by Speranza and Joachin. But he said one incident had been closed while the second was deemed a civil matter.

Meanwhile, Speranza has discovered more alleged victims in other provinces through social media. They exchanged photos of the fraudster to confirm his identity, and have shared information about their cases.

Together, they’ve pieced together a string of allegations against Vautour across the country.

The Canadian Press has contacted police forces, court houses and justice departments in several provinces and has confirmed he’s a wanted man with a criminal past.

Story continues below advertisement

Documents obtained from Quebec’s Justice Department show Vautour pleaded guilty in 2005 to unauthorized use of credit card data and received a suspended sentence of one year’s probation.

In 2015, Quebec courts issued an arrest warrant for Vautour for fraud.

Victoria Law Courts confirmed a warrant for the arrest of Vautour was issued in 2001, and executed in 2009. He pleaded guilty in August 2009 to obtaining by false pretense and served a six-month conditional sentence in the community, followed by two and half years of probation.

Meanwhile, West Kelowna RCMP said they are aware of a recent incident and have a police file open on the matter. But spokesman Jesse O’Donaghey said specific details are not released until charges are laid by Crown counsel.

The Winnipeg Police Service confirmed Vautour is currently the subject of two arrest warrants. Const. Rob Carver said the charges pending from 1998 include possession of goods obtained by crime over $5,000 and personation.

Records from the Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick indicate Vautour was charged in 1996 with stealing a Volkswagen Jetta in Dieppe.

Despite efforts by law enforcement, some alleged victims have launched their own investigations – even hiring a private investigator.

They’ve tracked down more than 20 phone numbers, 10 e-mail addresses and multiple physical addresses used by Vautour in Canada and overseas.

The alleged victims have even narrowed down his method.

They say he told them all variations on a theme: He had a successful career either working on offshore rigs, as a remotely operated underwater vehicle operator, or running companies.

He claimed he made it big investing in precious metals, cryptocurrency and cannabis, the alleged victims say. He said he owned a white convertible Porsche, a Ford F-350 truck, a baby blue Aston Martin. He even had pictures to show off his upscale possessions.

“He had money and was well-travelled,” says Jodi McMullin, a woman from the Okanagan area of B.C. who met him on a dating site in January 2018.

The whirlwind romance moved quickly, and they began planning a future together.

He told her he had been working in Vietnam and wanted to stay with her in Canada. But he had tax issues, and needed help cashing a business cheque.

The businesswoman offered to help him out. When she had doubts, he was always ready with an explanation.

“Every time I questioned him on something, he had a response right away,” she says. “There was never any hesitation.”

She provided him with her bank account number, and he deposited a cheque and then pressured her to transfer him the money, she says.

McMullin acquiesced and then left for a wedding in the U.S. When she returned, the cheque – which she later learned was a fake purchased online – bounced, she says.

“He ended up stealing just over $45,000 from me,” she says. “My trust is shot. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about it.”

Speranza is determined to bring the man she knew as March to justice, launching www.stopthemarchmadness.com in the hopes of preventing romance fraud and encouraging more potential victims to come forward with anecdotes, stories and possible charges against Vautour.

The other family members on the trip were 45-year-old father Prerit Dixit, 71-year-old grandfather Pannagesh Vaidya and 63-year-old grandmother Hansini Vaidya.

Kosha moved to Ontario in 2004 after marrying her husband, who already lived in Canada.

The girls were strong students and enrolled in specialized science and technology courses, Manant said. Ashka was also known for her singing voice, while Anushka was talented in dance and was learning a traditional Indian form called khattak.

Prerit worked as a medical lab assistant for LifeLabs and also held a job at Ontario's Ministry of Health. Kosha used to work for the Canadian Hearing Society, said Manant.

Pius Adesanmi: Adesanmi was a Nigerian-born professor in the Department of English Language and Literature and the Institute of African Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa.

He was a ""towering figure in African and postcolonial scholarship,"" said the school's president, Benoit-Antoine Bacon.

Adesanmi was the winner of the inaugural Penguin Prize for African non-fiction writing in 2010.

Mitchell Dick, a Carleton student in communications, said Adesanmi was ""extremely nice and approachable,"" and stood out for his passion for African literature.

Angela Rehhorn: Angela Rehhorn, 24, was an enthusiastic conservation volunteer from Orillia, Ont., who was developing a citizen science project on bat conservation.

The Canadian Wildlife Federation says she had recently participated in its Canadian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program for Canadians ages 18 to 30. She was on her way to participate in the United Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi as part of the UN Association of Canada's Canada Service Corps Program, it said.

Rick Bates, CEO of the Canadian Wildlife Federation, said in an interview that Rehhorn was a well-liked ""outdoors girl"" who was also a great leader.

""She was full of excitement and the optimism of youth and wanting to change the world and work on changing the world. And that's what she was doing,"" Bates said.

Rehhorn recently completed a bachelor of science at Dalhousie University and was ""thrilled"" to take part in the conservation corps, the federation said.

Her experience took her to Alberta where she went backpacking in Kananaskis this fall, then to Pacific Rim National Park on Vancouver Island for her field training. At the time of her death, Rehhorn had just finished volunteering her time to do species surveys and was especially interested in expanding her experience working in the marine environment, the federation said.

Stephanie Lacroix: Stephanie Lacroix was passionate about youth education and life skills development in both Canada and southern Africa.

Lacroix was working with the United Nations Association in Canada to help engage young Canadians in the UN's work to grow global citizens as a project officer with the association's Canada Service Corps, her LinkedIn profile says.

She graduated in 2015 with an honours degree in international development and globalization from the University of Ottawa. She was a board member of the African Community Fund for Education Canada and previously volunteered with Free the Children.

In an interview, Jasveen Brar said she met Lacroix at COP24 in Poland.

""She was a mentor to me and the two other guys that were selected for the conference. Since the COP, we kept in touch over email, where she offered me lots of advice about my career and life, she really was a star,"" Brar said.

Darcy Belanger:

Parvati.org, a not-for-profit conservation group, says the former Edmonton resident was its founding member and director of strategic initiatives.

Belanger's LinkedIn profile says he was working as a United States director of professional development with PCL Construction in Denver. Parvati says Belanger had taken time off from PCL and was travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly.

The organization said he was a champion of the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary because he realized the importance of the Arctic Ocean in balancing global weather patterns. MAPS declares the entire Arctic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle a protected area, the group said in a statement.

""Admired for his courage, outstanding achievements, and noble qualities, Darcy was a hero in every sense of the word,"" Parvati said. ""He was passionately devoted to the protection of all life through the realization of MAPS.""

Micah Messent: Messent was an environmentalist from British Columbia who expressed his joy on social media at being able to attend the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi.

In an Instagram post, he said he had been selected by the United Nations Association of Canada to attend the assembly and was travelling to Kenya where he would ""have the chance to meet with other passionate youth and leaders from around the world and explore how we can tackle the biggest challenges that are facing our generation.""

""I'm so grateful for this opportunity and want to thank all of the people in my life who have helped me get this far.""

Prof. Laurie Meijer Drees taught Messent at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo and said he was committed to being a role model for Indigenous youth and was a trailblazer among his classmates and the faculty.

""He was a bright light among all of those bright lights,"" she said. ""He was very enthusiastic, a bright young scholar, very committed to the environment and the land.""

Drees said Messent was part of a group of about a dozen Indigenous Studies students who wanted to make the world a better place.

The First Nations Leadership Council said Messent was a member of the Red River Métis Nation in Manitoba and was raised as the youngest of five siblings in the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island. It said he had plans to return to school in the future to pursue a law degree.

Peter deMarsh: Described by a longtime family friend in New Brunswick as a dedicated community activist, deMarsh travelled the world as chair of the International Family Forestry Alliance.

The international group, based in Luxembourg, represents more than 25 million forest owners worldwide.

Genevieve MacRae recalled how deMarsh and his wife Jean Burgess helped establish the Taymouth Community Association in New Brunswick more than a decade ago.

""Peter and his wife Jean made a pretty powerful team,"" said MacRae, a friend of deMarsh's since her childhood. ""They were always looking for how to improve the lives of the people around them.""

MacRae said deMarsh was a pillar of the Taymouth community.

""He was warm, funny, passionate — you always felt listened-to with Peter,"" MacRae said. ""He was an intense person, except that doesn't signify the warmth that was behind it all ... It's a monumental loss for our community.""

Felix Montecuccoli, a board member with the International Family Forestry Alliance, said in an email that police shared the news of deMarsh's death with his family late Sunday.

DeMarsh was en route to Nairobi, where he and Montecuccoli had planned to attend a workshop on financing for small farms.

The CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada, Derek Nighbor, issued a statement describing deMarsh as a lifelong advocate for the Canadian forest sector.

Amina Ibrahim Odowaa and her daughter Sofia Faisal Abdulkadir:

The 33-year-old Edmonton woman and her five-year-old daughter were travelling to Kenya to visit relatives. Her brother, Mohamed Hassan Ali of Toronto, said he had planned to travel with them but had to cancel last week.

""(She was) a very nice person, very outgoing, very friendly — had a lot of friends,"" he said.

A family friend said Odowaa had lived in Edmonton since 2006.

Derick Lwugi: An accountant with the City of Calgary, Lwugi was on his way to Kenya to visit both his and his wife's parents.

""His mom was not feeling well,"" Lwugi's wife, Gladys Kivia, said in a brief interview from Calgary.

The couple have three children, aged 17, 19 and 20, all of whom live at home. The family has lived in Calgary for 12 years.

Lwugi's neighbours in the southeast suburban neighbourhood of Mohogany said they would honour him with a ribbon campaign in the Kenyan flag's colours of red, black and green.

Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said on Twitter he was ""crushed"" by news of Lwugi's death.

Jessica Hyba: Hyba's Facebook page says she was born in Ottawa and pursued a career in international aid work. She worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as an public relations officer, based in Mogadishu, Somalia. Prior to that, the UNHCR said Hyba worked for CARE Canada.

That agency issued a statement saying she had worked in Indonesia as part of the emergency response to the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.

""We remember her fondly as a dedicated humanitarian and loving mother,"" CARE Canada said on their website.

Danielle Moore: A 24-year-old marine biology student from Winnipeg, Moore graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax in 2017.

She posted on Facebook on Saturday morning that she would be travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly.

""Over the next week, I'll have the opportunity to discuss global environmental issues, share stories, and connect with other youth and leaders from all over the world,"" she wrote.

""I feel beyond privileged to be receiving this opportunity.""

Colby Deighton, who dated Moore for four years and was still a friend, said he has many fond memories of her.

""Danielle was fearless, she had an insatiable curiosity and kind of an unbelievable capacity to do whatever she wanted to do,"" he said. ""She was always looking for opportunities and not just for herself, but she would regularly send people job opportunities or ideas that related to her friend's interests or programs they might want to apply to because it reminded her of them.

""She would often tell me that her dream job was to work in a school and be a guidance counsellor.""

Prof. Kim Davies, her honours thesis adviser at Dalhousie, said Moore was an exceptional student.

""She excelled at her studies, she was a kind and friendly person, and she was deeply devoted to environmental and human rights causes,"" Davies said in an email.

Davies said after graduating from Dalhousie, Moore returned to Manitoba where she worked for several non-governmental organizations, including the Canada Learning Code, a group dedicated to improving the accessibility of educational and technological resources for Canadians.

The professor confirmed Moore's work was recognized by the United Nations, which is why she was invited to be a delegate to the environmental assembly.",Remembering the 18 Canadian victims of the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9224336-remembering-the-18-canadian-victims-of-the-ethiopian-airlines-plane-crash/

Leblanc is one shot ahead of American Maia Schechter heading into the final two rounds.

""I just hit the ball really well today,"" Leblanc told the tour's website. ""I was consistent throughout the day. I missed one or two short putts, but other than that, it was pretty solid tee to green.""

Leblanc withdrew from last week's season-opening event before the second round after tweaking her shoulder.

Maddie Szeryk of London, Ont., shot a 72, Christina Foster of Toronto had a 74, Hannah Hellyer of Stirling, Ont., carded a 75 and Samantha Richdale of Kelowna, B.C., had a 77.

Leblanc is back on the Symetra Tour this year after spending most of the past three seasons on the LPGA Tour. She lost her full status for this year after finishing 116th on the money list in 2018.

355,Business,2019-03-22T10:02:00.0000000Z,“This strategic partnership with Gotham Green Partners represents another key milestone ... which represents the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) on the trading day immediately preceding ...,"MedMen Enterprises Inc. (CSE:MMEN) (OTCQX:MMNFF) (FSE: A2JM6N) (“MedMen” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that it has signed a binding term sheet for a senior secured convertible credit facility of up to US$250,000,000 (the “Facility”) from funds managed by Gotham Green Partners (“GGP” or the “Investor”), an investor in the global cannabis industry. Management believes this is the largest investment to date by a single investor in a publicly traded cannabis company with U.S. operations.

“This strategic partnership with Gotham Green Partners represents another key milestone for MedMen and stems from our long-standing relationship with The Cronos Group and GGP’s brand portfolio,” said Adam Bierman, CEO of MedMen. “The growth capital will be used to operationalize the balance of our footprint and we look forward to creating further alignment with GGP and their global cannabis platform.”

“We continue to be impressed with MedMen’s industry leading retail execution and iconic branding. With MedMen’s fortified balance sheet, the Company’s future has never been brighter,” said Jason Adler, managing member of GGP. “We feel fortunate to have the opportunity to take such a significant stake in MedMen and begin to work actively with the management team and the board to help the Company achieve its goals.”

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from drawdowns on the Facility to fund the future capital needs of the business. In addition to funding general working capital, the growth capital will primarily be used to:

Operationalize existing retail licenses, with a focus on Florida, where the Company is licensed for 30 stores

Integrate assets acquired through pending transactions, including those related to PharmaCann, LLC

Accelerate geographic expansion through bolt-on acquisitions and investments in core markets

Support national roll-out of higher-margin in-house branded products

Continue to invest in technology and digital infrastructure, with a focus on delivery and loyalty programs

Consolidate the supply chain and enhance margins by ramping up cultivation and production capabilities

The investment from GGP will be in the form of convertible senior secured notes issued by MM CAN USA, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, totaling up to US$250,000,000 (“Notes”) on a private placement basis pursuant to applicable securities laws exemptions. The Notes will be issuable in three tranches, with each of the second and third tranches being issuable at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions and share price thresholds being achieved by MedMen. The initial tranche will be in the amount of US$100,000,000 (“Tranche I”). The additional US$150,000,000 would be funded in two US$75,000,000 tranches. The second tranche (“Tranche II”) would be available to the Company beginning on the six-month anniversary of the closing date, and the third tranche (“Tranche III”) would be available to the Company beginning on the six-month anniversary of the funding date of Tranche II.

All Notes will have a maturity date of 36 months from the closing date (“Maturity Date”), with a 12-month extension feature available to the Company on certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. Notes will bear interest from their date of issue at LIBOR + 6.0% per annum. During the first 12 months, interest may be paid-in-kind (“PIK”) at the Company’s option such that any amount of PIK interest will be added to the outstanding principal of the Notes. The Company shall have the right after the first year, to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Notes prior to maturity, in whole or in part, upon payment of 105% of the principal amount in the second year and 103% of the principal amount thereafter.

All or a portion of the Notes (including all accrued interest thereon) will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into class B subordinate voting shares of the Company (the “Subordinate Voting Shares”) at any time prior to the close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. The conversion price of each tranche of Notes is as follows:

i) for Tranche I Notes, the conversion price will be equal to 115% of the lesser of (the “Tranche I Reference Price”) (a) US$3.10, which represents the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) on the trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Facility (translated to US dollars), and (b) the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date; and

ii) for Tranche II and Tranche III Notes, the conversion price will be equal to the lesser of (a) 115% of the 20 trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of issue of such tranche, and (b) US$7.00.

The Company may force the conversion of up to 75% of the then outstanding Notes at the applicable conversion price(s) if the volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares (translated to US dollars) is US$8.00 for any 20 consecutive trading day period. If 75% of the then outstanding Notes are converted by the Company, the term of the remaining 25% of the then outstanding Notes will be extended by 12 months.

Upon drawdown of Tranche I, the lenders would be issued share purchase warrants (“Warrants”), each of which would be exercisable to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share. The number of Warrants to be issued will represent an approximate 50% Warrant coverage on the Tranche 1 Notes, certain of which Warrants will have an exercise price per Subordinate Voting Share that will be equal to a 30% premium to the Tranche I Reference Price, and another group of which Warrants will have an exercise price per Subordinate Voting Share that will be equal to a 50% premium to the Tranche I Reference Price. The Warrant coverage on the Tranche II and Tranche III Notes will be similar to those for the Tranche I Notes. The exercise prices for the Warrants on the Tranche II and Tranche III Notes will be equal to the lesser of (a) a 30% or 50% (as the case may be) premium to the 20 trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the drawdowns of such tranches, and (b) US$7.91 or US$9.13 (as the case may be).

The Warrants and any Subordinate Voting Shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants, will be subject to a four month hold period from the date of issuance of the Notes or such Warrants, as applicable, in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws.

The terms of the Facility described in this press release are those set out in a binding term sheet. However, completion of any tranche is subject to further agreements being entered into by the parties, including as to the guarantees and/or the collateral to be provided by MedMen and its applicable subsidiaries to secure its obligations under the Facility. The terms of the Facility, the Notes and the Warrants and the conditions to drawdowns are subject to change as the parties negotiate such definitive documentation. The closing of any tranches will be subject to certain conditions being satisfied including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals and the absence of material adverse changes. The parties are currently anticipating a closing in April. There can be no assurance that the parties will enter into definitive documentation such that the Facility will be available, or if definitive documentation is entered into, that the terms of the Facility, the Notes and the Warrants and the conditions to receiving the proceeds of any of the tranches will be as stated above.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The securities being offered have not been, nor will they be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws.

356,Politics,2019-03-21T04:07:00.0000000Z,"May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada ... One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments ...","In conversation with The Journal after her Community Matters town hall meeting in Ashcroft on March 5, Green Party of Canada leader and Saanich-Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May was asked whether the Green Party had more work to do to get away from the idea that they are mainly concerned with a single issue.

“Absolutely. Right now Canadians are looking around and thinking ‘I don’t feel like I want to vote “fill in the blank”.’ A lot of people are no longer as rooted in one party only. Growing up in Cape Breton, you used to feel that if someone’s parents were Liberals, they were always going to vote Liberal. It was almost genetic.

“That’s changing. People are looking around and thinking ‘Where do I want to put my vote? Who’s earned my vote?’ And almost by process of elimination people find themselves looking at the Green Party with new eyes. So we really have to explain ourselves. We’ve always had credible platforms, budgeted programs that are more detailed and fiscally sound than other parties. But a lot of people don’t know that, because the media coverage hasn’t shown us as the viable option. Now they are.

“Going into the 2019 election we do have work to do. We have an obligation to offer Canadians a viable alternative that answers the questions that they have.”

One of the main questions, May said, was to do with the idea that the Greens are against the economy; that if you care about the environment you are somehow against the economy. “That isn’t valid, but it’s been pitted like that for so long that people have a tendency to assume that’s going to be a problem in voting Green.”

May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada have set a standard for being hard-working and ethical. “We’re open to ideas, and wanting to cooperate with others. That’s one of the key things that makes us different from other parties. We want to get the best of the ideas from everybody and work on them together.”

Asked if she wanted to predict how many Green Party candidates might be elected in October, May said it was hard to say. “When I look at the variables I see that a lot is in flux. I’m not trying to be deliberately cagey, but look at what happened to the NDP in Quebec in 2011. That could happen for us this time.

“In the Outremont by election [on Feb. 25] we placed ahead of the Conservatives and ahead of the Bloc Québécois. That’s the best showing the Greens have ever had in Outremont. It’s not the same as saying we’re poised to win Outremont, but for the first time the Quebec media began to say ‘Wait a minute, the Greens could win seats in Quebec.’ Once people begin to say we could win, that’s when voters begin to think ‘Oh, it’s not a wasted vote,’ and they begin to look at our candidates differently.”

May said that she had expected the subject of trains to come up at the town hall in Ashcroft, but not to the extent that it did, and that she had learned a lot. She added that conversation in rural New Brunswick regarding trains was a lot like the one in Ashcroft, although with more emphasis on the inadequacies of passenger travel.

“Where you find a lot of conversation around rail safety is in Montreal, where people are still reeling from Lac-Mégantic.”

Regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair, May said that she did not expect to see any further cabinet resignations, and wondered how much pressure had to be put on every remaining member of cabinet to get their signature on a letter of support for the Prime Minister. “There may be some unhappy [people] who signed that.”

May planned to fly to Ottawa overnight on March 5 to attend the Justice Committee meeting on March 6 to ask questions. “I have a lot of questions, and I hope we make some headway in answering the key bits where there’s missing information.”

May had nothing but praise for the ethics and intelligence of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, both of whom have resigned from Cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin affair. “They’re both really impressive, and they’ve both done the thing that people with integrity will do. The extent to which that wasn’t anticipated by the old boys’ club that really runs things is fascinating.

“The gender analysis of this episode, when it’s all over, will be really, really interesting. The pressure … in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, there were a lot of men pressuring her. And Bill Morneau’s response to Jane Philpott leaving was ‘I know they were close friends.’ They’re both women. Women apparently, according to Bill Morneau, form little pinky-pacts where if one goes the other has to go too.

“No, that’s not the case. These are people of integrity, and in our political system it’s so rare for a cabinet minister to step out of that post.”

May said she was doing a lot of digging into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and had a lot of questions. “Where’s the evidence and analysis that would suggest that SNC-Lavalin could fold and all these people could lose their jobs? I don’t see it. There’s a lot to dig into here before I’ll feel as if I know what happened.”

Former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick recently had a dire warning about the upcoming election, saying that he worried about the “rising tide of incitements to violence” and that he feared “somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign”. May called the words a “diversionary tactic”, and said “I don’t think that’s Canada, and I think Michael Wernick’s testimony was unhelpful. Anything that gives oxygen to the idea that we’d take violent actions against people in private life I don’t appreciate, as a person in public life.

“I hope the election won’t be ugly. Of all the leaders of parties and of all the party strategies so far, it’s Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives who’ve been willing to play footsie with white supremacists, willing to run fear-based campaigns. We’ll see if the election unfolds in ways that elevate discourse, or move us closer to the kinds of things that go on in the U.S.”

May said that she is concerned about the potential for social media sites like Facebook to have paid-for advertising and the spreading of fake news designed to advantage one party over another. “Canadians, as intelligent and critical thinkers … I think the best defence against that kind of thing happening is to actually be prepared to be a watchdog. If they see something where they go back to the original media site over some claim that strikes them as unlikely, and it turns out it’s a manipulated propaganda site, they’re going to get on board a campaign that does #don’tbelievethisnewssite. Whatever it takes to say ‘We need to make decisions based on information from reliable news sources, not propaganda websites.'”

Current infrastructure funding, where the costs are split between the federal and provincial governments and municipalities, sees the federal government paying 50 per cent, the provincial government paying 33 per cent, and the municipality paying 17 per cent. The federal government considers a “rural community” to be anything under a population of 100,000, putting Ashcroft in the same boat as Kamloops. The difficulty that very small communities have in raising their 17 per cent share of infrastructure funding was pointed out to May.

“This is a big issue in my riding too,” said May. “A municipal government is still treated as if it’s a child of a province. Most of the critical infrastructure needs are found at [the municipal] level of government. One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments and First Nations.

“The access to a tax base is so small for municipalities compared to the provinces and feds. The split clearly isn’t sensible. You’re not going to find the tax base here to raise the kind of money that’s needed to gain access to infrastructure funding. But every community in Canada has a huge infrastructure deficit. There’s a better way to deal with it, and cost-sharing isn’t it.

“Infrastructure projects for small and rural municipalities should be 100 per cent federal. Just get it done, because it’s such a barrier when rural municipalities first have to beg the province and then find their 17 per cent. It’s not workable.”

May said that she had had a wonderful visit to the area. “The school, the theatre production of Shrek: I’ve been very fortunate to have had a lot of really great experiences of connecting with community. I visited the screwdriver factory and got my own personalized screwdriver with my name on it.

“Visiting Ashcroft, it’s clear that the number one asset of this community is the community spirit of talented people who love living where they live.

“Small communities are capable of doing amazing things, and Ashcroft is a great example of that. Really impressive.”

Make sure to also check out the variety of loose-leaf organic teas, including herbal, fruit, green, and black teas, as well as a wide range of tea accessories.","Located south of Katchewanooka Lake on both sides of the Otonabee River on the Trent-Severn Waterway, the Village of Lakefield offers many of the amenities of big-city life in a quaint small-town setting with a rich cultural heritage.

Dubbed the gateway to cottage country in Peterborough & the Kawarthas, Lakefield’s history dates back to the early 19th century. The village was originally founded by Colonel Samuel Strickland (brother of the iconic 19th-century writers Catharine Parr Traill and Susanna Moodie) when he settled in the area in 1831. Before becoming known as Lakefield, the village was previously called Nelson’s, Herriot’s Falls, and then Selby.

This is part three of a three-part series on Canadian getaways in Peterborough & The Kawarthas.

Originally sustained by the saw mill industry, Lakefield is now a prosperous residential community supported by small business, especially retail and tourism, along with international companies including SGS Research and Savage Arms.

A 15-minute drive north of Peterborough, a two-hour drive from Toronto, and a three-hour drive Ottawa, Lakefield’s historic homes and heritage sites, vibrant downtown, and close proximity to many local attractions make it an ideal destination for your next Canadian getaway.

Explore Canada’s literary history

The Village of Lakefield has a rich literary heritage, with two of Canada’s most important 19th-century writers — sisters Catharine Parr Traill and Susanna Moodie — having lived in the area, as well as one of Canada’s most esteemed and beloved writers, the novelist and short-story writer Margaret Laurence.

Born in England almost two years apart, Susanna and Catharine Parr Strickland eventually married, respectively, John Moodie and Thomas Traill. In 1832, both families emigrated to Canada where they settled on adjacent bush farms along the eastern shore of Lake Katchewanooka just north of Lakefield, with the help of their brother Samuel Strickland.

Their experiences as pioneers led to Catharine Parr Traill’s book The Backwoods of Canada (1836) and Susanna Moodie’s book Roughing It in the Bush (1852).

In 1840, Susanna Moodie and her husband moved to Belleville, but she returned to the Lakefield area for a month each summer to visit her sister.

The prior year, the Traills sold their farm and then lived at various locations in Peterborough County until Thomas Traill died in 1859. Following her husband’s death, Catharine had a cottage built in Lakefield with the help of her brother Samuel.

She called it “Westove”, after her husband’s home in the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Except for short absences to visit family and friends, it was Catharine’s home from 1860 until her death in 1899.

Located at 16 Smith Street in Lakefield, it is now a private residence with a historical plaque located beside the home.

One of Canada’s most esteemed literary figures, Margaret Laurence, spent the last 13 years of her life in Lakefield. She is best known for her iconic books The Stone Angel (1964), A Jest of God (1966), and The Diviners (1974).

Called the “First Lady of Lakefield”, Laurence lived at 8 Regent Street in Lakefield from 1974 until her death there in 1987. She also had a cottage on the Otonabee River near Peterborough, where she wrote The Diviners during the summers of 1971 to 1973.

Laurence’s Lakefield home is located near Christ Church (62 Queen St.), a small stone church built in 1853 under the leadership of Samuel Strickland. It now houses the Christ Church Community Museum, which displays important historical artifacts and displays including the Strickland family history and information about Susanna Moodie, Catharine Parr Traill, Margaret Laurence, and 19th-century writer and poet Isabella Valancy Crawford, who also lived in Lakefield.

Christ Church Community Museum is only open to the public in the summer, when Lakefield also hosts the annual Lakefield Literary Festival. The 25th anniversary festival takes place in 2019 from July 13th to 14th.

358,Business,2019-03-22T11:23:00.0000000Z,“This strategic partnership with Gotham Green Partners represents another key milestone ... which represents the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) on the trading day immediately preceding ...,"MedMen Announces US$250 Million Investment From Gotham Green Partners

LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–MedMen Enterprises Inc. (CSE:MMEN) (OTCQX:MMNFF) (FSE: A2JM6N) (“MedMen” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that it has signed a binding term sheet for a senior secured convertible credit facility of up to US$250,000,000 (the “Facility”) from funds managed by Gotham Green Partners (“GGP” or the “Investor”), an investor in the global cannabis industry. Management believes this is the largest investment to date by a single investor in a publicly traded cannabis company with U.S. operations.

“This strategic partnership with Gotham Green Partners represents another key milestone for MedMen and stems from our long-standing relationship with The Cronos Group and GGP’s brand portfolio,” said Adam Bierman, CEO of MedMen. “The growth capital will be used to operationalize the balance of our footprint and we look forward to creating further alignment with GGP and their global cannabis platform.”

We continue to be impressed with MedMen’s industry leading retail execution and iconic branding. With MedMen’s fortified balance sheet, the Company’s future has never been brighter. We feel fortunate to have the opportunity to take such a significant stake in MedMen and begin to work actively with the management team and the board to help the Company achieve its goals.

Jason Adler, managing member of GGP

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from drawdowns on the Facility to fund the future capital needs of the business. In addition to funding general working capital, the growth capital will primarily be used to:

Operationalize existing retail licenses, with a focus on Florida, where the Company is licensed for 30 stores

Integrate assets acquired through pending transactions, including those related to PharmaCann, LLC

Accelerate geographic expansion through bolt-on acquisitions and investments in core markets

Support national roll-out of higher-margin in-house branded products

Continue to invest in technology and digital infrastructure, with a focus on delivery and loyalty programs

Consolidate the supply chain and enhance margins by ramping up cultivation and production capabilities

The investment from GGP will be in the form of convertible senior secured notes issued by MM CAN USA, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, totaling up to US$250,000,000 (“Notes”) on a private placement basis pursuant to applicable securities laws exemptions. The Notes will be issuable in three tranches, with each of the second and third tranches being issuable at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions and share price thresholds being achieved by MedMen. The initial tranche will be in the amount of US$100,000,000 (“Tranche I”). The additional US$150,000,000 would be funded in two US$75,000,000 tranches. The second tranche (“Tranche II”) would be available to the Company beginning on the six-month anniversary of the closing date, and the third tranche (“Tranche III”) would be available to the Company beginning on the six-month anniversary of the funding date of Tranche II.

All Notes will have a maturity date of 36 months from the closing date (“Maturity Date”), with a 12-month extension feature available to the Company on certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. Notes will bear interest from their date of issue at LIBOR + 6.0% per annum. During the first 12 months, interest may be paid-in-kind (“PIK”) at the Company’s option such that any amount of PIK interest will be added to the outstanding principal of the Notes. The Company shall have the right after the first year, to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Notes prior to maturity, in whole or in part, upon payment of 105% of the principal amount in the second year and 103% of the principal amount thereafter.

All or a portion of the Notes (including all accrued interest thereon) will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into class B subordinate voting shares of the Company (the “Subordinate Voting Shares”) at any time prior to the close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. The conversion price of each tranche of Notes is as follows:

i) for Tranche I Notes, the conversion price will be equal to 115% of the lesser of (the “Tranche I Reference Price”) (a) US$3.10, which represents the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) on the trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Facility (translated to US dollars), and (b) the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date; and

ii) for Tranche II and Tranche III Notes, the conversion price will be equal to the lesser of (a) 115% of the 20 trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of issue of such tranche, and (b) US$7.00.

The Company may force the conversion of up to 75% of the then outstanding Notes at the applicable conversion price(s) if the volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares (translated to US dollars) is US$8.00 for any 20 consecutive trading day period. If 75% of the then outstanding Notes are converted by the Company, the term of the remaining 25% of the then outstanding Notes will be extended by 12 months.

Upon drawdown of Tranche I, the lenders would be issued share purchase warrants (“Warrants”), each of which would be exercisable to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share. The number of Warrants to be issued will represent an approximate 50% Warrant coverage on the Tranche 1 Notes, certain of which Warrants will have an exercise price per Subordinate Voting Share that will be equal to a 30% premium to the Tranche I Reference Price, and another group of which Warrants will have an exercise price per Subordinate Voting Share that will be equal to a 50% premium to the Tranche I Reference Price. The Warrant coverage on the Tranche II and Tranche III Notes will be similar to those for the Tranche I Notes. The exercise prices for the Warrants on the Tranche II and Tranche III Notes will be equal to the lesser of (a) a 30% or 50% (as the case may be) premium to the 20 trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the drawdowns of such tranches, and (b) US$7.91 or US$9.13 (as the case may be).

The Warrants and any Subordinate Voting Shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants, will be subject to a four month hold period from the date of issuance of the Notes or such Warrants, as applicable, in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws.

The terms of the Facility described in this press release are those set out in a binding term sheet. However, completion of any tranche is subject to further agreements being entered into by the parties, including as to the guarantees and/or the collateral to be provided by MedMen and its applicable subsidiaries to secure its obligations under the Facility. The terms of the Facility, the Notes and the Warrants and the conditions to drawdowns are subject to change as the parties negotiate such definitive documentation. The closing of any tranches will be subject to certain conditions being satisfied including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals and the absence of material adverse changes. The parties are currently anticipating a closing in April. There can be no assurance that the parties will enter into definitive documentation such that the Facility will be available, or if definitive documentation is entered into, that the terms of the Facility, the Notes and the Warrants and the conditions to receiving the proceeds of any of the tranches will be as stated above.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The securities being offered have not been, nor will they be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws.

Chill is a fan favourite all year round. A big pot of steaming, spicy chili warms you up in fall and winter but it's also the perfect topping to your favourite dog or baked potato year round and a tasty side to your bbq in summer. But it gets better...

Omnivore? Vegetarian? Vegan? No matter what your dietary preferences are there's more than a few chili recipes out there for you! But we're not done yet...

Chili can be as healthy and as economical as you want to make it. Pack it with beans, lentils, and veggies for extra bulk and flavour (and a cheaper cost). Use a leaner animal protein like chicken or turkey if you eat meat. But can we mention one more thing?

It tastes sooooo good!! There's a reason everyone loves it and it's not just because it's healthy, economical or an easy meal to prep. It's because it tastes delicious and you can dress it up (or down) however you like it.

The late Princess Diana’s niece has given an intimate and revealing interview to the publication, in which she discusses everything from her aunt to her taste in men. And to top it all off, she posed for the cover photo and related images while wearing a dress by Canadian designer Sid Neigum. His work has also been featured in publications like Vogue and Elle, and he's dressed the likes of Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau, Jennifer Aniston, Jada Pinkett Smith and MTV’s Jessi Cruickshank. It’s safe to say Kitty’s hit the big time!

“It was definitely unexpected. I thought I had someone else’s phone when I woke up the next morning,” she told the publication of the massive wave of interest after she was photographed at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ’s 2018 nuptials, before joking: “I had to turn my notifications off because my phone was going to die… Can I still FaceTime my cat and put it on my Stories?”

There was a massive wave of interest in Kitty after Harry and Meghan’s nuptials. You’ll remember she arrived at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle wearing an emerald green slim-fit dress with a gorgeous floral pattern and co-ordinating hat with netting. Her look, which also included a diamond choker lipstick and red lipstick, went viral and became the talk of royal watchers during and after the wedding.

But things didn’t quiet down after that – far from it. Later that month, Charles Spencer’s daughter was also announced as the new face of high-end jeweller BVLGARI. She was also spotted in an absolutely to-die-for Dolce & Gabbana outfit at the V&A Summer Party later in the year.

The model told HarpersBazaar.com she hasn’t gotten used to her new fame, and said she feels a sense of “not belonging.” She said it’s particularly prominent for her when she takes the runway with the likes of Monica Bellucci, Carla Bruni, Isabella Rossellini, Helena Christensen and Naomi Campbell – something she did in the fall of 2018 for Dolce & Gabbana.

“I do feel like I sort of snuck through the back door and no one’s noticed yet,” she said. “I keep thinking that this is potentially short term and a really exciting moment, so I’m trying to embrace it for what it is. And then when it does end, just being grateful because it was something I never imagined in the first place.”

Kitty said one thing that’s kept her grounded through her newfound fame is her upbringing and close family ties. She told the publication she feels “lucky” to have been raised in South Africa, where she enjoyed time outdoors and lived at a relaxed, serene pace.

Mary Greenwall, Princess Diana’s makeup artist, told HarpersBazaar.com that Kitty’s spirit is remarkably similar to that of her late-aunt: “Diana was so willing and open... as is Kitty. Just sort of free – there’s a sense of freedom with all of them. I think the sense of freedom is actually very important, that then they didn’t feel stifled by their upbringing and their circumstances.”

For now, Kitty told the publication she’d like to continue to focus on her career and on being a role model for young women. “I guess I’m doing these things on my own terms,” she said, particularly of maintaining a healthy sense of self. “I look after myself but I’m not obsessive or unhealthy. If a brand wants to work with me, and think their designs look good on me, then they can give them to me in my size.”

Love could also be in the cards. “I’ve been really lucky. I’ve always had really lovely, straightforward boyfriends,” she said. “Whenever anything exciting happens in my life, or sad, the serious boyfriends I’ve had will be the first to get in touch and the first to be supportive. I don’t see the appeal of going for anyone who’s too complicated or not trustworthy… The men that I’ve been with have been kind and still are. And it’s lovely because it’s like a greater form of friendship in a way.”

REGINA – The NHL’s outdoor game in Regina may be a home game for the Winnipeg Jets, but the Calgary Flames are staking a claim to it.

The NHL lauded all things Saskatchewan at Friday’s news conference launching its marketing campaign for the 2019 Heritage Classic on Oct. 26 at Mosaic Stadium.

A non-NHL or “neutral” city will be the host of the Heritage Classic for the first time.

The Jets will be the home team in the regular-season game, but the Flames emphasized the franchise’s Saskatchewan connections including ownership group chair Murray Edwards, who hails from Regina.

Late owners Daryl “Doc” Seaman was from Rouleau, just south of Regina, and John “Bud” McCaig was born in Moose Jaw.

President, chief operating officer and Saskatoon product John Bean pointed to the number of the province’s expats who live in Calgary and show up to CFL games there en masse wearing green and white.

“Notwithstanding we are the visiting team for this game, we are without hesitation considering the 2019 Tim Hortons NHL Heritage Classic, a home game for the Calgary Flames,” Bean declared to assembled media in Regina.

“In this age of political correctness, we loyal Saskatchewan transplants like to say when it comes to sports in Calgary, we are red on the outside and green on the inside.

“For one night only, we hope to have a sea of red in Regina. We all know we’re still green on the inside.”

The NHL also marked Saskatchewan as its territory extolling the 514 men from the province who have played in the league.

Seventeen are Hockey Hall of Fame inductees, including Gordie Howe, Sid Abel, Clark Gillies and Bryan Trottier.

“Here in Saskatchewan, a province with a relatively small population, there are a remarkable number of great NHLers that have gone before us,” NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said.

“True hockey greatness has been passed down from generation to generation here.”

Regina-born players currently in the NHL include Anaheim Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf, Jordan Eberle of the New York Islanders, Chicago Blackhawks forward Chris Kunitz, Minnesota Wild goaltender Devan Dubnyk and Wild defenceman Mathew Dumba.

Daly projected the league’s 28th outdoor game and the fifth Heritage Classic will be seen by 1.5 million people.

Mosaic Stadium, owned by the city and operated by the Regina Exhibition Association, replaced 69-year-old Taylor Field as the home of the CFL’s Roughriders in 2017.

Regina is the host city of the 2020 Grey Cup after Calgary stages this year’s CFL’s championship game in November.

Winnipeg’s Investors Group Field was the site of the 2016 Heritage Classic, which the visiting Edmonton Oilers won 3-0 in front of 33,000.

“It was really in my view a tipping point for our organization,” True North Sports and Entertainment chair Mark Chipman said.

“It allowed us to re-connect to the history of the Winnipeg Jets for the first time and re-establish our alumni which is really strong and thriving now.

“It was a meaningful crossroads for us to be able to present the game in Winnipeg on the world stage and show the hockey world how vibrant hockey is in the prairies.”

Calgary held the 2011 Heritage Classic at McMahon Stadium, where the Flames shut out the Montreal Canadiens 4-0 in front of 41,000.

Current captain Mark Giordano and centre Mikael Backlund played in that game.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

The leaders of Canada’s largest labour organization and a prominent national Muslim group say Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is emboldening far-right extremists by failing to call out Islamophobia following the New Zealand mosque shootings and attending events with people who promote hate speech.

Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) president Hassan Yussuff criticized Mr. Scheer’s response to the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last week that left 50 people dead and dozens more injured. Mr. Scheer issued a lengthy statement about the terrorism attacks Friday after his initial Twitter message on the shootings were criticized for failing to mention that the victims were Muslims.

“Unfortunately the opposition leader had to be shamed to do a 180-degree turn to actually acknowledge what happened. Had he not been shamed, I’m not sure he would have changed his position,” Mr. Yussuf said Thursday.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), said Mr. Scheer’s initial decision to avoid saying that the victims were Muslims and the attacks took place at mosques “felt very deliberate.”

“There is a real danger that this kind of association helps to embolden others to feel like they now have licence to act out on their hatred and on their ideologies,” Mr. Gardee said.

Mr. Yussuf also condemned Mr. Scheer for sharing a stage with “racists and bigots” at a protest led by a convoy of pro-pipeline, anti-carbon-tax demonstrators in February. Former Rebel Media personality Faith Goldy also attended the rally on Parliament Hill, where she told Indigenous counterprotesters to leave Canada if they didn’t like it.

Mr. Yussuf said Mr. Scheer should know better than to attend events with right-wing figures such as Ms. Goldy.

A spokesman for Mr. Scheer said the Tory leader was “very clear and emphatic” in his condemnation of the anti-Muslim hatred that motivated the New Zealand mosque attacks.

“Further, in his speech to the House of Commons earlier this week, he called for action to defend a concept of Canada rooted in shared civic values, respect for the principle of universal human dignity and freedom of religion for all,” said Brock Harrison, Mr. Scheer’s spokesman.

The CLC and the NCCM shared their concerns at a media conference about the rise of Islamophobia in Canadian workplaces, where they released a new report on the matter.

The report cites a steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslim communities in Canada over the past several years, fuelled by far-right politics at home and abroad. It makes several recommendations aimed at reinforcing the responsibility of employers to educate management and staff about legal obligations around human rights and religious accommodations for Muslims. It also calls on governments to do more to support anti-racism awareness campaigns and develop strategies to combat online hate speech.

“What we’re talking about here is the everyday micro-aggressions that inform this fearful environment that many Canadian Muslims exist in and infiltrates every aspect of their daily life,” said Leila Nasr, NCCM communications co-ordinator.

Some political leaders in Western countries have focused on countering radical Islamist groups while failing to address potential threats from right-wing extremists and white supremacists, according to a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Toronto.

The Canadian government’s past reports on terrorist threats have identified a number of groups, like ISIS and al-Qaeda, without usually mentioning right-wing extremists.

Anver Emon, director of the Institute of Islamic Studies, noted that Canada’s public safety report began mentioning right-wing extremist groups in 2018, but as a footnote to its concerns around jihadist groups that it identified.

“I do think we have a disparity in the way our federal government takes aim and focuses its interests on those groups that pose greater threats more locally and more pervasively,” he said.

Emon also said some politicians tend to tweet about Muslim communities in broad strokes after an Islamic terror attack, but may not do the same for other groups in society.

For example, last November Australia’s prime minister tweeted about ensuring his country’s Muslim communities were not “infiltrated” by “extremist radical Islam.

Former B.C ...","On International Women's Day, CBC News Network's Power & Politics invited four female former premiers to discuss the SNC-Lavalin controversy, leading a cabinet through tough times, and the realities of being a woman in Canadian politics.

Former B.C. premier Christy Clark, former Newfoundland and Labrador premier Kathy Dunderdale, former Alberta premier Alison Redford and former Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne offered their own perspectives on managing power relationships at the highest levels of government.

Jody Wilson-Raybould resigned as Veterans Affairs minister on Feb. 12, not long after a Globe and Mail report said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shuffled her out of the justice and attorney general portfolios because she'd refused to clear the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). She later told the Commons justice committee she was placed under heavy pressure by people at the highest levels of Trudeau's government to allow the company to avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

Clark defended the Trudeau government's actions on the SNC Lavalin file, saying the need to preserve a major employer isn't something any government can ignore.

""Everybody will argue they should not have gone about it the way that they did,"" said Clark. ""At the end of the day if you're talking about 9,000 jobs and the attorney general is refusing to save them ... I think that's a pretty good argument to move the attorney general and find somebody who wants to support a growing economy.""

Dunderdale, meanwhile, said jobs can't be the only consideration. ""At the same time you want ethical companies operating in your jurisdictions and so, you know, where's the balance in all of this?""

Redford, who also served as the province's attorney general, shed light on the unique role attorneys general play in a cabinet.

""We also serve as not only legal adviser to the government but also as a cabinet minister. And so that professional and legal obligation to put the justice system and the legal system paramount is a different lens than other people sitting around the political decision-making table have,"" Redford said.

Wynne, a political ally of Trudeau's, said the prime minister has more work to do to put the SNC-Lavalin controversy behind him. ""I think the prime minister started yesterday to address the concerns. I think that there's more that has to be addressed,"" she said.

""I want to see a bridge built and I want to see a better understanding among Canadians of exactly what happened and and then how how they're going to move forward.""

Former premiers Christy Clark, Alison Redford, Kathy Dunderdale and Kathleen Wynne discuss why more Canadian women aren't getting into politics. 11:06

They also discussed the role feminist principles are playing in the SNC-Lavalin controversy, with critics like Conservative MP Michelle Rempel calling Trudeau a ""fake feminist"" for his treatment of Wilson-Raybould.

""So if you're a feminist, which I am, you can't fire or demote a member of your cabinet because they're a woman? I don't know. I'm a feminist and I did that,"" said Clark. ""I'm sure there are other female premiers, former premiers, who have done exactly the same thing.""

Dunderdale said she doesn't think anyone can argue that Trudeau isn't a feminist, or that he doesn't care about Indigenous people, but she said thinks the prime minister was a bit ""tone deaf"" when the media reports emerged alleging Jody Wilson-Raybould was a difficult personality to work with.

""The prime minister should have shut that down right away because that's what happens to women, all the time, when they're being critiqued,"" she said.",Four female former premiers weigh in on SNC Lavalin and being a woman in politics,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/power-politics-premiers-league-1.5049791

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

By most accounts, they were members of the last legislative chamber in the Western world to keep TV cameras out.

No more.

As of today, proceedings in the Red Chamber can and will be televised.

The move comes 42 years after the House of Commons let the cameras in.

Many of the senators had resisted because they feared their mandate to supply “sober second thought” would degenerate into partisan politics if cameras appeared.

But in 2016, a committee charged with modernizing the Senate recommended that proceedings in the chamber be televised to show Canadians the “value” of the upper house.

A committee report noted that broadcasting proceedings would demonstrate ‘high quality of debate’ in Red Chamber.”

However, at least for now, senators will not be sharing their sober second thoughts from their long-time lair, the Red Chamber.

Because of major renovation work on Parliament Hill, the Senate is currently housed at the Government Conference Centre.

Once Ottawa’s central train station, the building has been the site of many famous events in Canadian history, including the federal-provincial meetings that led to the repatriation of the Constitution in 1982.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

“There’s much more to the story that should be told,” former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott told Macleans’ magazine in an interview released on Thursday.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” she said. Philpott added that she and Wilson-Raybould had more to say but did not elaborate. Philpott, a close political ally of Wilson-Raybould, quit on March 4.

Trudeau, who has denied any political interference to protect SNC-Lavalin from a bribery trial, indicated he felt Canadians had already heard enough.

Wilson-Raybould had the chance to “share completely” her thoughts during almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month, he told reporters in Mississauga, Ontario when asked about Philpott’s remarks.

The crisis may threaten Trudeau’s reelection chances in the upcoming October vote. Polls show the center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

As well as the two ministers, the affair has claimed Trudeau’s closest political aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy. A Liberal legislator who backed Wilson-Raybould quit on Wednesday to sit as an independent.

Trudeau suffered further potential embarrassment on Thursday when SNC-Lavalin Chief Executive Neil Bruce denied he had told government officials that 9,000 jobs could be at risk if the firm was found guilty of offering bribes to Libyan officials.

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, which wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

“Until we are able to put this behind us, it’s pretty difficult to grow our Canadian workforce,” Bruce told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Asked whether he had specified the number of jobs that could be at risk, he replied: “No, we never gave a number.”

A court conviction would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal government contracts for 10 years.

Bruce said if the company’s share price continued to suffer, it might become a takeover target.

SNC-Lavalin’s headquarters are in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats in the October election to retain a majority government.

Trudeau has dismissed calls for a public inquiry, noting the House of Commons justice committee was probing the matter. That committee, dominated by Liberal legislators, shut down its inquiry on Tuesday, saying no more action was needed.

Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties ...","Regardless of who wins the 2019 provincial election, Alberta has been fundamentally altered by the results of the 2015 election and its aftermath.

This is one of the themes of Orange Chinook, a book I co-edited with my colleagues Keith Brownsey, Richard Sutherland, and David Taras at Mount Royal University.

In several chapters, the book highlights how the last provincial election brought to the fore a number of demographic and political changes that had been bubbling below the surface for years.

Alberta has a reputation as a conservative place, but a progressive evolution has been happening in its largest cities. The 2015 election also saw a breakthrough for women in politics, dramatically shifting what was once a male-dominated landscape. We witnessed, too, the rise of Indigenous activism, an undercurrent that is rising, increasingly, to the surface.

Many of these changes seem permanent, and the net effect appears to be the end of decades-long political dynasties that characterized this province for so long.

In short, Alberta politics is becoming more ""normal"" in the Canadian context.

Toward a two-party system

From 1905 to 2015, Alberta was unique in Canada. It was a province dominated by a single party.

Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties: Liberals (1905-1921), the United Farmers of Alberta (1921-1935), Social Credit (1935-1971), and the Progressive Conservatives (1971-2015).

Moreover, when the dynasty was finally defeated, it was never really a contender again. The once-dominant party often disappeared entirely.

The 2015 election replicated this pattern. After their defeat, the PCs voted themselves out of existence when they merged with the Wildrose Party to form the new United Conservative Party.

But the situation is now different. If the UCP wins the 2019 election, as polls currently suggest, it's unlikely to govern for 44 years. And the NDP is unlikely to disappear.

Instead, Alberta is moving toward a two-party system, with the NDP on the left and the UCP on the right. With this structure, it more closely resembles the political landscape in other Canadian provinces.

Alberta has never had a party lose power and then come back and win another election. But that day is coming.

And the path to victory for any party, increasingly, runs through Alberta's largest cities.

The rise of cities

Rural Alberta had been the political bedrock of previous political dynasties, but the election of the NDP in 2015 was remarkable for its lack of a powerful rural minister in the vein of Hugh Horner, Marv Moore, Ken Kowlaski or Ed Stelmach.

The NDP, despite winning a handful of rural seats, was widely seen as ""the party of cities,"" as James Wilt describes it in one chapter of the book.

Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise, given the success of progressive candidates at a municipal level.

In the case of Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, Dave Bronconnier, Al Duerr, and even a young Ralph Klein could not be described as either fiscal or social conservatives. The situation was the same in Edmonton with Don Iveson, Stephen Mandel, Bill Smith, and Jan Reimer.

The longevity of the Progressive Conservative dynasty at a provincial level masked changes that were already underway in Alberta's two biggest cities.

For Roger Epp, who contributed another chapter to Orange Chinook, the fiasco over the NDP's farm workers bill and some insensitive remarks about the carbon tax showed a government that was, in his words, ""post-rural.""

The 2015 election, in Epp's view, put the electoral stamp on a number of trends that had been occurring in rural Alberta: a declining population, the increasing encroachments of urban life, the loss of health and education services, and the rural way of life quickly fading.

Indeed, the percentage of MLAs from rural Alberta has been in a slow but steady decline as urban and suburban populations grow. As recently as 2001, less than half of MLAs came from Calgary and Edmonton. For the 2019 election, when the suburbs are included, it will be two-thirds.

And in both 2012 and 2015, rural MLAs were mostly on the opposition side of the legislature. If the UCP forms government in 2019, a majority of rural MLAs will be back on the government side. But this will not bring back the political glory days. Those days are gone.

So too, are the days of politics being a man's game.

Alberta steps into the future

When Alison Redford won the PC leadership race in 2011, the Globe and Mail carried a notoriously condescending front-page headline: ""Alberta steps into the present.""

But as Lori Williams shows in her chapter comparing the leadership styles of Danielle Smith, Alison Redford, and Rachel Notley, Albertans have had several women succeed in a hitherto masculine environment.

These changes are permanent.

It was Notley — not Justin Trudeau — who introduced the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canada.

Meanwhile the UCP, which had been mocked for having more men in its caucus named Richard than it did women, has nominated dozens of women to run in 2019.

The days of Alberta politics being so heavily male-dominated are over.

A final demographic change is the rise of Indigenous political activism.

Indigenous votes

Brad Clark, in his chapter of Orange Chinook, demonstrates the NDP was overwhelmingly supported by Indigenous people in the 2015 election.

In fact, there were three ridings that were significantly impacted by First Nations and Métis votes: Lesser Slave Lake, Peace River, and Wetaskiwin-Camrose.

The potential for clashes over energy infrastructure, environmental considerations, revenue sharing, and the constitutionally mandated duty to consult means future Alberta governments need to respond to Indigenous people.

There are those who believe that the election of the NDP was an accident and that Alberta is really an ideologically conservative province going back to the Social Credit days.

But is that true?

Politics in the new Alberta

The concluding chapter by Anthony Sayers and David Stewart — using post-election survey data from 2008, 2012, and 2015 — shows that notion is more myth than reality.

On most questions of political values, they write, ""stereotypes notwithstanding, voters in Alberta appear broadly supportive of a substantial role for the state with respect to government spending.""

This was also replicated by a spring 2018 survey for CBC by Janet Brown and John Santos, who co-wrote a chapter on polling in the book.

The chapter on the fiscal situation in Alberta, written by Ron Kneebone and Jennifer Zwicker, provides more evidence that Albertans are not particularly fiscally conservative. In reality, they say, we like high government spending and low taxes.

For decades, Albertans could get away with that because the gap between revenue and expenses was covered by rich oil and gas royalties. When those royalties decline, as they did in 2015, budget deficits occur.

Whoever wins the 2019 election will need to make some hard choices to address Alberta's fiscal situation.

The titular Orange Chinook refers to the winds of change that carried the NDP to victory in 2015. But chinooks can be temporary. We could see the government voted out of office in 2019.

However, as the sub-title indicates — Politics in the New Alberta — what we witnessed four years ago represents a much more durable shift than just a change of governing parties.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, seeking to move past a political crisis threatening its re-election, lavished new spending on middle-class voters in its budget on Tuesday as it forecast a bigger fiscal deficit of C$19.8 billion in 2019-20.

The budget contained spending measures that could lift gross domestic product by 0.2 percent this year, which is “not enough to move the dial on Bank of Canada policy,” Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.

The market has shifted from expecting further rate hikes from the Bank of Canada, which has tightened 125 basis points since July 2017, to seeing potential for a rate cut as data showed a slowdown in the country’s economy.

Canada said on Tuesday it would issue nearly 20 percent more bonds in the coming fiscal year to help the Liberal government fund its spending programs.

At 9:31 a.m. (1331 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3321 to the greenback, or 75.07 U.S. cents. The currency traded in a range of 1.3316 to 1.3345.

The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to hold interest rates steady, shave the number of hikes projected for the rest of the year, and release long-awaited details of a plan to end the monthly reduction of its massive balance sheet.

The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, was dragged down by concerns about global economic growth as the U.S.-China trade dispute rumbled on, but receiving some support from tightened supply. U.S. crude oil futures were down 0.3 percent at $58.86 a barrel.

Canadian government bond prices were little changed across the yield curve, with the 10-year rising 3 Canadian cents to yield 1.725 percent.

""C-76 is, in fact, very ...","OTTAWA — Facebook is launching a new advertisement library that will capture detailed information about political ads targeted at voters in Canada, including who pays for them and whom they target.

The move is part of the social-media giant's response to changes the Trudeau government has made to Canada's election laws aimed at stopping bad actors — foreign or domestic — from interfering with Canada's upcoming federal election through advertising.

Bill C-76, which received royal assent in December, bans the use of money from foreign entities to conduct partisan campaigns.

It also requires online platforms, such as Facebook and Google, to create a registry of all digital advertisements placed by political parties or third parties during the pre-writ and writ periods and to ensure they remain visible to the public for two years.

Google recently said the demands of the new law are too onerous for its advertising system, which auctions ad space on the fly. It's simply refusing to take political advertisements in Canada around the upcoming election.

Kevin Chan, head of public policy in Canada for Facebook, says the company is trying to exceed the standards the Canadian law sets.

""C-76 is, in fact, very important and consequential legislation. It actually regulates online platforms, including Facebook,"" Chan said. ""In order to comply we actually need to build new systems and new products to be able to do this, so right now we have our product-engineering teams working very, very hard between now and the end of June to ensure that we will be in compliance with what C-76 requires.""

Advertisements that refer to political figures, political parties, elections, legislation or issues of national importance will have to go through an authorization process. This will capture the information of the entity or group buying the ad and ensure the buyer is based in Canada.

Political ads that appear on Facebook during the pre-writ and writ periods will be labelled with a ""paid for by"" disclosure. People will be able to click the disclosure and see the ad library. This library will include information on the ad's reach — who saw it, their gender and location, as well as a range of its impressions.

Information in the library will be viewable and searchable online for up to seven years, which exceeds the period required in the new election laws.

Another effort to exceed the legislative rules will see Facebook using its artificial-intelligence technologies and algorithms to detect ads or content that tries to circumvent the rules.

""We recognize that there's going to probably be the potential for bad actors to try to work around the system — in other words, they may want to run a political ad and not seek to self-declare and not seek to be authorized,"" Chan said. ""That is obviously problematic for us because we recognize that the spirit of what Parliament intended and what we intend, in terms of what we're trying to do, is provide the most transparency for political ads as possible.""

To help Facebook predict what issues might become key points of debate in the federal election, the company has amassed an group of policy advisers from a wide range of political backgrounds and expertise.

The group includes: former NDP MP Megan Leslie; former Stephen Harper aide Ray Novak, who is the managing director of Harper and Associates; Antonia Maioni, McGill University's dean of arts; Ry Moran, executive director of the truth and reconciliation centre at the University of Manitoba; and David Zussman, a professor at the University of Victoria's school of public administration.",Facebook announces changes to political advertising to meet new federal rules,Pique Newsmagazine,https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/facebook-announces-changes-to-political-advertising-to-meet-new-federal-rules/Content?oid=13452275

In Canada, there are 338 members of parliament, 751 members of provincial and territorial legislatures and some 25,000 municipal councillors and mayors. Add to that the number of people who ran for office but were not elected, and Max Cameron, the director of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI), says there are currently more than 75,000 people across the country who are actively thinking about entering politics.

But Cameron believes that number could be higher, and its cohort more diverse, if only Canadians had a better understanding of the entry points and inner-workings of politics.

“There are so many good people who would never go into politics because they don’t find it appealing. They’re deterred by the idea of living in a fish bowl where everyone is looking at you or not wanting to deal with the attacks,” says Cameron. “But without those good people, it’s affecting the way our institutions are functioning.”

With this in mind, through the CSDI, the University of British Columbia launched a non-partisan “boot camp” in 2013 that teaches participants about the day-to-day life of Canadian politicians at the federal, provincial and city level, as well as experimenting with new concepts to improve our democratic institutions.

This spring, Ryerson University’s Faculty of Arts is launching the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson (IFLR), a program modelled after CSDI’s boot camp. Applications are now open and are due by April 1. The program, which costs $1,200, runs over three weekends in May and June and is open to anyone.

Unlike most professions, there’s no concrete training for politicians. The boot camp prepares the participants for the real world of politics, from learning the basics of parliamentary practices and procedures, to how to answer media questions, to how to pass legislation and work with other political parties. The participants also get advice from elected officials, scholars and political journalists who offer mentorship and share their experiences. So far, former NDP MP Peggy Nash and journalist Martin Regg Cohn are confirmed for the Ryerson program.

During the final weekend, participants will head to Ottawa for a mock parliamentary session at the House of Commons. The students will break into political parties, run caucus meetings and try to pass legislation, while also keeping up to date on breaking news and fielding questions from journalists.

Although some of the UBC program’s alumni have gone onto become politicians – like Heather Sweet who was elected to Alberta’s legislature, and Allison Patton, who is on Surrey’s city council – others have gone onto become elected officials in unions or as civil servants. “Whether a participant decides to run afterwards or not, they’ll know much better what the job of a parliamentarian entails,” says Cameron.

Hailey Graham participated in the UBC program in 2013 with political aspirations. “Politics is definitely for me and I think the Institute helped me realize it’s not for me right now, but one day,” says Graham, who is currently in law school in Vancouver.

One of the most enlightening experiences for Graham was learning how to become more self-reflective, something that’s prompted by the instructors throughout the program.

“One of my passions is to have more women in politics, so part of the reflective piece for me was thinking, ‘Who’s taking up space?’ or ‘Who is putting themselves forward into leadership positions right away?’ and ‘How do those people end up getting elected?’” says Graham. “The boot camp highlights those inconsistencies [between different groups of people].”

Cameron says integrating the self-reflective element – something the CSDI picked up from UBC’s medical school – is a way for participants to become better politicians. “It gives them the tools to listen, be more empathetic, find common ground and be able to work with people across party lines,” he says.

Instructors at both Ryerson and UBC’s programs believe that the boot camp is also an opportunity to help elevate groups who have historically been underrepresented in politics, like women, people of colour and LGBTQ- communities.

“For people who haven’t had a political voice or have been marginalized, [IFLR] helps them find ways in which they can articulate their own concerns and do it in the legislature,” says Pamela Sugiman, dean of Ryerson’s Faculty of Arts.

Cameron agrees.

“If you don’t encourage the people who are underrepresented to acquire the skills to be effective statespeople, then politics will be dominated by the same families and social classes as always. Part of our hope for the boot camp is to encourage more inclusion.”

“What we’ve discovered is that in the determination to diversify our audiences, the only success is if we deliver work from underrepresented communities. We’re really making a commitment to that in our programming this year,” says Eric Coates, the GCTC’s artistic director.

The 2019-20 season consists of five plays — all of which were hits when they were staged elsewhere in recent years, Coates says — plus a key role in a new 11-day festival.

From Sept. 12 to 22, the GCTC will be the home base for the Prismatic Arts Festival, which, in line with Coates’s priorities, focuses on Indigenous and culturally diverse artists. The multi-disciplinary festival, which has run in Halifax since 2008, features not only theatre, but also dance, music, spoken word, visual arts, film and media arts.

Prismatic’s artistic director in Halifax “wants to create a stronger international presence for it. He believes Ottawa is the right place, and we’ve agreed to be the home for this pilot project of bringing it to Ottawa,” Coates says.

When Prismatic takes place in Ottawa, its presentations will happen at a mix of venues. The festival’s events at the GCTC will not be included in the GCTC’s subscription series.

The season’s first play is Bang Bang, which manages to tackle the charged issues of police violence, race, appropriation of voice and mental illness as “a very provocative comedy,” Coates says. The play by Toronto-based playwright Kat Sandler was staged in early 2018 at Toronto’s Factory Theatre. Its GCTC run will be from Oct. 22 to Nov. 10.

Cottagers and Indians, another comedy that premiered in Toronto in early 2018, comes to the GCTC Nov. 26 to Dec. 15.

Indigenous playwright Drew Hayden Taylor’s play is all about the interaction of two characters in central Ontario, an Indigenous farmer and a white female cottager, who are at odds after the farmer plants wild rice on the lake shore. “They have this running dialogue about how unreasonable these people are being,” Coates says. Hayden Taylor “writes with an extreme playfulness about very serious conflicts in society,” Coates adds.

The GCTC’s first presentation of 2020 is a unique play called Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools, which pairs Inuk artist Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory and queer theatre-maker Evalyn Parry. The two women had met on an Arctic expedition from Iqaluit to Greenland and the play that has arisen from their encounter addresses the meeting of Northern and Southern cultures in Canada. The play, which also features the accompaniment of two-spirit Cree cellist Cris Derksen, runs from Jan. 22 to Feb. 9 next year. It will be presented at the GCTC thanks to a partnership with the National Arts Centre’s Indigenous Theatre department.

Next spring will see the Canadian premiere of the play Daisy. It was written by Ottawa-based playwright Sean Devine but it premiered in 2016 in Seattle, where it received a Gregory Award nomination for outstanding new play and a Broadway World Seattle Critic’s Choice Award for best new play.

Devine’s play is based on the story behind the creation of the first modern political attack ad, a short clip known as the “Daisy ad” that was in support of Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 presidential campaign. The ad aired just once and then was banned because of the controversy that erupted. “It really rocked convention,” Coates says. “It set the stage for what we’re seeing as the signature of U.S. politics bleeding over to Canadian politics.”

Devine’s play, Coates says, is “is very much like an episode of Mad Men, taken out of that era and environment.” It will run from Mar. 10 to 29 next year.

Concluding the season will be the play Unholy, by Toronto playwright Diane Flacks. The play, which runs from April 21 to May 10 next year, features a debate of the question “Should women abandon religion?,” pitting a former nun and an atheist on the yea side versus a Muslim lawyer and a Jewish scholar.

The witty, provocative play also features a male moderator — “We wish him all the best,” Coates says. He adds that when he saw Unholy staged in Toronto, discussions would inevitably ensue after the play, and that the play drew a strikingly young audience.

Typically the GCTC’s season features the world premieres of one or two plays. However, for the 2019-20 season, “for a number of reasons we just didn’t have anything that was really ready to go,” Coates says.

He says he’ll be pleased nonetheless to see how the upcoming season’s plays will resonate with Ottawa viewers. “I suddenly found myself looking at my short list of plays, and I realized what a great test this would be to see how Ottawa responds to work, compared to other markets. I believe we really do have regional tastes.”

Coates added that “giving local artists a shot at plays that have a proven track record, that have some star quality to them, escalates everybody’s excitement in a different way.”

There's more here than meets the eye. If there isn't, this is the most incredibly incompetent, misguided ...","Politics can be unforgiving. Politicians come and go. The sepia state does not.

Let's be clear. The SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal runs deep and is not limited to one event involving Muammar Gaddafi and Libya. As Chrystia Freeland, our foreign minister, is fond of saying, we are punching well above our weight on this one.

It's been a while since a scandal has covered so many bases. If you are an identity politics aficionado, this imbroglio covers women, Indigenous peoples, Québec sovereignty and Alberta outrage.

Depending on your perspective, the prime minister, in one fell swoop, has wrecked his feminist bona fides by firing a female cabinet minister for standing up to him, hobbled his Indigenous reconciliation initiatives because she is also Aboriginal, and been disproportionately concerned about jobs in Québec, which means he obviously cares little for jobs in Alberta.

Much of this is a stretch but understandable given the prime minister's proclivity for announcing with regularity his immaculate conception (free from original sin). It turns out Justin is normal. He has a temper (a piker compared to Paul Martin); has poor people skills when he doesn't get his way, not unlike his ex-attorney general; seems highly motivated to get re-elected; and is prepared to do weaselly things if necessary (a rank amateur compared to Stephen Harper, who prorogued Parliament conveniently more than once).

The real problem with Justin is that he isn't authentic. That's why he is suffering so much.

Let's compare him to Donald Trump. Trump is a crook, a misogynist, a compulsive liar, intellectually lazy, uninterested in public policy, a bully and not very smart. He continues to be popular with 40 to 45 per cent of the American people.

Let's compare him to Doug Ford. Doug Ford got caught trying to put his unqualified friend in charge of the OPP because he wanted a big-screen TV in his van and someone to talk to when he travelled. When confronted with the obvious, he hid from Question Period for days, and when he came back he started screaming about the opposition playing politics with his decisions. Crazy, really, but I doubt he's paid any serious popularity price.

The reason is that just like Trump, Ford is authentic. He is who he is and doesn't pretend to be something else.

More concerning with this scandal is the behaviour of Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council. He's chippy and defensive. And what's this business about not wearing a wire? Too much Netflix?

In America, this is called the deep state. In Canada, let's call it the sepia state. Very interesting: the current top civil servant in the land is taking calls from the former top civil servant in the land (Kevin Lynch), who happens to be the chair of SNC-Lavalin. The appointment of Mr. Lynch on Jan. 1, 2018 was no doubt made with that call in mind, given Kevin brings no serious experience otherwise to chair a multibillion-dollar engineering company.

I met Mr. Lynch in the mid-’90s a couple of times (not alone) when the magazine industry was fighting an American attempt to dismantle our cultural laws protecting national magazines. I was on the road with John Tory, who was president of Rogers Media at the time. More arresting than Kevin Lynch was a call John took at the corner of Wellington and Metcalf. It was from Joe Clark. He was the newly installed leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, for the second time, and he was calling John to see if he could scare up some airline points so he could actually fly around the country. The party was broke and John had the best Conservative Rolodex.

Politics can be unforgiving. Politicians come and go.

The sepia state does not.

My hunch is that the Liberals led by Michael Wernick are more worried what witnesses in any upcoming trial will have to say about who else is involved in the payoff trail than any job loss in Québec. Remember: where international Canadian companies go, so goes the federal government (Export Development Bank, etc.).

There's more here than meets the eye. If there isn't, this is the most incredibly incompetent, misguided, amateurish meltdown of a federal government in living memory.

Part of the British strategy for ...","“Jewish” used to be considered a religious category. However, for many Jews, that is changing. Increasingly, people who live outside of Israel and identify as Jewish think of themselves as members of an ethnic or cultural group.

For years, researchers have expressed concern that Jewish communities would assimilate and dissipate as religious identification waned. They pointed to intermarriage as an indicator of declining community cohesiveness. For example, they found that in the U.S., half of Jews who are married or in a common law relationship are partnered with non-Jews.

A recent survey reveals that something different is happening in Canada.

A shift from religious identification toward ethnic and cultural identification is taking place. However, the expected assimilation and dissipation of the community is less evident. The intermarriage rate in Canada is less than half that in the United States.

Our family certainly did not follow the path that many researchers anticipated. We got married in 1987. Rhonda converted to Judaism. Our three girls attended full-time Jewish schools. They became fluent in Hebrew to varying degrees. All of them partnered with Jewish men.

While we are both secular in orientation, Rhonda insists that we attend synagogue on occasion. She is the major force behind the organization of activities and preparation of family meals to celebrate Jewish holidays.

We often wondered how common our story is. As senior sociologists in neighbouring Canadian universities, we decided to find out.

Last year we conducted a survey based on a representative sample of 2,335 Canadian Jewish adults in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver – home to 84 per cent of the Canadian Jewish population of about 392,000. Several surprises awaited us.

A strong community

The biggest news coming out of the survey is that the Canadian Jewish community remains highly cohesive. A much higher percentage of Canadian Jews than American Jews make financial donations to the Jewish community, send their children to full-time Jewish school, belong to a synagogue or other type of Jewish organisation and are strongly emotionally attached to Israel. Yet a smaller percentage of Canadian Jews than American Jews believes in God or a higher spirit and thinks that Jewishness is solely a matter of religion.

It is especially among young adults that the religious basis of Jewishness seems to be weakening.

When asked to report whether being Jewish is, for them, mainly a matter of religion, culture or ancestry, young adults are less likely than older adults to choose religion alone.

For these young people, Jewishness is often expressed in their community involvement. Younger Jews are about as active as older Jews on most indicators of community involvement. They are more likely to belong to a Jewish organisation other than a synagogue, light Sabbath candles weekly and donate to Jewish causes.

However, for them, such practices seem to be chiefly a means of achieving conviviality in the family and, beyond that, solidarity with the larger Jewish community.

One interpretation of these findings is that Canadian Jews, particularly young adults, are finding ways of remaining Jewish that are not principally religious. A shift away from religious identification is taking place in other Jewish diaspora communities too, but its replacement by community involvement does not seem to be happening to the same extent.

Canadian exceptionalism?

There are three main reasons why community involvement is substantially stronger in Canada than in the United States.

First, immigration has been proportionately stronger in Canada than in the U.S. since the Second World War. Consequently, 30 per cent of Canadian Jews are immigrants compared to just 14 per cent of American Jews. Canadians therefore tend to have stronger ties to “old country” traditions and languages than do American Jews.

Second, American Jews developed a stronger national identity than Canadians did, partly because the U.S. was settled earlier and therefore had more time for a national identity to crystallize. In addition, American national identity was forged in an anti-colonial war (always a great unifier), while Canadian national identity emerged gradually with the peaceful evolution of independence from Great Britain.

Zionism, the movement to establish a Jewish homeland, appeared on the scene in the late 19th century. It conflicted with American patriotism, particularly for Reform Jews, members of the country’s largest Jewish denomination. Most Reform Jews thought Jewishness should be based on religion, not a national movement.

Not so in Canada, where the Reform movement was weak. By the beginning of the First World War, Zionism was a core element of Jewish identity for the great majority of Canadian Jews. It thus helped to keep the forces of assimilation at bay. It did so by providing a new basis for Jewish identification that became even more compelling after the Holocaust.

The third main reason for Canadian-Jewish exceptionalism is that, out of political necessity, fostering the growth of ethnic institutions has been Canadian public policy since the British conquest of New France in 1760.

Part of the British strategy for dominating the French population was not to quash French Catholic culture, but to help the conservative Catholic Church maintain religious, educational and cultural control.

Two centuries later, shortly after Canada was proclaimed a bilingual and bicultural country, numerous ethnic groups objected that they, too, deserve official recognition and funding. The era of multiculturalism had arrived. For the past half century, strong state support for ethnic institutions has helped all Canadians, Jews among them, to ward off assimilation.

American and Canadian Jews do not differ in all respects. One similarity is the tendency for older Jews in both countries to be more likely than younger Jews to say that caring for Israel is an essential part of being Jewish.

A similar difference between young and old shows up in both countries when Jews are asked about the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Younger Jews are more likely to regard them as illegal by international law. If younger North American Jews are less emotionally attached to Israel than are older members of the community, that may be because they are more likely to disagree with Israel’s policy on the construction of West Bank settlements.

One in three often experience discrimination

Finally, we note a discontinuity of outlook between Canadian Jews and non-Jews.

One in three Canadian Jews believe that Jews often experience discrimination in Canada. In contrast, just one in eight members of the Canadian population at large shares that opinion.

This difference may be due largely to the tendency of non-Jewish Canadians to think of discrimination as mainly a socio-economic phenomenon, while Jewish Canadians tend to think of anti-Jewish discrimination as an ideological matter.

Canadian Jews are not underprivileged. About 80 per cent of Jewish adults between the ages of 25 and 64 have at least a bachelor’s degree. That compares to about 30 per cent of people in that age cohort in the population at large.

However, when Jews think of anti-Jewish discrimination, they have in mind being called offensive names, being snubbed in social settings or being criticized for supporting the existence of a Jewish state.

Of course, we cannot be completely certain of the validity of our findings.

For example, although our generalizations about the relationship between age and community involvement apply across the entire age range, we found it comparatively difficult to recruit 18-to-29-year-old respondents.

It is therefore possible that the youngest cohort in our sample overrepresents highly involved individuals. In that case, the most important relationship we discovered may be a bit weaker than we report. Only more research can discover whether that is the case.

Sexism is still obviously persistent in politics and ...,"A lot of things have changed in this country since Brian Mulroney was its Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, namely that it's no longer OK to call a female politician a ""little girl""— unless of course she is a little girl.

Stranger things have happened. In 2012, a 3-year-old boy named Bobby Tufts was appointed mayor of the tiny tourist town of Dorset, Minn., when his name was drawn from a hat at a town fair.

Amanda Simard, however, is not 3 years old, nor was her name drawn from a hat. She is an elected official and an adult.

Unfortunately Brian Mulroney didn't treat her like one on Sunday. The former PM participated in an interview on Radio Canada's Toute le monde en parle, where he went to bat for Ontario's Francophone Affairs Minister, Caroline Mulroney, a.k.a. his daughter.

""Caroline is always there to defend the interests of francophones in Ontario,"" Brian Mulroney said on the program in French.

He said this because last year the Ontario Progressive Conservatives came under fire for eliminating the province's French language commissioner and for cancelling plans to build a French language university.

Simard, herself a representative of a heavily French-speaking riding, was so displeased with these cuts, she left the PC caucus to sit as an independent. It was an action some Canadians regarded as brave and principled.

Brian Mulroney, presumably, was not one of them. In the interview in question he described Simard like this: ""la petite fille qui a démissionné est partie."" Translation: ""the little girl who resigned has left.""

As far as sexist barbs go, it's certainly an odd one, considering that Mulroney made it in a direct attempt to defend his daughter — a powerful female leader who no doubt has come up against similar sexist stupidity during her time in office, and who no doubt wasn't a fan of it.

It's hard to believe that Caroline Mulroney is pleased with her dad right now, whose remarks suggest he thinks she is as much a little girl as Simard is; a little girl who needs her father to fight her battles in the media.",Emma Teitel: Brian Mulroney should leave politics to the ‘little girls’ of the world who can handle it,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9229576-emma-teitel-brian-mulroney-should-leave-politics-to-the-little-girls-of-the-world-who-can-handle-it/

The Canadian dollar is trading in Toronto very close to where it left off yesterday. FX markets were very quiet overnight with traders adopting a cautious stance ahead of this afternoon’s highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee meeting.



The Canadian dollar had a great morning on Tuesday but a ""not-so-great"" afternoon. West Texas Intermediate oil prices climbed to $59.52 U.S./barrel, and the U.S. dollar was trading softer against the G-10 major currencies. The loonie rallied and broke through 100-day moving average resistance but could not drive above the 75.47-cent level against the U.S. dollar.



U.K. political developments took a toll on positive risk sentiment after the Speaker of the House ruled against allowing Prime Minister Theresa May to table her Brexit deal for a third vote. He insisted it needs to be substantially different which force the PM to seek an Article 50 extension from the European Union. Her letter to that effect is expected to be delivered today.



Those developments and the E.U.’s less than warm welcome to the news pressured GBP/USD overnight. GBP/USD opened at 1.3225, after trading in a $1.3270 to $1.3214 range, and then dropped further in Toronto trading, touching $1.3192, after Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded a confirmation referendum on a Brexit deal.



Today’s release of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting policy statement updated economic and interest rate forecasts and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference gave the US dollar a bit of support in Europe and Asia. The Fed is expected to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged but nudge their ""dot-plot"" forecasts lower. In December, the “dot-plot"" anticipated two rate hikes in 2019. Today’s forecast is expected to show just one. Even so, it still leaves the Fed as the only major G-10 central bank with a tightening bias. The rest are neutral and some, like the Bank of Canada, and Reserve Bank of Australia, could be forced to cut rates.



The selloff in WTI oil prices was due to profit taking ahead of today’s Fed meeting as well and concern about the state of the U.S./China trade talks. A Bloomberg article said China was stepping back from earlier trade concessions even as Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are heading to China next week. Those jitters were an excuse to take profit and undermined the Canadian dollar in the process.



The Canadian government released its 2019 budget. It plans a $22.7-billion spending spree to buy votes ahead of the October election but the news did not impact the Canadian dollar.



The economic calendar is empty, and traders will bide their time until the FOMC meeting concludes at 2:00 p.m. EDT.

Journalism programs from postsecondary schools across Canada have joined together to create J-Schools Canada, an organization meant to promote Canadian journalism education and collaboration among programs.

Susan Harada, associate director of Carleton University’s school of journalism and communications, spearheaded its creation. She said the idea for the organization came from a few journalism educators during a Canadian Communication Association conference a few years ago. She credits Ivor Shapiro, associate dean of undergraduate education and student affairs at Ryerson University’s faculty of communication and design, with first proposing the professional network.

“At a time when journalism is being challenged, Ivor thought that we should try to make some kind of pan-Canadian … organization that would bring journalism schools together,” Ms. Harada said.

According to Charles Hays, program coordinator for Thompson Rivers University’s journalism program and a member of J-Schools’ interim organizing committee, this new network is the first Canadian organization to do that.

Before J-Schools Canada “there wasn’t an organization that really spoke to, or for, or about Canadian journalism education,” Dr. Hays said. He noted that up until now, journalism educators would meet at the Canadian Communication Association conference once a year and then part ways.

He said it’s especially important for journalism educators to have cross-country connections to identify common issues across programs while also respecting different legal, political and cultural contexts found across provinces and regions.

“Our students go and work all over Canada and if we just teach them our own regional perspective, I don’t think we’re serving them well,” Dr. Hays said.

For Mark Hamilton, chair of the journalism and communication studies program at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, a J-Schools Canada member, one of the main draws for joining the organization was its links to J-Source, a trade website dedicated to providing news, research, and industry-related information for journalism professionals, scholars and students. J-Schools Canada produces and supports the website, and members will get access to a special section covering journalism education and pedagogy. Ms. Harada said the members-only section is currently in development.

The site is also accepting pitches for paid reporting assignments and republished content from students attending J-Schools Canada member institutions, and members can advertise on J-Source for no extra cost.

J-Schools Canada members currently include Carleton, Kwantlen, Ryerson, Algonquin College, the British Columbia Institute of Technology, the College of the North Atlantic, Lethbridge College, Mount Royal University, the University of British Columbia, the University of King’s College, the University of Ottawa, the University of Regina, the University of Toronto, and Wilfrid Laurier University.

Any postsecondary journalism program can become a member of the association, which will formalize its governing structure at the annual meeting of the Canadian Communication Association in June (held as part of the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, which this year is in Vancouver).",Canadian journalism schools partner in new association,University Affairs,https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/canadian-journalism-schools-partner-in-new-association/

The Good

Everything Corey Hart

We were all wearing our “Sunglasses at Night” when legendary performer and songwriter Corey Hart was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. A teary-eyed Hart accepted the award and dedicated it to his fans as his wife, Quebec musician Julie Masse, and his four children looked on with tears streaming down their own faces.

“I believe that music and love are the most powerful and enduring forces of good in the world,” he said. “Without music or the Junos, I would have never met my precious Julie. And without love I would have never experienced the miracle of cradling in my arms, my four precious babies… as a songwriter I can honestly say those are the greatest songs I will ever write.”

Cue the waterworks everywhere.

Hart has a long history with the Junos. As McLachlan pointed out, Hart’s “Sunglasses at Night” was the first video to ever win a Juno, but more importantly it was during the broadcast one year that he met Masse, as they presented together. They’ve been going strong ever since. #RelationshipGoals.

In 1993, Corey Hart was supposed to give out #JUNOs for video of the year.

He thought it was wrong for a musician to hand out a visual prize, and balked.

They offered to pair up with Julie Masse to give group of the year. He said yes.

They met that night.

London Calling

How a show opens is always a pretty important indication of how the evening is going to go and the Junos went for hometown hearts with a performance of “Body” by locals-gone-big Loud Luxury. They were joined by the Western Marching Band and the Western Mustang Cheerleaders, who wore their purple loud and proud.

It was an intricate number that undoubtedly sparked a few “They said London!” drinking games on couches across Canada, but it was sweet to see the hosting city get so much recognition. The swelled crowd certainly loved it, and exploded every time another artist coyly nodded, “Hey London,” from the stage.

What a feeling after that AMAZING opening to the #JUNOS. 💜💜💜@LoudLuxury pic.twitter.com/qu9VwoT6rF — The JUNO Awards (@TheJUNOAwards) March 18, 2019

Bülow lights up the stage

Sometimes it’s the simplest performances that resonate the most, as 20-year-old Bülow proved with a stripped down version of “This Is Not a Love Song.” The German-Canadian graced the stage with minimalist makeup and bare feet, using an array of lightbulbs as props while she belted out the hit.

It was only fitting when she won Breakthrough Artist of the Year a commercial break later, and tearfully accepted. We have a feeling she earned a few more social media followers as a result.

After winning last year’s Breakthrough Artist of the Year, it was heartwarming to see the outspoken Reyez take home a statue for RB/Soul Recording of the Year 12 months later. Her speech was the cutest too, as she thanked fans over, and over, and over again.

“If there’s one thing that I leave tonight man, it’s that I am you and you are me,” she said. “If there’s one thing that you’re chasing and you’re willing to work hard for it, do it. Because you can do whatever you want man. Thank y’all so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you…”

And to have that award presented by Sting and super-producer David Foster? Not too shabby.

The Bad

Sarah McLachlan makes it political

The Junos have a long history of sometimes random but mostly musical hosts, like William Shatner, Michael Bublé, Brent Butt and Shania Twain taking on MC duties over the years. This year was Sarah McLachlan’s time to shine, 25 years into her career. And she did shine… for the most part.

As with any awards show, sometimes political speeches land and sometimes they don’t. Rather than address any of the current Canadian political turmoil making headlines or leaning into the music side, McLachlan opted to tackle Trump in her opener and viewers seemed a little thrown.

“You know when you live someplace peaceful and beautiful, and then get a crazy neighbour,” she said. “And they start causing all sorts of trouble like putting up weird walls, picking fights with all the other neighbours, telling your daughters how they should behave, all the while saying they’re making the area great again and you just watch feeling helpless… and hoping they’ll be gone by 2020.”

The remarks weren’t met with (much) anger, per se. Most people just seemed genuinely confused.

Paging Shawn Mendes

Sunday night was unquestionably Shawn Mendes’ time to shine. By the end of the broadcast he walked away with five wins out of his six nominations, including Single (for “In My Blood”), Pop Album and Artist. The only problem? He wasn’t there.

The global popstar is currently on tour and so he wasn’t able to accept any of the accolades in person. Or by proxy. Or by video. It left the show feeling a little hollow and lacklustre, especially when the producers tried to make up for his absence with a “special performance” of “In My Blood” from Amsterdam, which was taped on March 4.

Maybe a heartfelt, taped acceptance speech would have played better, but at least he showed up in some form since he was the night’s big winner.

The fan favourite

Speaking of not showing up, the last award of the night is the we all wait for, and at the Junos, it was the only one voted on by the people who buy the music and the tickets and the merch: the Fan Choice Award. Given Mendes’ online support (hello #MendesArmy) and his big wins it seemed likely that he would sweep the bonus category too, but in the end Avril Lavigne fans showed up and led her to a win. But of course Lavigne wasn’t there either, so instead the night’s big moment just ended with a bit of a whimper.

At least Corey Hart’s show-ending performance was there to save the day.

THE CANADIAN

Indigenous rights

The night was full of tributes and performances, including Jeremy Dutcher’s performance of “Sakomawit” (he won best Indigenous music album during the pre-telecast and was asked to return to the stage by fellow winners Arkells after his thank-you speech was cut off), Elisapie’s ode to women delivered in Inuktitut, and indigenous journalist and author Tanya Telaga reminding everyone of the importance of language in a powerful speech.

Really cool to see Tanya Talaga on the Junos. Seven Fallen Feathers is required reading. And introducing Jeremy Dutcher, who is awesome. — Blake Murphy (@BlakeMurphyODC) March 18, 2019

A mashup of personalities

Sometimes Canadian artists and performers stop by just because they can. That’s how it felt when Rick Mercer, Tessa Virtue, Sting, and the OG grandfather of Canadian hip hop (and former Mr. D star) Maestro Fresh took to the stage at various intervals to present.

And if that’s not enough…. MAESTRO FRESH WES #Junos — Player 57 (@2amgirl) March 18, 2019

Last but not least, what would a Junos be without a little French artistry? We are a bilingual nation, after all. We were utterly confused when Hubert Lenoir took the stage to introduce Beatrice Pirate and Loud in some really weird yellow makeup that went unexplained, but the subsequent performance of “Dans La Nuit” really was beautiful.

The move is part of the social-media giant’s response to changes the Trudeau government has made to Canada’s election laws aimed at stopping bad actors — foreign or domestic — from interfering with Canada’s upcoming federal election through advertising.

Bill C-76, which received royal assent in December, bans the use of money from foreign entities to conduct partisan campaigns. It also requires online platforms, such as Facebook and Google, to create a registry of all digital advertisements placed by political parties or third parties during the pre-writ and writ periods and to ensure they remain visible to the public for two years. Google recently said the demands of the new law are too onerous for its advertising system, which auctions ad space on the fly. It’s simply refusing to take political advertisements in Canada around the upcoming election.

Kevin Chan, head of public policy in Canada for Facebook, says the company is trying to exceed the standards the Canadian law sets. “C-76 is, in fact, very important and consequential legislation. It actually regulates online platforms, including Facebook,” Chan said. “In order to comply we actually need to build new systems and new products to be able to do this, so right now we have our product-engineering teams working very, very hard between now and the end of June to ensure that we will be in compliance with what C-76 requires.” Advertisements that refer to political figures, political parties, elections, legislation or issues of national importance will have to go through an authorization process. This will capture the information of the entity or group buying the ad and ensure the buyer is based in Canada. Political ads that appear on Facebook during the pre-writ and writ periods will be labelled with a “paid for by” disclosure. People will be able to click the disclosure and see the ad library. This library will include information on the ad’s reach — who saw it, their gender and location, as well as a range of its impressions. Information in the library will be viewable and searchable online for up to seven years, which exceeds the period required in the new election laws.

Another effort to exceed the legislative rules will see Facebook using its artificial-intelligence technologies and algorithms to detect ads or content that tries to circumvent the rules. “We recognize that there’s going to probably be the potential for bad actors to try to work around the system — in other words, they may want to run a political ad and not seek to self-declare and not seek to be authorized,” Chan said. “That is obviously problematic for us because we recognize that the spirit of what Parliament intended and what we intend, in terms of what we’re trying to do, is provide the most transparency for political ads as possible.”

To help Facebook predict what issues might become key points of debate in the federal election, the company has amassed an group of policy advisers from a wide range of political backgrounds and expertise. The group includes: former NDP MP Megan Leslie; former Stephen Harper aide Ray Novak, who is the managing director of Harper and Associates; Antonia Maioni, McGill University’s dean of arts; Ry Moran, executive director of the truth and reconciliation centre at the University of Manitoba; and David Zussman, a professor at the University of Victoria’s school of public administration.

By Brian Mulroney

A challenge to visionary leadership in Canada and elsewhere is anti-Semitism.

Anti-Semitism is born in ignorance and nurtured in envy. It is the stepchild of delusion and evil.

The ongoing success of Canada’s Jewish community is consequently often misunderstood, misrepresented and misreported. The rise in the number of attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions in Canada testifies to the intractability of the problem and the constant need for vigilance, consistency and strength in dealing with the entire sweep of anti-Semitism.

The rise in the number of attacks … testifies to the intractability of the problem

In Dante’s Inferno it is noted that “the hottest place in hell is reserved for those who in times of great moral crisis, strive to maintain their neutrality.” In fact, ambivalence on an issue of such importance is for the cowardly, which is why each of us must stand up and be counted, and why our elected leaders cannot duck or dodge.

Anti-Semitic incidents are on the rise everywhere including in this country, where B’nai B’rith reported a 26-per-cent increase in events — such as harassment, vandalism and violence — to 1,752, a record high; to the U.K., where the clueless leader of the Official Opposition directs a motley and pathetic crew that includes open anti-Semites and proud opponents of Israel; to the Continent, where Jeffrey Goldberg reported in The Atlantic that in a recent year 51 per cent of all racist attacks in France targeted Jews although Jews account for only one per cent of France’s population; to the U.S. Congress, where a Democratic representative aroused enormous concerns when she publicly decried “dual loyalties” involving American Jews and Israel.

So new steps must be taken. Among them, the federal government should consider the appointment of a blue-ribbon panel composed of Canada’s most distinguished citizens.

They could examine the growth of Holocaust denial, introduce action in co-operation with the provinces and territories of obligatory education about the Holocaust and the courageous history of Jewish survival, and urge the consideration and implementation of a national action plan to combat anti-Semitism, as Norway and France have done.

Only if Canada reaches out to our youth to obliterate anti-Semitism … will real progress be made in a manner that will honour our citizenship in this splendid country of which we are all so proud.

Only if Canada reaches out to our youth to obliterate anti-Semitism … will real progress be made

After all, according to the Azrieli Foundation, 22 per cent of young Canadian adults haven’t heard about, or weren’t sure they had heard about, the Holocaust. In addition, 49 per cent of young adults in the same survey couldn’t name a concentration camp.

I took an extremely strong stand while prime minister against anti-Semitism in all of its forms. I stood proudly with the Jewish community and with those determined to provide unshakeable support for the state of Israel. Let us always maintain that noble tradition.

Leaders must have vision and they must find the courage to fight for the policies that will give that vision life. Leaders must govern not for easy headlines in 10 days but for a better Canada in 10 years — and they must be ready to endure the attacks that often accompany profound or controversial change, while they await the distant and compelling sounds of a verdict that only history and a more reflective nation can render in the fullness of time. …

Leaders must govern not for easy headlines in 10 days but for a better Canada in 10 years

From the bloodied sands of Afghanistan to the pristine snows and surging waters of the high Arctic — and everything in between — the Canada of 50 years from now will be defined by the leadership we are given today.

Canadian Legal Professionals’ Information Activities: What Do They Do, and How Do They Tweet?

ABSTRACT

The use of social media in professional settings has increased significantly over the past decade. This article presents the results of a statistical analysis performed on a sampling of Canadian legal professionals’ Twitter accounts between 2015 and 2016. A series of tweets were reviewed and subsequently categorized to determine the most common types of information activities occurring on social media accounts, specifically Twitter, from legal professionals.

INTRODUCTION

The use of social media and social networking platforms in a variety of professions, including the legal profession, has significantly increased over the past decade. In 2008, research performed by LexisNexis and Martindale, two of the leading providers of legal content and management resources, showed that more than 50 per cent of US attorneys actively used social media and social networking professionally. Similar research by the International Bar Association (IBA) in 2012 that received responses from 60 bar associations worldwide showed that 78 per cent of participants believed that the use of social media and social networking tools were advantageous for the legal profession.

One social media platform that legal professionals often use is Twitter. Twitter’s self-defined purpose is to

contain information you will find valuable. Messages from users you choose to follow will show up on your home page for you to read. It’s like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you’ll always find interesting—you can discover news as it’s happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time.

The microblogging aspect of Twitter is useful for professionals as it creates posts that are concise, focussed, and clearly depict the intention of the profile owner. Legal research requires precision with highly relevant, quality results while the business of law requires advertising and marketing. Twitter fulfils both these requirements, as it is both a real-time, convenient, and accessible database for current awareness as well as a public platform for self-promotion for legal professionals.

Research that provides a better understanding of legal professionals’ information activities will help to clarify best practices and research methods for legal professionals in an increasingly digital work environment. These findings will also elaborate on the information activities of legal professionals by clarifying their position within existing information behaviour models and providing additional information for the creation of information models directed towards lawyers specifically and, potentially, professionals as a group.

…

Objectives

The purpose of this research is to determine and categorize the information activities of Canadian legal professionals on Twitter. The objectives for determining and categorizing their information activities will include:

Do providers make posts to refer and/or to provide links to current awareness or self-promotion?

a. Does one of these categories occur more frequently? Are there other categories of information?

a. If so, which occurs most frequently? Does one of these categories, including the undefined categories, receive more engagement in the form of retweets and/or likes?

Clarification of the way that legal professionals interact with information through their activity on Twitter should assist in determining their real-time information needs.

Hypothesis

Current awareness and self-promotion will be the two most common information activities legal professionals perform online. Legal professionals will post current awareness materials more frequently than materials for self-promotion. Additional categories of information activities will exist, but they will be less prevalent than current awareness and self-promotion. One category of an information activity will have a higher rate of retweets and likes.

Definitions

Self-promotion: Content that provides announcements on personal involvement in presentations, publications, probono work, receiving awards, etc., related to the legal profession. Self-promotion is a method of enhancing professional image in a positive way to their colleagues, clients, and general public.

Current awareness: Content that is relevant to the legal profession, including case law, recent decisions at all levels of court, periodicals and other legal publications, legislation and additional government resources, news, conference proceedings, blogs, etc.

Alternative categories: Content that could not be described under the previously listed definitions of current awareness or self-promotion.

Methodology

To better understand how legal professionals are using Twitter to interact with information relevant to their work, a snowball sampling of Canadian legal professionals’ Twitter accounts was used. Snowball sampling uses a predefined list of users identified as experts by a medium outside of Twitter. This technique is useful when focussing on national-level or topical-based user groups. The predefined lists were drawn from Canadian Lawyer Magazine and a Twitter list created by a leading Canadian privacy and technology lawyer. Only open Twitter profiles were considered due to the nature of the data extraction tool and the assumption that the nature of the definitions aligned with account owners who were trying to reach a large audience and would, therefore, not maintain a private account.

A total of 67 accounts were compiled in the initial list. This list was reduced to the 25 accounts with the highest number of followers. This decrease is based on the assumption that followers are an indication of authority, validity of content, and consistent engagement. The most recent 50 tweets from each of these 25 accounts (1,250 tweets) were extracted from Twitter into 25 individual .txt .csv compatible files via Professor Michael Smit of the School of Information Management, Dalhousie University, through the use of a command line tool called GET statuses/user_timeline. These sheets were edited to contain only the most recent 50 tweets with information relating to the date the tweet was published, number of likes the tweet received, number of retweets the tweet received, and the text of the tweet for categorical analysis. Retweets were not included in the 50 tweets unless they had content added by the account owner to supplement or alter the original tweet. Each file was examined individually, and data was transferred to a master list after the text of each tweet had undergone categorical analysis.

These tweets were categorized under the previously defined information activities of:

Current awareness

Self-promotion

Alternative

The alternative content group was subsequently analyzed to determine if other categories of information activities were identifiable through reoccurring content themes. Once the tweets were categorized, a quantitative analysis determined which category was the most frequently posted by legal professionals.

The retweets and likes were sorted to determine the category that contained the largest number. The number of total retweets and likes per category were totalled to retrieve the sum of each. The number of tweets in each category was used to determine how many tweets received a retweet or a like. This total number was divided by the number of tweets within each separate category to return the percentage of retweets and likes for all categories.

The accounts were limited to individual legal professionals and excluded institutional accounts, such as law libraries, courthouses, or law firms. This exclusion was due to lack of identification regarding who is posting content and obligations to represent institutional opinions or neutrality. Simply put, legal institutions were assumed to have different information activities on Twitter than individual legal professionals. As the primary goal was to analyze the provision of information and its intended use, conversation tweets (replies) and retweets were also excluded.

Limitations

This study excludes legal institutions that host Twitter accounts due to the variations in information activities they are engaged with on Twitter and the inability to identify whether they have a singular or multitude of owners/contributors. Due to the volume of tweets available and the time frame associated with this study, this analysis was performed on a small scale and is not completely representative of the population of legal professionals in Canada. The selection of the top 50 tweets occurred on March 5, 2016. Twitter is frequently updated, and this analysis may be affected by trending events that occurred within the relative time frame prior to or on this date. Although social media and networking platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn are used, Twitter is the sole focus of this study due to the availability of open data. This study does not focus on passive or intentional searching for the retrieval of information from Twitter. It focusses on the provision of information and its intended use for others.

Results

Sample Population

The 1,250 tweets were drawn on March 5, 2016. The tweets were sent between October 16, 2015 and March 5, 2016. The majority of tweets (86 per cent) were posted within a 12-day period between February 23, 2016 and March 5, 2016. This indicates that the account owners were actively engaging in communication via Twitter. The population of the final 25 accounts consisted of 24 per cent women and 76 per cent men. A 2014 publication from the Law Society of Upper Canada found that, although more women are called to the bar and enter the legal profession by an average of 4 per cent more than men, they often experience a change of status within the first 5 to 10 years of their careers. A change in status indicates that they have opted to take leaves or pursued alternate career paths outside of a legal organization. As a result, the gender ratios are approximately 45 per cent women to

55 per cent men at the associate and general employee level and 21 per cent women to 79 per cent men at the partner level.31 Although these statistics rely heavily on legal professionals who practice law, the majority (63 per cent) of the final sample used for this research were practicing lawyers. This suggests that the sample was an appropriate representation of the current legal field.

The accounts ranged from 1,520–85,800 followers due to the varying prominence of the legal professionals within the field. The breakdown of types of legal professionals is displayed in figure 1. The total number of types of legal professionals was seven, with several account owners holding multiple positions related to the legal profession (e.g., practicing lawyer and professor). The legal professionals identified as practicing lawyers practiced in eight different areas of law, as displayed in figure 2. These areas include business, family, Indigenous, international, labour, personal injury, privacy, and technology. The accounts acquired through the Twitter list created by the leading privacy and technology lawyer may have created a denser population within the areas of technology and privacy, as they practice in these areas of law and likely follow accounts that display content relevant to their area of practice. Eighty per cent of the account owners maintained their own individual websites or contributed to shared websites as authors, editors, and web developers. The remaining 20 per cent were visible on their employers’ organizational or institutional websites but did not generate their own content. Geographically the lawyers were located across Canada, in Ontario (64 per cent), British Columbia (20 per cent), Nova Scotia (4 per cent), Newfoundland (4 per cent), Quebec (4 per cent), and Nunavut (4 per cent) to cover five provinces and one territory.

Categorical Analysis

During the analysis of the tweets, it was discovered that several accounts had duplicate tweets that contained identical content. It was assumed that these duplicates were not intentional, and these tweets were discounted from the analysis to eliminate bias within one category. The total number of tweets analyzed was reduced from 1,250 to 1,243.

The content analysis was done by matching the contents with the previously defined categories: self-promotion, current awareness, and alternative. To accurately categorize the content, all tweets containing links to additional content were opened in separate browser windows and the added content was examined to determine the appropriate categorization. This examination included observing the overall text content, the author, publisher, editor, developer, and organization with which it was associated. It was assumed followers would have information on any blogs or periodical publications that the account owner would post updates on; therefore, if contextual information was not provided in a post (e.g., new post up on John Smith’s Law Blog: newpost.johnslawblog. com), it was still considered self-promotion and not current awareness.

Hypothesis 1 & 2

Current awareness was the most frequently practiced information activity by Canadian legal professionals with 577 (46 per cent) of 1,243 tweets being categorized under this definition. Self-promotion accounted for 291 (23 per cent) of 1,243 tweets and was the second most frequent information activity. Hypothesis 1 and 2 are supported by these findings.

Hypothesis 3

Once the alternative categories column had been populated, it was analyzed to determine consistent themes. Hypothesis 3 was supported by the inclusion of the following definitions of additional categories of Canadian legal professionals’ information activities:

General Communication with Other Legal Professional(s): Content as communication directed at specific individuals that were also identified as legal professionals or to legal institutions, organizations, publications, etc.

Personal Opinion on a Legal Topic: Content focussing on a specific topic pertinent to legal professionals with an explicitly expressed opinion from the account owner without a link to an alternative document or resource on the topic.

Personal Political Opinion: Content focussing on a political topic with an explicitly expressed opinion from the account owner that indicated a bias toward or against a specific politician or party.

Job Posting: Content related to a current opportunity within the legal profession directed at the entirety of their followers.

Unrelated to Legal Profession: Content that did not relate to the legal profession.

The category that occurred most frequently was unrelated to legal profession with 208 (17 per cent) of 1,243 tweets. Two categories occurred at the same frequency: personal political opinion, which included 74 (6 per cent) of 1,243 tweets, and general communication with legal professional(s), which accounted for 71 (6 per cent) of 1,243 tweets. The remaining additional categories, personal opinion on a legal topic and job posting within the legal profession, occurred 18 (1.5 per cent) of 1,243 and 4 (0.5 per cent) of 1,243 tweets, respectively. These findings also support Hypothesis 3, as the additional category unrelated to legal profession occurred 6 per cent less than the next most frequent predetermined category of self-promotion.

Hypothesis 4

The category with the highest number of retweets was personal political opinion with 64 per cent of tweets within this category receiving engagement through retweets. The category with the highest number of likes was general communication with other legal professional(s), with 79 per cent of tweets within this category receiving engagement through likes. Hypothesis 4 was not supported by these findings, as the rate of retweets and likes was not confined to one category. The remaining retweet and like rates per category are displayed in figure 3.

Discussion

Both the predetermined categories and the additional categories suggest that the primary information activity of lawyers is providing, or sharing, information. This type of information activity is supported by the definition of Twitter as a real-time newsfeed designed to suit individuals’ interests. It is the platform that best suits their needs for the provision of information.

Although not included as a hypothesis, during data analysis it became apparent that determining the frequency of participation by each individual account owner within the sample population would be an important factor in establishing the popularity and success of each category. Figures 4 and 5 display the participation rates for each category. These findings correspond to the number of tweets as stated in the results section and support the previous findings.

The predetermined categories of current awareness and self-promotion were the most common types of tweets. These categories can be identified as significant information activities that legal professionals engage in regardless of environment. A new information behaviour model specific to legal professionals could be designed including, or based on, these categories and sharing information activities. It also supports Leckie, Pettigrew, and Sylvain’s research that links roles and tasks to specific information activities. The provision of current awareness information and the action of self-promotion information are two separate tasks that are related to specific roles. For instance, drafting is a role that requires current awareness research as a task. Leckie’s five roles could be categorized under each of these associated tasks to provide a clarification of the type of task associated with each role.

Current awareness was identified as the most common information activity that legal professionals perform online and accounted for almost half of all tweets that were analyzed. These results, combined with the definition of Twitter as a news source, correlate with Mote’s research that indicated that professionals with a wide scope possess the highest information needs. Legal professionals are engaging in highly consistent information activities through the provision of current awareness via tweets. Twitter’s platform for providing information could be used as a technical model to improve electronic legal databases and develop recommended systems for legal resources. The high frequency of current awareness also provides information on the real-time research needs of legal professionals that could be used to improve institutional intranets to display relevant material to the appropriate demographic (e.g., based on type of profession, area of law, geography, etc.) as resources are updated internally.

The frequency of current awareness tweets in the study supports the notion that legal professionals require finding tools for frequently updated databases. Twitter simultaneously acts as a database that is frequently updated by leaders in the area of law while being a repository of these resources organized by individuals’ personal interests. It thus provides a model of a platform through which best practices can be developed and subsequently implemented within alternative databases that possess the legal rights of distribution of large legal publishers of resources like case law or statutes.

The highest rate of likes occurred within the additional category of general communication with other legal professionals. This category provided a link to an external resource the least often. These tweets did contain some discussion with other legal professionals about resources but were primarily congratulatory in nature. When a colleague engaged in an activity that contributed to their professional development (e.g., publishing a book, speaking at a conference, accepting an award or promotion, etc.), the 64 per cent of the sample population that participated in general communication with other legal professionals was likely to tweet a congratulations or compliment and receive likes on this tweet. These findings may indicate that mutual respect and appreciation among colleagues is an effective method of networking and self-promoting via Twitter.

An unexpected theme that appeared in the alternative category were tweets related to the ongoing American presidential electoral process and the most recent Canadian federal election. Although politics certainly have the potential to affect the law, political tweets concerning the ongoing American election or the most recent Canadian election that contained opinionated commentary from the account owner were categorized within alternative and subsequently defined as personal political opinions. If the tweet shared a political update without opinion, it was classified as current awareness. This was to differentiate between tweets with bias and without, as the definition of current awareness does not indicate that a personal bias is present in the dispersion of recent information.

Generally, it is recommended that professional accounts remain silent on personal opinions on polarizing topics such as politics. However, the geographic and political separation of Canada and the United States combined with the dramatic nature of the US election at this time in 2016 may create a setting where Canadians respond positively to these results. This may be indicated by the high rate of retweets that occurred within the additional category of personal political opinion.

Conclusion

This analysis of legal professionals’ information sharing activities on Twitter indicates that the information needs of Canadian legal professionals are largely related to current awareness to support up-to-date legal decision making and self-promotion to increase their presence and reputation within the legal community. These information activities were supplemented by five additional categories of information activities that support information sharing as a significant information activity in which Canadian legal professionals engage. Further research into the definition of self-promotion may assist in understanding the intention and effectiveness of providing self-promotional information. Assessing the opposite information activity of acquiring information via Twitter by Canadian legal professionals would provide an interesting comparative analysis as well.

Additionally, the data describing the rate of retweets and likes suggests that best practices on professional Twitter accounts could be improved through the provision of more current awareness and self-promotion in the form of congeniality amongst colleagues. Databases, intranets, and their related finding tools could be improved based on the information provided through the rate of retweets and likes on specific current awareness topics and an examination of the demographics of an account owner. Finally, the seven categories discussed in this research could assist in supplementing or clarifying existing information behaviour models related to legal and other types of professionals. Twitter is a popular tool for legal professionals, as it is the database that best suits their professional needs.","Thursday Thinkpiece: Canadian Legal Professionals’ Information Activities–What Do They Do, and How Do They Tweet?",slaw.ca,http://www.slaw.ca/2019/03/21/thursday-thinkpiece-canadian-legal-professionals-information-activities-what-do-they-do-and-how-do-they-tweet/

The company had very ...,"Nearly everyone now knows the story of how Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, has alleged that she was unduly pressured by Trudeau and other senior officials to offer a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Trudeau knew all this yet still interfered so strongly with the SNC-Lavalin case, it makes a lot of sense to think that he was only doing so, to protect his political interests.",SNC-Lavalin Scam Was Never About Saving Canadian Jobs,Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13606-snc-lavalin-scam-was-never-about-saving-canadian-jobs.html

The Green Party hasn ...","It’s beginning to look a lot like electoral season. Everywhere you go, political parties are vying for your vote, even going as far as to text Albertans directly. With all too early political messaging and unsolicited texts abound, it makes you wonder why political parties even continue a practice like this.



As many of us know, Mary, the texting robot of the United Conservative Party, wants to know if she can count on you in the coming election. No matter that the election has just been called, the Conservatives have your phone number and now they — or rather Mary — wants your vote. The NDP has their own texter on front lines named Mike, who has been equally as annoying as Mary. The only difference is that Mike seems to be a human, which somehow is even more irritating. At least Mary is just following orders; I expected better from you, Mike.



But hold on, isn’t there some law that prevents Mary and Mike from sending me unsolicited text messages? Well, there is: it’s called Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL). But according to the government of Canada, “commercial electronic messages (CEMs) sent by or on behalf of a political party… are excluded from… CASL, if the primary purpose of the CEM is to solicit a contribution.” The reason for this is that it’s apparently in the public interest to receive these texts. Interest of the party maybe, and even that’s debatable.

It’s appalling that political parties would even consider these tactics. Given that they’re politicians, we can only assume they’re human, and if that’s the case, they should know that when people receive calls or texts from any kind of telemarketer, they will eventually be compelled to automatically reject the telemarketer’s message. It seems these parties were so preoccupied with whether or not they could send these messages that they didn’t stop to think if they should.



Perhaps they think that if a Canadian citizen doesn’t hear from them for a little while, they’ll just assume the party has disbanded. I mean, it could happen. The Green Party hasn’t ever really done that well in Alberta, so maybe they could pack it in someday. But who’s gonna assume the UCP have finally given up the fight? Is anyone actually gonna look down at their phone and say, “Damn, Mary, I forgot we had a conservative party, thanks for the heads up.”



But this is a democracy. Surely if voters really didn’t want to hear from politicians through texts and cold-calls, they’d put their vote elsewhere. The problem is that as we get deeper into the electoral season, these unsolicited messages will likely become a staple of every big party out there. Where can a voter go when all around are parties lowering themselves to the most annoying tactics in order to gain the upper hand? Seemingly the only way to escape this immense political spam is to move to the territories, where the cell reception is made up and Albertan political parties can’t reach you.



Someone needs to let these politicians know they’re only hurting their reputation in continuing with the spam. People have a bad enough view of the government anyways. Things like the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and a little less recently, the Alison Redford expenditure scandal, only work to widen the gap between representative and constituent. Having Mary slide into my DMs is not gonna help your case.

The carbon tax: The carbon tax might become the biggest political football during the upcoming campaign period.,"Alberta has officially entered into the election campaign, one expected to be highly divisive before people head to the polls later this spring.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley on March 19 called the election for April 16, prompting candidates of all political stripes to begin their official campaigns.

The battle for power so far is primarily between the United Conservative Party and the governing NDP, with leaders of each party offering differing visions for the province.

The UCP is currently leading the race, according to some opinion polls, but the party could lose traction as the RCMP investigate former leadership candidate Jeff Callaway’s campaign for irregular political contributions during the 2017 leadership race.

For agriculture, the issues that will likely dominate the headlines include Alberta’s crude-by-rail plan, farm safety, the carbon tax, research funding, abandoned oil and gas wells and rural school funding.

The Western Producer will be on the campaign trail, reporting regularly on issues that affect all producers.

Crude by rail: There are concerns grain shipments will stall once Alberta begins shipping more oil by rail.

The province is spending $3.7 billion to move 120,000 barrels per day by mid 2020, with smaller shipments to begin this summer.

Premier Rachel Notley argues the rail cars are needed to get more Alberta oil to market, given pipeline delays have stalled industry from expanding. She has said grain will get top priority.

Producer groups, however, worry more oil by rail will create logjams, delaying grain shipments to export markets.

Effects of the plan won’t be known until they are in place, but transportation experts think grain should remain unscathed.

UCP leader Jason Kenney has said he would cancel the plan’s contract with Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway, arguing the province could make better use of the money.

Farm safety: Alberta’s newly enforced farm safety legislation will get scrapped if the UCP forms government this spring.

The legislation, which was consulted on at length, has been contentious with farmers, requiring people with non-family employees to have mandatory WCB coverage and follow a set of regulations.

The UCP is proposing to kill the legislation and then re-write its own version by this fall after consulting with producers, likely granting exemptions to small farmers.

The NDP likes to point out the rules don’t apply to family members or neighbours, calling the UCP’s move atrocious because it says it would strip worker protection.

The Ag Coalition, which makes up multiple producer groups, has said it supports the legislation, but there are likely other farmers that’s don’t approve of it.

The carbon tax: The carbon tax might become the biggest political football during the upcoming campaign period.

ADVERTISEMENT

The UCP plans to scrap the tax, which applies to home heating and at the gas pump.

Farmers are exempt from paying the tax on marked fuel and diesel but largely disapprove of it because it affects their bottom line in other areas.

The NDP, however, has argued the tax has reduced emissions and spurred economic development in green technologies, offering people renewable electricity alternatives that, if adopted, lower costs in the long run.

The tax has funnelled millions of dollars to rural Alberta, whether for upgrading farm equipment and buildings or for electricity projects in local community buildings.

Research funding: Agriculture research recently entered the political arena with concerns it’s becoming less farmer-led.

The UCP has charged the NDP has slowed funding to some research organizations, taking more control over dollars.

The NDP has said producers are still heavily involved in research. The government is now focusing on public good research, according to Agriculture Minister Oneil Carlier, rather than funding large profitable corporations.

Abandoned oil and gas wells: There are a growing number of abandoned oil and gas wells on farmland, leaving farmers un-compensated and largely with the clean-up bill.

More to the problem is some operational oil and gas companies have chosen not to pay municipal taxes, putting communities in a difficult position to fund critical services.

The NDP has introduced a number of measures to help with the problem and is expected to unveil more plans to crack down on bad industry players.

In government, the NDP has so far given the Alberta Energy Regulator the authority to tag bad operators, allowing them to not re-authorize drilling licenses if they re-enter industry.

The UCP hasn’t yet announced plans to address this problem head-on, but has said it would review property rights legislation if elected.

The recent Redwater Supreme Court ruling has also changed the game, ensuring bankrupt companies fulfill their environmental clean-up duties before their assets go to bank creditors.

Rural school funding: Rural school advocates are hoping the next government will re-vamp the current funding model, ensuring education in small communities remains viable.

The NDP has said it would look at the model if elected for another term.

The UCP, however, has indicated it would freeze education funding, meaning growing schools wouldn’t get more cash.

Advocates say freezing education might have marginal, if any effects, on rural schools.

The trip, fronted by B.C. Minister of Forests Doug Donaldson, was cancelled after the Dec. 1 arrest of Meng, who was detained on an extradition request from the U.S. while changing flights at Vancouver International Airport.

And the cancellation happened despite advice from Canada’s Beijing embassy that there was no need to change plans.

The China leg of the Asian forest mission was suspended “due to the international judicial process under way relating to a senior official at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.,” the province said in a statement at the time. Donaldson did visit Korea and Japan.

Documents released to Glacier Media under B.C. freedom of information laws, however, paint a different picture.

“With the political situation developing re the Huawei CFO arrest, there are concerns being raised about bringing a minister and delegation into China next week,” said a Dec. 7 email from B.C. Forestry Innovation and Investment CEO Michael Loseth to Dave Murphy, a senior trade commissioner with Canada’s embassy in Beijing.

Documents show Donaldson wanted to speak with Canada’s ambassador to China, John McCallum, with Loseth attempting to facilitate such a discussion.

Murphy didn’t try to stop the visit.

“Business is as usual here right now, no reason to alter plans,” he wrote to Loseth Dec. 8. “If there were reason to change things for reasons of security/safety, advice to travelling Canadians would be updated. This is true for any country in the world.”

Industry delegates continued their visit to China without the government officials.

The decision for Donaldson and others to return to Canada was made after what Kevin Forseth of Forestry Innovation Investment called in a Dec, 9 email, “the end result of 72 hours of pretty intense discussion involving Ottawa, the embassy in Beijing” and the province at deputy minister, minister and premier levels.

Ministry of Jobs, Training and technology deputy minister Fazil Mihlar was also party to the discussions, trying to reach the delegation’s Chinese hosts for discussion of the situation.

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service was also involved with the Pacific region director general offering comments that were blacked out in documents.

When B.C. backed out of the visit, and Chinese organizations also cancelling, concerns were also raised about the security of sites McCallum was set to visit in Xiong’An, a development hub 100 kilometres southwest of Beijing.

McCallum was recalled from his post after telling a newspaper it would be good for Canada if the U.S. dropped its extradition request for Meng. He said if China and the U.S. could reach a deal on Meng’s situation, any deal should include release of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained in China in what many have called retaliation for Meng’s detention.

DELHI CRIME (Richie Mehta). Seven episodes streaming on Netflix on Friday (March 22).

Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta always imagined a career making sci-fi movies, never intending to forge a path that keeps returning to his Indian roots.

His 2007 debut feature, Amal, about a rickshaw driver in New Delhi, was meant to be a one-off calling card. Then he happened across a chain-wallah who inspired 2013’s Siddharth. And then came Ridley Scott, who tapped Mehta to turn crowd-sourced videos from YouTube into the 2016 documentary India In A Day. Despite being raised in the GTA, Mehta has distinguished himself among the few filmmakers rigorously and empathically tackling heavy social issues in India.

Now that platforms like Netflix are disrupting the screen industries in Hollywood and Bollywood and allowing new voices to be heard, more content coming from India is exploring the kind of harrowing subject matter that has never made Mehta flinch. Meanwhile, his work is about to reach his widest audience yet.

Delhi Crime, his seven-part procedural dropping on Netflix, painstakingly details the investigation and social fallout from 2012’s Delhi gang rape in which 23-year-old Jyoti Singh was beaten, raped and tortured with an iron rod by six men on a private bus. She died from her injuries two weeks after the assault. The crime grabbed international headlines, led to protests, riots and some vigilante fervour in a community trying to get a handle on the immense shock and horror and what they should do about it.

The series follows the police investigation spearheaded by the deputy commissioner of police Vartika Chaturvedi (Shefali Shah), who coordinated the hunt for the perpetrators. We don’t see the crime committed, but follow its immediate aftermath. Mehta focuses on the forensics, but as with his previous Delhi-set films, he’s eyeing the periphery.

The show takes place over two weeks in Delhi, observing a patriarchal society where women are routinely victimized, and a widening gap between classes fuels further hatred.

For a Canadian director now residing in the UK, the social structures that feed into gendered violence in India is topical everywhere. Mehta’s investigation into the subject kept bringing me back to the Toronto van attack, and the incel community that inspired it.

Grappling with evil

Mehta is in New Delhi, speaking to me over video chat in the morning, before getting back to work on Delhi Crime’s second season, which will tackle a different crime and likely be released next year. He took five years to develop the first – the last few months consisted of 16-hour days – and the process looks like it considerably aged him since our the last time I interviewed him.

That was in 2013 when Siddharth, Mehta’s devastating fictional story about an impoverished chain-wallah searching for his missing son, had just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. At that time, Mehta had just begun researching the Jyoti Singh case for Delhi Crime.

The filmmaker was in Delhi when Singh was attacked, completing post-production on Siddharth while following news reports about the Singh case and witnessing the fallout. Some time later, his family friend, a retired police commissioner, encouraged the Canadian director to consider making a film about the incident, offering access to case files and the investigating officers.

“I’m reading about evil,” says Mehta, describing the early stages in his three-and-a-half-year research and writing process. “Diving into it. Dreaming about it. Sleeping with it. Eating with it. I became anti-social in that [early] period. Then you continue on and start to put it together, formatting it in a way that’s palatable.”

He repeatedly met with Singh’s parents, reporting on what he was doing and asking whether they approved. The resulting procedural hangs close to police details and the environment they work in, and makes for an illuminative companion piece to compatriot Deepa Mehta’s 2016 film Anatomy Of Violence, which also took on the Singh rape case.

In that film, Deepa Mehta (unrelated) takes a compassionate but not at all forgiving look at the perpetrators, imagining the conditions in their upbringing and social life that might have led to such a monstrous act.

Anatomy Of Violence’s thesis is similar to that of the investigators interviewed by the Delhi Crime creator. The officers, who Mehta describes as “de facto psychologists after many years on the job,” point to the widening gap between the rich and poor, particularly over the last 15 years.

“You have more money in society literally presenting itself,” he says. “More infrastructure being built, more people are wearing their money, and less people have access to it than before. People at the bottom are physically seeing more money present and they don’t have it, which creates a kind of strife.”

The police also pointed to a boom in uneducated youth, particularly among males, and sudden access to pornography on basic smart phones consumed by many young men.

“You’re seeing women rise up [economically] in society in a manner that you’re not [doing],” Mehta continues. “If you’re taught to treat women a certain way – that they have a certain place in a patriarchal system – and see women rising [up] around you, you’re feeling more and more that you want to objectify them.

“All of these things converge and can create these types of explosions in very frustrated anti-social men. There is a swelling anger that manifests itself in psychotic behaviour.”

The overlap between that explanation and the frustrations and social behaviour attributed to incels in the West, particularly in the case of Toronto van attack culprit Alek Minassian, is not lost on Mehta. Anti-social behaviour, ingrained misogyny and a sense of entitlement are all at work.

Mehta attributes a primary motivation for telling this story to a key statistic. While sex crimes in India are rampant, the U.S. and UK have the most reported rape cases per capita: rape cases per 100,000 people in the U.S. and UK are nearly seven times that of India.

That isn’t meant to minimize the issues in India, and certainly the statistic doesn’t take into consideration how many incidents go unreported. But for the director, that number narrowed the distance between East and West and unravelled the prevailing higher-than-thou attitude some Canadians feel toward Indian society.

In movies like Slumdog Millionaire, Lion and even those made by both Deepa Mehta and Richie Mehta, everything from sex slavery to political corruption in India is on display. And while those problems are also evident in Delhi Crime, Mehta found something inspiring to zero in on: the Indian police officers trying to do good despite the obstacles they face.

Keeping the peace

Mehta’s admiration for the officers involved in the Singh case isn’t an apologia for the rampant corruption within the force, from bribery to human rights abuses. The characters in Delhi Crime work to fight these issues.

In 2016, Human Rights Watch reported 591 deaths in Indian police custody between 2010 to 2015, a regular occurrence stemming from a culture of impunity. Even a perpetrator captured in the Jyoti Singh case died in custody. That was ruled a suicide, though some suspect otherwise.

Mehta likens that police culture Serpico-era 70s New York City, and believes the Indian police system needs an overhaul. India upholds the Imperial Police Service left behind by the British. During the colonial period, the Brits were the officers and they relied on locals to be constables. Constables could never become high-ranking officers. That system remains, with class hierarchies dictating ranks.

“Incentive is the key to non-corrupt policing,” says Mehta, pointing out why a constable with no opportunity to move up in their career would be susceptible to bribery and more.

Mehta also acknowledges that women being afraid to report sexual assaults to police affects the statistics. But he’s also noticed, at least in Delhi, more female police officers at every station. India began introducing more all-female police stations in the early 2000s to push back against gender biases and make victims feel more comfortable. That led to a 22 per cent increase in reports of violence against women.

The compassion of a female police officer is what Mehta hangs his entire series on. Shefali Shah’s Vartika is based on Chhaya Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police who oversaw the Singh investigation. Called “Madame Sir” – because the patriarchy gets confused – Sharma is portrayed as a woman whose gutted, visceral response to the attack motivates her to go above and beyond and take total control of the investigation.

“It was her reaction to the crime that led to it being solved,” says Mehta.

When he met Sharma for coffee, the woman behind the counter at the café repeatedly refused to take the deputy commissioner’s money.

“She had this look of ‘My superhero just walked in,’” he says. “Imagine this happening in Toronto. Somebody is in awe of a cop!”

A new Indian mainstream

The conversation I’m having with Mehta today is a great deal more optimistic than the one we had in 2013, particularly when discussing Indian cinema as a whole.

At that time, it seemed like Deepa Mehta and Richie Mehta were the only prominent filmmakers grappling with India’s social issues. Meanwhile, Bollywood spoon-fed audiences glamour and fantasy.

“[Bollywood filmmakers] could be more mindful of the power of what they are able to do,” Mehta had said at the time. “But they aren’t, by and large.”

But then along came stellar work like The Lunchbox, Court and, more recently, Village Rockstars. Those are indie films, but Mehta points out that such distinctions are breaking down, as even more Bollywood films like Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury’s Pink and Shree Narayan Singh’s Toilet tackle gender and social issues.

“Things have changed so much,” says Mehta. And at the risk of sounding like he’s stumping for his benefactor, he credits platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video for aiding that progress, giving new voices opportunities to make compelling projects, and giving audiences access to discover them.

Amal and Siddharth were not released in India until they hit Netflix. Soon after Delhi Crime drops, expect Deepa Mehta’s new series, Leila, on the platform as well.

“Filmmakers, artists and creators are enabled to finally do the thing they’ve been fighting so hard to do. It’s edgier work, more probing. And there’s more grey zone.”

I know many of our local farmers are concerned about the decision by the Chinese government to cancel the canola import permit for Richardson International, one of Canada’s largest grain processors. I share these concerns and have discussed what impact this could have on our region’s agriculture producers with Pouce Coupe’s town council.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry is citing fears of insect infestation as the reason for canceling their canola import permit, however the Chinese government has yet to provide any evidence to support these claims.

We all know that our farmers produce the highest quality canola in the world and that these baseless allegations have nothing to do with Canada’s canola product. Instead, this calls into question the Liberal government’s ongoing failure to handle Canada’s relationship with China.

I am deeply concerned about what impacts these unfounded actions by the Chinese government will have on Canada’s agriculture and canola sector, especially our local farmers. Approximately 40 percent of Canadian canola exports go to China, with a value of approximately $3.6 billion in 2017.

Canada’s Conservatives have requested an emergency meeting of the Agriculture and Agri-Food Committee to discuss the Liberal government’s lack of action on this important file. Opposition Members also requested an emergency meeting of the International Trade Committee to discuss the Chinese government’s revocation of Richardson International’s export registration. This meeting was held on March 17 and members agreed to invite the Ministers of Agriculture and Agri-Food and International Trade Diversification to appear at committee and discuss what is being done to restore market access to China for Canadian canola. However, the Liberal members of the committee voted down inviting the Minister of Foreign Affairs as a key witness, despite Opposition requests for answers to specifically prevent further retaliatory actions by China against Canada.

It is clear that our agriculture producers are paying for the mistakes of Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government on the world stage.

“The Catholic community of the diocese of Quebec shares the pain and suffering of the Muslim families affected by the attack in New Zealand,” said Cardinal Gerald Lacroix of Quebec on Facebook. “Our humble prayer accompanies you. We continue to believe that it is possible to live together in respect and freedom of worship.”

In a rambling online manifesto, the Australian accused in the New Zealand shootings named the Quebec killer among mass murderers who inspired him. Alexandre Bissonnette was convicted of killing six men in the attack on Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre.

In a March 15 letter addressed to Muslim Brothers and Sisters, the president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) Bishop Lionel Gendron of Saint-Jean-Longueuil assured them of the solidarity and support of the Canadian bishops “during this terrifying time.”

“We are horrified that the attack injured and killed so many people, and left behind a feeling of fear and uncertainty in your homes and places of worship,” said Gendron. “For Canadians, and especially Muslim Canadians, this act of horrific violence is a painful reminder to the shooting which took place Jan. 29, 2017.

“As the Muslim communities and the entire population of New Zealand mourn the dead and care for the injured, the Catholic community of Canada extends to you its fraternal proximity and assurance of prayers and support,” he said.

The Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Quebec also reacted quickly with a statement March15 as they wrote they learned “with horror and pain” of the “terrible crime” committed in New Zealand “against people who only prayed” while meeting in their spring plenary in Trois-Rivières.

“The Bishops reaffirm that religious freedom is a fundamental right that everyone has the duty to respect and they unite their voice to all those who denounce and reject violence in all its forms,” the statement said.

“It’s an evil act, for starters,” said Anne Leahy, former Canadian ambassador to the Holy See who is now a professor at McGill University teaching Catholicism and public policy. “It’s something everyone needs to take a stand against.”

Leahy said more needed to be known about the motivations of the young Australian involved in the killings, but has found reports of the killer being motivated by white supremacy “quite worrying.”

“The political leaders can take a stand and condemn this sort of event for what it is, not to fudge it,” she said, noting that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “names the tragedy for what it is, an attack against Muslims.”

“It was an act of hatred against specifically Muslim worshippers,” she said. “We have to name the evil to specifically fight the evil.”

Leahy said the response of Quebec officials two years ago set the right tone. In the immediate aftermath, the mayor of Quebec, the Premier, the Cardinal of Quebec and the Imam of the mosque made “great shows of solidarity,” she said. “Their words, effectively made the right gestures and helped a lot in the healing.”

“That was far more important and relevant to citizens in a given place than debating in parliament.”

The reaction of Quebec after the Quebec shooting was “a cry of conscience,” and “an improvement in the attitude of people towards Muslims who have been living amongst Quebeckers for many years,” Leahy said.

In Toronto, hundreds of Torontonians turned up at Nathan Phillips Square on March 15 in response to the New Zealand shooting.

“The place where you practice your religion should be the place where you feel safest,” Ryerson University political science student Shehaz Shabbir told The Catholic Register.

Whether the massacre had taken place in a church, temple or synagogue, he would have brought his friends from the Ryerson student union to the square in front of City Hall to protest, Shabbir said.

“If something can happen over there, it can happen here as well,” he said.

Fatima Ahmed stood in the rain holding a “United Against Islamophobia” sign with her two young sons, Adam and Yasin, because she felt it was important that her boys see her city, her country and people of good will everywhere are not on the side of hate and violence.

“I’m here to say no to hate,” she said. “We need to know and love each other. I think the problem is that we don’t know each other.”

Representatives of all three levels of government and people representing a wide range of faiths were at the protest quickly organized on social media by TorontoMuslims.com, Muslim Youth Fellowship, Faith in the City and the Urban Alliance on Race Relations.

“Once you get past the utter shock and horror of such a barbaric act of mass murder, you have to focus in on what this man did and what was motivating him,” said Andrew Bennett, former ambassador of religious freedom and now director of the Cardus Religious Freedom Institute. “What was motivating him was evil and hatred of Muslims,” he said. “This man killed 50 people when they were being most fully themselves as human beings from a religious perspective.”

A place of worship, whether a mosque or church or temple, “should be the place where we feel most secure and are able to be most fully ourselves.”

The response has to be greater advocacy for religious freedom, Bennett said. People must be “able to publicly live their faith,” to “publicly worship” and be “free to act on what they believe and what they confess in worship in living out their daily lives.”

A heathy, pluralist society must have broad religious freedom, he said, but we must “draw a very clear distinction between violent acts of hatred which are never acceptable and when people out of genuine belief publicly privately disagree with others about what they believe.”

“The reality is that humans believe very different things, theologically, ethically, ideologically, but if we’re going to have a common life together, if we’re going to live next to one another, we have to be willing to accept difference,” he said.

A key is the respect for the dignity of the individual, despite disagreement. Bennett said Canada’s laws provide penalties for preaching hatred or advocating violence against individuals or a group of people or against the civil order.

However, Bennett said people “should be free to publicly differ about what they believe.”

“As a Catholic, I should have the freedom to publicly say I disagree with Islam,” he said. “I believe Islam is wrong and the fullness of Christ is to be found in Jesus Christ. Likewise, a Muslim friend of mine has every right to say to me, “You’re wrong and I don’t believe Jesus Christ is the incarnate Son of God. He was a prophet.”

“The hard red line is when people begin to advocate violence and open hatred,” he said. “There needs to be proper limits and we have got provisions already within the statutes.”

“There can be no toleration of violent acts against any human being let alone against human beings in public prayer,” Bennett said.

The New Zealand shooter is said to have been radicalized on social media, and that concerns Bennett.

Social media is “where a lot of this stuff thrives,” he said.

“Social media does not build up community; it breaks down community, because you are not in physical proximity to the people you are having a debate with,” he said. “It’s easy to dehumanize the person, when not having physical contact with them.”

“We need to be much more questioning on what is going on in social media, and build up genuine human community in our neighborhoods, not electronically but actually physically present with one another.”

This story was originally published by National Observer. It appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

A surge in US and Canadian oil production over the last decade has added the equivalent of “one Russia or one Saudi Arabia” to the markets—pushing the planet farther away from ever getting a grip on the pollution that is driving climate change.

Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, revealed this fact Feb. 26 while discussing what he saw as a “growing disconnect” between the countless scientific studies calling for a decline in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions—each more urgent than the last—and the fact that pollution continues to rise, hitting a record high last year.

In order to avoid the extreme flooding, drought, heat waves, rainfall, disease outbreaks and other dangers to human health that climate change will provoke, nations must stop burning fossil fuels in sufficient amounts to limit the rise in average surface temperature to below two degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.

The problem, said Birol, is that there is already no more room to increase the amount of pollution that humans add each year to the atmosphere. All of the cars, trucks, power plants, factories and other facilities that have already been built around the world, he said, will eat up the rest of the planet’s so-called “carbon budget”—an expression used to describe the maximum amount of pollution that could be generated if the planet wants to limit the rise of average global temperatures—by 2045.

Canada has committed to investing billions of dollars over the next several years in clean technology that Birol said can take a big bite out of oil demand. For example, the Trudeau government is investing in a national network of electric-charging stations to help precipitate a flood of electric car sales in the 2020s.

The government is also establishing a nationwide price on pollution and is phasing out emissions from coal-fired power generation through regulations by 2030. It is working to expand an international coalition to follow them as rapidly as possible.

But the government also spent billions of dollars to buy the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and expansion project, and Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi recently announced $1.6 billion in support for the oil and gas sector to expand into new markets. Even Ottawa’s electric-car charging fund is also supporting natural gas refueling stations.

Those waiting in the wings to take power in Canada promise even more fossil fuel exploitation. Official Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has referred to Canada’s oil as the “cleanest” energy in the world, and continues to do so despite petroleum needing to be kept in the ground to keep global warming in check.

The Liberal government does not see a contradiction in all its efforts. It says decarbonization won’t happen overnight, and needs to be encouraged over several years, with the energy sector continuing to receive support in the interim. It sees lower-carbon shifts, such as from diesel to natural gas, as better than doing nothing.

Even so, a report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development describes how clean tech companies in Canada are facing challenges competing on a level playing field with the financially powerful oil and gas sector.

Sohi told National Observer in an interview that a lot of clean tech innovation in Canada relates to the natural resources sector itself, so he saw these developments as not actually “working against each other.”

“You need to basically look at it in a holistic way,” said Sohi. “I think that’s what we are focused on. We are supporting a lot of investment in new technology.”

“Full impact” of oil surge not yet felt

During an Ottawa speech alongside the minister and University of Ottawa professor Monica Gattinger, Birol laid out a stark assessment of the planet’s energy picture, and the uphill battle facing nations in cutting their carbon emissions.

Oil production in North America has more than doubled since 2009, despite Canada promosing to cut its carbon emissions since the 1990s. A decade ago, Birol said, US and Canada together produced roughly 10 million barrels per day of oil, and today that number is roughly 22 million.

The increase in production alone is equal to “one Russia or one Saudi Arabia” in additional output, he said, and an increase in natural gas is a “similar story.”

“I believe the full impact of the North American oil and gas surge has not been felt yet” in terms of energy markets and petro-politics.

“I believe the full impact of the North American oil and gas surge has not been felt yet” in terms of energy markets and petro-politics, said Birol.

In addition, a deluge of new coal power plants that have been built in India, Indonesia and Philippines over the last decade are expected to last another 40 years without intervention, he said, and are already responsible for a third of global carbon emissions.

While coal plants in North America and Europe are typically close to retirement, he said newer plants in Asia aren’t disappearing anytime soon.

This year’s Climatescope survey by BloombergNEF of 103 nations similarly warned that around 86 percent of coal-fired generation under construction is due to come online in the next several years in China, Indonesia, India and South Africa.

But for Birol, an important aspect of the climate change debate is getting overlooked: how current facilities are already clogging up our atmosphere.

“Leave aside for a moment what we are going to build that’s new,” he said. “I asked my colleagues, can you please calculate in the next 25 years, how much emissions will come from existing power plants, existing industrial facilities, existing cars and trucks, throughout their economic lifetime? The answer, ladies and gentlemen, was very depressing.”

A full 95 per cent of the planet’s remaining carbon budget will be eaten up by existing infrastructure, he said.

“We have no room to maneuver, in other words. If we want to be in line with the Paris target, we wouldn’t build any non-zero carbon plants, no new cars, no new factories—and all the ones we have, we shut them down. So of course, that’s practically impossible.”

Getting clean tech off the ground

Most of the world’s nations, including Canada, have committed to the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the global average temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius.

The agreement allows for each country to come up with their own nationally-determined contributions. Canada’s current target is to cut 30 per cent of its emissions below 2005 levels by 2030.

However, each nation’s commitments, added up, are insufficient to keep warming under two degrees, according to the United Nations. The UN’s environment program reported in November that they would result in roughly three degrees of warming by 2100.

And that even assumes countries will be able to meet their own promised targets. Canada, for example, will fall short of its target unless it can close a gap of 79 million tons of carbon pollution.

Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna said in December that she is banking on future technologies, increased use of public transit and future efforts of provinces and territories to close that gap.

Relying on future technology is not entirely pie-in-the-sky thinking. Birol said global electricity demand is growing twice as fast as global energy demand, suggesting the electrification of economies, as a result of digitization and an increasing share of renewables like solar and wind power.

Last year, solar was the largest growing power sector source in the world. Costs have plummeted and many governments are encouraging solar energy adoption. The developing world, in fact, is now deploying more renewables than developed nations. “We are going to see a big role for solar in the years to come,” Birol predicted.

The US $1.1 trillion global low-carbon economy is growing overall, with compound annual growth of four per cent from 2008 to 2015, the IISD reported. But its January report by economist Céline Bak referred to “market failures” in getting clean tech off the ground in Canada.

“Evidence shows that Canada’s array of low-carbon innovation policies can seed a vast nursery of potential trees, and yet few strong oaks have yet emerged,” she wrote.

“Emerging firms are struggling to operate in the low-carbon economy, where prices for the commodities they replace—including energy derived from oil and gas—are volatile and where prices for the pollution they address—such as carbon—remain low and are also subject to volatility.”

Sohi disagreed that clean tech and oil and gas were at loggerheads in the markets.

“I think that the kind of innovation and investment in new technology, or development of new technology that has happened in Canada, a lot of that actually relates to the natural resources sector—the oil and gas sector, the forestry sector or the mining sector,” he said.

“Clean tech is growing, and we will continue to support it.”

“Clean tech is growing, and we will continue to support it,” added the minister. “We are investing in products that allow the testing of solar panels that capture energy on both sides…a project in Halifax that is investing in technologies in tidal power…in Regina that is investing in geothermal….in BC that is testing tech around autonomous vehicles.

“Yes, those technologies take time to be developed, then commercialized, then put into use. I think we are doing whatever we can—and we are doing a lot of investment into fundamental sciences.”

He also referred to the government’s commitment to phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. National Observer reported in February on a letter sent to an Ottawa-based organization that suggested the government was still working on identifying certain subsidies years into its effort.

Sohi promises many more electric car chargers

A key low-carbon transformation is electric vehicles. All the cars in the world consume a fifth of global oil production, so electrification can take a serious bite out of fossil fuels, as long as they’re charged from non-emitting power sources like renewables, hydro or nuclear. In Canada, over four-fifths of the electrical grid is already non-emitting.

“We made a commitment to create more electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country, and we have a plan in place,” said Sohi.

In January, National Observer reported that 45 per cent of the funding in a program that had been described as a boon for electric vehicles, was actually going towards natural gas refueling stations.

Electric vehicle advocates said at the time that they felt slighted that the program wasn’t advancing the cause of electrification as much as it could.

Under the program, the electric vehicle charging stations have cost about $50,000 to install, making them much cheaper than natural gas stations which cost around $1 million each.

Departmental officials stress that the program, funded by the 2016 and 2017 federal budgets, is intended to be a six-year, $182 million undertaking and the government is still in the process of rolling out new applicants.

The $6.5 million that had been given out for natural gas refueling by the end of January already represented a large portion of the $22 million overall that is being allocated to natural gas, they say.

That means that, assuming the program survives federal budget cuts over its six-year lifetime, much more money will end up flowing to zero-emission stations like electric chargers and hydrogen refueling than to natural gas.

“There are a few announcements that have been made—there are a lot of other announcements that are coming in the next number of months,” said Sohi.

“You will see how we are supporting electric vehicle charging infrastructure. We have a process in place, and our department reviews those applications.”",US and Canadian Oil Production Push the Planet’s Climate Goals Out of Reach,Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/03/us-and-canadian-oil-production-push-the-planets-climate-goals-out-of-reach/

The sixth book in his Transdimensional Authority series, Good Intentions also begins the Multiverse Refugees Trilogy as the First Pie in the Face (you'll understand if you read on).



Ira says, ""I decided I wanted to write a story about refugees. Sure, it's not an uncommon trope in speculative fiction, where aliens are sometimes metaphors for human beings, but I figured nobody had approached the subject quite like I would. I also came by the story honestly: my father came to Canada as a war orphan from Europe in the late 1940s, while my mother's family fled persecution in Russia a generation earlier. I know what refugees contribute to the country, and have been incensed by the increasing xenophobia in both my country and the world at large. Anger is the satirist's rocket fuel.""



At the end of the second novel in the series, the chief scientist of the Transdimensional Authority set up an alarm to warn him if a universe is succumbing to the universe-killing machine that was at the heart of that story. One of Ira's original inspirations for Good Intentions was: how would the Transdimensional Authority respond if that alarm went off?



The refugees from the ill-fated universe are short aliens with blue skin. The first one we meet, Rodney, wearing an impeccable suit, always carries a briefcase with him, out of which he seems able to pull any inanimate object that he needs. This includes pies, Rodney's preferred means of introduction (now you might understand the subtitle of the book).



Peter Buck, Director of Word Wrangling at Elsewhen Press says, ""Ira has a unique and highly distinctive way of telling a story: at times surreal, rarely predictable, always funny and often poignant. Like the consummate satirist that he is, Ira entertains you with an unputdownable story that makes you laugh out loud and by the end you realise he has also made some extremely important points for you to think about. Perhaps the world's so-called 'leaders' should be made to read Ira's stories and then maybe they might start to exhibit a little more humanity. Or would that be too much to expect?""



Good Intentions (The Multiverse Refugees Trilogy: First Pie in the Face) will be available to buy on all popular eBook platforms from 1st April 2019 (yes, April 1st!) and is already available to pre-order. The paperback edition will be available on 3rd June 2019.



Notes for Editors

About Ira Nayman

In another life, Ira Nayman was a skydiving WWI hero, a yak herder in the treacherous Rocky Valleys and the lead guitarist for the band The Strange Feebles. Since that other life happened in another universe, it may not be as impressive to you as it sounds.



In this universe, Ira is celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of his decision to devote his life to writing comedy, in all of its forms and in a variety of media. His Web site of political and social satire, Les Pages aux Folles, has now been updated weekly for over fifteen years. The ninth book in the Alternate Reality News Service series, E Deplorables Unum, was self-published in January, 2019; two more books in the series will be published before the end of the year. Good Intentions is his sixth Multiverse novel published by Elsewhen Press.

Ira is also surprised to find himself the editor of Amazing Stories magazine. Yes, that Amazing Stories magazine. I know, right?

He finds his life in this universe exciting enough. The way things go, he's probably allergic to sky…

His aggressive promotion of regime change in Venezuela also fit with the politics of an ...,"CIIA cum CIC

Aside from government officials the dominant media is fond of quoting “experts” from foreign policy think tanks when discussing Canada’s role in the world. While presented as neutral specialists, these opinion shapers are generally entangled with powerful, wealthy, elites.

Take the case of Venezuela and Canada’s leading foreign policy ‘ideas organization’. Recently Canadian International Council President Ben Rowswell has been widely quoted promoting Ottawa’s regime change efforts in Venezuela. After 25 years in Canada’s diplomatic service, including stints as chargé d’affaires in Iraq and ambassador in Caracas, Rowswell joined the CIC in November. Rowswell’s move highlights the close relationship between Global Affairs Canada and this corporate funded think tank, which has deep imperial roots.

Formerly the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, CIC has 15 (mostly university based) regional branches that hold dozens of conferences and seminars annually. The head office publishes International Journal, Behind the Headlines as well as reports and books. It also does media outreach.

Officially formed in 1928, CIIA’s stated aim was to promote “an understanding of international questions and problems, particularly in so far as these may relate to Canada and the British Empire.” Its first meeting was held at the Ottawa home of staunch imperialist Sir Robert Borden, prime minister between 1911 and 1920. (Borden publicly encouraged Canadian businessmen to buy up southern Mexico and sought to annex the British Caribbean colonies after World War I.) Borden was made first president of CIIA and another former prime minister, Arthur Meighen, became vice-president in 1936. On hand to launch CIIA was the owner of six Canadian newspapers, Frederick Southam, as well as Winnipeg Free Press editor John W. Dafoe and Ottawa Citizen editor Charles Bowman. “The CIIA’s early leadership constituted a roster of Canada’s business, political, and intellectual elite”, explains Priscilla Roberts in Tweaking the Lion’s Tail: Edgar J. Tarr, the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, and the British Empire, 1931–1950.

CIIA’s genesis was in the post-World War I Paris Peace Conference. At the 1919 conference British and US delegates discussed establishing internationally focused institutes. The next year the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA), or Chatham House Study Group, was founded in London and in 1921 the Council on Foreign Relations was set up, notes Imperial Brain Trust: The Council on Foreign Relations and United States Foreign Policy, “to equip the United States of America for an imperial rule on the world scene.”

The driving force behind these international affairs institutes was British historian Lionel Curtis. An “indefatigable proponent of Imperial Federation” and former Colonial Office official in South Africa, Curtis set up a network of semi-secret Round Table Groups in the British Dominions and US. The aim was “to federate the English-speaking world along lines laid down by Cecil Rhodes”, the famous British imperialist. The Rhodes Trust and South African mining magnet Sir Abe Bailey financed the Round Table Groups and former British Secretary of State for War Lord Milner promoted the initiative.

Before its official formation CIIA sought to affiliate with RIIA. A number of prominent Canadians were part of Chatham House and the Canadian elite was largely pro-British at the time. “Much of the impetus and funding to” launch CIIA, Roberts writes, “came from Sir Joseph Flavelle, a meatpacking and banking magnate who strongly supported British Imperial unity. Other key Anglophile supporters included Newton W. Rowell, a leading Liberal politician, the wealthy Liberal politician and diplomat, Vincent Massey, and Sir Arthur Currie, commander of Canadian forces on the Western front during the war, who became principal of McGill University in 1920.”

The CIIA’s early powerbrokers generally identified with British imperialism. But its younger members and staff tended to back Washington’s foreign policy. In subsequent decades US foundation funding strengthened their hand. The Rockefeller Foundation accounted for as much as half of CIIA’s budget by the early 1940s. Alongside Rockefeller money, the Carnegie Corporation and Ford Foundation supported the institute. Set up by US capitalists responsible for significant labour and human rights abuses, the Big 3 foundations were not disinterested organizations. In The Influence of the Carnegie, Ford and Rockefeller Foundations on American Foreign Policy Edward Berman writes: “The Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller foundations have consistently supported the major aims of United States foreign policy, while simultaneously helping to construct an intellectual framework supportive of that policies major tenants.”

In subsequent decades CIIA would receive significant funding from Canada’s External Affairs and the Department of National Defence. But the institute’s nonfinancial ties to the government have always been more significant. After nearly two decades at External Affairs, John Holmes returned to lead the institute in 1960. In Canada’s Voice: The Public Life of John Wendell Holmes Adam Chapnick notes, “during [Prime Minister Lester] Pearson’s time in office [1963-68] Holmes had unprecedented access to the highest levels of government. He could reach Pearson personally when he was in Ottawa, and the Prime Minister promoted the CIIA while entertaining. Holmes also drafted speeches for Minister of Trade and Commerce Robin Winters.”

Upon leaving office external ministers Lester Pearson, Paul Martin Senior and Mitchell Sharp all took up honorary positions with CIIA. In 1999 former foreign minister Barbara McDougall took charge of the institute and many chapters continue to be dominated by retired diplomats. Active Canadian diplomats regularly speak to CIIA meetings, as did Prime Ministers Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chretien.

Alongside Ottawa and US foundations, Canadian capitalists with foreign policy interests also funded CIIA. Annual reports I analyzed from the late 1960s to mid-1990s list numerous globally focused corporate sponsors and corporate councilmembers, including Bata Shoes, Toronto Dominion, Bank of Montréal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Brascan, Barrick Gold and Power Corporation.

In 2006 CIIA’s operations were subsumed into CIC. With financing from Research In Motion (RIM) co-founder Jim Balsillie, CIIA partnered with the Balsillie-created Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) to establish CIC. The CIIA library and its publications were maintained while an infusion of cash bolstered local chapters. The new organization also added a major national fellowship program, which is headquartered at the University of Toronto’s Munk Centre for Global Affairs.

Balsillie was made founding chair of CIC and the initial vice chairs were former foreign ministers Bill Graham and Perrin Beattie. “The CIC promises to transform the debate about and understanding of Canadian foreign policy,” said Balsillie in 2007.

Balsillie put up $1-million in seed funding and launched a fundraising drive in the corporate community. Trying to drum up support for CIC, Balsillie wrote a commentary for the Globe and Mail Report on Business, explaining that “in return for their support, contributing business leaders would be offered seats in a CIC corporate senate that would give them influence over the research agenda and priorities of the new council.” In another piece for the National Post Balsillie wrote: “To create a research base on Canadian foreign policy, I have spearheaded the creation of the Canada-wide Canadian International Council (CIC). The Americans have their powerful Council on Foreign Relations, which offers non-partisan analysis of international issues and integrates business leaders with the best researchers and public policy leaders.”

The CIC Senate has included the CEOs of Barrick Gold, Power Corporation, Sun Life Financial and RBC. According to the most recent financial statement on its website, half of CIC’s funding comes from corporate donations (a quarter is from its International Journal and another quarter from dues).

406,Politics,2019-03-18T18:48:00.0000000Z,Singh is the first racialized leader in the Commons in Canadian history. The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill. Singh won his new Burnaby South ...,"OTTAWA — Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection — made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart — ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.","NDP's Jagmeet Singh steps into the House of Commons, making history",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/ndp-s-jagmeet-singh-steps-into-the-house-of-commons-making-history-1.23667038

They’ll get a job,” SNC CEO Neil Bruce said in an interview with Canadian Press. “This thing that somehow they’re going to be unemployed ...","Justin Trudeau continues to have problems with women in his Liberal caucus.

On Wednesday, Trudeau lost another prominent woman as Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes announced that she would leave the Liberal caucus and sit as an independent until she leaves Parliament come the election in October.

Caesar-Chavannes had previously announced that she would not run in the next election.

She also revealed that when she told Trudeau of her decision, citing the impact of politics on her family, that he yelled at her and claimed she wasn’t grateful enough for all his help.

“I no longer want to distract from the great work my caucus colleagues are doing,” Caesar-Chavannes said on Twitter.

She told CBC that she had become a distraction after her interview with the Globe and Mail where she revealed Trudeau’s harsh treatment.

“While I support the values and principles the Liberal Party that it might be good, since that message did go out, that I sit as an independent for the rest of the term,” she told CBC.

As Trudeau lost yet another woman — both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott have resigned from cabinet and Caesar-Chavannes has resigned from caucus — the PM faced claims of being a fake feminist.

It was a claim Trudeau hit back against while speaking at a media event in Ottawa, saying he supports abortion while the Conservatives do not.

“People need to focus on the actions that we’ve taken as a government,” Trudeau said when asked about the fake feminist claim.

“And the contrast with the Conservatives who still can’t reconcile themselves to unequivocally defending a woman’s right to choose.”

So there you have it ladies, have all the abortions that you want, just don’t speak out or try to raise your voice.

That is Justin Trudeau’s brand of feminism.

“What I believe a feminist is, is somebody who treats women equally, believes that women have an equal voice at the table, should be treated equally in every way shape and form,” Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen told reporters after Question Period.

Bergen said that unlike Trudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer does treat women equally and fairly.

She also alluded to Trudeau’s oft-cited claim about men and women experiencing events differently.

“That would be Justin Trudeau’s explanation,” Bergen said.

“That seems to be his explanation every time a woman challenges him or every time a woman describes an experience with him that isn’t positive.”

Trudeau used the line that men and women can experience events differently to respond to groping allegations that resurfaced last summer, some 18 years after they were first made.

Both he and former top advisor Gerry Butts also used the same line to claim that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould simply didn’t understand what was happening when Trudeau and Butts pressured her to give a sweetheart deal to SNC-Lavalin to escape bribery and corruption charges.

Caesar-Chavannes wasn’t Trudeau’s only headache on Wednesday.

The PM has maintained that he only pressured the former attorney general to drop criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin to protect jobs yet the CEO of the company said in an interview that the PM is off the mark.

“There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They’ll get a job,” SNC CEO Neil Bruce said in an interview with Canadian Press.

“This thing that somehow they’re going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.”

Trudeau desperately wants this issue to go away but he keeps having his main messages proven false and key people in his party or his office resign.

The question everyone is asking is, who is next?

408,Politics,2019-03-21T04:07:00.0000000Z,"These are people of integrity, and in our political system it’s so rare for a cabinet minister ... One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal ...","In conversation with The Journal after her Community Matters town hall meeting in Ashcroft on March 5, Green Party of Canada leader and Saanich-Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May was asked whether the Green Party had more work to do to get away from the idea that they are mainly concerned with a single issue.

“Absolutely. Right now Canadians are looking around and thinking ‘I don’t feel like I want to vote “fill in the blank”.’ A lot of people are no longer as rooted in one party only. Growing up in Cape Breton, you used to feel that if someone’s parents were Liberals, they were always going to vote Liberal. It was almost genetic.

“That’s changing. People are looking around and thinking ‘Where do I want to put my vote? Who’s earned my vote?’ And almost by process of elimination people find themselves looking at the Green Party with new eyes. So we really have to explain ourselves. We’ve always had credible platforms, budgeted programs that are more detailed and fiscally sound than other parties. But a lot of people don’t know that, because the media coverage hasn’t shown us as the viable option. Now they are.

“Going into the 2019 election we do have work to do. We have an obligation to offer Canadians a viable alternative that answers the questions that they have.”

One of the main questions, May said, was to do with the idea that the Greens are against the economy; that if you care about the environment you are somehow against the economy. “That isn’t valid, but it’s been pitted like that for so long that people have a tendency to assume that’s going to be a problem in voting Green.”

May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada have set a standard for being hard-working and ethical. “We’re open to ideas, and wanting to cooperate with others. That’s one of the key things that makes us different from other parties. We want to get the best of the ideas from everybody and work on them together.”

Asked if she wanted to predict how many Green Party candidates might be elected in October, May said it was hard to say. “When I look at the variables I see that a lot is in flux. I’m not trying to be deliberately cagey, but look at what happened to the NDP in Quebec in 2011. That could happen for us this time.

“In the Outremont by election [on Feb. 25] we placed ahead of the Conservatives and ahead of the Bloc Québécois. That’s the best showing the Greens have ever had in Outremont. It’s not the same as saying we’re poised to win Outremont, but for the first time the Quebec media began to say ‘Wait a minute, the Greens could win seats in Quebec.’ Once people begin to say we could win, that’s when voters begin to think ‘Oh, it’s not a wasted vote,’ and they begin to look at our candidates differently.”

May said that she had expected the subject of trains to come up at the town hall in Ashcroft, but not to the extent that it did, and that she had learned a lot. She added that conversation in rural New Brunswick regarding trains was a lot like the one in Ashcroft, although with more emphasis on the inadequacies of passenger travel.

“Where you find a lot of conversation around rail safety is in Montreal, where people are still reeling from Lac-Mégantic.”

Regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair, May said that she did not expect to see any further cabinet resignations, and wondered how much pressure had to be put on every remaining member of cabinet to get their signature on a letter of support for the Prime Minister. “There may be some unhappy [people] who signed that.”

May planned to fly to Ottawa overnight on March 5 to attend the Justice Committee meeting on March 6 to ask questions. “I have a lot of questions, and I hope we make some headway in answering the key bits where there’s missing information.”

May had nothing but praise for the ethics and intelligence of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, both of whom have resigned from Cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin affair. “They’re both really impressive, and they’ve both done the thing that people with integrity will do. The extent to which that wasn’t anticipated by the old boys’ club that really runs things is fascinating.

“The gender analysis of this episode, when it’s all over, will be really, really interesting. The pressure … in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, there were a lot of men pressuring her. And Bill Morneau’s response to Jane Philpott leaving was ‘I know they were close friends.’ They’re both women. Women apparently, according to Bill Morneau, form little pinky-pacts where if one goes the other has to go too.

“No, that’s not the case. These are people of integrity, and in our political system it’s so rare for a cabinet minister to step out of that post.”

May said she was doing a lot of digging into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and had a lot of questions. “Where’s the evidence and analysis that would suggest that SNC-Lavalin could fold and all these people could lose their jobs? I don’t see it. There’s a lot to dig into here before I’ll feel as if I know what happened.”

Former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick recently had a dire warning about the upcoming election, saying that he worried about the “rising tide of incitements to violence” and that he feared “somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign”. May called the words a “diversionary tactic”, and said “I don’t think that’s Canada, and I think Michael Wernick’s testimony was unhelpful. Anything that gives oxygen to the idea that we’d take violent actions against people in private life I don’t appreciate, as a person in public life.

“I hope the election won’t be ugly. Of all the leaders of parties and of all the party strategies so far, it’s Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives who’ve been willing to play footsie with white supremacists, willing to run fear-based campaigns. We’ll see if the election unfolds in ways that elevate discourse, or move us closer to the kinds of things that go on in the U.S.”

May said that she is concerned about the potential for social media sites like Facebook to have paid-for advertising and the spreading of fake news designed to advantage one party over another. “Canadians, as intelligent and critical thinkers … I think the best defence against that kind of thing happening is to actually be prepared to be a watchdog. If they see something where they go back to the original media site over some claim that strikes them as unlikely, and it turns out it’s a manipulated propaganda site, they’re going to get on board a campaign that does #don’tbelievethisnewssite. Whatever it takes to say ‘We need to make decisions based on information from reliable news sources, not propaganda websites.'”

Current infrastructure funding, where the costs are split between the federal and provincial governments and municipalities, sees the federal government paying 50 per cent, the provincial government paying 33 per cent, and the municipality paying 17 per cent. The federal government considers a “rural community” to be anything under a population of 100,000, putting Ashcroft in the same boat as Kamloops. The difficulty that very small communities have in raising their 17 per cent share of infrastructure funding was pointed out to May.

“This is a big issue in my riding too,” said May. “A municipal government is still treated as if it’s a child of a province. Most of the critical infrastructure needs are found at [the municipal] level of government. One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments and First Nations.

“The access to a tax base is so small for municipalities compared to the provinces and feds. The split clearly isn’t sensible. You’re not going to find the tax base here to raise the kind of money that’s needed to gain access to infrastructure funding. But every community in Canada has a huge infrastructure deficit. There’s a better way to deal with it, and cost-sharing isn’t it.

“Infrastructure projects for small and rural municipalities should be 100 per cent federal. Just get it done, because it’s such a barrier when rural municipalities first have to beg the province and then find their 17 per cent. It’s not workable.”

May said that she had had a wonderful visit to the area. “The school, the theatre production of Shrek: I’ve been very fortunate to have had a lot of really great experiences of connecting with community. I visited the screwdriver factory and got my own personalized screwdriver with my name on it.

“Visiting Ashcroft, it’s clear that the number one asset of this community is the community spirit of talented people who love living where they live.

“Small communities are capable of doing amazing things, and Ashcroft is a great example of that. Really impressive.”

The Montreal-based company beat out two other consortia to extend the Trillium Line from Greenboro into Riverside South, a decision cemented with a 19-3 vote by Ottawa city council on March 6.

However, sources with direct knowledge of the Stage 2 evaluation process told CBC that SNC-Lavalin failed to achieve the minimum technical score of 70 per cent, a requirement set out in publicly available documents.

CBC is not naming the three sources because they are not authorized to speak with the media.

SNC-Lavalin, currently at the centre of a major political controversy, is also one of the key partners in Rideau Transit Group, the consortium building the thrice-delayed first stage of Ottawa's LRT system.

The troubled company was one of three pre-qualified bidders for the extension of the Trillium Line. The other two — Trillium Link and Trillium Extension Alliance — scored well above the minimum technical grade of 70 per cent, according to CBC's sources.

City 'stands by' process

City officials and their hired experts overseeing the procurement process have steadfastly refused to confirm whether SNC-Lavalin met the technical threshold.

When council debated and ultimately approved the spending for LRT Stage 2, which includes extending both the east-west Confederation Line and the north-south Trillium Line, Coun. Diane Deans asked if the winning bids had met the minimum 70 per cent score.

She was told the scores were commercially confidential. Deans replied she wasn't asking for the score, only to be assured the winning bids met the threshold.

Coun. Diane Deans expresses frustration that city staff refused to confirm whether SNC-Lavalin met the technical requirements for the Trillium Line contract. 1:12

Again this week, the city refused to say whether SNC-Lavalin made the minimum grade, citing commercial confidentiality of the process.

Given more than two business days to respond to inquiries, the city refused to provide an in-person interview, sending instead an email attributed to Chris Swail, the director of O-Train planning.

""The city stands by the overall integrity of the procurement process in no uncertain terms,"" according to Swail's statement.

The statement also says city officials ""are all satisfied with the results"" of the procurement process and in ""the winning proponent's ability and capacity to design, build and maintain the Trillium Line extension.""

SNC-Lavalin has built rail systems all over the world, including the award-winning Canada Line in Vancouver.

""We are very proud of the proposal we submitted and look forward to getting started,"" said an SNC-Lavalin spokesperson in an email.

The engineering and construction giant said it has no knowledge of the breakdown of the score as the process is confidential.

How the bids were evaluated

The procurement process was overseen by law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, consultants Deloitte, fairness commissioner Oliver Grant, city-hired engineering experts and the city's own staff.

According to the statement from Swail, the three technical proposals were reviewed by a team of experts for ""completeness"" and ""conformance"" to make sure the submissions met the requirements of the contract.

In order to receive a passing score, a technical score threshold of 70 per cent for each of the criteria was required. - City of Ottawa report

But these ""completeness"" and ""conformance"" reviews are not the same as the technical scoring, and in fact were conducted before the bids were scored for their technical merit.

The technical evaluation for the shortlisted bids occurred in two stages, according to public city documents.

Individual expert evaluators reviewed and scored the submitted bids for the Trillium Line on a number of criteria including project design, engineering and operations.

""In order to receive a passing score, a technical score threshold of 70 per cent for each of the criteria was required,"" states a city report.

The evaluators then came together to decide on a so-called ""consensus"" score out of a maximum of 500 points.

It is common in procurement processes that a bid that doesn't make the technical grade be disqualified and barred from the financial evaluation round. This week, the city would not say whether this was the case with the LRT Stage 2 procurement.

According to a statement attributed to Chris Swail, Ottawa's director of O-Train planning, all the bids 'were deemed conformant' to the city's requirements. But that assessment is separate from the technical scoring. (CBC)

Secret committee

But Swail did appear to confirm it earlier this month.

At the March 6 council meeting, Deans asked specifically about the process: ""Pre-qualification, followed by technical scoring, and then if you passed the 70 per cent threshold, you went onto financial assessment. Is that correct?""

Swail answered: ""That is correct.""

The financial evaluation also consisted of several stages, and the resulting consensus score was also out of a maximum of 500 points.

The technical and financial scores were then combined to produce a ""final ranking.""

SNC-Lavalin said it was told by the city that it was the preferred proponent, ""which means that our total score placed us first."" It is possible that a bid could have the overall highest score, but still not have met the 70 per cent minimum technical threshold.

The bid evaluation steering committee oversaw this whole evaluation process, but no one knows who these people are — the membership of the committee is secret.

Geoffrey Gilbert, centre, a Norton Rose Fulbright lawyer, told councillors on March 6 that they didn't need to know whether SNC-Lavalin met the technical score. (Kate Porter/CBC)

The steering committee presented the final technical and financial scores, as well as the overall rankings, to an executive steering committee comprised of the city's most senior staff including the city manager, the city solicitor, the treasurer and the head of OC Transpo.

It's the executive steering committee that recommended the preferred proponent to council, which ultimately had the final say on whether to approve SNC-Lavalin for the Trillium contract. But council made that decision without knowing whether the company met the minimum technical score.

According to Norton Rose Fulbright lawyer Geoffrey Gilbert, ""council is not supposed to verify whether … proponents met the technical score. It's council's job to take all the recommendations on the preferred proponent, assess that and make their decision.""

Unanswered questions

That SNC-Lavalin failed to meet the minimum technical grade raises a number of issues.

First, how did the company make it through to the financial evaluation round?

Asked if there are provisions in the request for proposals that would allow a bidder to win without earning a 70 per cent grade, the city wouldn't explicitly say. Instead, Swail's statement repeats the argument that ""specific details that are commercially sensitive or relate to proponent evaluations are kept confidential to protect the integrity of the bidding process and its results.""

Chris Swail, centre, said during last month's technical briefing on the Stage 2 LRT contract that SNC-Lavalin was by far the lowest bidder. (Kate Porter/CBC)

Norton Rose Fulbright lawyers also cite confidentiality as the reason for refusing to confirm whether SNC-Lavalin met the minimum technical score. But Swail has spoken a number of times about the Montreal company's financial score.

""They were by far the lowest bid,"" Swail said last month of SNC-Lavalin's proposal. He's also said SNC-Lavalin was the only proponent to come in under the city's price target.

While SNC-Lavalin's bid will cost the city $230 million more in the short term than planned, the company promises to save the city $100 million over its 27-year maintenance contract.

The Conservative Opposition triggered the voting marathon in Ottawa after the Liberal-dominated justice committee shut down further investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair. For more than 30 hours, the House of Commons was engaged in round-the-clock voting that kept MPs close to their seats.

The voting got underway around 6 p.m. ET Wednesday and continued until almost 1 a.m. ET Friday, with members voting line by line on the Liberal government's spending plans.

It's over: See the end of the House of Commons voting session, which ran for more than 30 hours 0:37

Philpott's interview with Maclean's — her first substantial interview since resigning from cabinet earlier this month — set official Ottawa buzzing and is certain to dominate the SNC-Lavalin conversation.

In the story, the Liberal MP said she had concerns about the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case before the controversy became public in January. She alleged Canadians have been prevented from hearing more about what went on in government circles due to efforts by the Prime Minister's Office to ""shut down the story.""

""My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,"" Philpott said.

""I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.""

'Waste of public funds:' May

The Conservatives wants the Liberal government to fully waive cabinet confidence restrictions and allow former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to return to committee to answer questions about her decision to resign from cabinet in February.

Wilson-Raybould has alleged that officials in the Prime Minister's Office and elsewhere in government inappropriately pressured her to clear a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin — which would have allowed the company to avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges. In January, she was shuffled out of her cabinet post — a move she said was punishment for not following the PMO's marching orders.

Thursday morning, Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre raised the interview on a point of order, arguing Liberals MPs should reverse their decision to halt the justice committee's SNC-Lavalin inquiry.

""As much as I agree with the motivation of my friends in the Conservative Party, this is a huge waste of public funds and resources,"" said Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, referring to the voting marathon.

Now is normally the time when government MPs fan out across the country to sell their constituents on a new budget. But because each of these votes deals with fiscal matters, they're considered votes of confidence.

Losing a confidence vote can trigger a general election. So Liberal MPs were generally sticking close to their desks — although Trudeau was able to sneak away to Mississauga, Ont., for an infrastructure announcement before returning to his seat.

Confidence vote confusion

There was a moment of tension in the House Thursday afternoon when the opposition charged that dozens of Liberal MPs had entered the chamber after one of the questions to be voted on was still being read.

As deputy Speaker Anthony Rota was still reading the question, Liberal MP Kevin Lamoureux rose to complain that he could not hear it — a move that gave some Liberal MPs time to make it to their seats. Opposition members, sensing that they might have the government cornered on a confidence vote, told Rota that those Liberal MPs who entered the House late were ineligible to vote.

After a prolonged and heated debate, Rota ruled that it was not up to him to monitor attendance and left it to the ""honour"" of individual MPs to decide whether they were eligible to vote when the question was read.

Rota read the question a second time, the vote went ahead and the government survived (several Liberal MPs rescinded their votes afterwards).

MPs are beging a marathon voting session expected to go through the night 1:06

On Wednesday, the Conservatives put forward a motion calling on the government to have the Commons ""take note"" of Wilson-Raybould's comments about the SNC-Lavalin affair, and asking the prime minister to waive solicitor-client privilege to allow her to speak publicly about the January cabinet shuffle.

That was voted down by the Liberal majority.

Last week, upset with the government's handling of the SNC Lavalin affair, the Tories put forward 257 separate motions to oppose specific proposed funding allotments in the supplementary and interim estimates.

Cots were brought into the West Block to allow members to sleep in shifts and multiple MPs were called out for sneaking food and wearing sweatshirts in the House. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould, who gave birth last year, took to her Instagram to document all the times she's had to leave the floor to pump breast milk.

Now to be honest, I don't know a lot about SNC-Lavalin, except for what I have read and heard, and I didn't know a lot about the bully except for what I observed. However, I do know a little about business, government and politics and how they work. And as an outsider looking in, there seems to be some fear that if SNC fails, it will be bad for Canada. We have politicians, bureaucrats and people in la belle province of Quebe, suggesting that any attempt to stop SNC-Lavalin from bidding on government contracts will result in tens of thousands of lost jobs and a damaged economy.

article continues below

I am here to say that I believe that the failure of SNC-Lavalin would actually be good for the Canadian economy and the Canadian people and there should be no government intervention to stop it from facing the consequences it has bestowed upon itself.

Here is why:

1. SNC-Lavalin has a history of corruption and we cannot tolerate corruption as Canadians. Canada has historically been listed as one of the countries with the lowest corruption levels in the world, yet our toleration for SNC-Lavalin could be changing that rating. Corruption is generally defined as the use of power for personal benefit. Typically, someone is paid money or another benefit in exchange for a favour. This might be as simple as getting your family member a job or on a larger scale, receiving a contract to build a bridge, or hospital, or the capacity to influence government decisions. SNC-Lavalin has faced allegations of corruption in as many as 14 different countries. In 2013, the World Bank banned SNC-Lavalin for 10 years from bidding on World Bank projects. The former SNC-Lavalin CEO Pierre Duhaime was charged with paying $22 million in bribes to win SNC-Lavalin a $1.4 billion bid to build a hospital in Quebec. Just last year, SNC-Lavalin's former vice president Norman Morin pleaded guilty to helping the company funnel $117,000 in illegal campaign funds to the political parties. It's not surprising that Canadian support for the ruling Liberals and their leader Justin Trudeau is fading. With government officials leaving office on a weekly basis, the scent of possible corruption here in Canada in relation to this company is only growing stronger. Yet the government assures us that we need to protect SNC-Lavalin because it's the largest construction and engineering company in Canada.

I don't buy it.

2. For far too long, Canadians have been silent as big business has driven the government agenda. We see it in all sectors of our economy from the steel industry, to agriculture, construction, manufacturing, mining and forestry practices. Most times, we see the influence of multinational corporations who, for their own benefit, push the government to make changes that are often not in the best interest of the individual Canadian. These businesses bully, coerce and threaten governments with the loss of taxes and jobs, in order to obtain competitive advantages, subsidies and tax breaks. Yet when there is no longer much benefit to the company, it quickly cuts ties and moves on. Small business owners miss out on those benefits and are often at the mercy of the multinationals as they supply services to these companies, and are often squeezed on prices to ensure that the giant is profitable. SNC-Lavalin has been one of those giants for too long.

3. No jobs will be lost, only changed. Fear not, O Canada, that the failure of SNC-Lavalin to obtain government contracts will lead to a loss of jobs in Canada. It is true that SNC-Lavalin will be forced to lay off employees if it doesn't get those sweet government contracts because of their wrongdoings. However, those jobs will go elsewhere. In fact, some employees laid off from SNC-Lavalin will likely end up starting their own companies, getting their own sweet contracts and hiring employees of their own. Other competitors of SNC-Lavalin who get the contracts through a fair bidding process will likely need help in building, engineering and constructing those projects. They will gladly hire employees laid off by SNC-Lavalin. We don't need to fear the propaganda of lost jobs, we only need to seek the truth and understand the economics of the situation.

I am not sure where he ended up, but for the teachers and students in the school there was a sense of relief when the bully in the school was expelled. My expectation is that when we come to a decision that we won't tolerate corruption in Canada and dispel any idea that SNC-Lavalin can use political bidding to get its way, Canada too will breathe a sigh of relief. It will be good and healthy for Canada to put the likes of SNC-Lavalin and its culture and history of misdeeds behind us and move on.

Feb. 19, 2015 – The RCMP lays corruption and fraud charges against Montreal-based engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin, over business dealings in Libya. SNC-Lavalin says the charges are without merit and the allegations linked to people no longer with the company. A conviction could bar the company from bidding on federal contracts.

Oct. 19 – The Liberals win a federal election. Two weeks later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau names Jody Wilson-Raybould minister of justice and attorney general of Canada. She is the first Indigenous person to hold the post.

March 27, 2018 – The Liberals table a budget bill allowing for “remediation agreements,” plea-bargain-like deals for corporations to avoid criminal proceedings by making reparations for bad behaviour. SNC-Lavalin had lobbied for such a provision in Canadian law.

Sept. 4 – The Public Prosecution Service rejects SNC-Lavalin’s request to negotiate a remediation agreement. Wilson-Raybould is told about the decision. No public announcement is made.

Sept. 5 – Justice Department deputy minister Nathalie Drouin testified she first spoke with Wilson-Raybould about the decision during a late afternoon phone call while the minister was in Fiji. The department agrees to provide Wilson-Raybould with advice on the powers of the attorney general.

Sept. 6 – According to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s chief of staff, Ben Chin, warns his counterpart in Wilson-Raybould’s office, Jessica Prince, of job losses during a Quebec provincial election absent a deal for SNC-Lavalin.

Sept. 8 – Justice Department deputy minister Nathalie Drouin provides Wilson-Raybould with a briefing note on the attorney general’s powers on remediation agreements.

Sept. 12 – Drouin testified that on this day, the Finance Department tells her that SNC-Lavalin is still in discussions with the prosecution service about a remediation deal, suggesting to Drouin the decision not to pursue a deal isn’t set in stone.

Sept. 16 – According to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, officials in the PMO call Prince. They say the Crown prosecutor wants to negotiate an agreement, unlike the director of prosecutions, and suggest a solution before the company’s board meets in four days.

Sept. 17 – According to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Trudeau asks Wilson-Raybould to “find a solution” for SNC-Lavalin to avoid job losses, talks about the Quebec election and notes that he is a Quebec MP.

“Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the attorney general? I would strongly advise against it,” Wilson-Raybould says, according to her justice committee testimony. Trudeau says, “No. We just need to find a solution.”

Wernick raises the election as well, but he later testifies he did so to highlight the long-standing convention for the federal government to stay out of provincial campaigns.

In Trudeau’s version of events, he says mentioning he was a Quebec MP was not in a partisan context, adding it is up to MPs to advocate for their constituents, and that concern for job losses in Quebec and elsewhere were top of his mind. He says he asked to reconsider her decision and she agreed.

Sept. 18 – Drouin meets with Wilson-Raybould to debrief about the meeting with Trudeau. Drouin testified Wilson-Raybould expressed unease with the content of the conversation.

Sept. 19 – Drouin meets with Wilson-Raybould on SNC-Lavalin. Drouin testified Wilson-Raybould told her this would be the last time the two are going to discuss the matter, and that Wilson-Raybould instructs her not to talk with the director of prosecutions.

Sept. 21 – The remediation-agreement provisions come into force.

Oct. 9 – The prosecution service confirms it will not negotiate an agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The company challenges the decision in Federal Court.

Oct. 15 – According to Wernick’s testimony, he takes a call from Kevin Lynch, the chairman of the board of SNC-Lavalin and a former clerk of the Privy Council. Lynch asks about a remediation agreement and what can be done. He tells Lynch the decision is up to Wilson-Raybould.

The president of the company sends Trudeau a letter outlining the SNC-Lavalin’s concerns about the implications of a conviction and asks for a meeting.

Oct. 26 – According to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, official Mathieu Bouchard muses to Prince about getting outside legal advice on a deal for SNC-Lavalin. Wilson-Raybould later recounts Bouchard brings up the need for the Liberals to get re-elected in 2019.

Dec. 5 – Wilson-Raybould and Gerry Butts, Trudeau’s principal secretary, meet for dinner at the Chateau Laurier. SNC-Lavalin is discussed, but the two later give differing accounts of the tone of the conversation.

Dec. 18 – Prince meets with Butts and Katie Telford, Trudeau’s chief of staff. Afterwards, Prince texts Wilson-Raybould, citing Butts as saying, “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference” after being told what is being proposed is political interference in a prosecution. She cites Telford as saying “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

Butts later tells the justice committee that he didn’t — or wouldn’t — have used the word “solution” and denies anything nefarious in his comments. The point of the meeting, and anything said, was about getting a second opinion from someone like a former Supreme Court justice because the law had never been applied before.

Dec. 19 – According to Wilson-Raybould, Wernick warns her she is on a collision course with Trudeau, who wants to get a deal done. Wernick later testifies he doesn’t recall saying that.

Jan. 6, 2019 – Trudeau talks with Jane Philpott about becoming Treasury Board president and having her help convince Wilson-Raybould to take over Indigenous Services. Trudeau later says Philpott asks him if the move is related to SNC-Lavalin, which he denies.

Jan. 7 – Trudeau tells Wilson-Raybould she is being shuffled out of the justice portfolio. Wilson-Raybould says the PMO denies the move is over the SNC-Lavalin file. Butts testified Wilson-Raybould refused Indigenous services, citing her opposition to the Indian Act.

Jan. 14 – Trudeau shuffles his cabinet. David Lametti, a Montreal MP and former law professor, becomes justice minister. Wilson-Raybould becomes veterans-affairs minister.

Feb. 7 – Citing unnamed sources, the Globe and Mail newspaper reports that Trudeau’s aides pressed Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case. Trudeau calls the allegations false.

Feb. 11 – Trudeau says Wilson-Raybould’s continued presence in his cabinet speaks for itself and that he told her any decision on SNC-Lavalin was hers alone. Meanwhile, ethics commissioner Mario Dion launches an investigation.

Feb. 12 – Wilson-Raybould resigns from cabinet. Trudeau says she had a duty to tell him about any undue pressure applied to her in her role as attorney general.

The same day, Oshawa, Ont., Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes tells Trudeau she won’t seek re-election. Trudeau’s office later says it was an “emotional” conversation; Caesar-Chavannes claims he yelled at her through the phone. The details emerge later as Caesar-Chavannes becomes publicly critical of Trudeau, and more supportive of Wilson-Raybould.

Feb. 13 – The House of Commons justice committee debates its own probe. Liberals use their majority to push for a narrow hearing that doesn’t include Wilson-Raybould. The Liberals call it a first step in a cautious investigation. The opposition calls it a coverup.

Feb. 15 – Trudeau says Wilson-Raybould asked him in September whether he would direct her on SNC-Lavalin. He says he told her he would not.

Feb. 18 – Butts resigns. He denies any impropriety, but says his presence in the PMO has become a distraction.

Feb. 19 – Wilson-Raybould addresses a cabinet meeting. Cabinet confidentiality means nothing can be revealed about what was said or why.

Feb. 20 – Trudeau says he is confident probes by Dion and the justice committee will provide an airing of the facts. The Liberals use their majority to defeat an opposition motion calling for a public inquiry.

Feb. 21 – Appearing before the justice committee, Wernick calls allegations of political interference false and even defamatory and says none of his conversations crossed any lines.

Feb. 25 – Trudeau partly waives solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality so Wilson-Raybould can speak publicly, but not about communication with Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions.

Feb. 27 – Wilson-Raybould tells the justice committee she came under “consistent and sustained” pressure — including veiled threats — from the PMO, the Privy Council Office and Morneau’s office to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau rejects her characterization of events. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calls on Trudeau to resign. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh calls for a public inquiry.

Feb. 28 – Butts asks the justice committee for an opportunity to testify.

March 1 – Trudeau makes longtime MP Lawrence MacAulay his new veterans affairs minister. Marie-Claude Bibeau replaces MacAulay as agriculture minister and Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef takes on the additional portfolio of international development. All three express support for Trudeau.

March 4 – Philpott quits cabinet, saying she has lost confidence in the way the government has dealt with the ongoing affair and citing her obligation to defend the cabinet as long as she is a part of it.

At a rally in Toronto, Trudeau says the ongoing affair “has generated an important discussion” about how ministers, staff and officials conduct themselves. “Concerns of this nature,” he says, “must be taken very seriously and I can assure you that I am.”

March 6 – Butts tells the justice committee that Wilson-Raybould never complained about improper pressure to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin until Trudeau decided to move her out of her coveted cabinet role. Wernick disputes parts of her testimony as well. Drouin provides more details about the timeline.

March 7 – Trudeau holds a press conference where he says he should have been aware that trust had eroded between his office and Wilson-Raybould, but denies anything inappropriate took place. He talks about learning from the events; he does not specifically apologize.

Opposition MPs on the justice committee ask for an emergency meeting to discuss calling further witnesses to testify. They want to recall Wilson-Raybould as well as several officials from the Prime Minister’s Office.

March 8 – The Federal Court strikes down SNC-Lavalin’s request for judicial review of the prosecution service’s decision not to negotiate a remediation agreement.

March 11 – The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development says it is “concerned” the allegations of political interference and monitoring to determine whether Canada is violating its commitment to an international anti-bribery convention.

March 12 – Dion’s office says he is taking a prolonged leave from his job for health reasons, but says information will continue to be gathered in all ongoing cases in his absence.

March 13 – Liberals quickly use their majority on the justice committee to end the emergency meeting, and move to reconvene on March 19 as originally planned.

March 15 – Wilson-Raybould tells her Vancouver constituents she intends to run for re-election as a Liberal. She writes in an open letter that important questions haven’t been answered about the affair and wants to stay in Parliament, and with the Liberals, to change a “culture of conflict, empty partisanship and cynical games” in federal politics.

Meanwhile, Quebec Premier Francois Legault says his government isn’t ruling out buying shares in SNC-Lavalin to prevent the company from being sold or dismantled. He adds he has spoken with Trudeau on the need to find a way to save SNC-Lavalin and the jobs it creates.

March 18 – Trudeau appoints former leadership rival Joyce Murray to replace Philpott as Treasury Board president. Hours after being at the swearing-in ceremony, Wernick announces he will step down as the country’s top public servant before the fall election, having concluded he has lost the trust of opposition parties.

March 19 – Liberals on the justice committee vote to end the committee’s probe, hours after saying in a letter to the committee chair that “all rules and laws were followed” and Canadians “have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.”

The Conservatives protest later in the day by walking out of the House of Commons during Morneau’s budget speech.

March 20 – SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce tells The Canadian Press he never cited the protection as 9,000 jobs as the reason the company should be granted a remediation agreement. He adds he doesn’t expect an agreement to be offered in the current political climate.

In Ottawa, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould attend the Liberal caucus that followed a “frank and emotional” meeting Philpott had with her Ontario caucus colleagues.

Caesar-Chavannes quits the Liberal caucus.

The opposition parties trigger a marathon voting session after the Liberals use their majority to reject a motion calling on Trudeau to let Wilson-Raybould testify more fully about her allegations.

March 21 – In an interview with Maclean’s magazine, Philpott says there is “much more to the story” that should be told. She says she had concerns in January, before the controversy became public, but is prevented from discussing them through efforts by the Prime Minister’s Office to “shut down the story.”

At an event in Mississauga, Trudeau says the issue is about what happened while Wilson-Raybould was attorney general, “and she got to speak fully to that.”",A timeline of events in the SNC-Lavalin affair,Vancouver Is Awesome,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/03/21/timeline-snc-lavalin-affair-vancouver/

Philpott’s comments came in an interview with Maclean’s magazine that was published Thursday morning — right in the midst of the House of Commons filibuster launched by the Conservatives in protest at the shutdown of justice committee testimony. The Conservatives forced the 257-vote marathon after the Liberals defeated a motion calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to waive privilege over further testimony from former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

The mood was tense at times in the Commons, particularly at one point Thursday afternoon when the Liberals appeared to be late getting their MPs into the chamber for a vote, leading to an extended — but ultimately unsuccessful — effort by the opposition to challenge whether their votes should count. Because the votes are all on budgetary measures, if the government loses a vote it could trigger an election.

But it was Philpott’s interview that especially rankled some Liberal MPs. “She’s well aware of how we all feel,” said Liberal MP Judy Sgro to multiple reporters on Thursday afternoon. She challenged Philpott and Wilson-Raybould to “clear the air” in the Commons chamber instead of spreading “innuendo.”

“You know, we don’t want to damage the party, we’ve got a lot of work to do,” Sgro said. “This is hanging over our head with this innuendo with this, that and the rest of it.”

Having served as health minister, Indigenous services minister, and president of the treasury board, Philpott was one of Trudeau’s most trusted cabinet ministers before she resigned on March 4. She said she had lost confidence in how the government was handling Wilson-Raybould’s allegations that political pressure was inappropriately put on her to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on corruption charges.

I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial

In the Maclean’s interview, Philpott said that while resigning was difficult and while she still supports the Liberal party, she felt she could not remain in cabinet.

“I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history,” Philpott said.

She also slammed Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who had suggested Philpott resigned in solidarity because Wilson-Raybould was her friend.

“I think that’s an insult,” Philpott told Maclean’s. “I don’t make decisions on any policy — and definitely not on a matter of principle — based on friendship. I made the very difficult decision to step down because my conscience demanded it.”

Philpott said that the testimony that has come out so far — including one appearance by Wilson-Raybould at the Commons justice committee — has not given the public the whole story.

“There’s much more to the story that should be told,” she said. “I believe the former attorney general has further points to make. I believe that I have further issues of concern that I’m not free to share.”

She also cited justice committee testimony from Trudeau’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who also resigned as the SNC-Lavalin scandal unfolded, in which Butts alluded to a Jan. 6 conversation between Philpott and Trudeau about the company’s eagerness to be offered a remediation agreement instead of facing prosecution. “I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister a month before the public knew about it,” she told Maclean’s. “Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former Minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?”

Her comments add pressure to the Liberals to provide another venue for Philpott or Wilson-Raybould to speak. It also puts pressure on senators as the upper chamber considers its own study of the issue, though debate there has become bogged down and it’s not clear when a vote will take place.

Philpott told Maclean’s that although parliamentary privilege technically allows her or Wilson-Raybould to speak on the matter in the House of Commons, it would be difficult to get enough time to properly tell the story.

“My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,” she said. “I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.”

She also said she felt an obligation to the people in her riding, saying “they have understandably been concerned about why there’s been an attempt to shut down the story.”

Speaking to reporters on Thursday after the interview was published, Trudeau defended his decision to only waive privilege for Wilson-Raybould’s testimony before she was removed as justice minister, saying the crux of the issue is whether she was pressured in her role as attorney general. Wilson-Raybould has pointed to the fact the waiver does not allow her to discuss conversations that happened after she was shuffled out of the job, hinting there is more to say about it.

“We granted an unprecedented waiver to allow for fulsome testimony at the justice committee so that people could be heard on this matter as fully possible, and that’s exactly why we’re pleased with the work done by the justice committee, and that will be done by the ethics committee,” Trudeau said.

He also provided some detail about his conversation with Philpott on Jan. 6, describing it as a “good and positive conversation.” He said the discussion was focused on moving Philpott from Indigenous services to treasury board, but also about moving Wilson-Raybould out of justice and potentially into Indigenous services.

“(Philpott) asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin issue, and I told her no, it was not,” Trudeau said. “She then mentioned that it might be a challenge for Jody Wilson-Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous services, and I asked her for her help, which she gladly offered to give, in explaining to Jody Wilson-Raybould how exciting this job is and what a great thing it would be for her to have that role for reconciliation, for the government, and that it would be a very positive thing.”

In his testimony to the justice committee, Butts explained why Wilson-Raybould rejected the move to Indigenous services and was moved to veterans affairs instead. “She said she had spent her life opposed to the Indian Act and couldn’t be in charge of the programs administered under its authority,” Butts told the committee.

Trudeau was also asked on Thursday why Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are still in the Liberal caucus, given the trouble they are causing for his government.

“They have indicated they want to serve as Liberal members, they want to continue to run in the next election as Liberal members of parliament, and that they share the goals we have and the focus we have,” he said. He added later that he is “pleased to have a diversity of voices within the Liberal Party.”

As the Commons sat through Wednesday night and into Thursday evening, neither Philpott nor Wilson-Raybould has been on the Liberal benches.

In a media availability on Thursday morning, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel accused Trudeau of hypocrisy for championing women’s rights, but blocking the ability of Wilson-Raybould or Philpott to tell more of the story.

“Any Canadian woman regardless of (political) stripe should be outraged at what is happening to these women,” Rempel said. “It’s disgusting.”

Philpott gave an interview to Maclean’s ...,"OTTAWA — Former cabinet minister Jane Philpott fanned the flames of the SNC-Lavalin fire Thursday as Liberals struggled to douse the controversy and focus Canadians’ attention on their pre-election budget.

Philpott gave an interview to Maclean’s magazine in which she said there is “much more to the story” of improper pressure allegedly exerted on former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The early-morning publication of the interview coincided with a Conservative-orchestrated filibuster, landing like a bombshell in the House of Commons where exhausted MPs were in their 12th hour of non-stop voting, line by line, on the government’s spending plans. The filibuster, which continued into the night Thursday, was intended to protest Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s refusal to offer a blanket waiver of privilege and confidentiality that Wilson-Raybould has claimed is necessary if she is to fully tell her side of the story.

In the late afternoon, Conservatives believed they had caught the Liberals shorthanded, with not enough of them ready to vote to pass one item. Since spending votes are confidence measures, the government would have fallen had any of the spending measures been defeated.

Liberals quickly flooded into the chamber, male MPs hastily doing up their neckties for decorum. Assistant deputy speaker Anthony Rota, an Ontario Liberal then in the chair, cited a Commons rule to say that it’s not the speaker’s duty to police whether members were in the chamber at the critical time to be eligible to vote. Liberals eventually carried the motion, as opposition MPs heckled.

Philpott, who resigned early this month as Treasury Board president, told Maclean’s that she raised concerns with Trudeau, during a Jan. 6 discussion about an imminent cabinet shuffle, that Wilson-Raybould was being moved out of Justice because of her refusal to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the prime minister a month before the public knew about it. Why would I have felt that there was a reason why Minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?” she said. “My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story.”

But Philpott actually appears to already be free to talk about that Jan. 6 conversation with Trudeau: The government has waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality for last fall, when Wilson-Raybould alleges she was improperly pressured, until Jan. 14, when she was moved to the Veterans Affairs portfolio. The waiver applies not just to Wilson-Raybould but to “any persons who directly participated in discussions with her” relating to the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for alleged corrupt practices in Libya.

That waiver allowed Wilson-Raybould to testify for nearly four hours before the House of Commons justice committee.

Trudeau rejected Thursday the opposition parties’ contention, echoed by Philpott, that a broader waiver is required to cover the period between Jan. 14 and Wilson-Raybould’s resignation from cabinet a month later.

“It was extremely important that the former attorney general be allowed to share completely her perspectives, her experiences on this issue, and that is what she was able to do,” he said after an announcement in Mississauga, pumping up the latest budget’s promise to invest $2.2 billion more in municipal infrastructure projects.

“The issue at question is the issue of pressure around the Lavalin issue while she was attorney general and she got to speak fully to that.”

Trudeau also gave his version of the Jan. 6 conversation with Philpott, during which he informed her she would be moving to Treasury Board and that Wilson-Raybould would be taking her place at Indigenous Services. His version echoed the testimony of his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, to the justice committee.

“She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision and I told her no, it was not,” Trudeau said. “She then mentioned it might be a challenge for Jody Wilson-Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services and I asked her for her help, which she gladly offered to give, in explaining to Jody Wilson-Raybould how exciting this job was and what a great thing it would be for her to have that role.”

Wilson-Raybould ultimately turned down the move to Indigenous Services and Trudeau moved her instead to Veterans Affairs. She resigned a month later.

Neither Philpott nor Wilson-Raybould voted Wednesday on a Conservative motion calling for a broader waiver. Nor did they speak during debate on the motion in the Commons, where anything they said would have been protected by parliamentary privilege.

While she conceded speaking up in the Commons is “technically possible,” Philpott told Maclean’s that debates wouldn’t give the ex-ministers the “hours of time” needed to fully tell their stories.

Since any vote involving government spending is automatically a confidence vote, Liberals were required to be out in force throughout the all-night, all-day voting marathon to avoid potential defeat of the government. But although Philpott and Wilson-Raybould remain members of the Liberal caucus, they were exempted from having to show up, in the interests of not exacerbating tensions with their sleep-deprived colleagues.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel construed that as further evidence of a “culture of intimidation” against the former ministers who’ve “been put under a gag order” by Trudeau.

“I find it really difficult to watch as two strong female colleagues continue to be shut down,” she said.

However, Trudeau continued to try to paper over tensions among Liberal caucus members, even after Philpott’s intervention added fuel to the fire. He continued to say the ex-ministers are welcome to remain in the Liberal caucus, despite their criticisms of him just seven months before an election. While they disagree over the SNC-Lavalin matter, Trudeau said all Liberals are united on the “big things” like investing in the middle class, fighting climate change and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pounced on Philpott’s interview to bolster his call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“If the prime minister and the Liberal government has nothing to hide, why don’t they waive all solicitor-client privilege and call for all witnesses to testify and answer all questions that Canadians have. If they have nothing to hide, why won’t they do that?” Singh said.

The filibuster resulted in the cancellation of Thursday’s question period and scheduled debate on government bills. Committee meetings were also cancelled as the filibuster continued into the night with no end in sight.

Only a couple of dozen opposition MPs needed to be in the chamber at one time so they had plenty of opportunity to grab a few hours of sleep.

The Liberals, however, were forced to keep most of their MPs in the chamber at all times, to avoid being caught short on any of the votes.

Most Liberal MPs had laptops on their desks and appeared to be doing work, reading or, in some cases, watching movies. A few read books. One, Toronto-area MP Jennifer O’Connell, sat with a blanket wrapped around her legs. They were periodically allowed to leave the chamber to catch a few winks on cots, as reinforcements replaced them.

The Conservatives periodically offered to end the vote marathon, if Trudeau would agree to waive confidentiality and let Wilson-Raybould and all others involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair testify fully.

Philpott gave an interview to Maclean's magazine in which she said there is ""much more to the story"" of improper pressure allegedly exerted on former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The early-morning publication of the interview coincided with a Conservative-orchestrated filibuster, landing like a bombshell in the House of Commons where exhausted MPs were in their 12th hour of non-stop voting, line by line, on the government's spending plans. The filibuster, which continued until almost 1 a.m. Friday, was intended to protest Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's refusal to offer a blanket waiver of privilege and confidentiality that Wilson-Raybould has claimed is necessary if she is to fully tell her side of the story.

Late Thursday afternoon, Conservatives believed they had caught the Liberals shorthanded, with not enough of them ready to vote to pass one item. Since spending votes are confidence measures, the government would have fallen had any of the spending measures been defeated.

Liberals quickly flooded into the chamber, male MPs hastily doing up their neckties for decorum. Assistant deputy speaker Anthony Rota, an Ontario Liberal then in the chair, cited a Commons rule to say that it's not the speaker's duty to police whether members were in the chamber at the critical time to be eligible to vote. Liberals eventually carried the motion, as opposition MPs heckled.

Philpott, who resigned early this month as Treasury Board president, told Maclean's that she raised concerns with Trudeau, during a Jan. 6 discussion about an imminent cabinet shuffle, that Wilson-Raybould was being moved out of Justice because of her refusal to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

""I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the prime minister a month before the public knew about it. Why would I have felt that there was a reason why Minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?"" she said. ""My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story.""

But Philpott actually appears to already be free to talk about that Jan. 6 conversation with Trudeau: The government has waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality for last fall, when Wilson-Raybould alleges she was improperly pressured, until Jan. 14, when she was moved to the Veterans Affairs portfolio. The waiver applies not just to Wilson-Raybould but to ""any persons who directly participated in discussions with her"" relating to the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for alleged corrupt practices in Libya.

That waiver allowed Wilson-Raybould to testify for nearly four hours before the House of Commons justice committee.

Trudeau rejected Thursday the opposition parties' contention, echoed by Philpott, that a broader waiver is required to cover the period between Jan. 14 and Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet a month later.

""It was extremely important that the former attorney general be allowed to share completely her perspectives, her experiences on this issue, and that is what she was able to do,"" he said after an announcement in Mississauga, pumping up the latest budget's promise to invest $2.2 billion more in municipal infrastructure projects.

""The issue at question is the issue of pressure around the Lavalin issue while she was attorney general and she got to speak fully to that.""

Trudeau also gave his version of the Jan. 6 conversation with Philpott, during which he informed her she would be moving to Treasury Board and that Wilson-Raybould would be taking her place at Indigenous Services. His version echoed the testimony of his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, to the justice committee.

""She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision and I told her no, it was not,"" Trudeau said. ""She then mentioned it might be a challenge for Jody Wilson-Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services and I asked her for her help, which she gladly offered to give, in explaining to Jody Wilson-Raybould how exciting this job was and what a great thing it would be for her to have that role.""

Wilson-Raybould ultimately turned down the move to Indigenous Services and Trudeau moved her instead to Veterans Affairs. She resigned a month later.

Neither Philpott nor Wilson-Raybould voted Wednesday on a Conservative motion calling for a broader waiver. Nor did they speak during debate on the motion in the Commons, where anything they said would have been protected by parliamentary privilege.

While she conceded speaking up in the Commons is ""technically possible,"" Philpott told Maclean's that debates wouldn't give the ex-ministers the ""hours of time"" needed to fully tell their stories.

Since any vote involving government spending is automatically a confidence vote, Liberals were required to be out in force throughout the all-night, all-day voting marathon to avoid potential defeat of the government. But although Philpott and Wilson-Raybould remain members of the Liberal caucus, they were exempted from having to show up, in the interests of not exacerbating tensions with their sleep-deprived colleagues.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel construed that as further evidence of a ""culture of intimidation"" against the former ministers who've ""been put under a gag order"" by Trudeau.

""I find it really difficult to watch as two strong female colleagues continue to be shut down,"" she said.

However, Trudeau continued to try to paper over tensions among Liberal caucus members, even after Philpott's intervention added fuel to the fire. He continued to say the ex-ministers are welcome to remain in the Liberal caucus, despite their criticisms of him just seven months before an election. While they disagree over the SNC-Lavalin matter, Trudeau said all Liberals are united on the ""big things"" like investing in the middle class, fighting climate change and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pounced on Philpott's interview to bolster his call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""If the prime minister and the Liberal government has nothing to hide, why don't they waive all solicitor-client privilege and call for all witnesses to testify and answer all questions that Canadians have. If they have nothing to hide, why won't they do that?"" Singh said.

The filibuster resulted in the cancellation of Thursday's question period and scheduled debate on government bills. Committee meetings were also cancelled as the filibuster continued into the night with no end in sight.

Only a couple of dozen opposition MPs needed to be in the chamber at one time so they had plenty of opportunity to grab a few hours of sleep.

The Liberals, however, were forced to keep most of their MPs in the chamber at all times, to avoid being caught short on any of the votes.

Most Liberal MPs had laptops on their desks and appeared to be doing work, reading or, in some cases, watching movies. A few read books. One, Toronto-area MP Jennifer O'Connell, sat with a blanket wrapped around her legs. They were periodically allowed to leave the chamber to catch a few winks on cots, as reinforcements replaced them.

The Conservatives periodically offered to end the vote marathon, if Trudeau would agree to waive confidentiality and let Wilson-Raybould and all others involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair testify fully. The Liberals rejected each offer and the voting resumed.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought to reset the political spotlight on the federal budget Thursday, but it was overshadowed by opposition manoeuvres in Parliament and a public appeal from former cabinet minister Jane Philpott to allow Canadians to hear “the whole story” of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Ms. Philpott – who resigned this month as president of the Treasury Board over political interference in the justice system – urged the Prime Minister to waive all cabinet and solicitor-client privileges to permit former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould and other key players to speak freely about the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution for bribery and fraud.

""My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole truth,” Ms. Philpott told Maclean’s magazine. “If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories.”

She complained about “an attempt to shut down the story” and said “there is still a substantial amount of [Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s] story that’s not out there.”

The broadside at Mr. Trudeau’s handling of the matter took the focus off a budget announcement in Mississauga, where he promised additional money from gas taxes for municipalities.

He faced repeated questions from the media on why he won’t grant a sweeping waiver for Ms. Wilson-Raybould so she can talk about what transpired between the time she was shuffled out of the Justice portfolio, in early January, and her resignation from cabinet on Feb. 12.

Mr. Trudeau told reporters he had already granted an “unprecedented waiver” to Ms. Wilson-Raybould so she could provide testimony before the House of Commons justice committee about the political pressure she faced between September and December, 2018, to help SNC-Lavalin out of its legal difficulties.

“The issue was pressure around SNC-Lavalin while she was attorney-general, and she got to speak fully to do that,” he said.

The political controversy has resulted in the resignations of four high-profile members of the government, as well as opposition attempts to disrupt Parliament in order to protest a decision by the Liberal-dominated justice committee to shut down its inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin matter.

Conservative and NDP MPs forced marathon votes on spending estimates Wednesday night that continued through most of Thursday and forced the cancellation of Question Period.

In an interview with The Globe and Mail Wednesday, SNC-Lavalin chief executive Neil Bruce also undermined key assertions of Mr. Trudeau and his staff that the company might relocate its headquarters out of Canada and take 9,000 jobs with it if it were convicted and then barred from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years. Mr. Bruce said he never cited the protection of jobs or retention of the Montreal headquarters as reasons why the company should be granted an out-of-court-settlement.

The engineering and construction company, which is facing fraud and bribery charges relating to its business dealings in Libya, had sought to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). Under such an agreement, it would accept responsibility and relinquish benefits gained from wrongdoing, pay a fine and put in place compliance measures.

SNC-Lavalin never claimed jobs were at risk, CEO Neil Bruce says

The issue has dominated Parliament since The Globe reported on Feb. 7 that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a DPA without trial for SNC-Lavalin.

In the fallout, Mr. Trudeau lost Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, as well as his principal secretary, Gerald Butts. On Monday, the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, retired because he said he had lost the “trust and respect"" of the opposition parties over his role in the SNC-Lavalin case. Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion has also launched an inquiry, and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has asked the RCMP to investigate possible obstruction of justice.

On Tuesday, Liberal MPs on the justice committee shut down hearings on the matter, preventing Ms. Wilson-Raybould from returning to testify.

Liberal MPs are also expected to use their majority on the House ethics committee next Tuesday to block an attempt by Conservative and NDP members to mount an inquiry and have the former attorney-general testify.

In testimony last month, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top aides to override federal prosecutors and negotiate a DPA with SNC-Lavalin.

The B.C. MP has said she wanted to return for a second round of testimony to explain what transpired between the time she was moved out of the Justice portfolio and her resignation from cabinet.

She has asked the Prime Minister to give her another waiver from solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality to talk about the conversations with Mr. Trudeau that led to her resignation.

In the Maclean’s interview, Ms. Philpott said she is also keen to have cabinet privilege waived for her as well so she can talk about a meeting with the Prime Minister in which they discussed his plan to move her to Treasury Board and shuffle Ms. Wilson-Raybould out as justice minister and attorney-general. A key topic was the pressure put on Ms. Wilson-Raybould, she said.

“I spoke to the Prime Minister on January the 6th about SNC-Lavalin’s desire to have a DPA,” she said. “I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister. … Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?”

Mr. Trudeau had a different interpretation of that meeting, saying it was mostly about Ms. Philpott’s move from Indigenous Services to Treasury Board and his plan to have Ms. Wilson-Raybould take over her portfolio.

“She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision, and I told her, ‘No, it was not,’ ” he said. “She then mentioned it may be a challenge for Jody-Wilson Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services.”

Mr. Trudeau said he asked Ms. Philpott “for her help, and she gladly offered"" to help convince Ms. Wilson-Raybould to take the position. As a former B.C. regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ms. Wilson-Raybould turned down the job because she did not want to oversee the Indian Act.

She was then shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14, which she said she believed was related to her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin.

Ms. Philpott did not respond to requests from The Globe to explain the discrepancy between her and Mr. Trudeau’s versions of the Jan. 6 meeting.

In the Maclean’s interview, she praised Ms. Wilson-Raybould for standing firm, despite “bullying or harassment” from the Prime Minister’s Office to override the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to help SNC-Lavalin.

“The former AG didn’t want to override that, and she had her finger in the dike and said no repeatedly,"" Ms. Philpott said.

Mr. Trudeau said he would not seek to have Ms. Philpott or Ms. Wilson-Raybould ousted from the Liberal caucus – a view shared by some but not all Liberals.

“She is someone I look up to as a mentor,” Toronto MP Julie Dzerowicz said of Ms. Philpott. Charlottetown MP Sean Casey said she was a “significant contributor"" to caucus.

But Toronto MP John McKay expressed frustration that two former ministers are hurting the Liberals.

“Members are starting to realize that this has political consequences, and the decisions that have been made by both of them over the last few weeks have hurt members,” he told reporters during a break in the marathon voting.

Veteran Liberal MP Judy Sgro, who is also a former cabinet minister, appeared visibly frustrated by Ms. Philpott’s latest comments and the “innuendo” she said they have created.

“There’s no reason that Jane or Jody cannot go into the House of Commons [under] parliamentary privilege, talk for as long as they want, say anything they want,” she said. “There’s absolutely no reason that the two former ministers can’t do that.”

Rob Walsh, a former House of Commons law clerk, said Ms. Wilson-Raybould could rise in the House on a matter of “personal privilege” to ask to speak under the cover of parliamentary immunity and would not be bound by cabinet solidarity and solicitor-client privilege.

“It may be she could argue that she has tried to appear before the justice committee and been denied an opportunity and feels it is imperative that she be afforded an opportunity to respond to the witnesses who testified after she testified,” he said, although he added that the Speaker may not allow her to go on longer than 20 minutes.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Neil Bruce said Wednesday if the engineering firm is convicted and barred from bidding on federal contracts here at home its workers would end up working for the Montreal-based company’s foreign rivals.

“There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They’ll get a job,” Bruce said.

“This thing that somehow they’re going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.”

Bruce’s comments come as a political storm in Ottawa continues over allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to end a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Trudeau and his staff have said their only concern was for SNC-Lavalin’s 9,000 jobs, which might be at risk if the company were convicted and then barred from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and the country’s top public servant, although he continues to insist no one did anything wrong.

Bruce said about 75 per cent of the company’s rivals have concluded deferred prosecution agreements in their host countries and are free to work in Canada.

Meanwhile, Bruce said he still doesn’t know why the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould were not open to granting a remediation agreement.

He said SNC-Lavalin employees feel bruised and battered by the last six weeks since a report surfaced that government officials pressured the former attorney general to grant the company a deferred prosecution agreement.

“And I think fundamentally that’s unfair on our employees who had nothing to do with what went on seven to 20 years ago.”

While he’s not surprised that politicians would make hay out of this issue during an election year, Bruce said he’s concerned that policy-makers haven’t been as willing as other countries to defend home-grown companies and their workers.

He said there’s no plans to move the company’s headquarters from Montreal, adding competitors are envious of its shareholder base that is 82 per cent Canadian and led by the Caisse de depot which has helped fund its acquisition of British engineering firm Atkins.

Jane Philpott has been quietly getting out the word in recent days that she will be doing interviews within the coming weeks.

Remember those Canadians being held in China, including one facing the death penalty? The international panel warning that the world has 12 years to get its act together on climate change or face environmental catastrophe?

Indeed we would. The saga of former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin has now consumed six full weeks of federal politics. It has eclipsed the federal budget and pretty much anything else that may be on the Trudeau government’s agenda.

Why wait a couple more weeks, though? “My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story,” Philpott told Maclean’s columnist Paul Wells.

Well, as the automated answer machine says: Please hold, your call is very important.

So let’s have it. If the truth is this urgent and all-consuming, worth putting every other issue on hold, why does it keep hiding behind some obscure, debatable rules?

Philpott and Wilson-Raybould may be correct, that whatever led them to quit cabinet on a point of high principle is worth all the collective, breathless attention of the political class in Canada and a voting marathon in the House of Commons (which they were sitting out, granted immunity from cranky caucus mates.) These two ex-ministers keep telling us they have more to say.

Lately I’ve been imagining how something like this would play out in the United States — even Donald Trump’s United States. If two senior members of the U.S. cabinet had quit their posts amid allegations of corruption at the top levels of government, they would probably hold a news conference, maybe on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

That’s what speaking truth to power looks like. It doesn’t dance behind anonymous leaks, cryptic interviews or polite, “No I couldn’t possibly break the rules” evasion. It doesn’t issue vague statements and then shrink from interviews and hard questions, including sharp ones from their caucus colleagues.

Up to now, the only thing that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sacrificed are their ministerial perks and salary for the sake of their principles. Certainly that’s no small thing.

But again, if what they’re alleging is as serious as they keep hinting, why not risk the punishment of breaking the rules they keep talking about — some of which have been waived already?

What would happen if they convened a news conference and told the whole story? Do they think they would be led away in handcuffs?

Philpott’s interview with Maclean’s, with no disrespect to interviewer or interviewee, was baffling in many parts. She confirms that she knew a full month before the SNC-Lavalin story broke — and warned the prime minister — that Wilson-Raybould would see this as the cause for bouncing her out of her job as justice minister.

“I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the prime minister a month before the public knew about it,” Philpott said.

Again, yes we would. Moreover, quite conveniently, we are allowed — even entitled — to know that.

Trudeau waived solicitor-client privilege for the period of time during which Wilson-Raybould was justice minister. She was still justice minister when Philpott spoke to him. Trudeau has spoken freely about this meeting, and did again on Thursday, in the hours after the Maclean’s story was published.

He said, intriguingly, that Philpott herself had offered to help him soften the career blow to Wilson-Raybould in moving from justice to the Indigenous services portfolio, which was the original idea of the now-infamous cabinet shuffle.

“She then mentioned it might be a challenge for Jody Wilson-Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous services and I asked her for her help, which she gladly offered to give,” Trudeau said.

From that account, it doesn’t sound like Philpott left the meeting with an urgent need to tell Canadians of what she knew about SNC-Lavalin, or call the police or some parliamentary authority. She still hasn’t said what she knows. Why not?

Philpott was asked in the Maclean’s interview why she hadn’t taken advantage of other ways to tell her truth, whether that’s in Parliament, where she enjoys privilege, or some other forum. It’s complicated, she answered.

Actually, it’s not. “There’s much more to the story that should be told,” Philpott said.

Agreed. So let’s move up those proposed interviews a couple of weeks, or just call a full news conference on Friday. That’s what the power of truth looks like.

The letter calls on the committee to hold a televised meeting on Thursday to examine allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office interfered in the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec engineering giant accused of bribery. It also requests that former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould appear before committee ""no later than Wednesday, March. 27.""

The mandate of the ethics committee is to study matters related to multiple watchdog positions, including the commissioners of lobbying, privacy and ethics. Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion's office is currently conducting its own investigation of the SNC-Lavalin issue, although the commissioner himself is currently on a ""prolonged"" medical leave.

In the letter, Kent and Gourdes argued that the allegations of political interference fall under the ethics committee's mandate to ""investigate matters as they pertain to ethics.""

The next ethics committee meeting is scheduled for Thursday, but the members are only slated to discuss the privacy of digital government services. The Conservatives said in a press release that they intend to move a motion to request Wilson-Raybould's appearance.

Speaking in the House of Commons ahead of question period, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer - who chairs the ethics committee - said the motion is in order. That means the committee, which has a Liberal majority, is going to be given the opportunity to vote on the motion.

“As always, members are welcome to submit witnesses. Any members of the public who may have information of wrongdoing that may help with an investigation can come forward and submit it to the ethics committee without fear,” Zimmer said.

The letter comes as the latest Conservative move to push for Wilson-Raybould to provide more testimony on the SNC-Lavalin issue following the parliamentary justice committee's Tuesday decision to end its own study on the issue. At the time, the Liberals argued the committee had obtained all the necessary information for Canadians to arrive at a conclusion on this issue.

""As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings,"" Liberal MPs wrote in a letter addressed to the justice committee chair on Monday. ""Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all the rules and laws were followed.""

Should this latest motion fail, Conservative have vowed continued action to keep the allegations on the agenda.

""We will use every tool at our disposal to hold Justin Trudeau to account. Nothing is off the table and we are prepared for anything,"" Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Tuesday.

One option in the Tory toolkit is their ability to launch a marathon voting session, which they are likely to do Wednesday evening with over 200 fiscal votes on notice.

Following the news that the justice committee ended its investigation into SNC-Lavalin, Scheer blasted the government for what he called an ""attack on the rule of law and our parliamentary democracy.""

""We will not sit idly by and allow that to happen,"" he said.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, has been pushing on the Conservatives to shift their focus from SNC-Lavalin to the recently released budget.

""It's disappointing that the Conservatives actually don't care and don't know what's in the actual budget,"" Trudeau said during a speech in the House of Commons Tuesday.

Trudeau also emphasized Liberal party unity as he walked into a caucus meeting Wednesday morning. The meeting was the first since former president of the treasury board Jane Philpott resigned from cabinet, a move Wilson-Raybould had undertaken just weeks before.

""They’ve both indicated that they continue to believe in the Liberal Party and want to stand for us in the election in the fall,"" Trudeau said of Philpott and Wilson-Raybould. ""I look forward to continuing to work together.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was hoping the festivities would distract from Jody Wilson-Raybould and the SNC-Lavalin scandal after the Liberal-majority justice committee ruled against letting the former attorney general speak again, effectively shutting down the committee investigating the issue.

However, it appears once the pomp and circumstance of the budget have faded, Canadians will still want answers that only Wilson-Raybould and the PM can provide.

In other words, this is not going away.

LISTEN: Scott says “it’s not the opposition and the media keeping this story alive, It’s a lost and fumbling Liberal Government”

One of those questions is why the former attorney general was fired, although the reason appears to be because she wouldn’t give SNC-Lavalin the get-out-of-jail-free card the Liberals wanted in order to secure their votes in Quebec.

Another is whether current Attorney General David Lametti will do what Wilson-Raybould refused to do and grant the Liberals their wish.

Liberal supporters have said it is the Opposition and those who simply dislike Trudeau who are keeping this story alive for political gain.

I would disagree with that.

It is the Liberals who are keeping this story alive by failing to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak and by continuing to drag out the narrative on a daily basis with their shabby handling of the affair.

Delaying the justice committee’s decision not to let Wilson-Raybould speak until the day of the budget and the sudden early retirement of Michael Wernick, the supposedly unbiased clerk of the Privy Council (who got to testify twice), are just two of the latest examples of keeping this story in the headlines.

It’s not just the average Canadian who is losing confidence in Trudeau — it continues within his own party.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Trudeau knew all this yet still interfered so strongly with the SNC-Lavalin case, it makes a lot of sense to think that he was only doing so, to protect his political interests.",SNC-Lavalin Scam Was Never About Saving Canadian Jobs,Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13606-snc-lavalin-scam-was-never-about-saving-canadian-jobs.html

After a rough few weeks, the PM enthuses, they have a plan! There’s going to be a budget, presumably full of pre-election goodies, something to help shore up their fading poll numbers.

And Anne McLellan, former Liberal MP and cabinet minister, is going to do a review of some of the issues raised in the SNC-Lavalin controversy. It’s going to be amazing. Just what this government needs.

And then the Prime Minister glances at his phone, reads a text message and frowns. “Wernick did what?!” he mumbles.

He quit, that’s what. Michael Wernick, the now-outgoing clerk of the Privacy Council (the most senior civil servant in Ottawa) announced that, due to his recent central role in the controversy, he’ll be retiring. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Wernick wrote, “It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties. … It is essential that Canadians continue to see their world leading public service as non-partisan and there to provide excellent services to Canadians and the governments they elect.”

For those keeping score at home, this is the fourth resignation thus far in the ongoing scandal that the Prime Minister insists is all just a wee breakdown in communication.

I was mostly kidding above, for the record. I’m sure the Prime Minister’s Office wasn’t exactly floored by Wernick’s announcement, nor would they have been stunned by the declaration of the Liberal majority on the House justice committee that there’s no reason to invite Jody Wilson-Raybould back to testify again. That was me just indulging my sense of whimsy. But what is true is that as much as the Liberals would like the SNC-Lavalin affair to be over, they seem weirdly determined to keep it alive.

The Liberals can’t be pleased that the SNC-Lavalin affair has now lasted as long as a Biblical wandering-of-the-desert. And it’s not that they haven’t tried to move on. It’s just that they don’t seem to be very good at it. They’d better hope that the budget absolutely knocks it out of the park with the voters, because the opposition isn’t going to give up on this.

And the Liberals themselves haven’t exactly set things up for a rapid conclusion. The five members of the House justice committee, having decided that 13 hours of testimony is the absolute maximum that Canadians could bear, seem set to shut their investigation down. (That’s three hours and fifteen minutes of testimony per resignation to date.) In their letter to the committee chair, the majority wrote, “As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings.”

On Tuesday, the committee’s Liberal majority, voted, as expected, to suspend its probe, leading to both opposition parties pledging to do all they could to get answers. Andrew Scheer even mused about finding ways to delay the budget speech. So that’s going well.

And then there’s the matter of Anne McLellan, the former Liberal deputy prime minister, MP and herself a former minister of justice and attorney general. The Prime Minister announced on Monday that McLellan will report by June 30 on whether the justice minister and attorney general job should be split. This isn’t the first time the government has turned to McLellan; she prepared an exhaustive, very serious and almost unreadably boring report on cannabis reform ahead of last October’s legalization. No doubt she’ll produce something similar this time. It will be well researched, thoughtful and helpful.

It will not, in any way, answer the questions Canadians have about the government’s recent conduct.

That’s a feature, to be clear, not a bug. The Prime Minister, much like the Liberals on the justice committee, want this to be over. They want to move on, to the budget first, and then whatever comes after that. Appointing McLellan is supposed to signal that it’s time to get back to work and focus on the future.

The problem, of course, is that while McLellan might be a great person to write a report, she’s a terrible person to put this affair to bed. It’s not just that she’s a partisan Liberal by virtue of her past positions. She remains active in the party. And as a general rule, if you want to convince Canadians that you’re taking an issue seriously and seeking an independent voice, don’t go to someone who has to immediately back out of the fundraiser they’re hosting for your party in just a few days.

It’s bizarre. Forty days (and counting) is probably testing the outer limits of the average Canadian’s patience with any scandal. Allowing the House justice committee to hear more testimony, and appointing someone more neutral to draft up recommendations, could well have crushed what remaining interest they have.

But the Liberals didn’t do that. Instead, they’re going out of their way to limit how much more Canadians will learn. Funny, that.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought to reset the political spotlight on the federal budget Thursday, but it was overshadowed by opposition manoeuvres in Parliament and a public appeal from former cabinet minister Jane Philpott to allow Canadians to hear “the whole story” of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Ms. Philpott – who resigned this month as president of the Treasury Board over political interference in the justice system – urged the Prime Minister to waive all cabinet and solicitor-client privileges to permit former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould and other key players to speak freely about the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution for bribery and fraud.

""My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole truth,” Ms. Philpott told Maclean’s magazine. “If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories.”

She complained about “an attempt to shut down the story” and said “there is still a substantial amount of [Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s] story that’s not out there.”

The broadside at Mr. Trudeau’s handling of the matter took the focus off a budget announcement in Mississauga, where he promised additional money from gas taxes for municipalities.

He faced repeated questions from the media on why he won’t grant a sweeping waiver for Ms. Wilson-Raybould so she can talk about what transpired between the time she was shuffled out of the Justice portfolio, in early January, and her resignation from cabinet on Feb. 12.

Mr. Trudeau told reporters he had already granted an “unprecedented waiver” to Ms. Wilson-Raybould so she could provide testimony before the House of Commons justice committee about the political pressure she faced between September and December, 2018, to help SNC-Lavalin out of its legal difficulties.

“The issue was pressure around SNC-Lavalin while she was attorney-general, and she got to speak fully to do that,” he said.

The political controversy has resulted in the resignations of four high-profile members of the government, as well as opposition attempts to disrupt Parliament in order to protest a decision by the Liberal-dominated justice committee to shut down its inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin matter.

Conservative and NDP MPs forced marathon votes on spending estimates Wednesday night that continued through most of Thursday and forced the cancellation of Question Period.

In an interview with The Globe and Mail Wednesday, SNC-Lavalin chief executive Neil Bruce also undermined key assertions of Mr. Trudeau and his staff that the company might relocate its headquarters out of Canada and take 9,000 jobs with it if it were convicted and then barred from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years. Mr. Bruce said he never cited the protection of jobs or retention of the Montreal headquarters as reasons why the company should be granted an out-of-court-settlement.

The engineering and construction company, which is facing fraud and bribery charges relating to its business dealings in Libya, had sought to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). Under such an agreement, it would accept responsibility and relinquish benefits gained from wrongdoing, pay a fine and put in place compliance measures.

The issue has dominated Parliament since The Globe reported on Feb. 7 that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured Ms. Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a DPA without trial for SNC-Lavalin.

In the fallout, Mr. Trudeau lost Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, as well as his principal secretary, Gerald Butts. On Monday, the Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, retired because he said he had lost the “trust and respect"" of the opposition parties over his role in the SNC-Lavalin case. Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion has also launched an inquiry, and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has asked the RCMP to investigate possible obstruction of justice.

On Tuesday, Liberal MPs on the justice committee shut down hearings on the matter, preventing Ms. Wilson-Raybould from returning to testify.

Liberal MPs are also expected to use their majority on the House ethics committee next Tuesday to block an attempt by Conservative and NDP members to mount an inquiry and have the former attorney-general testify.

In testimony last month, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top aides to override federal prosecutors and negotiate a DPA with SNC-Lavalin.

The B.C. MP has said she wanted to return for a second round of testimony to explain what transpired between the time she was moved out of the Justice portfolio and her resignation from cabinet.

She has asked the Prime Minister to give her another waiver from solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality to talk about the conversations with Mr. Trudeau that led to her resignation.

In the Maclean’s interview, Ms. Philpott said she is also keen to have cabinet privilege waived for her as well so she can talk about a meeting with the Prime Minister in which they discussed his plan to move her to Treasury Board and shuffle Ms. Wilson-Raybould out as justice minister and attorney-general. A key topic was the pressure put on Ms. Wilson-Raybould, she said.

“I spoke to the Prime Minister on January the 6th about SNC-Lavalin’s desire to have a DPA,” she said. “I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister. … Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?”

Mr. Trudeau had a different interpretation of that meeting, saying it was mostly about Ms. Philpott’s move from Indigenous Services to Treasury Board and his plan to have Ms. Wilson-Raybould take over her portfolio.

“She asked me directly if this was in link to the SNC-Lavalin decision, and I told her, ‘No, it was not,’ ” he said. “She then mentioned it may be a challenge for Jody-Wilson Raybould to take on the role of Indigenous Services.”

Mr. Trudeau said he asked Ms. Philpott “for her help, and she gladly offered"" to help convince Ms. Wilson-Raybould to take the position. As a former B.C. regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ms. Wilson-Raybould turned down the job because she did not want to oversee the Indian Act.

She was then shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14, which she said she believed was related to her refusal to help SNC-Lavalin.

Ms. Philpott did not respond to requests from The Globe to explain the discrepancy between her and Mr. Trudeau’s versions of the Jan. 6 meeting.

In the Maclean’s interview, she praised Ms. Wilson-Raybould for standing firm, despite “bullying or harassment” from the Prime Minister’s Office to override the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to help SNC-Lavalin.

“The former AG didn’t want to override that, and she had her finger in the dike and said no repeatedly,"" Ms. Philpott said.

Mr. Trudeau said he would not seek to have Ms. Philpott or Ms. Wilson-Raybould ousted from the Liberal caucus – a view shared by some but not all Liberals.

“She is someone I look up to as a mentor,” Toronto MP Julie Dzerowicz said of Ms. Philpott. Charlottetown MP Sean Casey said she was a “significant contributor"" to caucus.

But Toronto MP John McKay expressed frustration that two former ministers are hurting the Liberals.

“Members are starting to realize that this has political consequences, and the decisions that have been made by both of them over the last few weeks have hurt members,” he told reporters during a break in the marathon voting.

Veteran Liberal MP Judy Sgro, who is also a former cabinet minister, appeared visibly frustrated by Ms. Philpott’s latest comments and the “innuendo” she said they have created.

“There’s no reason that Jane or Jody cannot go into the House of Commons [under] parliamentary privilege, talk for as long as they want, say anything they want,” she said. “There’s absolutely no reason that the two former ministers can’t do that.”

Rob Walsh, a former House of Commons law clerk, said Ms. Wilson-Raybould could rise in the House on a matter of “personal privilege” to ask to speak under the cover of parliamentary immunity and would not be bound by cabinet solidarity and solicitor-client privilege.

“It may be she could argue that she has tried to appear before the justice committee and been denied an opportunity and feels it is imperative that she be afforded an opportunity to respond to the witnesses who testified after she testified,” he said, although he added that the Speaker may not allow her to go on longer than 20 minutes.

Philpott, once one of Trudeau’s most trusted and powerful cabinet ministers, resigned her post as president of the Treasury Board on March 4 citing the government’s handling of the SNC scandal.

Now, in an interview with Paul Wells of Macleans Magazine, Philpott says Canadians would like to hear the whole story.

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system,” Philpott told Wells.

Philpott said her resignation was directly tied to the government’s handling of the SNC file, saying she could no longer keep cabinet solidarity with the PM and how he was portraying the issue.

“I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history,” Philpott said.

The interview was published early Thursday as MPs continued voting in an all-night session.

The Conservatives had asked for former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to appear before the justice committee again and vowed to keep Parliament voting on more than 200 amendments if the Liberals continued to block her appearance.

Rather than allow Wilson-Raybould to speak, the Liberals opted for the all-night session, potentially costing millions of dollars.

When the story broke shortly after 6 a.m., MPs were still in the chamber voting and reading the article on their cellphones.

New Democrat MP Alistair MacGregor tweeted that he listened to Liberal MPs across the aisle attack Philpott, still a Liberal MP, as they read the story.

“Really sad to see them use words like ‘pathetic’ and ‘betrayal’ to describe her. It’s like the Liberals have total blinders on to principled actions,” MacGregor tweeted.

The bombshell from Philpott comes a day after Trudeau’s government was rocked with another resignation, this one not from cabinet but from caucus.

Whitby MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes announced on Wednesday that she was leaving the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent. Caesar-Chavannes had previously said she would not run in the next election but recently let slip how Trudeau reacted when she informed him of her decision.

She says yelling, hostility and guilt where all tactics used by Trudeau, who claimed Caesar-Chavannes didn’t appreciate all that he had done for her. After Trudeau’s office denied any yelling, Caesar-Chavannes’s husband came forward to say that he was in the room during the phone call and could hear Trudeau yelling through the phone.

None of this helps Trudeau with his self-styled feminist image, he’s silencing women and firing or yelling at them when they don’t do his bidding.

The Conservatives have started calling Trudeau a fake feminist, a charge the PM has responded to by saying he supports abortions.

That may be true but he doesn’t support women speaking their mind or acting independently or on principle.

After Philpott’s interview and her revelations, the call has to be made again to let these women speak and speak freely.

Jane Philpott, who resigned her cabinet post over the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin case, told Maclean’s that there’s “much more” to the SNC-Lavalin story and that she believes, “Canadians want to know the whole story.”

In the interview, she goes on to say that she “felt there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system.”

As for the “whole story,” Philpott did not elaborate on the specifics of the alleged political interference, explaining that she had “further issues of concern that [she’s] not free to share.”

Though vague, her comments still breathe new life into a story that has dominated headlines for months — despite the Liberal government’s best attempts to put the scandal behind them.

“I resigned because I could not maintain solidarity with cabinet on the specific issue of the management of the SNC-Lavalin issue,” Philpott reaffirmed in her interview with Maclean’s.

“I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

Philpott is a close ally of Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former Attorney General who claims she was improperly pressured by senior members of Trudeau’s staff to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya.

If convicted, the firm would be barred from bidding on federal contracts for a decade.

In his testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, Trudeau’s close friend and former personal secretary Gerald Butts said that when Trudeau broached the idea of shuffling Wilson-Raybould out of the justice portfolio with Philpott in January, she cautioned him that the former Attorney General might interpret it as a result of her refusal to issue a DPA in the SNC-Lavalin case.

In the Maclean’s interview, Philpott confirmed that this conversation had taken place and eluded to what it meant.

“I think Canadians might want to know why I would have raised that with the Prime Minister a month before the public knew about (the SNC-Lavalin story),” Philpott said.

“Why would I have felt that there was a reason why former minister Wilson-Raybould should not be shuffled?”

Philpott also acknowledged the awkward situation she finds herself in as she continues to speak out on the SNC-Lavalin scandal, while still hoping to run as a Liberal MP.

“This has hurt people, and I feel really sad about that,” Philpott told Maclean’s.

“And I’m really sorry that I had to do it, because there are people who are afraid that they’re not going to get elected because of what I did.”

Philpott’s fresh commentary on the issue, went public after a busy night.

Too soon?: By stumbling his way through the opening weeks of the SNC-Lavalin controversy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau created any number of opportunities for his political opponents to calmly but ruthlessly dismantle his constantly changing narrative. Instead, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer fumbled the opportunity with his pre-mature call for Trudeau’s resignation, writes Andrew MacDougall:

If Canadians are impressed by what they’ve seen from Scheer personally in response to SNC, they’re doing a pretty good job of hiding it. While Conservative support has now surpassed that of Trudeau’s Liberals, Scheer’s personal numbers remain below Trudeau’s. The differential in polling outcomes likely exists because people identify Trudeau much more strongly with his party than Scheer with his, and because the SNC debacle has, to date, been driven more by Trudeau’s missteps than Scheer’s interventions. To wit, Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation (checks calendar) 12 days ago and Trudeau is (checks www.pm.gc.ca) still prime minister. Canadians will have noticed the misfire. (Maclean’s)

If it walks like a lobbyist and talks like a lobbyist: Last fall Canada’s former top bureaucrat called up Canada’s current top bureaucrat to talk about SNC-Lavalin. In doing so, Kevin Lynch, now the chair of the engineering company’s board, may have broken lobbying rules. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick disclosed the Oct. 15 call during his second round of testimony to the justice committee last week, but the Hill Times found no record of such a call in the federal lobbyist registry. A spokesperson for SNC-Lavalin said Lynch’s call was merely to inform Wernick the company would be issuing a statement after prosecutors refused to offer it a remediation agreement. As Wernick told it, Lynch asked him: “Isn’t there anything that can be done?” (Hill Times)

Ethically speaking: The watchdog looking into whether the PMO broke any federal ethics rules in the SNC-Lavalin affair has taken a “prolonged” medical leave, according to his office, which said the investigation will continue in his absence. Mario Dion later told a reporter he hopes to be back within weeks and said “There’s no delay that will be attributable to this. (CBC News, Twitter)

When no one wants Alberta’s oil: Twitter fights about pipeline politics, carbon taxes and culture wars are fashionable. But Alberta needs to think long-term—and not just hope for another boom, writes Jen Gerson;

[Alberta] has a bad habit of talking about the need for economic diversification until the next resource boom rolls around to save the day. “On diversification specifically, it’s just one of those words we throw around, but we don’t know what it means or what the actual goals are,” says Trevor Tombe, a professor of economics at the University of Calgary. The problem is that talk of diversification is just that—talk—if the provincial government’s own fiscal situation remains a mess. Alberta has suffered substantial deficits since the oil price dropped in 2015 and oil revenue tanked with it. Just as a decade of Progressive Conservative governments had done before it, the NDP adopted a strategy of waiting for the oil royalties to come back.

When Alberta doesn’t want Canada: University of Calgary professors David J. Bercuson and Barry Cooper imagine a future when Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and parts of Ontario and B.C. have split from Canada to form the Republic of the Northwest:

The immediate benefits were obvious. Indeed, gaining them was a major part of the failed negotiations of 2020. How long ago that all seems now! First there was an end to the corrupting equalization payments. More symbolic, but tied to equalization, came an end to the absurdities of official bilingualism. With the accession of northern British Columbia, the Northern Gateway oil pipeline to Prince Rupert was built in less than two years. The huge new container port, built at the same time, has cut transit times from Chicago to the Western Pacific by three days as compared to shipping through Vancouver or Seattle. (Maclean’s)

Judy Sgro, a Toronto MP who served as minister of citizenship and immigration for two years under former prime minister Paul Martin, threw down the gauntlet while speaking to Parliament Hill reporters Thursday.

""There's no reason that Jane or Jody cannot go into the House of Commons, parliamentary privilege, talk for as long as they want, say anything they want,"" Sgro said. ""They'll be clear of any cabinet issues. Parliamentary privilege is in the House of Commons and there's absolutely no reason that the two former ministers can't do that.""

The Canadian Press Judy Sgro responds to questions in the House of Commons on Nov. 25, 2004.

Parliamentary privilege essentially gives members of Parliament legal immunity over what they say in the House. According to the rules governing Parliament, MPs must have the freedom to speak about issues ""without fear of civil or criminal prosecution.""

The principle explains why, when an MP says something that could be defamatory, they are often urged by rivals to ""say it outside"" — to literally repeat their words outside of the chamber, where they are not protected from legal consequences.

Sgro, who was first elected in 1999, told reporters she has ""been here a long time"" and knows how things work.

She said there is ""absolutely no reason that we have to have all this innuendo lurking around"" when the House provides an appropriate platform for MPs to speak their mind.

Another Toronto MP, Adam Vaughan, delivered the same message to reporters on Thursday.

""There are forums by which any member of Parliament can... walk into the House of Commons and say what they need to say,"" Vaughan said. ""That's why parliamentary privilege exists. The institutions of Parliament are there and if people have things to say, I have ears to listen.""

The Liberal MPs were asked to react to Philpott's bombshell interview with Maclean's magazine, which landed as MPs were stuck in a marathon voting session triggered by Conservatives.

The move is in response to Liberals voting down a motion Wednesday that called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fully waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence — the principle that discussions between ministers remain private — for Wilson-Raybould.

Opposition MPs want Wilson-Raybould to discuss the events leading to her resignation as veterans affairs minister in February. The motion called for Wilson-Raybould to be able to ""address events"" after she was shuffled from Justice to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14.

Watch: Trudeau says Philpott, Wilson-Raybould still welcome in caucus

Wilson-Raybould told the House justice committee last month that she faced sustained pressure from Trudeau and other officials, when she was attorney general, to help SNC-Lavalin secure a deal to avert criminal prosecution.

The prime minister waived some solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence to allow Wilson-Raybould to testify about the SNC-Lavalin matter, but not about her brief time as veterans affairs minister.

Philpott, who resigned as Treasury Board president weeks ago over the government's handling of the controversy, told Maclean's that ""there is more to the story that should be told"" and that Canadians deserve answers.

""I believe the former attorney general has further points to make. I believe that I have further issues of concern that I'm not free to share,"" Philpott told the magazine, referring to cabinet confidence.

Maclean's columnist Paul Wells noted in his interview that it has been argued the parliamentary privilege enjoyed by Philpott and Wilson-Raybould ""trumps other privilege"" and that she could try to deliver a one-minute member's statement or speak on any bill or motion linked to the controversy.

""I would prefer to err on the side of caution in terms of the very serious oaths that I made when I became a cabinet minister to respect confidentiality,"" Philpott told him. ""And every supposed legal expert in the country weighing in, saying I can assume that that privilege has been waived does not necessarily give me confidence clearly enough that I am prepared to speak.""

Philpott also expressed doubt that she would be given enough time to adequately air things out in the House.

Wilson-Raybould stunned the House last month when she rose to explain why she abstained on voting on an NDP motion calling for a full public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth,"" she said at the time.

In her testimony to the justice committee, Wilson-Raybould said that cabinet confidence placed constraints on her ""ability to speak freely on matters that occurred after I left my post as attorney general."" She agreed, however, to return to the committee if Trudeau would waive those restraints.

Liberal MPs on the committee voted this week to end the group's investigation into the controversy. In response, Tories heckled Finance Minister Bill Morneau during his budget speech and later stormed out of the Commons in protest.","Judy Sgro Calls On Philpott, Wilson-Raybould To Speak On SNC-Lavalin Affair In House Of Commons",HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/21/judy-sgro-philpott-wilson-raybould_a_23698105/
429,Politics,2019-03-22T03:17:00.0000000Z,"The marathon voting session in the House is into its second day, with the Conservatives showing no signs of backing down in light of new comments from former cabinet minister and current Liberal MP Jane Philpott on the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal.","OTTAWA – The marathon voting session in the House is into its second day, with the Conservatives showing no signs of backing down in light of new comments from former cabinet minister and current Liberal MP Jane Philpott on the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal.

In an interview with Maclean’s magazine that has been making waves on Parliament Hill since it was published early Thursday, Philpott said that there is “much more to the story that needs to be told.”

Philpott, who resigned from cabinet earlier this month citing a loss of confidence in the way the government is handling the scandal, said in the interview that she believes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his top staff have been trying to “shut down” the story.

“My sense is that Canadians would like to know the whole story. I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” Philpott said.

The Conservatives launched the overnight series of confidence votes on budgetary measures as their latest procedural display of outrage over what they consider a prolonged “cover up” of the controversy. At the heart of the affair: allegations from former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould that she faced high-level “veiled threats” and months-long attempted political interference from senior government officials in the criminal prosecution of the Quebec engineering giant.

Facing questions about this latest development during a budget photo-op in the GTA, Trudeau—who like his fellow leaders was in and out of the House overnight—dismissed Philpott’s assertion that more needs to be aired. Trudeau said there has already been a “fulsome” accounting of the scandal, with more work to be done by the federal ethics commissioner’s office that is probing the matter.

Trudeau also pointed to Wilson-Raybould’s delivery of four hours of testimony on Feb. 27, after Trudeau waived solicitor-client privileges and cabinet confidences so that she and anyone who participated in discussions with her could “address relevant matters.”

Wilson-Raybould—who over a month ago first stood in the House and implored that she be allowed to “speak my truth”— told the committee that this unprecedented waiver still limited her.

This was something former top Trudeau adviser Gerald Butts disputed when he testified. He also cast doubt on how Wilson-Raybould characterized some key interactions and cited SNC-Lavalin jobs as the Liberals’ main motivation.

Both Wilson-Raybould and Butts’ testimonies occurred before the House Justice Committee, which was probing the matter before Liberal MPs shut it down on Monday, saying Canadians had heard all they need to make their own conclusions about the controversy.

On Thursday, Trudeau also maintained that so long as both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould want to be in the Liberal caucus, they are welcome, even though during a meeting of the Ontario MPs in the Liberal caucus on Wednesday, members of the caucus expressed displeasure with Philpott. He already lost one outspoken Liberal MP from that province this week, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who relegated herself an independent MP for the remainder of this Parliament.

The 257 fiscal motions MPs are working their way through could take up to 40 hours to get through, meaning the filibuster could stretch into Friday.

As of 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, MPs have been voting continuously for more than 20 hours, and have made it through 173 of the 257 votes the Tories are forcing. This filibuster-type tactic was triggered after the Liberal majority shut down the latest in what has been a series of attempts over the several weeks to have Prime Minister Justin Trudeau take further steps to allow Wilson-Raybould speak further and in more detail about the scandal.

This voting marathon is quickly nearing the longest one of this Parliament, as the longest one to date was in March 21 over the India trip affair. In that instance, the Conservatives also initially also pledged ""about 40 hours"" of votes, and it ended up being a 21-hour procedural standoff.

Particularly the opposition have been keen to hear more about the series of events that unfolded after Wilson-Raybould was shuffled into veterans affairs. She has said that she believes what many saw as a demotion, was connected to her refusal to bow to calls to reconsider a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, a measure federal prosecutors remain adamantly opposed to.

Wilson-Raybould left the veterans affairs portfolio in the early days of this scandal, and there’s since been two federal cabinet shuffles to readjust Trudeau’s front bench following her and Philpott’s high-profile departures.

Neither Wilson-Raybould nor Philpott were present for this vote, nor have they been seen in the Commons during the ongoing marathon session of confidence votes.

Throughout the marathon, Conservatives have been voting against every line item, which Liberals have been using to try to score political points on social media, pointing out some of the government programs and services the Tories are opposing. Though, from the Conservative’s perspective, their “no” votes are to signal they do not have confidence in the government.

There will be no normal House proceedings on Thursday as a result of the ongoing votes, meaning no question period, and no committee meetings.

In anticipation of the late-night sitting, cots were set up on the government side just outside the House of Commons chamber.

Armed with the new article, opposition MPs have periodically rose on various points of order to reference Philpott’s latest comments and try to poke at the Liberals to see if there’s any movement on agreeing to re-open aspects of the affair. So far all of these attempts have been rejected by the Liberals.

430,Business,2019-03-21T16:41:00.0000000Z,"VANCOUVER—As another scandal plays out in Ottawa, government watchdog groups are calling for wider scrutiny of SNC-Lavalin's activities in jurisdictions like British Columbia, where the company donated to the ruling political party at the same time it ...","Through Elections BC's political donations database, the Star verified that between 2005 and 2013, SNC-Lavalin and the company's chairman of the board at the time, Gwyn Morgan, donated a combined total of $196,157 to the BC Liberal Party.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

And they have been especially concerned about what appears to be political interference in the administration of our criminal justice system.

I have been the vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Until recently, our committee functioned well. A spirit of collegiality infused our deliberations. Our reports regularly contained unanimous recommendations. However, all that changed with our study into allegations of attempted interference with the former attorney-general’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified that she experienced “consistent and sustained pressure” to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. And that pressure appears to have emanated from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Clerk of the Privy Council and from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself. Sadly, the Liberals on the committee confirmed on Tuesday that they are not interested in finding out what happened: they pushed through a motion to end our study. No other witnesses, including Wilson-Raybould, will be able to speak.

It is difficult to overstate how serious this is. The former attorney-general testified that veiled threats were made to browbeat her to take into account partisan political considerations in deciding whether a criminal prosecution should proceed. And when she refused to relent, she was removed from her position. This would be contrary to the rule-of-law principle, something that is enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Is that what happened? Canadians need to know.

Wilson-Raybould made clear that she still had crucial evidence to provide but was prohibited from speaking about why she resigned from cabinet. Three times I asked the committee to invite her to return and be permitted by the prime minister to speak to contradictory testimony given by Trudeau’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and — until he resigned on Monday — the senior public servant in Canada, Michael Wernick. I also moved that all those implicated in her testimony appear. These motions were all defeated by the Liberal majority.

So now there can be doubt: The Liberals are not interested in finding out what happened. Instead, their only goal seems to be containing the political fallout. Although the prime minister always says that the committee is master of its own procedure, Canadians can now see that the Liberals are being controlled. The prime minister has repeatedly lauded our committee as the place where answers can be found — now we know this isn’t true.

I was truly disheartened to have a front-row seat at this political theatre. I watched the Liberals clumsily cherry-pick witnesses and adjourn an emergency meeting on a whim. All of this culminated in their feeble attempt to use budget day as a fig leaf to conceal the truth.

Words like “cover up” are no longer rhetorical.

The Liberals’ partisanship, the lack of transparency and the dismissive tone applied to the serious allegations should give all Canadians pause. After all, two highly respected cabinet ministers — Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott — have quit the cabinet over this issue.

I have tried to keep an open mind, to be nonpartisan and to seek the truth for Canadians. Yet I have been stonewalled by Liberal colleagues more concerned with damage control than determining whether there was inappropriate political interference. The NDP has called for a public inquiry. Now that the Justice Committee has failed utterly to do its job, that call is even more urgent.

– Canada’s Liberal government continues to be mired in controversy following the SNC-Lavalin affair. Celina Caesar-Chavannes, MP from Whitby, Ontario, has quit the Liberal caucus and will sit as an independent. Caesar-Chavannes is the fifth Liberal member to distance herself from the party since early February. “I think it’s important to understand that while I support the values and principles of the Liberal Party, that it might be good, since that message did go out, that I sit as an independent for the rest of the term that I’m here,” she told CBC News. Caesar-Chavannes will not stand for re-election in October.

The report by Transparency International Canada, along with Canadians for Tax Fairness and Publish What You Pay Canada, found that some $28.4 billion worth of residential purchases since 2008 were done through corporate entities.

The corporate structures, whether companies, trusts or nominees, allow the beneficial owner to stay hidden from law enforcement, tax authorities, and anti-money-laundering obligations.

The report further notes that $9.8 billion worth of the housing purchases were done without a mortgage, eliminating another layer of checks on sources of funds and beneficial owners.

The groups call for governments to require beneficial owners to identify themselves and make the information publicly available, along with other measures to make it easier to determine who truly owns property.

They determined the numbers in the report by analyzing more than 1.4 million residential property transactions. They say analysis focused on corporate entities because there is no data on nominee owners and trusts.
