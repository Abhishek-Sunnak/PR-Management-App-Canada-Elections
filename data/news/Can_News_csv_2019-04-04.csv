""I was overjoyed,"" said Frank, a Canadian living in the United States who received the letter earlier this month confirming his right to cast a ballot in the upcoming federal election.

For seven years, Frank and other Canadians living abroad fought for the right to vote in general elections and national referendums.

In December 2018, the Trudeau government passed Bill 76 — just a month before the Supreme Court of Canada shot down the 1993 law that prohibited Canadians who had lived outside Canada for more than five years from voting in Canadian elections, calling it a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Frank and fellow ex-pat Jamie Duong filed that charter challenge after being denied ballots in 2011. Bill 76 restored voting rights to all Canadians living abroad; the Supreme Court ruling prevents future governments from restoring the ban.

Number of international voters could triple

Since January, Elections Canada has been mailing out letters to Canadians abroad reminding them that they're back on the international electors list.

""It felt like a moment of closure, a moment of real victory,"" Frank said.

Elections Canada expects to see a surge in the number of mail-in or 'special' ballots. It estimates the number of Canadians voting from abroad could almost triple — from 11,000 voters in 2015 to 30,000 in 2019.

To cope with the demand, Elections Canada issued a tender in March for a new system to automate the way ballots are distributed.

""We are reducing the number of processes carried out by hand related to special ballots,"" Elections Canada spokesperson Natasha Gauthier said in an email. ""In automating these processes, we will reduce the number of staff required to handle the volume of ballots we receive.

""These optimizations will not include automated counting of ballots — all ballots will still be marked and counted by hand.""

'We're all Canadian citizens'

Duong said Canadians should not fret about the prospect of votes by Canadians living in the U.S. or Hong Kong swinging individual ridings. If it happens, it happens, he said.

""You can say that about any group. What if votes of people 65 and over change the outcome? What if votes [from voters aged] 18 to 25 change the outcome?"" Duoug said.

""We're all Canadian citizens. We all have a right to vote. So, yes our votes should matter. And they should possibly change the outcome of the elections.""

Former chief electoral officer Jean-Pierre Kingsley argues we'll never know for sure whether the re-appearance of ex-pat voting in 2019 had any real effect on the outcome, since voting is secret. And while ""it just takes one vote to swing a riding,"" he said, the ex-pat vote likely isn't going to have that kind of influence because Canadians abroad have to jump through a lot of hoops before casting ballots.

International voters, he said, have to register themselves on the international voter list, find which ridings they belong to, figure out who's running, fill out their ballots correctly and then mail them in on time. They also have to pay the international postage themselves.

Some political party leaders have said the equalization formula is unfair for Alberta, and promised to push Ottawa to revise or end it, if elected on April 16.

READ MORE: Alberta gives more than it gets from federal government, Fraser Institute says

But how much sway could a province have over a federal program? What would it take to change the formula to better serve Alberta? Is it even possible?

What’s the allegation?

Both the United Conservatives and the Alberta Party have vowed to get a better deal for Alberta by way of equalization reform.

“Every year, Albertans send billions of dollars to Ottawa that aren’t spent on Albertans, but instead given away to other provinces,” Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel said on Monday.

“And in return, we receive rejection, scorn and attacks on our industries and our way of life. We see that with a hijacked coastline, and an unfair equalization program, and refusals to consider pipelines like Energy East.”

WATCH BELOW (March 21, 2019): Jason Kenney announces his UCP government would hold a referendum on removing Alberta from equalization payments in Oct. 2021 if certain conditions are not met.

Jason Kenney, a former MP who is now leader of the UCP, has said he would use equalization as a negotiation tool.

“We will send a clear message to Justin Trudeau that if we do not get a timely completion of a coastal pipeline, if he will not withdraw anti-Alberta laws, like Bill C-69, that we are prepared to put on the table equalization, by holding a constitutional referendum to end equalization, to assert our fight for fairness to the top of the national agenda,” Kenney said last week.

The matter would be put before voters on Oct. 18, 2021, which would be the date of the next municipal elections in Alberta, he said.

What is equalization?

Equalization was established as part of Canada’s federal system of intergovernmental transfers in 1957. It is intended to address “fiscal disparities among provinces,” according to the federal Department of Finance.

“The goal of the program is actually outlined in the Constitution,” University of Alberta political scientist Jared Wesley said.

“It’s to provide all Canadians with comparable services at comparable levels of taxation. It does that by flowing money from the federal government straight to lower-than-average-performing economies.”

Equalization was entrenched in the Canadian Constitution in 1982. Allocations are determined by measuring provinces’ ability to raise revenues from natural resources, income and property taxes.

“So, if a province is below the national average, in terms of what it can raise in money, that doesn’t mean that its citizens have to suffer from sub-standard services on one hand or well-above-average levels of taxation on the other,” Wesley explained.

WATCH BELOW (July 5, 2018): A University of Alberta political science professor weighs in on the federal government’s controversial equalization payments.

In the 2018-2019 year, Quebec, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Prince Edward Island will receive transfer payments. Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador and British Columbia will not.

READ MORE: Equalization payments — how they work, and why some provinces are upset

Wesley said Alberta received equalization payments for a brief time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before the oil and gas sector took off, but hasn’t been a “have-not” province since then.

“The biggest public misconception about equalization is that Alberta — or Albertans — send cheques through their government to other provinces like Quebec for the program. That’s simply not the way that it works.

“The federal government takes tax dollars from all across Canada and spends it on all kinds of different programs, services and transfers — like equalization — so it’s not possible for Alberta to withdraw from the program nor is it possible for Albertans to stop the payments of equalization.

“That’s something that the federal government has to decide on its own, in terms of what the formula is and how it’s distributed.”

Other federal transfers

Equalization is just one of the federal transfers distributed to provinces and territories. There are also social and health transfers, which provinces must spend on public health care and social services such as social assistance and child care.

In the 2019-20 year, Ottawa will give provinces and territories more than $78 billion in major transfer payments. The health transfer is the largest; double the $20 billion being spent on equalization in the 2019-20 budget.

READ MORE: Equalization debate re-emerges ahead of ministers’ meeting in Ottawa

In 2014, the federal Conservative government under Stephen Harper, approved changes to the way federal transfers are calculated.

“Equalization was simplified dramatically,” Wesley said. “It was actually under the direction of a former deputy minister of finance here from Alberta, Al O’Brien, who toured across the entire country hearing from Canadians about how to improve the equalization system.

“Changes were made to equalization that made the equalization pot bigger and put it on a sustainable path and a predictable path… It linked it to economic growth.

“At the same time those changes were made, there were changes made to other fiscal transfers including health care, which benefited ‘have’ provinces like Alberta.

“Alberta, out of this deal… did see a larger share of healthcare funding from the federal government to the tune of about $1 billion a year.”

In 2019-20, the government of Alberta will receive $6.4 billion through major transfers, including a $4.7-billion Canada Health Transfer and a $1.7-billion Canada Social Transfer. The per capita allocation ($1,465) is exactly the same as Ontario’s.

Can Alberta opt out of or end equalization?

Not in its current form, Wesley said.

“The only hope of not participating in revenue-sharing across the country is to remove it from the Constitution and scrap the formula. Doing that is very, very difficult considering it would require the permission of exactly those provinces that receive equalization.”

The three energy-producing provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland) urged Ottawa in 2017 to rework the federal transfer formula but Finance Minister Bill Morneau locked in the existing formula for another five years, until 2024.

Politicians in Saskatchewan and Alberta slammed the extension, saying the formula was flawed and that more consultation with provinces was needed. However, the federal finance ministry said the decision to keep the formula the same was made after one year of “intense discussion and consultation,” including with provincial counterparts.

What about a constitutional referendum?

“A provincial government can host a referendum on any constitutional question and, according to some interpretations, that would require the federal government to negotiate in good faith on that particular issue,” Wesley said.

There have been three (non-binding) referendums in Canada: on Prohibition in 1898, on conscription in 1942, and the Charlottetown Accord on constitutional reform in 1992.

The law does not require the federal government to hold a referendum for amendments to the Constitution but the Referendum Act does offer a framework should the government decide to do so. In Alberta, the Constitutional Referendum Act requires that constitutional amendments be subject to a provincial referendum.

Some experts argue that a 1998 Supreme Court decision means that if representatives of one province want to amend the Constitution, other provinces and the federal government must enter into negotiations to discuss the issue.

That desire could be voiced through a provincial referendum, the decision says.

“The corollary of a legitimate attempt by one participant in Confederation to seek an amendment to the Constitution is an obligation on all parties to come to the negotiating table.”

However, the court did not specify what form the negotiations must take, exactly who should participate, or at what “table” they should occur.

READ MORE: Premier Scott Moe says he wants to renegotiate equalization

Rather than threatening to force a referendum on the issue, Wesley thinks it would be more effective to elect strong western Canadian voices as MPs in Ottawa.

“For years, western Canada was very well represented in the Harper government — Jason Kenney was in that government — and made some substantive, important, and, a lot of people would say, positive changes to the way equalization worked and the way that health and social transfers flowed to the province.

“So it’s a wonder now that one of the architects of that revision is now having problems with it when they could have had a lot of opportunity to change it.”

WATCH BELOW (June 22, 2018): Alberta Opposition Leader Jason Kenney criticized how the government handled the equalization formula extension and called their lack of communication on it “shocking.”

What else should I know?

Equalization is meant to address provincial disparities over the long term. Being on the receiving end isn’t something we should wish for, Wesley said.

“Alberta will never be a recipient of equalization as we know it today. The economy will never fall below the national average, and if it did, we’re in a heap of trouble as a country, economically.

“Where I think critics do have a point though, is that when Alberta and other provinces like Saskatchewan and B.C. go through tough economic times and they suffer year-over-year drops that are sudden — like we did with our most recent oil crash — that the federal government should provide more support to those provinces through fiscal stabilization.

“If you’re reading between the lines, I think that’s what the UCP is looking to do with this campaign promise through a referendum — is to get the federal government back to the table to talk about those kinds of issues.”

Provinces must apply for the Fiscal Stabilization Program, which provides “financial assistance to any province with a year-over-year decline in its non-resource revenues greater than five per cent,” according to the department of finance. In 2015-16, Alberta received $251 million.

“When Albertans get upset that they still see their hard-earned tax dollars flowing to Ottawa and not coming back in the forms of programs and services, they have a point,” Wesley said.

“It’s right to think the federal government should increase the amount that it sends to provinces like Alberta that go through tough times through the Fiscal Stabilization Fund. But it’s important to note that that Fiscal Stabilization Fund is not equalization.”

In the 2015 general election, the parties spent more than $7.5 million altogether, according to Elections Alberta. The Progressive Conservatives spent $4.3 million of that amount, followed by the NDP with $1.6 million and the Wildrose Party with $1.2 million.

Spending limits

Unlike the previous general election campaign, spending by political parties during the 28-day writ period is now capped at $2 million, courtesy of the Fair Elections Financing Act, introduced by the NDP in November 2016. Candidates are limited to spending $50,000.

Donations from unions and corporations have also since been banned, replaced by registered third-party interest groups. They can each spend up to $150,000 during the writ period.

“There are dozens of [third-party interest groups] that are all participating in raising and spending money in this campaign,” said Justin Archer, a former political operative and who is now a partner with Berlin Communications. “I think this will be the most expensive election campaign in Alberta’s history.”

So angry that you don’t question who or what it came from, or if it’s true.

Online misinformation comes in many forms: it can take the shape of a tweet, a comment, an ad or even look like a news story. The commonality is that the information presented is false, and meant to inflame the people who encounter it.

As Albertans prepare to go to the polls April 16, political parties and voters alike have taken to social media to share information, spar and, at times, full-out brawl. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been used to spread misinformation — the most notorious example being Russia’s use of the tactic to interfere in the 2016 United States election.

But since then, both social media companies and governments around the world have said they’ve stepped up efforts to fortify against online malfeasance — and the upcoming Alberta election is no exception.

‘Potential’ threat

During its preparations for the writ drop, Elections Alberta sought advice from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) about preventing online malfeasance.

CSIS spokesman John Townsend said the agency routinely engages with a “variety of stakeholders” on potential security threats.

“Democratic institutions and processes, including elections, are valuable targets for hostile state actors, and Canada is not immune to these types of threat activities,” he said in an email.

Alberta’s deputy chief electoral officer Drew Westwater said in a recent interview that the provincial election was not deemed by CSIS to be in a “high threat” category.

“They thought ours was a potential threat, but not a high threat,” Westwater said.

Westwater said that CSIS and other security agencies seemed to be more concerned about attempts to interfere in the federal election, which will be held in the fall.

“We’ve briefed our own teams here, and our contracted agencies looking after social media for us on the threats and possibilities of that,” said Westwater.

‘It’s very effective’

Online security expert and NAIT instructor John Zabiuk said that while the spread of online misinformation in Canada isn’t nearly as pervasive as some other parts of the world, it does happen. Last year, evidence surfaced that the same Russian troll farm that meddled in the American election was found to have dabbled in influencing the Keystone XL pipeline debate in Canada.

But fake content shared with malicious intent — distinct from a strong opinion that someone disagrees with — certainly doesn’t always come from outside the country.

“We do see local accounts being set up just for that specific reason, to target local issues,” Zabiuk said in an interview Friday.

Misinformation comes in many forms: from comments and posts, to memes and videos. It can look like an advertisement or even a news article. True ‘fake news’ is often characterized by an unflattering photo of the politician or figure being targeted, and is accompanied by an inflammatory headline, Zabiuk said.

He said the common characteristic of false information is that it evokes such a strong emotional reaction that it clouds a person’s ability to assess if what they’re seeing is factual.

“If you tell people something and you say it enough, and you say it with enough conviction and they start to feel it, then it becomes the truth in their world,” Zabiuk said. “And that’s really what trolling comes down to, just trying to make people believe what you’re saying. And it’s very effective.”

As troubling as the spread of misinformation can be, Zabiuk said that fully handing over the reins of online discourse to either government agencies or private companies in hopes of stamping malicious content out is a dangerous prospect.

“In a world of free communication, the internet presents a very difficult piece to try to control. The real question is, do we want to control it? Should we be monitoring, or do we need to find some other way to make people understand what is legitimate and what is not?” he said.

Corporate responsibility?

Twitter officials have been active in Alberta for about six months, getting ready for the election by connecting with Elections Alberta, the government and the political parties, said Michele Austin, head of public policy for Twitter Canada.

She said there’s a team focused on monitoring what’s happening during the election, and that Twitter wants to keep discourse vibrant and “safe.”

She said Twitter relies on its users to report misinformation when they see it, but that the company has also improved the automated tools and safety procedures for detecting and stopping malicious activity online.

“One of the main things we’re trying to distinguish is whether or not the action behind the tweet is malicious. So, some people might spread fake news because they don’t know or they don’t understand the subject,” she said.

Austin said she couldn’t comment right now on how much, if any, malicious spreading of information has been detected so far during the election period, but said that the company would be able to share what they found in the future.

Facebook also has a team with eyes on Alberta for the campaign, said Kevin Chan, the company’s head of public policy for Canada.

Chan talked about Facebook’s efforts related to the Alberta election during a March 23 panel discussion at a conference hosted by the Manning Centre, a Calgary-based conservative think tank.

Like Twitter, Facebook acknowledged the spread of misinformation during the presidential election, and has since improved its artificial intelligence tools to identify what it calls “bad actors,” and increased its security staff to 30,000 from 10,000.

Chan said in an emailed statement that Facebook has been working on security for Canadian elections — both federal and provincial — since 2017, and that no foreign co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour has been observed so far.

Canada’s United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (known as the Steelworkers) began their four-day national policy convention in Vancouver on Tuesday.

The Steelworkers said Donald Trump’s tariffs led to job losses, uncertainty and a reduction of steel exports to the U.S. of up to 29 per cent. ( Alex McKeen / Star Vancouver )

The Steelworkers in Canada have more than 225,000 members in industries that range from manufacturing, to services, security and universities. But on Tuesday morning, the convention was laser-focused on the Steelworkers’ namesake industry, with leaders calling on the federal government to fight back more forcefully against U.S. steel tariffs and prolong efforts to prop up the domestic industry as a months-long trade war rages on. Trump in May slapped tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminum imported from Canada and other allies. Local 9548 union president Cody Alexander, who represents workers at Algoma Tubes in Sault Sainte Marie, Ont., said local members were initially sympathetic to Trump’s campaign promises to crack down on imports of cheap steel from China to protect American jobs.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in June that the steel and aluminum tariffs Washington imposed on Canada and other allies were designed to force them to address the overproduction and overcapacity of steel around the world. The Trump administration has also drawn direct links between steel imports, tariffs and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which concluded when the parties signed the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement in November.

But the agreement hasn’t been ratified yet, prompting calls by the union to reject it. Steelworkers national director Ken Neumann said the signing of the agreement, which was not accompanied by the removal of the tariffs, was an affront to workers who saw the government giving up their best bargaining chip. “Do not ratify the USMCA,” Neumann said, calling out the government in a speech to more than 400 union delegates Tuesday. “Have the decency. When you say you have our back, show us what you mean.”

A third of Canadian exporters reported being hurt by the tariffs in a December survey. The Steelworkers said the tariffs led to job losses, uncertainty and a reduction of steel exports to the U.S. of up to 29 per cent. Neumann vowed the Steelworkers would make the tariffs and trade deal an election issue. The union also wants the government to extend temporary steel industry “safeguards” implemented in October, which apply a 25 per cent tax to certain foreign steel products “in cases where the level of imports from trading partners exceeds historical norms.” Currently Canada has tariffs on U.S. steel, and the extra 25 per cent tax could apply to imports of cheap steel from China and elsewhere. Steelworkers want to see the rule, which encourages the purchase of domestic steel, made permanent. A construction industry coalition called The Canadian Coalition for Construction Steel opposed the move, saying it would make accessing steel more expensive for builders in Canada. Tom Sigurdson, executive director of the B.C. Building Trades unions, said there’s no doubt construction jobs are impacted by the tariffs and Canada’s response to them. But he still wants to see Canada encourage the use of domestic product. “We should be using the best steel available, and it comes from Canada,” he said.

With a federal election mere months away, what should Canadians demand from politicians to tackle this crisis?

Isabelle Turcotte, director of federal policy at the Pembina Institute environmental think-tank, spoke with On The Coast host Gloria Macarenko to offer her thoughts on what Canadians should look for when deciding who to vote for.

What sort of checklist should voters have when they're trying to evaluate their political representatives?

Voters should look for strong climate platforms and leaders who will be dedicated to tackling this issue with concrete action and concrete policies that will reduce our emissions and transform every sector of our economy.

How does the average voter know what is a concrete policy?

Let's get all of our leadership hopefuls on the record saying that they are committed to meeting our Paris Agreement target and that they are also committed to increasing that target because we know that that target is not quite enough

Look for policies that reduce emissions in the transport sector. Concrete things like increasing electric vehicles on the road. Look for policies that put more renewable energy on the grid, for policies that help our industrial sector decarbonize.

Really concrete things that make our economic sectors more efficient and more economically competitive.

Well, you can have concrete evidence for a government that's in power, but what about parties that are out of government?

A very important element is policy certainty to make sure that those industries that are making investments in the current regulatory environment where we are putting in place our climate plans and guiding investments, that they know they can be confident that this regulatory environment will be sustained and dialed up because we know we need to do more.

So seeing some policy alignment between what's being proposed is really valuable — between what's being proposed by leadership hopefuls and what exists is a good indicator.

Despite climate change being an issue that's affecting all of us there are very clear partisan divides on it among provinces. Ontario and Saskatchewan are against the carbon tax vehemently. Why is this happening?

To those who oppose this measure, which we know is the lowest-cost measure to reduce our emissions, to those who oppose that approach, put forward your alternatives and let's debate it. I think that's what Canadians need to demand of their leaders.

Angry legislators are starting to push back against Trudeau and his team, opening up public divisions of the kind the ruling Liberals have not seen for almost 20 years.

Trudeau has been under pressure over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on then-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to try to ensure SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial by paying a fine instead.

Wilson-Raybould resigned on Feb. 12 after being demoted within the Cabinet, and a second minister, Jane Philpott, subsequently quit over the way the matter had been handled.

The mood among senior advisers inside the prime minister’s office has often been grim, according to two Liberals familiar with the matter.

“The frustration is certainly more palpable than it was a couple of weeks ago ... it’s not the happiest of places to spend much time,” said one of the people, who like others cited in this story requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. Despite a sea of unfavorable headlines as well as opinion polls showing the Liberals are on track to lose October’s federal election, Trudeau’s approach has been to wait it out.

His support for keeping the two former Cabinet ministers in caucus – while indicating both could run again for the party in October - is also inexplicable to Liberal lawmakers who say it threatens party unity.

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott say they are acting out of principle and that the scandal shows the Liberal Party needs to do better.

Many lawmakers are furious that Trudeau’s team did not do more to shut down the affair soon after it erupted on Feb. 7. In a sign of their anger, they look set to defy his wishes and expel at least Wilson-Raybould from caucus at its next scheduled meeting on Wednesday.

“They have bungled this from the start. They should have issued an apology, promised to do better and moved on,” said one of the party’s most senior figures.

Instead, Trudeau initially denied anyone in his office had inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould, only to have her publicly testify to the contrary. She released more documents on Friday, ensuring the story was kept alive.

Some legislators complain that Trudeau’s tight-knit team has kept them at a distance, that it can be hard to speak to the prime minister alone and that he has ignored people with experience. Trudeau, 47, came to power in 2015 with a small cadre of longtime intimates serving as a brain trust, including Gerald Butts, his close friend and top political adviser. Butts resigned in February amid the scandal.

Members of the Trudeau team are pushing back against the criticism, arguing they are doing the best they can. “No one is claiming the outcome was handled well, but I’m not sure it would have gone any better had we tried something else,” said a third Liberal, conceding that “perhaps there can be some recalibration” on improving relations with legislators.

A government official, pressed on Trudeau’s handling of the affair and criticism from Liberals, said the prime minister was “very proud of the team” and focusing on his agenda.

‘PUT UP OR SHUT UP’

Trudeau has made small shifts in strategy, such as reaching out more to his members of parliament and slightly broadening his circle of advisers, but otherwise insists on staying the course.

“He doesn’t throw chairs against the wall or bang on tables. That’s not his style,” said the third Liberal.

“But he can be very stubborn. Once he’s decided on something, that’s it.”

Trudeau told reporters last week that his team was “stronger and more united than ever before,” but the splits are clear for all to see. Liberal legislator Judy Sgro urged Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to “either put up or shut up” and said they were being selfish.

Ironically, Liberals say it was the Trudeau team’s desire to prevent further outbreaks of intraparty hostility that helped exacerbate the current crisis.

Unhappy Liberals complain Trudeau’s closest advisers sidelined a raft of party veterans after the 2015 election who were associated with past infighting. They say that deprived Trudeau of the chance to consult people with previous experience of dealing with problems.

“It’s almost like ‘we are not a continuation of the Liberal Party, we’re new and different.’ And by doing that, there’s no question they don’t have the same group to circle the wagons and defend them that they once had,” said a fourth Liberal. As well, Trudeau, a self-avowed feminist who appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet, recruited star candidates like Wilson-Raybould and Philpott who veteran legislators complain had no experience of federal politics and therefore were unfamiliar with conventions on party loyalty and solidarity.

While polls suggest an October election defeat, some insiders are less gloomy. That said, they concede the result could well be a minority government, which would leave the Liberals reliant on opposition parties to push through their agenda.

Senior Liberals say there are signs the public is becoming bored of the tale, giving the prime minister the chance to grab hold of the news agenda and reduce the pressure on his inner circle.

“The mood was terrible for a while, but it’s getting better,” said the third Liberal.",Canada's Trudeau sticks to guns as scandal threatens re-election,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1RD3BX-OCADN

Their message comes as Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said his party will use “innovative ways” to communicate with voters, such as the party’s decision to send a large volume of text messages on the weekend to voters in the four provinces affected by the new federal carbon tax that took effect Monday.

As the October election looms, political campaigners across the country will be working to update and expand the large databases of potential backers used by parties to target their messages and identify supporters.

Yet federal parties are entirely exempt from Canada’s privacy laws, which require private companies to obtain the clear consent of users before collecting and using personal information.

Chief Electoral Officer Stéphane Perrault and federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien issued new guidelines Monday that call on federal political parties to do more than what is legally required.

“I’m hopeful that they go beyond the bare minimums. Ultimately, this is about trust in the electoral process,” Mr. Perrault said.

In a separate interview, Mr. Therrien said he hopes the guidelines will encourage parties “to raise the bar” and increase trust while also providing citizens with suggestions for what they should be demanding from political parties.

“It’s also for electors, to see what they should expect from a party that protects privacy,” he said.

New election legislation took effect April 1 that requires all political parties to have a policy for protecting the personal information of Canadians and to publish these plans by July 1.

The requirement to have a privacy policy in place falls far short of past recommendations by the privacy commissioner, who had called for political parties to be subject to federal privacy laws.

Nonetheless, the two independent offices released guidelines Monday reminding parties of what the new law requires and adds examples of how they could go further if they wanted to meet international privacy standards.

The guidelines provide a sense of the kinds of things political parties could be doing with personal information that would raise concerns.

For instance, it states that individuals should be informed if their e-mail addresses will be sent to companies such as social-media platforms for data analysis and profiling. It also says a strong policy that complies with international standards would seek consent if information will be used to group individuals by age, gender, financial status, ethnicity or religious affiliation as a way of predicting how they will vote. The guidelines also recommend that parties should give individuals access to their information upon request to see what has been gathered.

Under the new law, political parties are only required to have a privacy policy in place that meets minimum standards in terms of topics covered, such as a statement of the types of personal information that are collected.

“There’s nothing that they cannot do under their privacy policies,"" Mr. Perreault said.

Conservative Party spokesman Cory Hann said the party “will follow all rules and laws that are in place.” Liberal Party spokesman Braeden Caley said the party will release an updated policy that will “further enhance our party’s strong privacy commitments,"" while NDP spokesman Guillaume Francoeur said the party already complies with the new law and “will be looking closely at international best practices” as it updates its policy.

At a news conference in Upper Letang, N.B., Mr. Scheer was asked about his party’s decision to send mass texts to individuals on the weekend reminding them to fill up their gas tanks before Monday’s start of the carbon tax.

“I can assure you that all the rules were followed as it relates to communicating with Canadians,” he said. “It’s part of our innovative ways to try to communicate with Canadians as technology evolves.

Lloyd Axworthy, a former Liberal cabinet minister, is leading 160 Canadian volunteers monitoring Ukraine’s presidential elections. Speaking to The Globe and Mail on Monday – one day after the first round of votes in Ukraine – he said the presidential election met international standards in most of the country, but expressed concerns about the situation in Russian-controlled regions where people were unable to vote.

There were no voting stations for Ukrainian citizens in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian-controlled parts of the eastern Donbass region, where Ukraine is at war with Russian separatists. Mr. Axworthy said Ukrainians in those areas should be allowed to cross the border to vote, but Russian occupiers have employed aggressive tactics to prevent them from doing so.

Story continues below advertisement

“I think the Russians really are abusing the human rights of these people,"" Mr. Axworthy said. ""They have an important right to vote, and I think they are doing everything in their power to try to undermine it.”

He said some of the election observers in eastern Ukraine heard about voters being deliberately held up at the Russian-controlled border, while others couldn’t even get to the border.

“We had discussions with some of the observers who were talking about how in the areas around some of the checkpoints there were land-mine fields that people see as a real risk,” Mr. Axworthy said.

The land-mines issue is particularly important to Mr. Axworthy. When he was Canada’s foreign affairs minister in 1997, Mr. Axworthy spearheaded the Ottawa Treaty, a United Nations convention aimed at eliminating anti-personnel landmines around the world.

In February, two people were killed and a third injured when a minibus hit a landmine while crossing the border between Ukraine and Donetsk, in the Donbass region. The passengers were returning to the rebel-controlled region after collecting their pensions in Ukraine.

Mr. Axworthy said Russia should also be “called to account” for using online propaganda to tell Ukrainian citizens in the Russian-controlled regions the election is not legitimate. He said the Russian interference is a “wake up call” to other democracies, including Canada.

“We’re used to our ways of free elections. ... But maybe not as prepared or as conscious as we should be of how disruptive this can be,"" Mr. Axworthy said.

A comedian and actor with no political experience led the Ukrainian presidential race after the first round of votes on Sunday.

Volodymyr Zelensky stars in a popular television show in which he plays a schoolteacher who becomes president after a video of him blasting corruption goes viral. Mr. Zelensky is now trying to turn his show into a reality, naming his political party after the TV program: Servant of the People.

Mr. Axworthy said Mr. Zelensky appears to have established a reliable base of supporters, especially among young people, who made a strong showing at the polls on Sunday. But he said there are still questions about how the celebrity candidate would lead Ukraine.

“He won’t make promises so that he doesn’t have to break promises,” Mr. Axworthy said.

“If he gets elected, what will he be able to do to deal with some of the really serious issues? This is a country still at war. It’s a country that’s being highly pressured by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and the Russians. They need a strong president.”

Mr. Zelensky secured 30 per cent of votes as of Monday, ahead of incumbent President Petro Poroshenko. With no candidate taking more than half the votes, a runoff election is scheduled for April 21.

Mr. Axworthy said the first round of elections was fair and should generate confidence in Ukrainians for the runoff vote and parliamentary elections later this year.

Despite the controversial SNC Lavalin affair that has been dominating headlines, Atlantic MPs appear to continue to have faith in the party — an official Liberal party list identified 20 MPs that have been confirmed nominated, and SaltWire was able to confirm the candidacy of an additional six that are nominated, have plans to announce soon, or are on the verge of being nominated.

The only MPs that will not have their names on the ballot are long-time Nova Scotia MPs Bill Casey and Mark Eyking, one-term Nova Scotia MP Colin Fraser and one-term New Brunswick MP T.J. Harvey. Cape Breton MP Rodger Cuzner has stated publicly he is on the fence about his plans to run, and former treasury board president Scott Brison quit cabinet back in January and has since resigned his seat in order take a job in the private sector, so the Kings-Hants Liberal nomination still open.

“It’s important to remember that the Liberals swept all of Atlantic Canada at the last election. So there's certainly an incentive to run again if you’ve won the previous time,” said Dalhousie University sociology professor Howard Ramos.

Polling trends indicating a region that is still open to a Liberal federal government, and the Liberals’ movement on things like the National Shipbuilding Strategy and infrastructure are all reasons why the Atlantic Liberals are likely feeling confident, Ramos said.

Don Desserud, political science professor at the University of PEI said in many cases political parties have deep roots in certain ridings in Atlantic Canada, therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see that the Liberals have a full slate of candidates.

“I see this as basically party loyalty and something that comes with having members of the party that probably have long family roots and other reasons why they’re part of that of that team in the first place,” he said.

In Nova Scotia, however, the Liberals have suffered a major blow to their election lineup — with long-serving MPs like Casey, Brison, and Eyking out of the mix. Now Cuzner — who has spoken openly in the media about his disappointment in being left out of cabinet in the shuffle triggered by Brison’s departure — is also considering making an exit from politics.

Former Trudeau right-hand man (and Cape Breton native) Gerald Butts even expressed in his testimony to the justice committee on the SNC Lavalin affair internal concerns about the fate of the Liberals in Nova Scotia.

“I knew if the prime minister chose a minister from the class of 2015 (for cabinet, Cuzner and Eyking) could interpret that as a signal and perhaps not run again either. In short, in the span of a few months, we would go from holding all 11 seats in Nova Scotia with strong incumbents to having five of them open in the next election,” Butts told the committee.

For MPs like Cuzner that are still on the fence, Cape Breton University politics professor Tom Urbaniak said the current issues facing the Liberal party will likely be part of their considerations.

“There’s no question that there’s been an erosion of morale within the Liberal Party or for the past couple of months,” Urbaniak said.

“There’s nowhere to go but down for the Liberal Party in Atlantic Canada even though many poll numbers have still been favourable in the region.”

Meanwhile, the Conservative Party has nominated 13 candidates so far and the Green Party has six candidates, five in Nova Scotia and one in PEI.

The NDP have still only have a single candidate in place in Brison’s former riding of Kings-Hants.

“We have two nomination meetings planned so far in the month of April and several good candidates have expressed their interest in running for the NDP in the Atlantic provinces,” Guillaume Francoeur, who speaks for the NDP, said in an email. “The approval process is following its course and we are confident we will have strong candidates in every riding across the Atlantic provinces.”

Memorial University political science professor Alex Marland said he’s not wholly surprised to see a nearly blank roster as getting candidates who are willing to run for a party that has historically been third place isn’t an easy feat.

“If you’re a party that's polling third in the polls and has never formed a national government you have fewer tools to be able to invite people to run as a candidate because you say, ‘Well the chances are you’re not going to win, and there’s a good likelihood we’re not going to form government. So our ability to reward you for your time is limited as opposed to the other parties,’” he said.

Politics in Atlantic Canada is still quite neighbourly and door-knocking goes a long way, Urbaniak said. So it’s wise for the competition to have candidates on the ground good and early, especially in places that don’t have a strong incumbent.

But for the NDP, Urbaniak said he doesn’t think their lack of candidates at this point in the game is critical.

“What’s more critical is to clarify the brand. Make sure the leader is sure-footed (and establish) that comfort level between the leader and the population,” he said.

“There are many precedents for late nominated candidates doing surprisingly well because votes moves and trends happen during the period of a campaign when the public mind is really focused on the competition.”

While there’s still plenty of time before fixed October election date for parties to get their ducks in a row, there have been rumours circulating about the possibility of an early election call. But Ramos said that’s unlikely.

“I think that if (the Liberals) were to go to the polls now they wouldn’t go with their best foot forward as it seems that there’s quite a bit of division within the caucus,” he said. “I’m not holding my breath for an early election. I would expect there to be probably a fall election on course to give the summer time to reset and rebrand the message of the party.”",Federal election candidate lists taking shape in Atlantic Canada,The Chronicle Herald,https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/news/local/federal-election-candidate-lists-taking-shape-in-atlantic-canada-296815/

His 64-year-old challenger has offered to use his middle initial, meaning his name will appear on the ballot as Matthew J MacKay.

Matthew J, who is standing for the Green Party, said the island's Scottish settlers were partly responsible for the problem.

He said: ""The Scots are very frugal people, we recycle everything - we even recycle names.""

The semi-retired graphic artist added: ""There are a lot of MacKays and there are a lot of Matthews.

""We're not really creative when it comes to new, trendy names. I'm surprised it hasn't happened in PEI before.""

PEI's news outlets call the men PC MacKay and Green MacKay after their parties, while Matthew J - or Green MacKay - calls himself ""Old Matthew"".

Latest polls show United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney is on track to oust the New Democratic Party government in the April 16 election. If successful, Kenney has vowed to rip up contracts signed as part of the NDP government’s C$3.7 billion plan to ship more crude out of the province by rail.

Alberta is Canada’s biggest oil-producing province, but congestion on export pipelines pushed Canadian heavy crude to a record discount versus U.S. barrels last year. In a bid to drain storage tanks and shore up prices, the government controversially mandated oil production cuts and announced plans to lease rail cars to ship crude.

“We will stop the C$4 billion boondoggle and let the private sector risk its own money rather than imposing the risk on taxpayers,” Kenney told a news conference on Monday.

Companies including Cenovus Energy and Imperial Oil ship crude from their own rail terminals in Alberta.

But two sources at midstream companies that have already signed three-year contracts with Premier Rachel Notley’s government said the plan is moving ahead regardless of who wins the election.

“They can tear (the contract) up all they want, but I still have an email copy,” one source said. “Anybody on a platform in front of 1,000 people can say what he wants...that’s not going to affect how the real world works.”

Notley slammed Kenney’s plan to cancel the rail deal at an event in Calgary on Monday, saying it would slow oil production and deprive Alberta of C$2.2 billion in revenue.

Canadian crude by rail has slowed since hitting record levels late last year, National Energy Board data shows, after the discount on Canadian crude shrank dramatically as a result of production curtailments, making rail uneconomic.

But many analysts expect shipments to increase again after Enbridge Inc said its Line 3 pipeline replacement, which would ship an extra 370,000 barrels per day (bpd) out of western Canada, will be delayed until the second half of 2020.

“In the reality where Line 3 is delayed, crude by rail serves as the incremental release valve for a market that has been consistently plagued by bottlenecks,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Tran.

Notley announced in February that Alberta has leased 4,400 rail cars and will bring them into service in July so it can buy and sell oil itself. Canadian National Railway Co and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd will haul a combined initial volume of 20,000 bpd, reaching 120,000 bpd by mid-2020.

Alberta will spend C$2.95 billion on rail service including capacity at terminals, storage access and rail transportation, and C$750 million on rail cars and other fees, the government said.

Trading sources in Calgary said Australian bank Macquarie has been hired to buy crude in the market on behalf of the government. Macquarie Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Another source at a midstream company said Kenney may be forced to change his mind on rail, given the risk of more pipeline congestion without it.

“The practical reality is if you want to move incremental production it is going to go by rail,” the source said. “For all intents and purposes the agreements are done and signed. They are our contracts to rip up.”",Full steam ahead for more Alberta crude by rail despite looming election,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/idCAKCN1RD34T-OCABS

The report comes at a time when Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party is planning, if it wins the election on April 16, to pick a fight over equalization payments, another federal program to which Albertans contribute disproportionately.

Unlike equalization, though, provinces can opt out of participation in the CPP; Quebec already has.

In 2017, 16.5 per cent of all CPP contributions came from Alberta workers, while just 10.6 per cent of CPP expenditures made their way back to the province. The difference between what was paid in and paid out was $2.9 billion in 2017, the most recent year for which data are available. (Alberta paid in $8.1 billion and received $5.2 billion.) Between 2008 and 2017, Albertans have contributed $27.9 billion more to CPP than retirees in the province have received back.

“What we were trying to do is really use a case study to illustrate the disproportionate contributions Albertans make to national programs,” said Jason Clemens, one of the study’s authors, in an interview on Tuesday.

Ontario is the next highest contributing province in Canada. Over the same period, from 2008 to 2017, Ontario paid in $7.4 billion more than it received back — more than $20 billion less than the loss in Alberta, and that’s in a province with more than 14 million people, compared to Alberta’s roughly four million.

However, Ontario’s fortunes turned around in 2017. The province contributed about $24 billion, but received back about $25 billion.

British Columbia paid in $8.2 billion in 2017, and received back $8 billion.

Were Alberta to drop out of the CPP — which Clemens says they’re not recommending — other provinces would have to pick up the slack by raising individual contribution rates. Were the province to withdraw, Albertans could pay as low as 5.85 per cent into an Alberta pension plan, while the rest of the country would need to up their contributions from 9.9 per cent (the 2017 contribution rate) to 10.6 per cent, the study says. The federal government already raised the contribution rate (shared equally by employers and employees) to 10.2 per cent in January, and plan to increase it to 11.9 per cent by 2023.

There are three main reasons why Albertans pay more into CPP than what retirees get out of it. More Albertans are of working age — between 15 and 64 — compared to the province’s overall population, than in other provinces in Canada.

Among that group, there are traditionally higher employment rates in Alberta. “Which means they have a higher share of the population that’s working,” Clemens said.

And, as is a partial explanation for higher equalization contributions, Albertans simply make more money than workers in other provinces, so the province has more contributions per worker. What the study does, Clemens said, is point out to the rest of Canada the contributions Alberta makes to federal programming, and it helps explain why Albertans feel left behind by the federal government and other provinces.

“The hope would be back to the discussion of, there’s a give and take,” Clemens said. “The rising frustration in Western Canada, particularly in Alberta, is legitimate, in terms of what is the balance right now of the give and take?”

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday. Her father was charged with first degree murder and died a few days later in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We’re mere weeks into a new year and there have been at least four femicides across Canada already. It’s time for us to demand that the lives of women and girls in Canada be prioritized.",The Election Issue That Isn’t Even On Politicians’ Radar,Chatelaine,https://www.chatelaine.com/opinion/femicide-the-election-issue-that-isnt-even-on-politicians-radar/

The federal government recently released their new climate report titled Canada’s Changing Climate, and it carries some stark warnings about Canada’s possible future if we do not immediately correct our course on climate.

In fact, according to this report Canada’s overall temperature has risen 1.7 C since 1948, while northern Canada warmed by 2.3 C. While this may not seem significant, I would ask all those reading this to take time and remember what their local ecosystem looked like when they were a kid, and compare to what they see around them today. Climate change has already affected us, from the lake levels we’re seeing now, to the increase in forest fire activity in our great province, and in the absence of snowpack in our mountains to sustain our communities fresh water resources.

Yet, if this report is to be taken seriously, as it should be, then the future this report paints should terrify us all. It lays out that these temperature increases, caused by both human and and natural activities, are primarily caused by human activity, stating that “the human factor is dominant”. The report also lays out, that in a high emission scenario, we could see record highs in daily temperatures every two years as opposed to every 20, and “extreme hot temperatures will become more frequent and more intense.” This will lead to increased risk of drought, wildfires, and inland flooding.

Furthermore, this change in temperatures will also affect our pristine environment. Even under a medium emission scenario the report reads that, “glaciers across the mountains of western Canada will lose 74 per cent to 96 per cent of their volume by the late century.”

However, despite all of this negative news there is some positive to go along with it. This report details that, in a low emission scenario, most of the catastrophic events that I just layed out can be mitigated, but our emissions outputs must peak immediately. With a federal election coming this fall it is possible to put a party in power that is willing to fight for a bold, progressive plan for fighting this generational crisis. Which is why I’m astonished that Conservatives are now leading in the polls. A party who hasn’t even had the common courtesy to placate concerns around climate change, and has yet to release a climate change plan. The main reason for this is that climate change is a generational issue. The simple fact is that the most conservative voting group in our country is also the oldest. For many of those in this group, they will not have to face the effects of climate change that those in our youngest generations will. This makes climate change less of a priority for them. And, I want to take a second to say I’m not trying to insult anyone, and I do understand the rationale of some of these older voters.

However, the future belongs to the young in this country, and we are terrified of the possibilities that may face us. That is why young people, yes I’m talking to you millennials and gen z’ers, now is our time to shine. We need to be forceful in our support for politicians who actually take this problem seriously, and swift in our condemnation of those who don’t. We need to make our voices heard this time around. We must refuse to be silenced. And above all else, we need to tell all of our politicians in Canada that climate change matters to us, and we will no longer settle for good enough, but rather strive for the best. In 2019, we need to stand up and scream that our future is our say.

""For decades, successive federal governments have failed ...","Canada is doing too little to combat climate change, a parliamentary report warned Tuesday, a day after government scientists warned the country was warming at twice the global rate.

The rebuke came as Canada's independent environment auditor released a new report on government efforts to end fossil fuel subsidies, and as climate change shapes up as a divisive issue in elections seven months from now.

""For decades, successive federal governments have failed to reach their targets for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, and the government is not ready to adapt to a changing climate,"" wrote environment commissioner Julie Gelfand.

""This must change.""

A report by Environment and Climate Change Canada, details of which were released on Monday, showed that average temperatures in Canada have risen by 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1948, about double the global average of 0.8 degrees Celsius.

In northern Canada, approaching the Arctic Circle, temperatures rose on average by 2.3 degrees Celsius over the same period.

Canada has pledged to meet a Paris Agreement target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.

On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau—who has declared climate action a top priority—slapped a carbon tax on four provinces that had not fallen in line with his emissions reduction strategy.

But the government's overall efforts have been panned by the environment auditor, and in December the environment ministry acknowledged a best case scenario of a 19 percent emissions cut.

In her latest report, Gelfand outlined a badly defined process, a lack of good data and little progress in making decisions to meet Canada's G20 commitment to eliminate inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025.

She also slammed the government for looking only at the economic impact of fossil fuel subsidies, without considering potential social and environmental damage.

For fossil fuel producers, subsidies can take the form of tax breaks, cheap loans, protection from competitors, or favorable trade restrictions.

For consumers, they generally result in below-market prices for oil, gas or electricity.

The intergovernmental International Energy Agency (IEA) last year estimated the global value of fossil fuel consumption subsidies in 2016 at about US$260 billion, down from US$310 billion the year before.

Electricity and oil each accounted for just over US$100 billion, with natural gas topping US$50 billion. Coal subsidies were only about US$2 billion.

Coal, natural gas, and oil extraction contribute nine percent of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP). Together with transportation, the sector produces half of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.

Environmental groups said the report shows Ottawa ""continuing to stall"" while seeking to justify ""irresponsible handouts to the oil and gas industry.""

Sign up for the Maclean’s politics insider to get Markusoff’s inside track in your inbox every morning.

Jason Kenney leaned on the wisdom of former Saskatchewan NDP treasurer Janice MacKinnon when announcing Thursday apromise to privately contract out publicly insured surgeries. That seems an unconventional information source for Kenney, until you realize McKinnon wrote her report for the Fraser Institute. The western Canadian conservative think-tank has long been feedstock for Kenney’s policy brain. Its research underpins his proposals to slash regulation and corporate taxes, and he further justified his medical wait-times strategy Thursday with a Fraser Institute report conveniently released that morning. Mark Milke, a lead author of the United Conservative Party’s platform, is a Fraser alum—paragraphs of a UCP policy backgrounder were copied verbatim from his recent book on Ralph Klein and Rachel Notley.

Big deal, Markusoff, I can hear you mumble. Conservatives like conservative think-tankery. My point, dear mumbling reader, is that Alberta’s 2019 election is such a showcase of stark ideological opposites, dominated by two parties with polar-opposite orthodoxies offering a many off-the-shelf ideas from the nation’s policy hothouses. Though many Albertans are fond of calling Rachel Notley’s NDP “socialist,” the party’s lodestar is not the Karl Marx bibliography—it’s left-leaning think tanks like the Broadbent Institute and Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, both of which provided basis for the NDP’s daycare policy. Her policy of investing in petrochemical and oil refining projects is an old 1970s-era Alberta Tory invention, but it’s also out of contemporary organized labour playbooks, and a former Alberta Federation of Labour official authored the party’s 2015 platform, much of which is being rehashed four years later. Notley hews to progressive orthodoxy that frowns on corporate taxes, but makes a point recently of citing a not-so-lefty Bloomberg article stating the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts padded corporate profits but not the economy. (The article explains the cuts had little stimulative impact because the U.S. economy is already red-hot; not so much the case in Alberta.)

By way of proving how strong a current confirmation bias can be in Alberta politics, Kenney’s corporate tax plan relies on research by University of Alberta economist Bev Dahlby, who predicts solid economic growth if the business tax rate drops. Kenney is less likely to quote Dahlby’s recent work for the Ecofiscal Commission on carbon taxes: “Carbon pricing is the fairest and cheapest way to fight climate change,” states a new report Dahlby co-authored. Meanwhile, fellow U of A economist Andrew Leach, who led the climate panel which gave the Alberta NDP its carbon tax policy, has praised the Kenney’s corporate tax proposal that Notley derides.

Aside from Notley’s pipeline policy, we’re getting fairly paint-by-numbers ideological platforms from the two parties. Elections are always about choices, but they’re seldom as stark as this one.

The kamikaze candidate’s aide speaks out

Throughout the campaign that may make Jason Kenney premier, more light is being shed on how he became UCP leader in the first place. The RCMP now looking into allegations his campaign perpetrated voter fraud, while Kenney’s integrity has taken a pounding due to revelations of how his campaign coordinated with [scare-quotes] “rival candidate” Jeff Callaway, whose candidacy largely existed to disparage Brian Jean, Kenney’s main competition. Writing for Maclean’s, Jen Gerson unpacks the role of Callaway campaign executive assistant Jeff Park, who wasn’t aware until recently of the extent of collusion between the Callaway and Kenney camps.

Park said that he was led to believe that the Callaway campaign might also provide an opening for him to work for Kenney directly. “It was explained to me that…you know, Jason hasn’t been in Calgary or Alberta all that much and he doesn’t know the Alberta political operatives as well as he should and this would be an an avenue to—if Mr. Kenney was to win the leadership and we were to drop out early, which was always presented as being on the table—to make sure there were more Alberta-based people involved in Mr. Kenney’s leadership campaign and leadership office if he were to win.” (Maclean’s)

Kenney, meanwhile, once again carefully answered reporters’ questions about the RCMP’s contacts with his campaign into estranged organizers’ allegations of voter identification fraud. But he suggested the police force’s sniffing around doesn’t amount to a full-on criminal probe into his team. “We have not been told we are under investigation,” Kenney told reporters.

Party insiders express confidence that voters won’t care much about the Callaway mess and this fraud innuendo—not when economic anxiety remains the top issue on voters’ minds.

From the wilds, a lonely cry for an Alberta sales tax

Ted Morton, a former Tory finance minister, calls PST a “political suicide tax” in Alberta. It’s perfectly normal everywhere else, but oil-rich Alberta has felt immune to the typical laws of fiscal gravity, and that’s held with all mainstream parties for the province’s recent history, even with the decimation of oil royalty revenues.

Which might be our way of saying the Alberta Liberals are not a mainstream party. The party was Official Opposition from 1993 to 2012, but its legislature delegation has rapidly shrunk, and the party is likely to lose its only Alberta seat this year. But party leader David Khan earns bravery points for promising Alberta adopt an eight-per-cent provincial sales tax—and in turn slash income taxes, including an exemption for all income earned until $57,250. It’s an idea lifted from a 2013 University of Calgary public policy school paper. And it’s one worth earnestly debating for fiscally wobbly Alberta, despite how third-rail it is. Which is, sadly, precisely why it will get scarce discussion this campaign. (Canadian Press)

Kenney glowers, Toronto cowers?

Kenney is a undoubtedly a powerful politician with renown and influence across Canada. Even before becoming premier, he claims his oomph helped kill a potential lawsuit against oil companies in Toronto. Centre-of-the-Universe councillors voted against forwarding for council consideration a proposal by colleague Mike Layton to study suing oil companies for the costs of climate change. Upon hearing this, Kenney touted his own campaign-trail warnings against this move, at a sensitive time for Alberta—Notley joined his fist-shaking at Layton—and the former Ottawa-based federal minister suggested calls to councillors he knows on council slayed this supposed menace to Alberta’s oil patch. “Quite frankly, I don’t know where else they would have gotten that message from if I hadn’t sent that letter to council and made those calls,” he told reporters.

David Rider, the Toronto Star’s City Hall bureau chief, noted that such rejections of councillor motions can be a “very common fate,” not the crowning accomplishment Kenney proclaimed. Moreover, the idea isn’t dead—council merely voted to forward to council’s environment committee for future talks. Layton’s bid will live on another day, should Kenney wish to remain vigilant.

But Albertans have one big council vote in their favour. Toronto Mayor John Tory did tell the Calgary Sun he’s opposed to suing oil companies:

“You can’t very well call out one industry that provides the fuel and then drive your car around and think that somehow there is no connection between the people who provide the fuel for the car and the people who drive the cars or make them.” Tory also sends a message to Albertans. “The city of Toronto and its people and its businesses have benefited immensely from being partners with Alberta in our country,” says the mayor. (Calgary Sun)

What else we’re reading:

Keith Gerein on Kenney’s supervised drug consumption site plan: It’s encouraging he no longer calls them places “helping addicts inject poison into their bodies,” but his promised socioeconomic reviews of existing facilities, with more concern for neighbour complaints about crime and disorder than the thousands of overdoses reversed, shows a not-so-open mind. “In terms of the ‘compassion’ Kenney is seeking, I suspect those who had their lives saved would say they were well served on that score.” (Edmonton Journal)

Andray Domise on candidates’ racism and how it’s covered: “The people behind the bylines and headlines in Alberta’s media class are, as with the rest of the country, very white. They carry with them the sensibilities that often insulate white supremacy, even if inadvertently (as with the Calgary Herald headline that uncritically repeated Kiryakos’s claim that she was the victim of a ‘smear’ campaign)… This is an endless source of frustration for the communities of colour in the province, and across Canada, as we are perpetually dragged back to the same naïve and uncomplicated conversations about racism, even as our communities increasingly come under attack.(Maclean’s)

Licia Corbella on NDP’s power system mismanagment: “Clark says if he had his way, he would hold a royal commission into the Alberta ‘NDP government’s single biggest scandal’ — its meddling with Alberta’s electricity system that led to the en-masse resignation of all but one member from the electricity balancing pool and has cost Alberta taxpayers $2 billion while getting nothing in return.” (Calgary Herald)

Gary Mason on the UCP plan to roll back protections for school gay-straight alliances: “Mr. Kenney needs to ask himself whether he’s prepared to risk Alberta’s reputation over a move that is small, petty and mean-spirited, all to serve the interests of a close-minded, intolerant minority. Ahead of a provincial election, Albertans need to ponder that question as well.” (Globe and Mail) Meanwhile, several hundred Calgarians rallied on the issue on Thursday night. It’s normally near-impossible to get such large crowds out in button-down Calgary for a political protest that’s unrelated to pipelines.","Piping hot from the think-tank microwaves, here come Alberta election ideas",Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/piping-hot-from-the-think-tank-microwaves-here-come-alberta-election-ideas/

That’s what the Russians did in the United States — created a debate that’s gone on since then. On how Canada can combat foreign interference ...,"VANCOUVER – Canada is only “on the margins” of having the resources needed to monitor radicalized fighters who have returned to Canada, says the former head of Canada’s spy agency.

Richard Fadden said in an interview that 60 to 75 so-called “foreign fighters” have returned to Canada and it’s not immediately clear in all cases what they were involved in overseas. That means they may need to be tracked upon their return and that requires a lot of resources.

“For the small group that we’ve decided are a risk, 24-7 surveillance — even with electronic support — is very manpower intensive,” said the former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. “And even if CSIS uses the help of the RCMP and other police forces, it’s very tough to do. I’d say we’re probably on the cusp of being able to do it effectively.”

Fadden’s remarks come at a time when many Western nations are grappling with political and moral questions related to returning foreign fighters. Should their citizenship be revoked? Should they be allowed back at all? What about their families?

In a wide-ranging interview with the National Post ahead of a scheduled talk Tuesday night at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver hosted by the Canadian International Council, Fadden also discussed the growing threat of foreign espionage and influence in Canada and explained why he thinks Canada should sever ties with Chinese tech giant Huawei.

Here are highlights of some of his remarks, which have been edited for length and clarity:

On the threat posed by foreign fighters

The returning fighters are in three categories: one is, ‘I’ve been there, it was an appalling mistake, I will never in my life have anything to do with these people again; the second is, ‘I’ve done my bit, I’m not going to do violence anymore, but if I can help people logistically, I’ll do it’; and the much smaller group is, ‘Jihad is not finished yet. I want to continue in my home country.’ The problem for CSIS is it’s not immediately obvious when they touch Canadian shores which category they’re in. To one degree or other they have to be surveilled.

On why we aren’t charging them when they come home

We have to be able to gather the evidence, it has to be done lawfully, it has to be arguable in a Canadian court. A Canadian has gone to fight in Syria — how do we know what he’s done there? Both police and Crown have a tough path to hoe in the context of accumulating evidence.

On whether we have sufficient resources for surveillance

I would say that we’re on the margins of being able to do it. The other issue is that there are radicalized people in Canada who have never gone abroad. Islamic State and al-Qaida decided a few years ago to give advice to people who wanted to go fight in Syria and Afghanistan: stay in your own countries and cause havoc there. That advice is being taken around the planet, particularly now that the caliphate is over. So we have that lot to worry about as well.

On combatting terrorism in general

We’ve become very effective at playing what I call “whack a mole.” The West is more than capable of suppressing terrorist activity. But we’ve not begun trying to get at the root causes. The fanaticism that was shown by the last few thousand Islamic State fighters in Syria — if that’s any indication, terrorism isn’t going to go away. Somebody somewhere has to start saying to themselves: what are we going to do about Islamic State, al-Qaida, Boko Haram, al-Shabaab, Hamas, Hezbollah?

On foreign espionage in Canada

There are two countries — Russia and China — that are particularly problematic. Generally speaking, they’re going to try and be as disruptive as they can. Both of them are what I call revisionist states; they’re both unhappy about their position in the world and they effectively have no limitations on what they can do to advance their positions. So they have decided they are going to try and acquire as much intelligence from the West as they can, including intellectual property. The bigger worry is espionage through the use of cyber tools. It’s generally thought that China uses the vacuum cleaner approach — they’ll extract anything from any country they can. The Russians are generally thought to be much more surgical.

On foreign influence

It’s simply an attempt on the part of a variety of countries — but principally the two I mentioned — to cause people in those societies to adopt views favourable to the home country that they otherwise would not have. You do that through trying to get the ethnic press to say things they might not otherwise say, by getting people in all walks of life to take positions that would be more supportive of that government — it’s not just politicians, it’s public servants, people in business, people in academe. The most effective way, I think, of trying to influence people’s thinking is to take an existing website that has great deal of credibility and modify it.

On foreign interference in the federal election

The traditional way of influencing elections and politicians was through the use of the pocketbook. That went on for a long time. What’s making it worse today is the possible use of social media and the Internet because by pushing a couple buttons you can influence tens of thousands. There are two main areas: mucking about with the databases of political parties — sending out conflicting messages, changing what their messages are — you can cause a fair bit of confusion. And possibly targeting media or ethnic media by modifying sites and sending out different messages. There’s no real expectation that they’re going to shift an election result; it’s just to destabilize. That’s what the Russians did in the United States — created a debate that’s gone on since then.

On how Canada can combat foreign interference

We need to develop associations with like-minded countries. At some point, we have to find some way of saying we understand you have a different system, different values, but these things are just not acceptable and we are going to push back. We haven’t quite figured out how to do that yet. To change their overall approach, we’re going to have to do it ideally with United States leadership. But the current U.S. administration — the most polite way I can put it is that they’re very unpredictable and have contributed to significant destabilization on the planet.

On whether Huawei should be allowed to build a wireless network in Canada

I go back to the fundamental premise that China has a very pro-active intelligence and information gathering policy. Chinese law is clear: any corporation, state owned or not, must aid Chinese security services, if asked. If Huawei were to be given the right to build our 5G network, it would potentially be the fastest thing I can think of into virtually every bit of information held in Canada. The threat, the possibility of their doing it, is sufficient that we should say no. The United States has asked us not to do it. I don’t think we should do everything the U.S. asks, but in this case because of the interoperability of ours systems, I don’t think it’s an unreasonable request. If they say no and we say yes, we become the weakest link in the chain.

It behooves those of us who are trying to argue positions not desired by the Chinese state that there’s a clear distinction — we’re not against China and Chinese (people). We’re against the Chinese Communist Party today, which stands for virtually everything we don’t stand for: democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.

But the party has ...,"Atlantic Canada was where the first domino of the SNC-Lavalin affair toppled in public — when Nova Scotia cabinet minister Scott Brison decided to resign his post. It's also where the Liberals have taken the biggest hit from the scandal's fallout.

What was once the party's most formidable electoral stronghold has now become one of its key regions of vulnerability.

According to the testimony of Gerald Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, the plan to replace Brison as president of the Treasury Board was supposed to be simple and tidy. Jane Philpott would go from Indigenous Services to Treasury Board and Jody Wilson-Raybould would take Philpott's place. David Lametti would be promoted into the justice portfolio vacated by Wilson-Raybould.

It didn't quite work out as planned.

The CBC's Canada Poll Tracker has recorded a six-point drop in Liberal support nationwide in the wake of the controversy surrounding Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet — but the party has fallen even further in Atlantic Canada.

The Poll Tracker estimates the Liberals are down to 37 per cent support in the region, just 2.5 points ahead of the Conservatives.

That's a 12-point drop from where the party stood on Feb. 5 — a few days before the Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources, first reported that Wilson-Raybould was pushed by senior people in the Trudeau government to allow the Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges by meeting a number of conditions laid out in a remediation agreement.

Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press More

That slide is twice as big as any drop the Liberals have suffered in other regions of the country and has been registered by every polling firm in the field over the last few weeks.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also has taken a bigger personal hit in Atlantic Canada than in the rest of the country. His approval rating in Atlantic Canada has averaged 32 per cent in three recent polls by three different polling firms. Those same three firms found Trudeau's approval rating averaging 46 per cent in Atlantic Canada in November and December.

Trudeau and the Liberals certainly had more ground to give up in Atlantic Canada than they did elsewhere. The party swept all 32 of the region's seats and beat the Conservatives by a margin of 40 points there in the 2015 federal election.

But the party has now gone from being 19 percentage points more popular in Atlantic Canada than in the country as a whole to just five points more popular there than nationwide. About one in four Atlantic Canadians who supported the Liberals at the beginning of February have since abandoned them. Nowhere else have the Liberals lost more than a fifth of their support.

It has a real impact on the Liberals' chances of holding their seats in the region.

The Liberal sweep could be swept aside

When Butts testified at the justice committee last month, he talked about the electoral conundrum that Brison's departure created for the Liberals.

""Not to give away a political strategy in this forum,"" he said, ""but my main political concern was our position in Nova Scotia.""

Butts was worried that with Brison gone — and with a few other Nova Scotia Liberals already at risk of not running for re-election in the fall, particularly if they weren't given a promotion to replace Brison — the party would be without incumbents in five of their 11 seats in the province, leaving those seats vulnerable.

Canada’s former attorney general pleaded with her colleagues Tuesday to let her remain in the Liberal party caucus amid a scandal that has rocked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government in an election year.

Liberal lawmakers are expected to vote as soon as Tuesday evening to oust Jody Wilson-Raybould after she publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant.

The scandal has led to multiple resignations and damaged the party for eight weeks.

In a letter, Wilson-Raybould acknowledged her colleagues are enraged but said she was “trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” Wilson-Raybould wrote to colleagues.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.”

Trudeau has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 via sources that Trudeau’s staff put pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She denied she was the source of the story, writing “I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened.”

The secret recording Wilson-Raybould made public shows Wernick telling Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau “is determined, quite firm” in finding a way to avoid a prosecution that could put 9,000 jobs at risk.

It also reveals Wilson-Raybould saying she regards the pressure as “inappropriate.”

Wilson-Raybould has refused to express support for Trudeau, a demand many Liberal lawmakers say is necessary if she is to remain in Parliament as part of the party caucus.

Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said he expected Wilson-Raybould to be expelled.

“Her letter, I believe, sets the stage for her run at the Liberal leadership if the Liberals lose in October and Justin Trudeau steps down,” Wiseman said.

“She is a victim of the parliamentary system which in Canada imposes sturdier party discipline than in any of the other Westminster parliamentary systems. The letter reveals her naivete, as a rookie Member of Parliament, about how the system works.”

Vancouver-based Research Co. conducted the online poll among 600 Albertans from March 29 to April 1.

Of decided voters, the poll found 45 per cent would cast a ballot for the UCP and 40 per cent for the NDP. The Alberta Party came in at six per cent and the Liberal Party with three per cent.

Interestingly, almost two-in-five decided voters said they may change their mind.

Thirty-eight per cent of respondents said their opinion of UCP Leader Jason Kenney has fallen since the start of the campaign, compared with 30 per cent with a more negative view of NDP Leader Rachel Notley.

Research Co. president Mario Canseco said the UCP is connecting well with male voters and Albertans aged 55 and over, while the NDP is more popular in Edmonton, with women and with voters aged 18 to 34.

The margin of error was +/-4.0 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

Meet the NDP

The United Conservatives launched a new tool in their election strategy this week — a website called MeetTheNDP.ca.

The name might suggest a friendly political friendship site, but it’s not.

It’s in a similar vein to the NDP’s TheTruthAboutJasonKenney.ca, unveiled before the campaign even began.

The idea is to click on your local candidate — if they happen to be one of the 33 listed on the site — and read a very brief line about their actions while in office or, in the case of a few candidates, questionable comments they have made.

Climate, carbon, common sense

Alberta will likely have to take stronger action against climate change, NDP Leader Rachel Notley said Tuesday. She was responding to a report by federal scientists indicating that Canada is being impacted by climate change twice as fast as the rest of the planet.

“You need to make tough decisions and that’s what we’ve done,” said Notley, referring to the province’s carbon tax and other measures.

“Do we need to do more? Probably.”

Kenney agreed climate change is a concern but said his party is offering a “common sense” approach to control industrial emissions that won’t be as hard on industry.

But amid relentless news coverage ... now say that 15 is the most likely maximum gain. In a tight election, that could make all the difference.","By Nelson Wyatt

MONTREAL (Reuters) - The biggest scandal of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's tenure is starting to hit his fortunes in the populous province of Quebec, where the ruling Liberals say they need to pick up seats in an October election to remain in power.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that government officials inappropriately leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure Quebec-based construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a corruption trial by paying a fine instead.

Trudeau's message that he was worried about potential job losses initially played well in his home province of Quebec, where the Liberals hold 40 of the 78 seats in the 338-seat federal House of Commons.

His officials say Quebec media has been much less critical of the affair than elsewhere in Canada. But amid relentless news coverage, recent polls show the Liberals' lead over the official opposition Conservatives is shrinking.

""He (Trudeau) has lost some ground in Quebec ... people have questions about the way this file was handled,"" said Daniel Beland, director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada in Montreal.

""At the same time, I think people put more emphasis on the economic side of the issue rather than maybe on the constitutional or legal side of it,"" he added.

Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing.

Liberals, who had once predicted the party could win an extra 20 seats in Quebec, now say that 15 is the most likely maximum gain. In a tight election, that could make all the difference.

Philippe Fournier, a poll analyst for 338canada.com, said the Liberals were now hovering between 36 to 38 percent support in Quebec as opposed to 44 or 45 percent before the scandal.

Fournier said even with the drop, the Liberals have an edge, since support for their rivals was more spread out than in other provinces.

Opinion was divided on the streets of downtown Montreal on Tuesday about how much the scandal would affect support for Trudeau and his team.

""There's a lot we don't know,"" said pensioner Louise Gagne, adding the Liberals had definitely taken a hit. ""Is Mr. Trudeau hiding something?""

Henri Cordeau, a 22-year-old university business student, questioned how long the public would bother to pay attention.

""People just kind of forget at some point. I think worse things could happen,"" he said.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

Tory MHA for Cape St. Francis Kevin Parsons says he will be on the ballot in the coming provincial election, after turning down a bid to seek the federal Conservative nomination in St. John’s East.

Parsons says he was in talks to be the Conservative Party of Canada nominee in St. John’s East (currently held by Liberal Nick Whalen), but decided to stay in Newfoundland and Labrador to be with his young grandchildren.

“At this time in my life, I’ll be 58 years old this year, I got two young little grandchildren that live right next door to me that mean a lot to me,” said Parsons.

“I’d like to be here in Newfoundland to watch them grow up. I enjoy the work I’m doing right now and I hope the people in the area will continue to support me.”

The provincial Progressive Conservative Party has yet to open nominations in the district, nor have the Liberals or New Democratic Party.

The former mayor of Flatrock, Parsons was first elected to the House of Assembly in 2008.

Robert Heinlein wrote about such a thing in Starman Jones in 1953, but the idea had been around even decades before that.

Basically it’s a transport pod suspended by magnetic or other technology such that it doesn’t actually touch any surface. As it operated within a very low or no air-pressure system, there is little to no air resistance as it travels at extremely high speed through the tunnel and would be unaffected by any weather conditions outside the tube.

Now the “hyperloop” is much less science fiction with American billionaire Elon Musk having created a successful prototype version.

Canada, which has lagged decades behind other countries in high speed rail lines, may just skip that step and go to hyperloop technology.

The federal government agency Transport Canada has recently put out a request for proposals (RFP) to study the feasibility of a Montreal to Toronto link, a distance of approximately 550 kilometres.

Such technology is claimed to be able take passengers between the two major cities in a mere 45 minutes.

The RFP wants to know more about a variety of safety issues compared to high-speed rail or maglev concepts as well as studying the many engineering and economic questions involved.

There have been several companies around the world springing up to propose the various technological ideas, including a Canadian one, Transpod. That company with investors in Europe has a 3-kilometre test track under construction in France. It has been chafing at lack of support in Canada and has been hinting of moving to Europe where some research has already been relocated. The company welcomes this latest announcement.

While the idea has almost universally been thought of as a passenger concept, Transport Canada is seeking some input as to whether freight pods could be an additional component.

And this being Canada, there are also questions about “regulatory oversight” of such a system.

Then again, when high-speed rail was being developed decades ago in Asia and Europe, Canada was also talking enthusiastically about a system here, and talking, and talking, even as late as last year during the provincial election in Ontario. There are still none in this vast country.

As for hyperloop technologies, there are none operating in other countries, at least not as of yet.

Six years ago, when Dr. Henry Morgentaler died, many Atlantic Canadian abortion advocates felt disarmed and afraid. Morgentaler's private clinic in Fredericton had provided most of New Brunswick's abortions for years, each patient paying $750. The province refused to cover the cost of abortions performed by non-specialists or in clinics, and required patients seek the permission of two physicians for a hospital-based procedure. Morgentaler's clinic was necessary.

The closure of the Morgentaler clinic in 2014 propelled an extraordinary wave of progress in abortion access in Atlantic Canada. While we are not without threats to access, and must continue to advocate, we should acknowledge and celebrate significant recent gains. Talking about these changes normalizes abortion as health care, reduces stigma and can improve provider uptake of abortion into practice.

In May 2014 a grassroots organization, Reproductive Justice New Brunswick, formed. By July, RJNB was crowdsourcing funds for a down payment to purchase Morgentaler's clinic. A sympathetic editorial by Elizabeth Renzetti helped the campaign go viral. While the paperwork was being sorted for a physician to re-open the clinic as a pro-choice, trans-friendly family practice, RJNB moved on to political battles. Abortion became a key issue in the 2014 provincial election.

In November 2014, then-premier Brian Gallant announced the removal of Regulation 84-20, which required women seeking a hospital abortion to have two doctors certify it as medically necessary. Patients could now call the hospital abortion units in Moncton and Bathurst directly, no referral required, no two-physician permission needed. However, surgical abortions outside of hospital continued to be excluded from insured services.

The next coup was Prince Edward Island, where abortion services had been ""banned"" for 30 years. A coalition of advocates came together to strategize how to dismantle PEI's unwritten rules. With support from the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF) a grassroots plaintiff group named Abortion Access Now PEI (AAN-PEI) launched a lawsuit against PEI in January 2016. PEI recognized its policy as indefensible, and premier Wade MacLauchlan announced abortion services would launch within the year. On January 31, 2017, Lianne Yoshida performed the first abortion at the Prince County Hospital in Summerside.

In Nova Scotia, abortion providers and advocates campaigned to remove the referral requirement for hospital abortion services and a direct, toll-free line connecting patients with abortion services just launched in winter 2018.

Health Canada approved Mifegymiso, ""the abortion pill,"" in 2015. (It had been available for decades in the United States.) In just a few years many early restrictions on Mifegymiso have been removed. Most provinces cover the cost and allow nurse practitioners to prescribe it. Since 2017, over 14,000 prescriptions of Mifegymiso have been filled.

The last six years have won significant achievements, but there's still work to do. The five current priorities for improving abortion access: 1) Aligning abortion policy across Canada, so clinic and medical abortions are always publicly insured. 2) Improving access to ultrasonography to reduce wait times. 3) Increasing public education about abortion in Canada, because the deluge of US news creates misunderstandings about access here. 4) Expanding scope of practice, so midwives and other clinicians can provide abortions. 5) Encouraging health-care providers to adopt abortion into practice.

If you are a provider or student, we invite you learn about abortion and join in the remarkable wave of work we have accomplished in a half-dozen years. a

Our Nation’s Oil, From Alberta to Saudi Arabia

Pipelines have been running through our nations lands dating back to the 1950s, when this method of transportation was developed to carry oil and natural gas to Eastern Canada and the U.S., eventually being carried North.

Pipelines have been running through our nations lands dating back to the 1950s, when this method of transportation was developed to carry oil and natural gas to Eastern Canada and the U.S., eventually being carried North.

The pipelines originate in Alberta, running in all directions: west to British Columbia, north towards the Northwest Territories, south to Texas, and east up until Quebec, with a pipeline even running between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. There are more than 840,000 km of pipelines criss-crossing the country.

These lines are not without controversy, as production within the Canadian tar sands generate greenhouse gases. While oil and gas are a valuable part to Canadian economy, the nation competes with Saudi Arabia, who ships their oil to Eastern Canada.

Environmental concern isn’t the only dispute: pipelines run through Indigenous lands, not all of which have been granted approval. Canadian law states that First Nations must be consulted about pipeline projects. Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted to allow Indigenous groups access to the right of consent towards resource development projects that go through their land. However, as long as the government has attempted a sincere consultation, project can legally proceed even without Indigenous approval.

The most recent debate on pipelines has resurrected due to tensions recently exemplified within the Wet’suwet’en nation, as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police forcibly removed of activists preventing TransCanada Coastal GasLink from being constructed on their land.

And that’s just part of the tensions surrounding pipeline construction.

The federal government announced it had purchased the existing Trans Mountain pipeline, built in 1953, and its expansion project for $4.5 billion last September. The price of the expansion itself is estimated to be about $7.4 billion. The project, which would expand the capacity to transfer oil from Alberta to BC, has gained criticism from both politicians and environmentalists.

“There are concerns by Indigenous communities and environmentalists that the pipeline poses threats,” Saint-Lazare Councillor Brian Trainor told The Link. “Due to the possibility of a spill on route overland and at sea with the threat to marine life, in particular whales, of the increased tanker traffic.”

Forty-three First Nations signed agreements signalling their support for the Trans Mountain expansion project. However, the six First Nations of Tsleil-Waututh Nation, Coldwater Indian Band, The Stó:lō Collective, Squamish Nation, Upper Nicola Band, and Stk’emlupsemc te Secwepemc of the Secwepemc Nation, are leading challenges against the project in court, which could have a major impact on the future of the expansion.

“If any of the First Nations are successful, the whole underlying approval goes away,” Eugene Kung with West Coast Environmental Law told Huffington Post. “Canada is assuming that risk.”

The Trans Mountain pipeline, bought in 2005 by Kinder Morgan Inc., covers 1,150 km from Strathcona County near Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, BC.

The planned expansion would build a second pipeline alongside the existing one and would increase the transportation of oil from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day. Further, it would increase the traffic off of BC’s coast from approximately five to 35 tankers a month.

“Shipping is the most efficient type of transportation and plays a significant role in Canadian and global trade,” said Fadi Harb, a Concordia professor in the economics department. “However, it has some negative externalities and it creates environmental pollution.”

Under pressure from the Alberta government and the oil industry, the federal government purchased the existing Kinder Morgan pipeline. Trainor said it became obvious that Kinder Morgan had decided not to proceed with the required investment given economic uncertainty due to legal delays and dropping world oil prices.

“In terms of construction and making way for a new pipeline, in all aspects, this was the least impactful way in environmental terms of solving the problem of not having a way of getting [Canada’s] resources to new markets,”said Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister for Youth Affairs Peter Schiefke. “This is important because we are losing anywhere from $7 to $15 billion a year, because the U.S. is buying our oil at a reduced cost—because they know we have no choice.”

“Not only did the Liberals spend $4.5 billion of taxpayers’ money buying a pipeline that a private company wanted to build without a single tax dollar, but they failed in the negotiations, spending a billion more than the Independent Parliamentary Budget Officer [Yves Giroux] had estimated,” said Luc Berthold, Mégantic-l’Érable MP for the Conservative Party.

“The Liberals have no plan for expansion, and each year of delay increases the costs by hundreds of millions of dollars.”

Shortly thereafter, the federal Court of Appeal ruled that further consultations with First Nations would be necessary and the National Energy Board will have to review the the effects of more tankers off the BC. coast before the expansion project can continue. Trainor said these consultations are currently ongoing but the Liberal government is under extreme pressure from Albertans and the oil industry to advance the project as soon as possible. As it stands, the conclusion of these consultations doesn’t have a deadline.

“Indigenous consultations are inextricably intertwined with review of marine impacts—orcas have important cultural significance,” said Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada to the Vancouver Sun. “So charging ahead on this before sorting out the Indigenous consultation piece seems like a mistake.”

“From an economic perspective, there are always benefits and costs associated with a pipeline project, and one needs to study how efficient would the pipeline project be in enhancing Canada’s economy,” Harb said.

According to the Conference Board of Canada, it’s estimated the pipeline project would create the equivalent of 15,000 construction jobs, not to mention the equivalent of 37,000 jobs per year of operations in direct, indirect and induced jobs in Alberta and BC. An increase in the taxes collected could also be used for public services such as health care and education.

Last Spring, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley called the pipeline expansion “a major step forward for all Canadians.” She said the pipeline is a financially feasible and will generate profits. She conceded that governments may be held accountable if there is a spill, however, Notley said spills are not occurring as often.

But critics say The Trans Mountain pipeline will raise the amount of tankers in BC waters, increasing the chances that one of them will hit something and cause a spill of fuel into the ocean.

A major oil pipeline leak in 2011 was caused by the rupture of the Plains Midstream Canada Rainbow pipeline. It resulted in 28,000 barrels of oil spilling in northern Alberta, and was reported as the biggest spill in the province in 35 years. Some of the oil had seeped into the wetlands nearby. But in 2016 there were fewer than 100 spills larger than seven tonnes reported, compared to 3,000 in 1974.

“More than 100,000 people in the energy sector have already lost their jobs, and thousands more are unaware when construction will begin,” said Berthold. “Every day the construction is delayed further undermines Canada’s reputation as a stable and predictable place to invest—that is why the majority of Canadians believe that failing to build pipelines is a national crisis.”

“The federal government has to represent every province and territory, and if any sector is struggling, our job is to ensure that we’re doing everything we can to get the most out of that sector and provide jobs for those people,” said Schiefke.

According to Schiefke, this is especially the case for Calgary, as the city currently has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.

“One of the obvious reasons for opposing pipelines is the threat they pose to drinking water. If this pipeline spills at the Outaouais river, this could make water undrinkable for millions in the province of Quebec, since the St. Laurent [river] provides a key source.”

In 2016, British Columbia said it didn’t support the Trans Mountain pipeline, in part out of concerns about the lack of information provided by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners for their proposed spill prevention and clean-up program. Kinder Morgan has increasingly been using the pipeline to transport diluted bitumen from the tar sands, which is much more corrosive than regular oil. Bitumen is a thick tar-like mix of hydrocarbons that is toxic and very difficult to clean up if there was a spill.

“One of the obvious reasons for opposing pipelines is the threat they pose to drinking water,” said Vincent Duhamel from Climate Justice Montreal. “If this pipeline spills at the Outaouais river, this could make water undrinkable for millions in the province of Quebec, since the St. Laurent [river] provides a key source.”

“I think pipeline expansion is digging a deeper hole in terms of our reliance on fossil fuels,” said Emily Carson-Apstein, external coordinator of Sustainable Concordia. “This is super harmful to vulnerable communities in Canada, like Indigenous communities on the West Coast and people around the world who can’t afford to escape the effects of climate change.”

The crude oil pipeline Enbridge Line 9 provides oil to Montreal’s Suncor Refinery from Sarnia, Ontario. It’s processing on average 24,300 barrels of diluted bitumen a day. The TransCanada Corp. canceled its Energy East Pipeline and Eastern Mainline projects, after being subject to increased regulations and facing opposition from environmental groups.

Saudi Oil and Canadian Pipelines’ Impacts on Indigenous Land

Canada not only receives its oil from the Alberta tar sands, but also from Saudi Arabia. “Alberta crude extraction is a relatively recent phenomenon and Canada has been importing Middle Eastern oil for a very long time,” said Syed Ahsan, a Concordia professor emeritus in the economics department.

Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are the second largest in the world. According to the National Energy Board, Canada has approximately 80,000 barrels of oil imported from the kingdom every day and we pay them about $2 billion a year, versus the $3.8 million barrels of oil produced by Canada per day.

The situation is a matter of money. Acquiring Saudi’s oil through affordable transportation and having it refined in New Brunswick is cheaper than the complex and expensive process of extracting the oil from Alberta’s tar sands and refining it.

Only certain refineries can turn Alberta bitumen into gasoline, which are mainly located in Alberta and BC The greenhouse gas emissions for extracting and processing oil sand are larger than for regular crude oil, and contribute to global warming. The oil is then moved to the Burnaby Terminal—a distribution point for crude oil to local terminals.

The Irving refinery in St. John, New Brunswick receives 40 per cent of its crude oil from Saudi Arabia. However, in light of the fractured diplomatic relations between the two countries, some economists say Canada could easily replace the Saudi Arabian crude oil with its own if the kingdom stops selling it.

Ahsan explained why this hasn’t happened. “The heavy crude can only be economically extracted at a certain price floor, possibly close to $50 USD [per] barrel, while Middle Eastern oil has a much lower threshold for profitable extraction.”

Indigenous nations are particularly affected by the pipelines threatening their land. The Wet’suwet’en is the most recent nation to publicly oppose pipelines and face attacks from the RCMP. The nation called for a stop on the Coastal GasLink pipeline project because the RCMP enforced a court injunction for access through the Unist’ot’en camp, about 15 minutes from the worksite.

“We review major projects proposed on Wet’suwet’en territories,” Mike Ridsdale, environmental assessment coordinator for the Office of the Wet’suwet’en.

“We monitor the province and make the proponents know of the hereditary decisions on the lands where there is proposed works,” said Ridsdale. “Currently, we are working with lawyers to stop Coastal GasLink pipeline due to their cultural genocide of our historical evidence on the land.”

The Oceans Protection Plan, a $1.5 billion federal policy unveiled by the current Liberal government in 2016, attempts to address environmental consequences brought on by oil transportation and potential spills. It includes provisions to protect chinook salmon, fund new research on water contaminants, and plans to reduce noise from the thousands of vessels that travel near the whales each year.

“When we took office, only one per cent of our coastline was protected, after 152 years of existence as a country,” said Schiefke. “We vowed that by the end of our first term we would bring that up to 10 per cent. So far we are at 8.7 per cent.”

Apstein fears the environmental impact of these pipelines. “The Canadian economy runs on fossil fuels right now and we don’t have a lot of time to find a different way to run the country, because this just isn’t going to cut it.”

“Going oil-free should definitely be in the interest of every economy moving forward,” said Harb. “From an environmentalist’s point of view, building a pipeline that could eventually no longer be operational in two decades’ time is quite costly and detrimental to the environment.”

Schiefke said he believes an environmental and economical balance is needed. “It’s about being realistic about our economic needs, and then doing the hard work necessary to innovate and look for ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors by using revenues to invest in green technology,” said Schiefke.

With the upcoming federal election later this year, the pressure to decide on the fate of the Trans Mountain Pipeline may come into the forefront of Canadian concern. If the project goes according to plan, the added construction is expected to take about 30 months, which means the pipeline could be operational in 2022.

You may find yourself in a strange chit chat with a person who never lived or travelled north of Red Deer. We have. More than a few times, actually.



“So,” half-jokingly one asked, “Does anybody live in igloos up there?”



“There,” he meant, just about any place north of Edmonton. In fact, for some people, the city of St. Albert is far, far out in the wilderness, despite it being just a few kilometres north of Edmonton. Westlock, Barrhead, Whitecourt, Lac La Biche, Slave Lake, High Prairie, Falher, Peace River and Grande Prairie are terribly far, far north.



Another question once asked, “So, does the ice ever go out completely on that big lake of yours up there?”



Gosh, folks. We actually do have summers. And paved roads. And stores and hospitals. And although we have our share of not-so-bright people, most of us up here know where the centre of Alberta is. For those who never get to travel the Swan Hills highway from Kinuso to Fort Assiniboine and southward, the geographic centre is a few kilometres off the highway south of Swan Hills which, of course, makes all those places like Edmonton and Lloydminster and Edson in central Alberta!



Or, if you wish to not make too many divisions, there is northern and southern Alberta. Everything south of Swan Hills is not, emphatically not, northern Alberta.



You may know politicians talking about the royal pickpocketing that Ottawa, also known as central Canada, gives to Alberta. All of Alberta.



“Billions!” they shout. “They rob us of billions of dollars every year!”



It isn’t just provincial politicians. It’s coffee shop folks. Media people. Councillors in towns and counties and cities. Your neighbour. Your cousin sleeping under a bridge! Best, if that be a bridge in Calgary, it’s much, much warmer than a bridge in the frozen north of Alberta, like Whitecourt you know.



Does anybody ever switch the story? Are their complaints how Edmonton, or Calgary, or Stettler rip off the north half of this great province, each and every year? Why is it hunky-doo to complain about Ottawa ripping off all of Alberta? But not so “correct” to complain about the giant rip off laid upon northern Alberta by the south.



Calgary gets kilometres of multi-lane highways and overpasses. We get another $50 to fill potholes in some of the goat trails we call back alleys.



Edmonton gets another 1,000 jobs added in a government department. We are told to be happy we will lose only 10 jobs out of our local civil service, instead of the 20 they planned to cut originally.



And how is the chit chat from our candidates running in this coming election? Nothing. It’s the same old story. This half the province gets ignored.



It’s always that 24-or 36-inch pipeline taking resources and wealth south. What the north gets back barely fills a garden hose.","Commentary – Another election, another dollar gone",southpeacenews.com,http://southpeacenews.com/commentary-another-election-another-dollar-gone/

An alarming new study released by Environment and Climate Change Canada warns that Canada is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the world.

The authors of the study — called Canada’s Changing Climate Report — hope that their findings are taken seriously and serve as a catalyst for change.

“I have to believe that we’ll, some time soon, start to change the curve on this and bring us into some sort of new balance,” University of Calgary climatologist Shawn Marshall told the CBC on Monday. “Because the further we go in this direction, the harder it’s going to be to right the ship.”

The study contains many ominous predictions, including the projection that Northern Canada will heat up at almost three times the global average. It also determined that we’re already experiencing increased precipitation — especially in winter — as well as water supply shortages in the summer and “extreme fire weather.”

The report also warns that climate change and warming will affect the amount of precipitation across the country and will increase the risk of flood and extreme weather events such as coastal tropical storms. It also warns that warming will contribute to drought and wildfires and the intensity of heat waves.

The report also stresses that “the human factor” is a dominant cause of climate change, in particular the emission of greenhouse gases.

“If we reduce emissions, then things like trees and the ocean will gradually pick up the extra CO2 that’s in the atmosphere,” Marshall said. “That would stabilize the planet and it’s probably the only long-term solution I can imagine right now.”

According to Marshall, the long-term solution to this warming trend would involve a “generational shift” over about 30 years away from carbon-emitting fuels.

Is a carbon tax the answer?

As part of this shift away from carbon emissions, the Liberal government’s controversial carbon tax came into effect on April 1. The tax is a punitive levy on companies that produce carbon emissions and encourage them to clean up the way they operate. Until they do, however, the carbon tax means we’ll we’ll be paying more for everything from gas to fill our cars, home heating and groceries.",New Report Says Canada Warming at Twice the Global Rate: Is Trudeau’s Carbon Tax Enough?,Everything Zoomer,http://www.everythingzoomer.com/general/2019/04/02/new-report-says-canada-warming-twice-global-rate-trudeaus-carbon-tax-enough/

Big money’s campaign to block pharmacare: First, buy influence

Since the government announced the federal Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare in the 2018 budget, the pharmaceutical and insurance industries have embarked on a lobbying frenzy in Ottawa.

No one knows exactly how much money Big Pharma, Big Insurance and billionaires are funnelling into the anti-pharmacare campaigns. No mechanism exists in Canada to ensure that level of transparency. However, it is possible to gather fragments of evidence that suggest a complex tapestry of lobbying and advertising activity being deployed by these actors to protect their interests.

Shortly after the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health issued its report endorsing publicly funded pharmacare in April 2018, members of Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association challenged the committee’s recommendations at a lobby day event on Parliament Hill. A press release stated that the Standing Committee’s recommendations could “reduce the quality of health benefit plans for millions of people.”

This was followed by a series of three half-page ads in the Hill Times in May, June and November 2018. With the headline “Better Health Benefits for Everyone,” the industry association ads reiterated its key position: that a program which preserves the private insurance industry’s market share is the best policy option for Canada. Any government changes to coverage ought simply to add another layer of targeted public coverage to the existing public-private mix, the ads suggested.

The association also turned to Twitter to spread its core message from July 18 to 20, when provincial premiers met for their annual summit in St. Andrew’s by-the-Sea, New Brunswick. During the days of the premiers’ summit, Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association-promoted ads appeared regularly on Twitter feeds geo-located to that hamlet with a population of 1,500 people.

The clear objective of the ads was to target Canada’s premiers and senior staff with a message opposing universal single-payer pharmacare.

Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association lobbying efforts also rose considerably with the launch of the advisory council. From 2017 to 2018, the association’s non-trade-related lobbying activity rose by roughly 61 per cent, according to data from the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying. The evidence suggests a ramping-up of efforts by Big Insurance to stop pharmacare from being delivered to Canadians.

Considering the growing potential profits on the horizon from high-cost medications, the pharmaceutical industry has a lot to lose from a national pharmacare program, with the government able to negotiate prices as the strong single-payer bargainer.

According to the latest report from the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, within a decade the number of patented medicines in Canada with an annual cost of at least $10,000 more than tripled. They now account for over 40 per cent of patented medicine sales, rising from 7.6 per cent in 2006. The number of people using these medicines is less than one per cent of the population. This high-priced pharmaceutical market is, to a large degree, preserved by Canada’s current multi-payer system of drug coverage.

In 2018, Innovative Medicines Canada, a major industry association, increased its lobbying and advertising efforts substantially. It bought 15 full-colour ads in the Hill Times in 2018 alone. The ads included claims that pharmacare could result in patients being forced to go without medications. “Far-reaching changes to Canada’s patented drug regime will lead to job losses, a cutback in R&D investment and reduced access to the latest therapies,” stated one ad.

In fact, since 2000 industry revenues have soared while R&D investments have stagnated. The industry’s research investments in Canada fell in 2017 to a paltry 4.1 per cent of Canadian sales from 4.4 per cent in 2016 (4.6 per cent for members of Innovative Medicines Canada, down from 4.9 per cent in 2016). Merck, AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis and Johnson & Johnson have either closed or scaled down their Canadian research facilities, laying off staff.

Innovative Medicines Canada and Canada’s pharmaceutical giants also increased lobbying efforts in 2018. In fact, IMC’s non-trade-related lobbying meetings rose from 18 in 2017 to 104 in 2018 — a 500-per-cent increase in lobbying activity in one year. The pharmaceutical industry sees the implementation of pharmacare as worthy of the deployment of unprecedented lobbying resources.

In the past two decades, drug companies in Canada and abroad have poured millions of dollars into funding patient advocacy groups, which now have a formal role in many drug policy structures. Many of these patient groups are tiny organizations that valiantly fight for the well-being of their often vulnerable patients, yet they are hamstrung by a lack of funding sources.

As one Canadian patient group recently discovered to its dismay, funding arrangements with patient groups often come with strings attached.

In October 2018, the Globe and Mail broke a story illustrating this phenomenon. In 2016 the president of the Canadian Spondylitis Association, which represents patients with a type of arthritis, attended a focus group project which ended with groups being asked to sign a report (destined for Health Canada) that said patients were “strongly opposed” to switching from their brand name drug to a cheaper biosimilar drug.

The two companies that paid for the report, Janssen and AbbVie, are two with a lot to lose from biosimilar competition. Feeling manipulated, the patient group’s president emailed members of his board and recommended the association take its name off the report. Board members agreed, despite the fact that Janssen and AbbVie had provided 90 per cent of the group’s budget the previous year. Janssen then rejected the group’s requests for funding in 2017 and 2018. (AbbVie continued its funding.)

With few other funding options available to them, cases like this suggest that many patient groups are given little choice but to take the conditions placed on them by Big Pharma funders, or face closure.

It is not easy to know the scale of pharmaceutical funding of patient groups, since few companies publicly disclose such contributions. To their credit, GlaxoSmithKline is a rare example of a company that effectively discloses its patient group funding to the public. Above is their data for 2017, likely only a drop in the bucket of all funding for patient groups.

There is also evidence that certain pharma-funded patient groups toe a similar line to the industry on the issue of a single-payer universal pharmacare plan for Canada.

One coalition of 24 patient organizations with pharmaceutical funding recently argued for “a full array of approved medicines... including more recently approved advancements” and warned that “access delayed is access denied.” Another coalition of patient advocacy groups, focused on rare disorders, told the Hill Times in 2018 that a national pharmacare program could slow or limit access to new drugs for some patients, such as those with rare diseases, who are much more likely to get access to the latest therapies under private drug plans than those who rely solely on a public plan. Innovative Medicines Canada bought a Hill Times ad two months earlier with a similar message.

These examples suggest that pharmaceutical giants are sometimes able to buy additional lobbying influence through their conditional funding of under-resourced patient groups.

Second, create echo chambers to promote your position

The second prong in the strategy to stop pharmacare is the creation of echo chambers of information designed to convince the public and media to favour policies that ultimately serve commercial interests. Information is generated and disseminated to the public via think tanks and other policy outfits funded by wealthy donors and corporations with a vested interest in stopping pharmacare from emerging in Canada. A revolving door connects the cast of characters at the Canadian think tanks to the pharmaceutical industry and larger U.S.-based conservative and business-friendly institutions. What emerges is a media campaign involving many industry-linked organizations singing from the same songbook.

Think tanks that oppose pharmacare draw funds from the ultra-rich and large corporations both from Canada and abroad. Due to murky public disclosure practices, it is challenging to uncover who the donors are and how much they contribute. Nevertheless, some examples can be traced that show part of the overall picture.

One deep-pocketed Canadian funder is the Aurea Foundation, a registered charitable organization founded by the late Canadian billionaire Peter Munk. From 2011 to 2017, Aurea gave $1.7 million to the Fraser Institute, $1.3 million to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and $968,000 to the Montreal Economic Institute, three think tanks that oppose pharmacare. Additional funding included $5 million in donations by the Munk family in 2016 to establish the Peter Munk Centre for Free Enterprise Education at the Fraser Institute.

One of Canada’s wealthiest families, the Westons, who own Shoppers Drug Mart — Canada’s largest pharmacy chain — also frequently supports the Fraser Institute. Their charitable family foundation has a history of collaboration with the institute.

Foreign billionaires and Big Pharma lobbies are also generous donors to Canadian think tanks that oppose pharmacare.

In 2004, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s lobbying arm, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, ramped up its lobbying budget to US$150 million to support a series of projects that would target American legislators and also foreign governments, including Canada. The plan was dedicated to funding a standing network of economists, “thought leaders” and think tanks to act as an intellectual echo chamber sympathetic to the industry, and to develop strategic alliances with doctors, patients, universities and influential members of minority groups. The PhRMA budget included $1 million “to change the Canadian health-care system.”

One objective of PhRMA was to keep global drug prices high, including those north of the border, where our lower drug prices and public health-care system constantly remind Americans of the level of dysfunction in their system. Price control efforts in Canada were seen as particularly problematic because they created “politically unsustainable cross-border pricing differences...”

The Fraser Institute received $4.3 million in foreign funding over 10 years from billionaire U.S. donors, beginning in the early 2000s. More than half (approximately $2.7 million) of the total foreign funding came from the Eli Lilly and Co. Foundation, a charitable arm of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. According to the U.S.-based Center for Media and Democracy — an organization that tracks corporations’ PR campaigns and identifies corporate front groups — between 1995 and 2014 the Fraser Institute received over $1 million from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, and $400,000 from the Searle Freedom Trust, a private foundation founded with wealth from G.D. Searle pharmaceuticals (now part of Pfizer, another pharma giant).

Canadian think tanks also receive funding from the U.S.-based Atlas Network, which is funded by billionaires such as the Koch brothers. Founded and initially bankrolled by British billionaire Antony Fisher, Atlas Network was an extension of Fisher’s mission to “litter the world with free-market think tanks.” Among the 13 organizations listed as Canadian global partners of the Atlas Network are the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, the Fraser Institute, the Montreal Economic Institute and the MacDonald-Laurier Institute for Public Policy.

The Atlas Network also is actively supporting the creation of new think tanks that support its mission in Canada and abroad.

According to the Atlas Network’s Annual Report for 2016, Canadian partner organizations received over $200,000 in grant funding, though it is unclear which organizations in particular benefited.

The people who work for these industry-funded think tanks often have deep ties to the pharmaceutical sector and larger U.S.-based think tanks. Although numerous examples exist, here are three.

The Canadian Health Policy Institute is another think tank that opposes pharmacare with ties to deep-pocketed donors. Its founder is a former CEO and director of health policy studies at the Fraser Institute, and was executive director of health and economic policy at Innovative Medicines Canada for four years. Despite a staff of three, the CHPI bills itself as an “evidence-based activist think tank.”

A former federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation for six years subsequently moved on to Rx&D (the precursor to Innovative Medicines Canada) and now works as a senior director for government relations with Purdue Pharma.

The media offensive

The Fraser Institute in Vancouver is one of the most established conservative think tanks in Canada. Founded in 1974, it has maintained a long-standing campaign to oppose public single-payer health care. As interest in pharmacare picked up in recent years, the Fraser Institute began contributing to the echo chamber of opposition. In 2018 alone, the Fraser Institute published six articles opposing universal single-payer pharmacare. Articles included titles such as “Pharmacare is the wrong solution at the wrong time” and “Before implementing national pharmacare, look at what provinces already offer.”

The institute also pitches opinion pieces in local newspapers in order to access new audiences across Canada. For example, in an effort to sway public opinion in just one small province, the Fraser Institute has published opinion pieces with titles such as “Prescription Drugs in Canada — target those who need help,” in the Moncton Times, and “Pharmacare — be careful what you wish for” in the New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal.

Adding to the echo chamber, the billionaire-funded Macdonald-Laurier Institute also published five articles in 2018, opposing universal single-payer pharmacare. Titles include “Fill in the gaps to strengthen pharmacare” and “Single-payer pharmacare is a cure worse than the system,” the latter published in the Hill Times in November.

As well, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute secured publication of three opinion pieces in the Financial Post in 2018 on pharmacare, with titles such as “Canadians are being fooled into thinking we’ll like pharmacare: we really, really won’t,” “Turns out nearly all Canadians already have drug coverage, despite the pharmacare myths” and “We can make medicine affordable without the damage pharmacare will cause Canadians.”

What’s Big Pharma Buying When It Gives Money to Your Doctor? read more

As recently as Jan. 23, the Canadian Health Policy Institute secured the publication of another opinion piece in the Financial Post, entitled “Trudeau spreads the Big Pharmacare myth that scores of Canadians can’t afford medicine.”

The Montreal Economic Institute, an Atlas partner and recipient of funding from the Aurea Foundation, adds yet another voice to the anti-public pharmacare echo chamber. One MEI-based economist has written articles with the titles “The risks that come with a national pharmacare program” in the Globe and Mail and “National pharmacare plan not the answer” in the Ottawa Citizen.

The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has also put pharmacare in its crosshairs. The CTF published a piece against pharmacare on CBC’s Opinion website in October 2018, titled “There will be no such thing as painless national pharmacare.” In other publications, CTF parrots the lines of big-moneyed interests, declaring that “there should never be a national pharmacare program” and that rather “more participation by the private sector” is the best path forward. Armed with its base of 140,000 supporters across Canada, the CTF has a powerful capacity to bolster the Big Money echo chamber in Canada.

Domestic and foreign billionaires and pharmaceutical giants have long targeted Canada’s public health system and now want to prevent Canada from implementing a universal single-payer pharmacare plan that Canadians so badly need. In an effort to head off public antipathy towards them, these deep-pocketed interests have deployed a campaign of mass public persuasion, using echo chambers to achieve their goal.

Canadians and the powerful Big Money Club

Though seemingly diverse, virtually all the opposition to pharmacare can be traced back to a network of well-funded interests exerting their influence largely in secret. This Big Money Club — made up of pharmaceutical companies, the health insurance industry, and both Canadian and foreign free-market billionaires — are the only players who stand to lose from pharmacare. For the rest of Canadians, pharmacare would be a substantial gain.

Big Pharma Created the Opioid Epidemic; We Can Stop It read more

With deep pockets and considerable resources, the Big Money Club is employing an expansive strategy to stop the delivery of pharmacare to Canadians. Tapping into a deep well of resources and overlapping networks, they are influencing politicians and policymakers through lobbying and inflammatory advertising. They are creating echo chambers to distort the information available to the public and the media, and to promote a fear of change. Finally, they are calling for backup from the Trump Administration to exert international commercial pressure on Canada to maintain the status quo and reconsider reforms.

As Canadians look to the federal election in the fall of 2019, we cannot let the big-moneyed interests distort health policy in Canada to the exclusive benefit of their profit margins.

Canadians must demand our elected officials choose policies that defend the interests of all Canadians over Big Money.

The announcement came at the end of an emergency caucus meeting to consider expelling former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould after she released a secret recording last week that reignited the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Former Budget Minister Jane Philpott, who had quit in protest over Mr Trudeau's handling of the controversy, was also removed.

The Liberals have been in turmoil since February when Ms Wilson-Raybould said officials had inappropriately pressured her to ensure a major construction company escaped a corruption trial when she was justice minister last year.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Mr Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus.

""Whether it's taping conversations without consent or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it's become clear that (both) can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Angry legislators had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity.

Opposition leader Andrew Scheer said the prime minister's decision to expel the two ministers shows ""if you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party.""

Justin Trudeau’s fall from grace

The Canadian Liberal party surged in popularity under the leadership of Justin Trudeau, son of popular former PM Pierre Trudeau.

Having finished the 2011 election in third place, Mr Trudeau’s Liberals secured a 20 per cent swing at the 2015 election and over 140 seats to knock the ruling Conservative party out of power.

Once seen as a poster boy for progressive politics, the shine has come off Mr Trudeau’s political tenure.

He was embroiled in a conflict of interest scandal in December 2017 over a family vacation to the island of business magnate Aga Khan, who has received funding from the Canadian Government to support his philanthropic efforts.

Mr Trudeau also came under strong criticism over an eight day visit to India last year, where he accidentally dined with a Sikh extremist found guilty of the attempted murder of an Indian minister.

Now his leadership has been derailed by a prosecution meddling scandal just months before Canada goes to the polls in Autumn.

SNC-Lavalin is a prominent engineering and construction company based in Montreal, who have offices in over 50 countries including Australia.

The firm is facing a number of fraud and corruption charges over business dealings in Libya.

The company has been pushing for the charges to be resolved with a deferred prosecution agreement, a new measure legislated by the Trudeau government last year.

A deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) would allow large companies accused of crimes like corruption, bribery and fraud to escape trial and criminal prosecution and instead pay an economic penalty.

On February 7, a report from the newspaper The Globe and Mail alleged SNC-Lavalin had lobbied the Prime Minister's Office to secure a DPA.

The report claimed the Prime Minister's office had pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the case and persuade prosecutors to drop the criminal trial.

Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned from her cabinet affairs in the days following the story’s release.

She then testified to the Justice Committee, saying she'd experienced ""consistent and sustained"" political pressure to interfere in the case, including ""veiled threats.""

Mr Trudeau steadfastly denied the claims.

“The Attorney General has been historically in charge of Prosecutions, but in the last decade much of that function has been given over to the director of public prosecutions,"" explains Dr Victoria Colvin, a University of Wollongong lecturer and former criminal prosecutor in British Columbia.

“Part of the purpose of having that office is to insulate prosecution from politics.""

""The Attorney General does have some powers to intervene, but the idea is decisions are made independent of political considerations and potentially the appearance of those considerations.”

Last Friday the scandal took another turn after Ms Wilson-Raybould released a phone recording along with other documents to support her claims.

The recording of a call between Ms Wilson-Raybould and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick contains a conversation in which Mr Wernick signals the Prime Minister's concerns over plans to prosecute SNC-Lavelin.

Mr Trudeau described Ms Wilson-Raybould’s decision to secretly record the phone call as ‘unconscionable’.

Dr Colvin says the alleged actions of Mr Trudeau's office could contravene the Shawcross Doctrine, a longstanding constitutional convention in British Commonwealth nations.

""We have a long established convention and understanding that the decisions to prosecute individual cases are separate from the political process,"" she explains.

“How that actually works in practice is very rarely tested.”

Ms Wilson-Raybould responded to her expulsion on Twitter and says she did ‘what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party.”

What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party. I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do. (2/2) — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

Fellow expelled MP Jane Philpott said her expulsion is “profoundly disheartening.”

“This isn’t about a lack of loyalty,” she wrote in a statement on Facebook.

“This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty, in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence, but to no avail.”

“These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.”",Trudeau expels two ministers from party as corruption scandal threatens re-election,SBS,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/trudeau-expels-two-ministers-from-party-as-corruption-scandal-threatens-re-election

The concert will feature songs off his latest album, Old Stock, as well as tracks from previous records.

Caplan’s music is influenced by diverse genres such as eastern European folk music, Balkan brass, Klezmer and Roma music.

“The story of my career as a musician has been about trying to collaborate with people who know more than me, who are more talented than me and slowly soaking up the little things that they know,” said Caplan.

The songs from Old Stock were originally composed for the musical theatre production he co-created entitled Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story. Caplan wrote the songs for the musical along with director Christian Berry, while Hannah Moscovitch wrote the musical’s script. His Canadian tour will end in Toronto with a five-week theatrical run of the musical.

Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story takes place in 1908 and follows the story of two Jewish Romanian refugees in Halifax. Chaim and Chaya, the protagonists, are based on Moscovitch’s great-grandparents.

Despite taking place in the past, the musical and the accompanying album’s themes address the current turmoil around immigration.

One of Stephen Harper’s comments in the 2015 federal election campaign helped prompt Caplan to undertake a project featuring a refugee romance.

Caplan recounted that Harper “made a distinction between new Canadians and ‘old stock Canadians,’ and I was very disturbed by that distinction that there could be a kind of person who was more or less Canadian, in my opinion.

“There is no such thing as more or less Canadian.”

Caplan sought to draw the audience to the hypocrisy of modern-day xenophobia by relating it back to Canadian immigrants in the early 20th century.

“This idea of drawing a distinction between people who have more complex ethnic backgrounds, that have identities that involve a place of origin that is not Canada and people who have a more unified or a more singular identity, I think is deeply problematic and, at its heart, racist,” said Caplan.

Caplan was also pushed to write Old Stock after seeing the image of the young Syrian boy Alan Kurdi, whose body came ashore on the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean. Deeply disturbed by this tragedy, Caplan decided to help create a humanizing story about refugees.

Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, winning top festival honours. In between the play’s international tour performances, Caplan has played concerts showcasing the musical’s accompanying album across Europe, Australia and North America.

“I hope the audience will leave [the show] with a sense of the joy and the whimsy that is inherent in life as well as the chaos and darkness that is inherent in life,” he said.

“I try to hold both wholes in my hands and move through both the light and the dark with humour and joy, so I hope that people will leave with a rich sense of the absurd and the duality of life.”

Devon Hargreaves didn’t wait for middle age to get involved in community affairs.

After being elected to the student council while studying at Lethbridge College, he joined the community-wide Lethbridge PrideFest board and went on to serve as chair for two years.

More recently, Hargreaves co-founded a local advocacy organization that collected 18,000 signatures for a petition to Parliament. And now he’s entered provincial politics, running for the Alberta Liberals in Lethbridge East.

“I’m a firm believer in that when you see something that needs to be done, you step up and do it,” he says. “We’ve seen a far-right approach and a far-left approach, and that wasn’t satisfactory to me.”

Lethbridge voters need a candidate who’s fiscally responsible while still being socially progressive, he believes.

They also want an MLA who stays in touch with constituents, he adds.

“We’ve heard from a lot of people at the doors, they haven’t felt heard, they’ve been living in the shadow of a government, and they see more of what the government is doing than what their representative is doing in fighting for them.”

One issue many voters agree is crucial, Hargreaves says, is putting a firm cap on the size of our school’s classes.

“Taking care of students, looking out for them, there’s a lot of parents that just want to see more attention given to their children,” he says.

Exploratory oilwell drilling and fracking are once again a hot-button issue here.

“It’s a big thing in Lethbridge.”

And he points out the Alberta Liberals would allow cities and towns to ban those activities inside their corporate limits.

“We understand and support the role of municipal governments, and we feel they need that recognition – and to have those authorities in place to stand up for their city’s needs.”

Albertans also want a government that stands up and puts fees in place for capping and cleaning up all the province’s depleted and “orphan” wells, he says. After all these years, that won’t be cheap.

“We’re running 26 per cent of what it’s actually going to cost to close those wells,” Hargreaves says. “It’s an environmental issue as well as a corporate responsibility one.”

On another local issue, he says Lethbridge’s supervised consumption site is saving health-care dollars as well as lives.

“But we need more treatment, more focus on the pillars of prevention, of enforcement and things like that,” he stresses.

“We would declare a state of emergency to get this opioid epidemic cleaned up.”

That would allow us to bring in inter-governmental support, and get the needed supports in place.

One of the Lethbridge East candidates is calling for Alberta to separate from the rest of Canada, and Hargreaves says he’s found little support for that suggestion.

“People are concerned about the separatist sentiment they’re hearing about, and very firmly want to be part of Canada.”

To make things work, however, Albertans need a government that’s “able to stand up to a federal government, and demand an explanation on where the pipeline is at and when it’s coming in.

“That’s something that the Notley government has failed to do, and that’s something that the Alberta Liberal party has called for.”

“This is not an election between Jason Kenney and Rachel Notley,” Hargreaves says.

“It’s an election to represent Lethbridge East as it should be represented.”

TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ousted Canada’s former attorney general and another ex-minister from the Liberal party caucus Tuesday amid a scandal that has rocked his government in an election year.

Trudeau cited repeated questioning of his leadership as well as the fact that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant.

Trudeau called that “unconscionable.”

Trudeau also ousted Jane Philpott, a former Cabinet minister who stepped down from her role after she said she lost confidence in how the government has handled the affair.

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had remained as members of Trudeau’s party in Parliament after resigning from Cabinet but kept making remarks that damaged the prime minister and the party.

The two were two high-profile women ministers in Trudeau’s Cabinet, half of which are women. Wilson-Raybould was Canada’s first indigenous justice minister.

Trudeau and Liberal lawmakers met Tuesday evening to discuss Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

Wilson-Raybould tweeted that Trudeau had removed her and she will not be a Liberal candidate in the fall election.

“What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party,” she tweeted. “I have no regrets. I spoke truth as I will continue to do.”

Wilson-Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to veterans’ affairs minister in January because she didn’t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company accused of bribing officials in Libya.

That potential solution would avoid a potential criminal conviction that would bar engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from receiving any federal government business for a decade. The company is a major employer with 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

The scandal has led to multiple resignations, including Gerry Butts, Trudeau’s top aide and best friend. And it has damaged the party for eight weeks.

In a letter released earlier Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould pleaded with her colleagues to remain and acknowledged they are enraged but said she was “trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” Wilson-Raybould wrote to colleagues earlier Tuesday.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 via sources that Trudeau’s staff put pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She denied she was the source of the story, writing “I am not the one who made it public.”

The secret recording Wilson-Raybould made public shows Wernick telling Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau “is determined, quite firm” in finding a way to avoid a prosecution that could put 9,000 jobs at risk.

It also reveals Wilson-Raybould saying she regards the pressure as “inappropriate.”

Philpott said neither she nor Wilson-Raybould initiated the crisis now facing Trudeau and the party.

“Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould’s credibility and attempt to blame her,” Philpott said in posting on social media.

“That approach now appears to be focused on whether Jody Wilson-Raybould should have audiotaped the Clerk instead of the circumstances that prompted Jody Wilson-Raybould to feel compelled to do so.”

Wilson-Raybould has refused to express support for Trudeau for weeks, a demand many Liberal lawmakers said was necessary if she was to remain in Parliament as part of the party caucus

Trudeau said past civil wars within the Liberal party damaged the party.

“The team has to trust each other. With Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott that trust has been broken. Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided,” Trudeau said to a loud ovation in caucus.

Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said Wilson-Raybould is angling to eventually replace Trudeau.

“Her letter, I believe, sets the stage for her run at the Liberal leadership if the Liberals lose in October and Justin Trudeau steps down,” Wiseman said.

“She is a victim of the parliamentary system which in Canada imposes sturdier party discipline than in any of the other Westminster parliamentary systems. The letter reveals her naiveté, as a rookie Member of Parliament, about how the system works.”

Canada will face pressure this coming week when the UN hosts a major peacekeeping summit in New ...,"OTTAWA — As Canada’s military mission races to leave Mali and the United Nations pleads for it to stay, the European Union is making a fresh appeal to the Canadian Forces to partner with it in the West African country.

Gen. Esa Pulkkinen, director general of the EU’s military staff, told The Canadian Press that he has asked the Canadian government to bring its military training expertise to Mali as part of a broader effort to stamp out Islamic extremism in Africa’s Sahel region.

Pulkkinen said he’s aware of the context of his request — it comes as Canada faces pressure from the UN to extend its Mali peacekeeping mission in order to bridge a gap until Romanian replacements can arrive.

But he says Canada would make a great bilateral partner with the EU’s military training efforts in West Africa, which he says are crucial to stamping out security threats to Europe.

Those threats include the mass northward migration to Europe, an increase in the smuggling of arms, drugs and human trafficking, as well as terrorism.

Pulkkinen was in Ottawa this past week, and said he was planning to make a formal request to Canadian officials after raising the matter informally.

“I need brains. I don’t need the quantities,” he said.

We try to find other partners that share the same universal Western values as we have. They are very important when you provide education for our African troops

“Your officer training is top level in the world. More importantly, you have French language skills as well, which we need when we provide advice for our Malian friends.”

Pulkkinen already commands 1,000 troops in Somalia, the Central African Republic and Mali, and is partnering with the United States on various missions on the continent. He said the EU wants to ramp up its presence in Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad as well.

Joining forces with Canada would be a natural fit, he noted, because the EU mission is predicated on the same shared values.

“We try to find other partners that share the same universal Western values as we have. They are very important when you provide education for our African troops,” Pulkkinen said.

“The same understanding of the respect of human rights and other issues — you name it.”

But the mission will be a tough sell for the EU.

Canada is in the final throes of withdrawing its eight helicopters and 250 military personnel from Mali, where they have been providing emergency medical evacuations and transporting troops and equipment across the vast country.

The drawdown has moved the UN to formally ask Canada to extend its mission in what appears to be a final effort to prevent a gap in military medical evacuations for wounded peacekeepers and UN staff.

The UN sent a formal request, in writing, to the federal government late last month after months of behind-the-scenes prodding got them nowhere with Ottawa.

The letter marks an unusual step: the UN usually only makes such requests if it believes it stands a good chance of a positive response, which in this case is far from certain.

The government, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has repeatedly played down the gap it would be creating by leaving Mali on schedule.

Pulkkinen’s request on behalf of the EU will only increase the pressure on the Trudeau government, which has faced criticism for what has been seen as a relatively weak return to the business of UN peacekeeping due to the Mali mission’s modest scope. The Liberals made peacekeeping a signature foreign policy promise during the 2015 federal election.

Canada will face pressure this coming week when the UN hosts a major peacekeeping summit in New York, the first one since Vancouver hosted a similar gathering in November 2017.

China, citing the discovery of pests, expanded its ban on canola seed imports on Tuesday to include shipments from a second major exporter, Viterra.

Viterra is owned by Glencore’s agricultural arm. Earlier this month, Beijing halted shipments from Richardson International, Canada’s top exporter of canola seed.

Canada’s Liberal government and China have been locked in a trade and political dispute since the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies was arrested in Vancouver last December on a U.S. extradition request.

China accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to the Canola Council, with seed exports to China worth some $2.7 billion a year.

Canada’s official opposition Conservative party, which opinion polls show could win an election in October, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not done enough to help canola farmers and is bungling ties with China.

“The restrictive measures imposed by China are said to be rooted in science. We have asked for the evidence,” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in a statement.

“To date, none has been supplied. We will keep pushing as hard as we can on this vital point,” added Goodale, an MP from Saskatchewan, Canada’s biggest canola-producing province by tonnage since 1990.

Trudeau said on Wednesday he was concerned about the ban and could send a delegation to Beijing. He met with Richardson executives on Tuesday.

Goodale, using sterner language, said “measures that defy science and contravene sound business and trading practices detract from the good reputation for reliability which all trading nations seek to maintain.”

The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment.

Canadian food inspection officials say they have found no problems with canola seed exports.

“We will intervene at the right level of seniority and intensity — scientifically, strategically and diplomatically — to have the best possible impact,” said Goodale.

Conservative legislators on Thursday sent a letter requesting an emergency meeting of the Commons agriculture committee on Friday.

“We fear that if this issue is not resolved expeditiously, farmers will suffer significantly because of the prime minister’s ongoing mishandling of the Canada-China relationship,” they said in the letter.

[This is a long article.]

Oh, Canada. No need to worry our pretty little heads any further about the Trudeau administration’s potentially criminal political interference in the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution.

Jody Wilson-Raybould’s new testimony to the Commons justice committee, including her mind-blowing recording of her December 19 telephone conversation with Michael Wernick answers it all.

So sayeth the man who orchestrated Canada’s worst-ever attack on a sitting attorney general, on the rule of law, and on its central tenet of prosecutorial independence: our once beloved prime minister, whose approval ratings are now lower than Donald Trump’s.

We’ve reached the end of his tortuous road to nowhere on LavScam, according to the statement put out late Friday (March 29) by PMO communications director Cameron Ahmad, in response to JWR’s latest evidence.

“All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the Prime Minister,” it declared [Emphasis added.]

“We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

As opposed to moving even further backward through a misplaced focus bent on further ripping Team Trudeau apart, by throwing its most popular MPs out of caucus over their principled conduct on this issue that its leader has concluded doesn’t really much matter to Canadians.Though I would not for one second bet against the prospect that the Liberals hungry for revenge are so bat-shit crazy as to conspire to boot JWR and Jane Philpott out of caucus this Wednesday (April 3).

Every step of the way, they have proven that they are too dim to realize how their actions have added insult to their own collective injury.

Why should we expect them not to further aggravate that reality by kicking JWR out of their “family”?

Especially after the feast on Saturday attended by some 500 people, who came out in Campbell River, B.C. to the Kwakwaka'wakw nation feast hosted to celebrate and honour Puglaas, whose Indigenous name translates as ""woman born to noble people"".

And considering that the NDP has just nominated Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs vice-president Bob Chamberlin as their candidate for the upcoming federal byelection, just over 150 kilometres down the road, in Nanaimo-Ladysmith.

If this scandal has shown anything, it is surely that the Liberals’ nuttiness knows no bounds.

Trudeau claims he was never fully briefed

Enough is enough, the PMO pretty much declared in its statement.

“The Prime Minister took responsibility for the situation...""

The “situation” being how he marshalled his most senior hired guns to try to bend Puglaas to his unseemly will, and then fired her as AG, precisely as she feared he would, when he couldn’t get his way.

Anyway, what’s done is done. And he swears he didn’t do it.

Rest assured, we are told, he was never “fully briefed” by Wernick on how his conversation with Puglaas went and he was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today”.

After reading that, my first reaction was ""right"".

Like we are all to believe that of the man who never lied when he said that ""The allegations in the (February 7) Globe story are false. Neither the current nor the previous attorney general was ever directed by me or by anyone in my office to take a decision in this matter.""

Believe it. Like Richard Nixon was “not a crook"".

Then again, according to a CBC story, a statement put out on Saturday from Wernick’s lawyer says that Wernick ""never discussed SNC again with the PM or PMO until someone leaked the story to the Globe and Mail in early February."" So that’s that.

Stupid us, Canadians.

And here most of us who listened to that recording, who read that new evidence, and who have been closely following this scandal might have thought that it all raises so many new questions and concerns that scream out to be formally scrutinized by the RCMP.

How wrong we are. All our concerns should now be put to bed, Justin Trudeau says.

Stupid, stupid us.

How could we ever think that there is any more to the gross wrongdoing that is at the root of this story that might warrant a police probe, or a public inquiry, or further investigation from a parliamentary committee?

Liberals are dreaming if they don't believe the expulsion of Jody Wilson-Raybould from caucus won't benefit NDP candidate Bob Chamberlin in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith by-election. Amanda Siebert

In Trudeau’s mind, there is simply no need to ask any questions of the multiple witnesses who are central to this scandal who were never obliged to testify, let alone under oath.

There is no need to ascertain whether anyone acted unlawfully in respect of s. 139(2), s. 423.1(1) and/or s. 122 of the Criminal Code, or may have violated the Lobbying Act.

The RCMP should know that all the facts are now on the table and should reject the appeals from Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and from the five former attorneys general who have all urged it to get to the bottom of the matter that Trudeau’s Liberals are trying so hard to bury.

No need to investigate how and what privileged information might have been possibly illegally shared and used to try to pressure JWR into politically intervening in a criminal prosecution in a way that might never been done before in Canadian history.

No need to investigate what, if any threats SNC-Lavalin did or did not make in respect of moving its head office from Montreal, costing Canada 9,000 jobs—both of which, its president and CEO, Neil Bruce, emphatically denied having ever made.

“Yes, the 9,000 people will get a job,” Bruce said. “I have no doubt whatsoever about that … But they’ll be working probably for a U.S. company.”

No need to investigate what the company or its agents really did or said in lobbying for a special deal to avoid a criminal trial, which Bruce suggested he never requested on economic grounds. A claim that would seem to contradict his company’s presentation to federal prosecutors last fall on options it was considering if it failed to get a DPA.

No need to investigate how those false threats about Canadian job losses and SNC’s potentially imminent HQ closure in Canada were used—either deliberately or unintentionally—as “public interest” arguments to justify a DPA.

No need to investigate, as Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre wondered, whether anyone endeavoured to “trick” JWR with specious public interest arguments into overruling the director of public prosecutions in order to save the company from a criminal trial.

No need to investigate how or if cabinet might have been deliberately misled in that regard, or what it may have been told before or after the January 14 cabinet shuffle, about any plans by the government to give SNC-Lavalin its multi-million-dollar wish for a DPA.

No need to investigate the degree to which the prime minister’s personal partisan interests and his party’s electoral interests factored into the inappropriate pressure repeatedly exerted on Canada’s top law officer, to give that company a DPA.

A company that also donated over $100,000 in illegal contributions to the Liberal party over the span of a decade.

A company facing fraud and corruption charges that neither the AG nor the DPP considered it appropriate not to prosecute—alleged crimes that the OECD has now put Canada on notice it is deeply concerned about, given what has so far surfaced in this scandal.

No need to search for any more truth, when the truth that has emerged is so damning in its own right.

You can only go to hell once. Trudeau’s better angels have told him, salvation awaits those who deny what they’ve done and lie to themselves that all their alleged sins have been exposed. No reason for him to admit anything or to beg for mercy.

The facts are all known. There is nothing more to be found out.

The Great Oz has spoken.

Trudeau wants us to look the other way

There is no wickedness here. “Surrender Dorothy” was never written in the sky in black smoke. There were no flying monkeys dispatched to terrorize the brave figure who led us all down her fantastical yellow brick road.

It is as true as the conclusion that Canada’s unapologetic wizard of his own misfortune is not at once the dishonest and bewildered little bully behind the curtain, the cowardly lion, the tin man without a heart, and his own straw man without a brain.

Poppies. Poppies. That’s the ticket, Canada.

Best we all just lie down now and go to sleep on this scandal that has dragged on for two months.

Let’s all turn the page and move on, Trudeau urges with mock humility and healing calm.

Time to focus on what’s really important.

Like the prime minister’s heroism in resisting those truly evil attempts by JWR to wish upon Canada that charter-hating judge as chief justice of the Supreme Court.

That is, so long as it does not involve formally investigating the possibly criminal leak behind that false proposition.

So long as it does not mean identifying and potentially prosecuting that unknown person, who attempted to smear the “true villain” in this piece by deliberately smearing Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench with false and highly privileged information.

No need to investigate that action by someone whom we are assured—no fingers crossed—is not in the prime minister’s office, nor who is his official agents’ secret agent.

An asserted fact about which they are so sure they see no reason to prove it about an action, it must be said, that both Trudeau and his current attorney general so “strongly condemn” they have decided it’s not worth investigating.

Nope. We have heard and learned all there is to know. Which is more than Trudeau’s nefarious leaker(s) ever wanted us to know, thanks to the swift and brutal responses from Justice Joyal, from the Law Society of Manitoba, and from the Canadian Bar Association.

No need either to let former cabinet minister Jane Philpott speak and tell us what she is not at liberty to share, solely because the prime minister in whom she could no longer serve in good conscience as a member of his cabinet has refused to waive her oath of cabinet confidentiality.

Even though she assures us that there are, in fact, “further issues of concern that I’m not free to share … There’s much more to the story that should be told.”

No need to “put up or shut up”—as Liberal MP Judy Sgro so famously chided both Philpott and JWR.

The latter has now royally “put up” and the prime minister has again concluded for the umpteenth time that “shut up” should suffice.

PM insists he didn't know about phone conversation

Despite his best efforts to silence JWR from offering her most recent testimony, with the help of his Liberal flunkies on the Commons justice and ethics committees, more facts materialized and that should be the end of it.

“Thank you very much for your donation”, Trudeau may as well have said in response to JWR’s latest protests. “I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.”

Now kindly leave the room and take your mercurial poisoning of our “more united than ever” Liberal “family” with you.

“Reconciliation” is simply not part of his vocabulary in any honestly meaningful sense. The video proved that point.

Crocodile tears at best is all we can expect, especially in this instance, where the victim of his abuse caused us all so much grief by speaking her truth to power.

In Trudeau’s apparent takeaway of all that has unfolded, it’s so sad that she created that “erosion of trust” by opening her big mouth instead of shutting up and doing what she was asked, even though she was studiously never explicitly told to do it.

It’s so sad that she misinterpreted his meaning and intent, before he fired her as his AG.

He “should have spoken directly with [her] about this matter—and wishes that she had come to him.” Poor, negligent, Jody.

For Heaven’s sake, how many more times does Trudeau or his apologists need to say that?

Don’t we get it?

She failed him and her party by never putting her concerns about the veiled threats, bullying, and inappropriate and sustained political pressure in writing.

She could have spared our country so much unnecessary pain if only she had come to him (OK, besides on September 17) and told him how she really felt.

Because, after all, why on Earth would she ever surmise that expressing her concerns directly and repeatedly to his top bureaucrat, to his top political adviser, to his office’s most senior political staffers, or to his finance minister would ever reach his ears?

Why, it is as unduly presumptive as imagining that Michael Wernick would ever fully report to him on his nonthreatening, most forgettable conversation that he initiated on Trudeau’s behalf to make JWR see the sensible light of day that had somehow escaped her ill-advised attention.

The conversation in which Wernick said, “I think they [SNC-Lavalin] have made direct representations to the prosecutor though...and they tried to make the public interest argument and so on and so on. But they gave the impression that they are not being listened to so...”

(A fact that he would know, how? And from whom? About a “public interest argument” that he apparently personally counselled the company should take to the director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, according to handwritten notes of the meeting he had with its CEO on September 18.)

Shudder the thought that the prime minister was ever “fully briefed” about that conversation in which Wernick repeatedly ignored JWR’s advice that “I am trying to protect the Prime Minister from political interference or perceived political interference or otherwise.”

Which prompted him to respond, “Alright, I understand that... but he does not have the power to do what he wants... all the tools are in your hands so...”

The December 19 recorded phone call between Jody Wilson-Raybould and top civil servant Michael Wernick has kept the SNC-Lavalin story at the top of newscasts.

JWR raises spectre of Saturday Night Massacre

Perish the suspicion that the prime minister was ever apprised of that final attempt at simple reasoning, in which Wernick said, “He [Trudeau] is asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal...um.” [Emphasis added.]

Including the one “tool” of directing the DPP to do something that both Roussel and JWR had decided would not be appropriate to use—as Wilson-Raybould had personally told the prime minister and all who were sent to convince her to use it anyway.

Sure, to we—the great unwashed—that might sound a lot like the prime minister actually tried to direct JWR to do the one thing she would not agree to do. But it wasn’t meant as such, it always being “her decision” and all.

All an unfortunate misunderstanding of so many conflicting personal “interpretations” of fact and perceived experience, best swept under the rug for good.

Why should we ever imagine that Wernick would personally fill his boss in on every nitty-gritty uttering from that telephone call? I mean, apart from the fact that he “never wore a wire” and all.

And apart from the fact that he actually said, “well, I am going to have to report back before he [Trudeau] leaves...he is in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so...I am a bit worried...”

We can all sleep so much easier now, confident that the prime minister was never told by his most senior civil servant that Wernick had suggested to JWR “it is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads.

That he was never told of Wernick’s warning to JWR that “he [Trudeau] is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn't being used.” A question Trudeau never dared again put directly to his attorney general after her admonition in his September 17 attempt to convince her to change her decision.

No sirreee, Wernick never apparently told the PM about his gentle and almost apologetic threat-that-wasn’t to JWR: “I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

We can all hold Trudeau harmless, knowing that he was never briefed about his beleaguered attorney general’s most colourful comment: “So I am having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here Michael to be honest with you and this is not a great place for me to be in—I do not relish this place—but what I am confident of is that I have given the prime minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

Once again, Trudeau would have us believe that he is innocent of all he never knew and that he doth not protest too much.

If only because neither his right-hand man nor his top legal adviser ever directly protested (for a second time) to him that something very rotten was taking place in his Denmark.

Except, perhaps, for this telling comment in that call made by JWR, which we are assured Wernick also failed to relay to his boss:

“I made it very clear at the cabinet table and other places that these tools are at the discretion of the prosecutor—and everybody agreed to that and that there was no guarantee that there would be a DPA in this or any other case.

“So we are treading on dangerous ground here —and I am going to issue my stern warning—um—because I cannot act in a manner and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn't independent, I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. All of this screams of that.”

Poor, Jody.

“I am waiting for the … other shoe to drop, so I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister … gets things that he wants,” she told Wernick.

And drop, it did, exactly as she anticipated, as Jane Philpott warned Trudeau that JWR feared it would, before he lowered the boom and turfed her from the office that she never called “her dream job”.

Before he “offered” her the Indigenous Services portfolio that she had specifically “told his transition team and others that I could not and would not in good conscience ever be able to take on the Ministerial role of delivering services to ‘Indians’ and Indian Act bands…” A role that she explained in her latest testimony “is understood as that of the ‘Indian Agent’ ”—a term typically used in “a derogatory fashion”.

Poor us, the PM would have us now believe, if we are also waiting for other shoes to drop and are still operating under the illusion that he won’t get what he wants.

Don’t we get it?

The PMO statement essentially declares that the final shoe has already dropped.

Trudeau doth command it. And above all, what he wants now is to get beyond this distraction that only really amounts to a bunch of contested facts that are now “all…on the table”.

Never mind that we know only a handful of facts about that December 18 “emergency meeting” between JWR’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince; the prime minister’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts; and the PM’s chief of staff, Katie Telford.

Facts that include the email to Prince with the subject heading “URGENT” that was sent precisely 44 minutes before she was summoned to attend that 5 p.m. meeting.

Which makes hash of Butts’s testimony that he did not regard that as an emergency meeting.

What more would we hope to accomplish by asking the RCMP or others to explore what was really said in that meeting?

What of it, if Butts and Telford pressured Prince to convince Wilson-Raybould to hire an external counsel—“someone like Beverly McLachlin”—prompting Prince to tell them “that would be interference”?

To which Butts allegedly responded with his most damning line, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.”

What of it, if the facts support Prince’s report?

Surely the RCMP would have no cause for concern if it was true that “KT thinks it gives us cover in the business community and in the legal community, and that it would allow the PM to say we are doing something. She was like, ‘If Jody is nervous, we would of course line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper.’”

What of it, if, as JWR testified “My [chief of staff] asked what if the [requested outside legal] opinion comes saying, ‘She can review it, but she shouldn’t’ or simply, ‘She can’t review it’ end of story?”

To which, Mr. Butts allegedly stated, “it wouldn’t say that.” No alarm bells, there.

A question of fact that JWR went on to stress “My COS informed me that she remembered this very clearly because this response made her nervous.” As indeed it would, for all its implied suspicions of such “independent” advice being initiated for its foregone conclusions.

What of it, if Prince accurately reported to her boss that “Katie was like ‘we don’t want to debate legalities anymore' ”?

No need for the RCMP or anyone to ask any of those attendees about those facts as asserted in Prince’s text message and in JWR’s testimony. Unless Canada’s law enforcement officers think it worthwhile to ascertain what was actually said and meant, in weighing any evidence pointing to a possible obstruction of justice.

Former prime minister and ex-attorney general Kim Campbell was mentioned by Gerald Butts in defence of Trudeau's wishes. Martin Dee/UBC

Kim Campbell's name pops up

Ditto for Prince’s report that “Gerry told some story about how Mulroney met with David Milgaard’s mom, walked into the cab[inet] room and told Kim Campbell she had to fix it.

“She gave him all these [attorney-general] reasons why she couldn’t interfere but then she ultimately did what Mulroney wanted”, “By Gerry’s telling, it was because Mulroney told her that she had to find a solution.”

According to the PMO’s statement, it should be enough to know that, as JWR has now testified, she personally met with the Right Honorable Kim Campbell the very next day after that meeting, to check out that outrageous claim.

That would be the same Kim Campbell who is currently the chairperson for Canada's Supreme Court Advisory Board.

Who cares that she was “quite offended and outraged by the comments” and told JWR that they were utterly untrue?

Pish, posh.

What’s another assault on the tenet of prosecutorial independence with yet another alleged and potentially defamatory fabrication, aimed at justifying an intervention that the prime minister wanted?

In this case, by sullying the name of a former Conservative AG and prime minister in the process.

Butts is gone. Wernick is going. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have both resigned.

It’s all good.

Except that none of it is.

All of it is not just bad; it as rotten as can be—and quite possibly criminal at its core.

As Wilson-Raybould put it to Wernick:

“Does [Trudeau] understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean—this is not about saving jobs, this is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.""

Evidently not, for as Trudeau’s clerk answered, “Well I don't think he sees it as that...” And besides, the prime minister was never fully briefed on that conversation.

I submit, it is the facts we still don’t know and that the prime minister still hopes to hide that cry out to be exposed.

The one thing we should all know enough by now is this sorry reality.

Never has any Canadian prime minister been so dishonest, deluded or factually discredited in his “version” of events in a scandal of such significance in the dangers it poses to the rule of law.

That fact is clear. And it is why for Canada’s sake, Trudeau must just go.

His actions and cover-up are beyond redemption.

His leadership is an embarrassment to our country and an affront to the highest values of his office.

His command of the truth is as lacking as the honesty of his office’s response to JWR’s latest evidence.

I hope and pray that the RCMP is not content to do nothing. Indeed, I predict again that it will not be content to dismiss the limited truths that are now on the table as “just” a political controversy that warrants no further investigation.

All the facts of what really transpired beg to be rooted out, publicized, and prosecuted—or not—as the law demands.

Come what may, the truth will out.

And when it does, one way or another, Trudeau will be out.

Senators on the committee say they want to hold meetings and hear from victims to ensure their experiences are shared “so that nobody else is forced into abandoning all hope of having a child.”

It is at least the third federal probe of the problem, with a House of Commons committee also studying it, and the federal government working with the provinces and territories to discuss how women, particularly Indigenous women, are being pressured or forced into the surgery.

The Saskatoon Health Authority publicly apologized in 2017 after Indigenous women came forward to say they were coerced into tubal ligations. A proposed class-action lawsuit was subsequently filed against the province of Saskatchewan, the federal government, regional health authorities, and individual doctors.

The election year budget was offered under a ...,"The Liberal government’s preference for continued deficits and increasing program spending “could increase the vulnerability of public finances to a faster economic slowdown or sudden shock,” according to Fitch Ratings.

Canada has the second largest gross government debt of ‘AAA’ rated countries after the United States, which is ‘incompatible’ with its gold-plated rating, according to the ratings agency.

While the credit agency concedes that increased spending and projected deficits in Canada’s latest budget remain consistent with a falling federal debt burden, the forecast assumes the economy will avoid a recession.

“Modest fiscal loosening and sustained deficits will increase the economy’s exposure to a downturn,” the ratings agency said in its post-budget analysis.

While the expanded federal deficits remain relatively modest at less than one per cent of GDP and are sufficiently low to keep debt-to-GDP ratio drifting lower over the medium term, the country’s gross general government debt, combining federal and provincial fiscal accounts, is higher than other similarly rated sovereigns, and the ratings agency notes that debt levels are “incompatible with (Canada’s) ‘AAA’ status.”

Fitch had issued a similar warning in 2017.

A raft of new spending items in the federal budget aims to stimulate an economy that’s lost momentum, with some analysts suggesting a recession may be around the corner. Canada’s GDP fell by 0.1 per cent in November and December, but the economy managed a marginal 0.4 per cent growth in the fourth quarter.

Earlier this month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it is now forecasting 1.5 per cent growth this year for Canada, compared to its previous call for GDP growth of 2.2 per cent.

On Wednesday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau disputed the notion that recession might rear its head.

“We’re expecting … that we will have a return to growth at expected levels in the second quarter (of 2019) and our long-term forecasts are positive,” Morneau said.

However, investors are becoming more cautious and more convinced that the next interest-rate move from the country’s previously hawkish central bank will be more dovish.

Local yields have fallen in recent weeks amid weakening economic data, a more downbeat assessment from the Bank of Canada and a global rally in bonds. Wednesday’s dovish shift by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the market’s more gloomy view on prospects for the U.S. buoyed sovereign bonds and supported the view that policy makers in Ottawa will need to cut rates.

Modest fiscal loosening and sustained deficits will increase the economy's exposure to a downturn Fitch Ratings

With “the bulk of the curve being below the overnight rate, it really says that the BoC will be reluctantly led to cutting rates,” Ryan Goulding, a fixed-income manager at Vancouver-based Leith Wheeler Investment Counsel Ltd., which manages around $19 billion, told Bloomberg. But it may not happen until “after a long, disappointing wait” for capital spending to pick up, he said.

The annual deficit projections in Tuesday’s budget, which is set to reach as high as $19.8 billion, will be racked up as the government makes several large, one-time investments for 2018-19, including $2.2-billion worth of new infrastructure funding and $1 billion towards improving energy efficiency.

The budget also pledges up to $3.9 billion for supply managed dairy, egg and poultry farmers affected by recent trade deals with the Asia-Pacific and Europe. Other big-ticket items include a $300 million zero-emissions car incentive, and a $1.25 billion houses-for-votes program that provides interest-free loans to first-time home buyers through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.

The election year budget was offered under a backdrop of disappointing growth over the last several months, according to CIBC Capital Market analysts Avery Shenfeld and Andrew Grantham.

“This was less a rain of largesse and more of a sprinkling of measures, aimed at winning-over targeted groups.”

There was an enhancement of the fiscal track since the fall statement, CIBC analysts wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

“With revenues running further ahead of plan, and spending undershooting,” they said.

Instead of aiming at a lower track for deficits than had been laid out last year, CIBC said the government used the extra room generated by the enhancements to announce a dissemination of new spending and tax benefits, “thereby giving the economy a modest dose of stimulus while leaving the deficit track little changed from the fall statement.”

Posted on March 27, 2019 by Sunny South News

Government budgets often offer some benefits for voters, but when the budget precedes an election, there’s a lot in common with Christmas — there are plenty of gifts, and you try not to think about having to pay for them later.

So it is with the Liberal government’s federal budget tabled last week that will dole out billions of dollars in new spending on all sorts of goodies for Canadians — many of them aimed at helping middle-class voters save money.

The Liberals were aided by the fact that a stronger economy has produced higher-than expected revenue — a projected extra $27.8 billion over the next six years.

Based on Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s plan, the Liberals will spend $22.8 billion of that additional money.

The budget includes: $1.7 billion over five years, and $586 million a year after that, for a Canada Training Benefit to help workers upgrade their skills and learn new ones while staying in their current jobs; $1.18 billion over five years to tighten border security, including hiring more judges to handle judicial reviews of asylum applications; $3.9 billion for farmers (the majority of them in the vote-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec) in supply-managed industries affected by new trade agreements with the U.S. and Asian countries; $2.2 billion for municipalities’ and First Nations’ infrastructure projects; $950 million for municipal governments to make their buildings more energy-efficient and to provide subsidy programs to help homeowners do the same; $300 million over three years for rebates of up to $5,000 on electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles.

The budget also calls for putting money toward lowering the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to the prime rate, and to create a new Canadian Drug Agency to centralize evaluations of new drugs and to buy in bulk nationwide, instead of province-by-province.

The provisions include measures to make housing more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers, by increasing the amount they can borrow from RRSPs and by having the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. contribute a small share of equity for down payments.

The budget also provides new rules that will let working seniors keep more of the money they earn before triggering a claw-back in the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The Canada Training Benefit will provide a tax credit of up to $250 per year to help with covering up to half the cost of job training, such as fees for a college course or other professional training programs. Such training is increasingly becoming crucial to help workers keep their skills up to date in a fast-changing workplace.

Similarly, helping working seniors keep more of their earnings in their pockets will be useful in a world where more seniors are having to remain on the job in order to make ends meet.

Of course, all these goodies have to be paid for, and the money for that ultimately comes from taxpayers’ pockets.

The Canadian Press points out the new budget will result in a 2019-20 federal deficit projection of $19.8 billion, including a $3-billion “risk adjustment,” an increase of $200 million from last year’s forecast. The Liberals’ plan includes a gradual reduction in the deficit, but that will happen more slowly than the government anticipated last year.

Morneau’s 460-page budget is titled “Investing in the Middle Class,” but it could perhaps be more appropriately called “Investing in Middle-Class Voters.”

Rather than using the unexpected windfall to reduce the debt or balance the budget, the Liberals have opted to spend the money like a carefree Vegas vacationer who just got lucky at the slot machines.

Affordability expected to dominate federal election campaign

New research has found that affordability will likely dominate the upcoming federal election.

A new public opinion poll has found 48 per cent of Canadians are worried about the rising cost of living and not having enough income to cover their expenses.

A total of 57 per cent listed issues of affordability, economic inequality, wages and taxes, as their top vote drivers for the upcoming federal election. Pharmacare and healthcare costs also rated highly. When shown options to improve affordability, good jobs, healthcare costs, fairer taxes, reducing costs of products and services received the strongest level of support

The survey also found a strong link between affordability anxiety and broader opinions and attitudes about the future economy, immigration, tax rates for the rich, and government regulation of corporations.

The poll was conducted by Abacus Data and presented at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit in Ottawa to shed light on the roots of rising populism and explore progressive solutions to the problems that worry Canadians most.

“Most Canadians believe that while the cost of living and income inequality has gotten worse over the last few years, corporate profits are doing fine,” said David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data. “What’s quite striking in the results is that both political leaders and corporate Canada are being held responsible for the worsening financial circumstances many Canadians are experiencing.”

“It’s clear both from the polling and from events here and around the world, ignoring rising affordability fears comes with great risk,” said Katrina Miller, Program Director for the Broadbent Institute.

“Many of the affordability concerns people have are natural ground for progressives,” and stagnant wages,” said Miller. “The research tells us we need to offer concrete proposals on issues like housing, healthcare, good jobs, fairer taxes to address affordability in the short and long-term.”

“We have to be careful. If affordability anxiety grows and people feel left out of the economic shift underway, they will be suspectable to divisive rhetoric that pits people against each other,” said Coletto. “There’s a growing group of what I call ‘anxious populists’ who will have a big influence of the next election. They are the least partisan and most persuadable group, so in a sense, they are up for grabs for whoever can make them the best offer.”

“We can’t stand by and allow the politics of division to take hold,” said Miller. “Progressive movements and leaders must listen closely to what ‘anxious populists’ are saying and provide a well-marked path to economic inclusion that gives them hope for the future.”",Affordability expected to dominate federal election campaign,Blackburn News,https://blackburnnews.com/midwestern-ontario/midwestern-ontario-news/2019/03/28/affordability-expected-dominate-federal-election-campaign/
49,,2019-03-27T17:46:00.0000000Z,Canada’s population has more than doubled ... “We haven’t talked about health care during an election for years. It’s high time we did. This is catastrophic. Bottom line: Either ...,"Stephen Skyvington is on a mission to have an adult conversation about the dire state of health care in Canada and the need for revolutionary change.

Hired as manager of government relations by the Ontario Medical Association in 1995, Skyvington opened his own PR company PoliTrain Inc. in 2001 — he’s a lobbyist, consultant, pundit, veteran of the health care wars.

“Unfortunately, my detractors would have you believe I have a hidden agenda, that my goal is to foist on Canada a U.S.-style, two-tier health care system,” he quipped.

“The irony, however, is that if we continue to keep our heads buried in the sand like we have for the past 50 years, trying to prop up a system that simply isn’t sustainable, then we’ll indeed end up with exactly what our neighbours to the south have: a health care system that’s a bloody mess.”

In his new book, This May Hurt A Bit: Reinventing Canada’s Health Care System, Skyvington concludes it is time to properly fund Medicare or “free it,” citing the long-running Cambie constitutional trial as a potential watershed moment that might prompt the long-needed transformation.

Or not.

With the face of the challenge, Dr. Brian Day, founder of the private Cambie Surgery Centre and a former president of the Canadian Medical Association, supplying a cheerleading foreword, Skyvington offers a 200-odd-page indictment of the current health care system.

He has nothing but scorn for the present crop of politicians — too mealy-mouthed to tell the truth and too spineless to act.

“Remember those kids who used to sit at the back of the classroom?” Skyvington asked. “The troublemakers? The slow learners? The social misfits? Well, guess what? They’re the ones in charge now.”

In his view, the most vulnerable are put at risk and governments dodge responsibility.

“The solutions are seen in best practices of the many countries that deliver universal care far more effectively and efficiently than we do in Canada. Governments have, with the support of special interest groups, abrogated their duty to care for patients,” Skyvington said.

He pointed to Walid Khalfallah, from Kelowna, a paraplegic thanks to his encounter with the health care system.

“All because those running the show felt it was a reasonable risk for a young boy of thirteen to wait 27 months — that’s right, I said 27 months — for surgery on his spine. By the time Walid had the surgery in 2012, at Shriners Hospital in Spokane, Wash., it was too late.”

Young people better pay particular attention, he warned.

“Baby boomers like me will get $4,000 more health care services than we pay for in our lifetime through taxes, Millennials will pay $18,000 more in taxes than in services received for health care, and the iGens will pay $27,000 more in taxes than in services received because we are always paying for our parents, the generation ahead of us,” Skyvington said.

“The problem is there are too many of us (baby boomers), not enough of the iGens and Millennials, plus they have all this school debt, they’re working two jobs, they’re living in their parents’ basement instead of having a house and building equity.”

How many ministries of health do we currently have in Canada?

“Believe it or not,” he fumed, “the answer is 14! Ten provincial, three territorial, and one federal. Each province and territory has a health minister and a health ministry chock full of civil servants, most of whom never see a patient. That’s a hell of a lot of dollars being spent on things other than frontline patient care.

“How much sense does it make to have all these different ministries negotiating separate deals with Big Pharma? Is it any wonder the cost of prescription medicines is eating up so much of our health care budgets?”

With all the surety of a scientist lamenting climate change, Skyvington is convinced Medicare’s doomsday is around the corner.

“We’re going to have a U.S.-style, two-tier system by 2030 because that’s what happens if we don’t make the changes I’m talking about now.”

He identified three treatment “tsunamis” — diabetes, obesity and dementia — that will swamp the system.

Introduced in 1968, Medicare is showing its age and there is not enough money to keep it from collapsing under its own weight, Skyvington explained.

Canada’s population has more than doubled — from 18.2 million in 1961 to 36.6 million in 2017 — while per-capita spending on health care increased more than 60 fold: From less than $100 per person in the early 1960s to a whopping $6,604 in 2017.

Even with all that money, there are historically long queues for care: Nearly a million patients waiting for treatment in 2016 lost $1.7 billion in wages alone.

Skyvington has a program of 10 solutions, but his book’s strength is not so much his prescription but his etiology and diagnosis.

And he hopes his analysis will spur a realistic discussion: “We have a bad insurance scheme masquerading as a working health care system, a system that is broken and unsustainable because it wasn’t built right in the first place.

“The reality is it puts the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society in a much worse place than if we actually had a hybrid system. The government should either properly fund health care or — if they can’t or won’t — free it.”

In 2017, he said the Fraser Institute released a report estimating that some 63,000 Canadians traveled abroad for medical care, a 40-per-cent hike from 2016.

“The rich don’t need a second tier,” Skyvington noted. “They already have one. It’s called America.”

Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland all provide universal health care, he said. Unlike Canada, none prohibits user fees or ties the funding of health care to “some kind of sick, perverse ideal of patriotism.”

Instead, each expects patients to share in the costs of health care and imposes either deductibles, co-payments or both on everyone except the poor and most vulnerable.

“If Canada’s health care system is so good, so worth fighting for and preserving, then why hasn’t anyone else copied what we’re doing?” he asked.

“The answer, my friend, is simple: Our system sucks. While we’ve been standing around for the past 50-plus years, admiring our collective navels, everyone else has been embracing not the status quo but change. Real change. Real innovation. Real solutions for an ever-evolving world.”

He hopes to make the crisis a key campaign issue this fall. “We haven’t talked about health care during an election for years. It’s high time we did. This is catastrophic. Bottom line: Either we accept this new reality and change or we’re doomed.”

Oil and gas issues figured prominently up and down the ...","× Expand Ted Wood/The Story Group Erie residents take to their horses to protest Crestone's drilling operations.

This scene has been repeated around the world; in Nigeria, Ecuador, Indonesia and elsewhere. In what economists call the “resource curse,” countries with minerals or oil are exploited by foreign powers and end up with damaged land, poisoned waters and sullied air.

In a new twist to an old tale, however, the foreign power in this case is Canada, and the indebted nation is the United States. Specifically, Boulder County, Colorado.

It began in October 2015, when the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the $368 billion behemoth that invests payroll withholding taxes from Canada’s workers on behalf of 20 million contributors, announced a $609 million USD deal to purchase all of the oil and gas assets in the Denver-Julesburg Basin owned by Canadian oil and gas giant Encana.

Many of Encana’s holdings were located in rapidly growing suburban areas near homes and schools north of Denver astride the Interstate 25 corridor between Colorado’s capital and its fourth-largest city, Fort Collins. Others were in communities that had banned hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, such as Broomfield and Boulder counties. The oil and gas industry challenged those bans, and the legal fight reached the Colorado Supreme Court as the Encana deal was being negotiated. The fracking bans were overturned, and when the dust settled, CPPIB had picked up a chunk of sub-surface Colorado real estate and wells producing approximately 30 per cent less than had been announced just months earlier.

It was moving full-steam ahead into a Colorado firestorm of opposition. With all the investments in the world available to them, why would widows in Winnipeg, retirees in Richibucto and teachers in Toronto choose to invest in Colorado’s escalating fracking wars?

× Expand Ted Wood/The Story Group Crestone's 15-well Wooley Sosa development.

TOXIC ASSETS

It may simply be that the CPPIB was willing to go where other companies wouldn’t – the pension board thought they scored a deal from a distressed seller that would yield strong long-term results for their beneficiaries.

The fact that the CPPIB created a new oil and gas company in Colorado, the CPPIB-registered Crestone Peak Resources LLC, rather than simply investing in an existing Canadian-owned one added another quizzical twist to the deal.

John Bennett, a senior policy advisor at the environmental group Friends of the Earth Canada, suggests it may be because fracking is highly controversial in Canada, where three of 10 provinces have banned the practice.

“I don’t think they would ever have invested in a fracking company in Canada,” says Bennett. “Most Canadians would be surprised to know they own a fracking oil company in Colorado.”

Denise Melanson, 70, is one such Canadian. A retired medical social worker who lives in Richibucto, New Brunswick, Melanson had been involved in passing the moratorium in the province. Melanson also receives two pensions from the CPPIB: one that she paid into during her years of employment, and the other she calls an “old-age” benefit that she started receiving when she was 65.

When she learned that some of her benefits might be coming from fracking operations in Colorado, she said in a phone interview, “I was horrified. I’d much rather not be receiving money that was earned by making other people miserable.”

Most Coloradans would also be surprised to know that Canadian pensioners are invested in drilling operations in suburban backyards.

“I have to wonder if the beneficiaries of the pension fund’s investments understand what they’re investing in,” says Boulder County Commissioner Elise Jones. As far as she knows, virtually every elected official in the county – including those from its municipalities – as well as the overwhelming majority of people who live here, oppose the kind of residential drilling plans Crestone is proposing.

Concerns range from the planned drilling around homes and schools, to negative health effects from the industrial facilities’ emissions, to the oil and gas industry’s impact on the Denver metropolitan area’s persistently poor air quality.

FOLLOWING THE MONEY

Along with its purchase of these controversial assets, Crestone was also invested in Colorado’s 2018 election.

Oil and gas issues figured prominently up and down the ballot, from the governor’s race to several ballot initiatives. And Crestone contributed $607,500 to support groups that directly or indirectly opposed Proposition 112, the failed initiative that would have required new oil and gas development to be placed at least 2,500 feet from homes and schools.

Crestone, for example, donated to the pro-industry group Protect Colorado, which campaigned to defeat 112, and other political groups backing Republican state legislature candidates that unswervingly support the oil and gas industry.

Austin Graham, legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, DC, reviewed Crestone’s contributions for their legality.

Federal law requires that foreign-owned companies’ contributions to state campaigns meet a two-part test: the contributions must be drawn from money made from U.S. operations; and the person making the decision to donate must be a U.S. citizen.

But since Crestone is a privately held, Canadian-owned company, it is not obvious where the money came from or who made the decision to contribute to the election.

Crestone states in an email that it follows all state and federal laws, and as a company operating in Colorado, “Crestone allocates a certain amount of funds each year to dedicate to organizations and initiatives that are important to our team. Crestone leadership ultimately makes the decision on which organizations these funds are donated to.”

Those organizations include “independent expenditure committees,” which are also allowed to receive contributions from foreign-owned corporations.

“Regardless of whether any laws were broken,” says Graham, the CPPIB “spent a substantial amount of money trying to influence Colorado voters.”

RESIDENTIAL IMPACTS OF OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT

Crestone has applied for a Comprehensive Drilling Plan (CDP) to move into Boulder County, but the applications for drilling permits are still awaiting approval from the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), which is slated to meet about Crestone’s CDP in late April in Boulder.

If approved, the plans will have to survive an ongoing lawsuit filed by Boulder County that a judge recently ruled must wait for the COGCC’s final approval to move forward. The company will be subject to Boulder County’s new oil and gas regulations that went into place in March 2017. A bill that would impose greater regulation upon the industry, in part by beefing up local control of drilling, may bolster Boulder County’s position. However, industry representatives have vowed to develop their mineral rights in accordance with whatever Colorado law permits.

Although Boulder County has not seen any new drilling since its ban was lifted in 2016, the impacts of residential oil and gas development are plain to see.

In Weld County, there are 21,694 active wells, according to COGCC. At the same time, new homes have been built within 120 feet of existing oil and gas facilities.

Pressure has been mounting for years around the state to put some brakes on the industry. There have been repeated fires at oil and gas sites, as well as a deadly explosion in 2017 from an abandoned pipeline located less than 200 feet from a home in Firestone, which killed two people. Recent scientific reports state that Weld County’s hydrocarbon production is sullying Boulder County’s air and contributing significantly to pollution in the Denver metro region, which has placed Colorado in the crosshairs of the Environmental Protection Agency for its worsening “non-attainment” of federal clean air standards.

WELCOME TO ""EERIE""

Perhaps no place illuminates these conflicts better than Crestone’s operations in Erie, a former farming community in Boulder and Weld counties with a population of about 2,000 that has grown to a bedroom community of about 25,000 residents today. The first citizen complaint against Crestone’s operations with the COGCC was filed just three months after the CPPIB/Encana deal was finalized.

Noise from a drilling operation smack in the middle of Erie was so loud it was “like a huge semi truck parked in our driveway,” according to one complaint. Others reported rumbling and shaking of Erie homes, pictures falling from walls and disturbing vibrations night and day for weeks on end. Dank smells emanated from the drilling sites, which were just a few hundred feet away from rows of homes, parks, schools, a skate park and even the city offices. Residents joked that their town should be renamed “Eerie.”

Monica Korber who works from her Erie home as a consultant, recalls trying to sleep while her bed was shaking through the night. Soon dozens of people were sharing stories on social media and asking what Crestone was doing to rattle their lives so viscerally. “We never got a straight answer,” Korber said.

After the rumblings stopped the project, Crestone pressed on. Soon, Erie residents were complaining at COGCC meetings and on the agency’s website about noxious smells, leaks, nosebleeds, headaches, industrial noises and lights burning all night outside their bedroom windows.

Erie’s experience with Crestone isn’t isolated. More than 1,000 complaints against Crestone’s operations were filed with the COGCC between November 2016 and February 2019 – almost twice as many as the next five oil and gas companies conducting business in Colorado combined.

Crestone spokesperson Jason Oates has repeatedly stated that residents have abused the complaint process in Erie by organizing complaining campaigns.

In its email response to my questions, Crestone’s public relations department says that, “while none of the complaints resulted in a violation of state standards by the COGCC or the CDPHE [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment], we knew we needed to make some changes in our operations. We took an above-and-beyond approach to further lessen the temporary impacts that we may have on neighbouring communities.”

One flurry of complaints came after Crestone’s operations caused a release of toxic gases at a site in Erie just 25 yards from the Aspen Ridge Preparatory School playground in September 2017. Crestone was plugging and abandoning a set of wells, and had been venting large quantities of volatile organic compounds before a resident smelled noxious fumes and complained to the COGCC. Those toxic emissions wafted directly onto the school playground of the Kiddie Academy Childcare Center and the elementary school, according to the COGCC’s report on the incident.

The COGCC ordered Crestone to cease operations until the problem was fixed, but parents say they didn’t hear about the leak for months. Mark Kadlececk, who has three children who attended Aspen Ridge, found the “Notice of Alleged Violation” posted on the COGCC website more than six weeks after the violation.

The COGCC fined Crestone $10,000, according to Mike Leonard, the agency’s community relations manager.

Christiaan van Woudenberg, one of Erie’s newly elected trustees, says that when companies like Crestone come into small communities such as Erie, dangling potential tax revenue and arguing (as Crestone spokesman Oates told a community meeting) that there are “no health impacts” from fracking, it is almost impossible not to be steamrolled. He says local elected officials are also hamstrung by state laws that limit their ability to say no to new oil and gas development.

“Erie is fracked,” van Woudenberg says. “We lost. We’re the cautionary tale.”

INVESTMENT QUESTIONS

Besides the fact that Crestone is seeking to operate in communities that oppose it, there’s a larger question for the CPPIB: is residential drilling in Colorado a smart investment?

Crestone continues to face legal challenges that are increasing the cost of doing business in Colorado. The company has been involved in lawsuits, protests, leaks and alleged violations of state regulations in multiple communities. Crestone, in turn, has sued the state and at least one other oil and gas company, alleging interference in its operations.

While Crestone is private, there are several clues that the CPPIB’s Colorado investment may be problematic. As of last month, the CPPIB’s website stated that the value of the investment had dropped to $543 million from the purchase price of $609 million.

Analysts are also divided about the future of shale development, with some predicting slow growth in 2019 and others convinced that many parts of the industry are burdened with debt and uncertainty regarding future regulatory regimes, international price fluctuations and the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy technology. Other investors remain bullish on oil stocks but are moving away from riskier investments in politically volatile countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and are looking to U.S. fracking operations as a safer alternative. Both Noble Energy and Anadarko reported record Colorado oil production in 2018.

Then there’s climate change. Canada, a signatory to the Paris climate agreement, faces some cognitive dissonance with the CPPIB’s fossil fuel portfolio. Financial and legal analysts as well as climate activists point out that Canada cannot export its fossil fuel investments and still claim it is moving to reduce its carbon footprint.

In a report released in January entitled Time To Act, Canadian law professors Janis Sarra (University of British Columbia) and Cynthia Williams (Osgoode Hall Law School at York University) conclude that, “The CPPIB has enormous potential to help shift governance practice to meet the issues discussed in this report.”

That potential has yet to be unleashed, says Williams in an interview. Canada is heavily invested in the oil and gas sector, and all recent indicators are that those investments “already have a lot of risk,” she says, partly exemplified by the drop in value of the Canadian dollar and declining returns from oil and gas investments in comparison to other sectors. “Why would the CPP double down on oil and gas developments?”

Various organizations in Canada have tried to push the CPPIB towards a more sustainable, lower-carbon portfolio, without much success, says Bennett. The CPPIB has expressly avoided committing itself to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments, stating that, “Consistent with the CPP Investment Board’s belief that constraints decrease returns and/or increase risk over time, we do not screen stocks or eliminate investments based on ESG factors. The CPP Investment Board considers the securities of any issuer all of whose businesses are lawful, and would be lawful if carried on in Canada, as eligible for investment.”

As many of the affected residents have noted, what is lawful in Colorado isn’t necessarily admirable. Many state laws were written in an earlier era of oil and gas exploration. They never anticipated new horizontal drilling and fracking techniques that allow companies like Crestone to build pads of 10, 20 and 30 wells and drill underneath hundreds of people’s homes for miles in every direction. These well pads are accompanied by rows of storage tanks, condensers, combustors and separators, as well as thousands of truck trips a day in and out of these mini-industrial complexes.

BURNING UP THE PLANET

Groups looking to aggressively address climate change are targeting pension funds around the world. As concerns resonate across the globe, investments in fossil fuel companies are increasingly seen as bad bets. Viable alternatives are emerging – with better financial rewards.

In the U.S., the divestment movement has made great strides in the past few years ever since Stanford University made headlines by selling off its coal stocks in 2014. Clara Vondrich, global director of DivestInvest – a philanthropic movement that encourages large institutional investors to move away from fossil fuels in favor of more sustainable investments – says that since 2014, more than 1,000 institutional investors have committed to fossil-free investments, with growth of capital investments rising from $52 billion to more than $8 trillion today.

Various backdated investment comparisons such as those done by the U.S. divestment advocacy group As You Sow confirm that portfolios without fossil fuel investments would have performed better than those with them. Says Vondrich: “These are underperforming assets that are also burning up the planet.” Now, she says, the CPPIB and other large investors “increasingly have a fiduciary duty to explain why they don’t divest, rather than the other way around.”

CALLING EDMONTON

At a January 2019 conference hosted by the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, Crestone’s Oates told the audience that the company had met all of the requirements laid out by the COGCC for its drilling plans, and Crestone would forge ahead into Boulder County despite resident and local governments’ objections. “It is how, not if, we are going to drill,” Oates told the audience.

Sara Loflin, executive director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans, attended the conference and was taken aback by the “arrogance” of Oates’ remarks. In response to multiple communities’ concerns ever since it started doing business in Colorado, Loflin said, Crestone has only proposed moving “closer to homes, in higher risk areas, in larger scale developments.”

In its email to this reporter, Crestone disputes this and says it aims “to operate safely, responsibly, efficiently and with minimal impact on local communities, while acting as good stewards for the land, air and water. This is a priority for us because as Coloradans, we value these natural assets, and we live here, too.”

Back in Erie, grandmother Monica Korber says that she and her neighbors suffer not just the proximity of the industrial operations, but also from the discord that they have unleashed on her community. She has joined a lawsuit against her elected officials for not doing more to protect Erie citizens.

Korber’s message to the CPPIB? “Why don’t you drill next to the homes of the people where you’re sending those retirement checks?”

Jody Wilson-Raybould recorded her conversation with the country's top mandarin less than a month before being removed as justice minister/attorney general and demoted in a cabinet shuffle. She admitted that her decision to record was inappropriate, but said that she was alone and wanted to have a record of what she anticipated would be an inappropriate conversation.



""I am just issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue,"" she is heard saying.



Wilson-Raybould's latest bombshell also reveals a strange, but false tale that a senior aide to Prime Minister Trudeau told about Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell to make their case.



You can read about it or listen to the recording yourself here.

He's back.

One of Canada’s most notorious climate deniers landed a job from Premier Doug Ford this week. Joe Oliver, former Harper cabinet minister, was appointed to the board that oversees Ontario’s electricity system.

The appointment came just one day after Oliver penned a no-holds-barred climate denial screed, published by Postmedia’s Financial Post.

Oliver claims that predictions of temperature change, ice melting and other climate impacts have failed to materialize. He cites just one scientist — a noted physicist... who died in 1988. The day after Postmedia published Oliver’s invective, the World Meteorological Association released its annual report showing “accelerating climate impacts” which have already caused an increase of many millions of people suffering from climate impacts and “displaced” from their homes.

Also in Ontario, the independent environment commissioner issued her last report (the office, along with two other watchdogs, has been axed by the Ford government). Dianne Saxe called the current situation “very frightening,” noting that both pollution and energy bills are on the upswing under the new government.

There’s never a dull week for Doug Ford. The premier also made a big splash at the country’s preeminent annual gathering for conservatives. National Observer takes you inside the Manning Networking Conference where conservatives embraced populism, raged at Trudeau, and talked separation.



In Ottawa, a progressive crowd heard from a survivor of the horrific Parkland shooting and she had a message for Canada's gun lobby: Stop behaving like the NRA.

Chrystia Freeland targets white supremacists

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland didn’t mince words at the UN Security Council, calling out white supremacism as “one of the most serious terrorist threats of the current age.”

Freeland said she felt an obligation to speak out following the attack in New Zealand:

“In the wake of acts of terrorism carried out by Muslim extremists, Western countries often call upon Muslim countries and Muslim leaders to condemn those attacks in the name of their people and their faith,"" she said.

""It should follow that, as the foreign minister of a majority white and majority Christian country, I feel a specific and personal responsibility to denounce white supremacist attacks in the same way.”

Freeland’s remarks come one day after Facebook announced it would ban support for white nationalism from its social media platforms. Last week, a far-right protest in Toronto by Patriots of Canada Against the Islamization of The West (Pegida Canada), was overshadowed by a counter-protest which stopped the anti-Muslim group from spreading its message.

[This analysis was written for the Unz Review]

The first round of the Presidential election in the Ukraine took place on April Fool’s Day and it could be tempting to dismiss it all like a big farce which, of course, it was, but, we should not overlook the fact that some very interesting and important events have just taken place. I won’t discuss them all right now, there will be plenty of time for that in the future. For now I will only focus on those elements of a much bigger picture which seem most critical to me. These elements are:

The Nazis suffered a *crushing* defeat in this election.

By “Nazis” I primarily mean their main figurehead – Petro Poroshenko (the rest of the “minor Nazis” did so poorly that they don’t matter anymore). Think of it: in spite of his immense wealth (he outspent everybody else and even spent more that twice what the next big spender – Tymoshenko – doled out for each vote), in spite of his immense “administrative resource” (that is the Russian expression for the ability to use the power of the state for your personal benefit), in spite of his “victory” with the Tomos, in spite of triggering the Kerch bridge incident, in spite of breaking all the remaining treaties with Russia, in spite of his control of the media and in spite of the (now admittedly lukewarm) support of the West, Poroshenko suffered a crushing defeat. See for yourself:

Look at the only two regions Petro Poroshenko (i.e. the Nazis) actually won (in blue) and see how nicely they overlap with the rough historical contours of the Galicia region. But Poroshenko managed to even lose part of that to Iulia Tymoshenko! Bottom line: except for a minority of rabid hardcore Nazis in Galicia, the rest of the Ukraine hates the Poroshenko Ukronazi regime. We always knew that, but now we have the proof.

Now I don’t want to present that just as some kind of massive anti-Nazi vote because, in truth, this is first and foremost a massive no-confidence vote against the entire ruling elite of the Banderastan which emerged in 2014 as a result of the Euromaidan coup d’etat. Remember how Poroshenko promised peace in weeks, a full respect for the Russian language and prosperity for all? Well, all he delivered was chaos, insecurity, poverty, violence, a massive influx of Ukronazis from Canada and the USA and, above all, a completely hysterical, rabid, russophobia combined with abject groveling before the AngloZionist Empire. He also brought an absolutely unbelievable level of corruption, having personally doubled his net worth many times over. The legacy Ziomedia and the Ukropropaganda can say all they want, and they can try to ban the Russian media and Internet in the Ukraine. But the truth is that everybody in the Ukraine knows that the Ukraine went from being the richest Soviet Republic to the poorest country in Europe. In fact, there are quite a few African countries which are doing much better than the Ukraine. The truth is, and has been for several years now, that the Ukraine is a failed state and that there is absolutely no even vaguely plausible scenario in the foreseeable future in which the Ukraine could begin to recover.

Hence this amazing result: short of the Galician Nazis, everyone else absolutely hates the regime in power. So Poroshenko’s score is a humiliating defeat for all the Ukronazis. But not for Petro Poroshenko himself!

Petro Poroshenko scores a remarkable personal victory

Poroshenko’s absolutely vital goal was to make it into the 2nd round. Had he failed to make it he would have had to immediately jump into an aircraft and leave the country (because the most likely victor of the Presidential election would have been Iulia Tymoshenko and we can be darn sure that she would immediately jail him and most of his cronies). In order to make it into the 2nd round, Poroshenko did not have to defeat Zelenskii, but only defeat Tymoshenko and that Poroshenko also succeeded in doing. Oh sure – it was thanks to a huge, massive fraud all over the country (especially in the easternmost and westernmost regions) and he beat her only by 2.5% but that is more than enough.

Besides, it is practically impossible to falsify an election and compensate for, say, a 15%-20% difference. But to cheat and change a result by less than 5% is much more doable. In fact, if we assume that a 5% fraud is well within the means of an outgoing President and billionaire, then we can also see that we will never know who really won. See here for an almost finished (99.68%) count for the top four contenders:

While Zelenskii is untouchable and way ahead of everybody else, Poroshenko, Tymoshenko and Boiko are all within less than 5% of each other.

Interesting, no?

Keep in mind that Boiko is the closest thing to a pro-Russian candidate and that just a few years ago he was virtually unknown. See for yourself:

Look at the stats for 2014: Poroshenko had 55% of the vote, Tymoshenko 8% and Boiko just about 0%. Please also notice that in the 2018 poll Tymoshenko is way ahead of Poroshenko while Boiko is not far behind. As for Zelenskii, he scores just like Poroshenko.

[Sidebar: this is not today’s topic, but Boyko’s score is rather amazing considering that he was presented by the entire Ukronazi propaganda machine as “Putin’s agent” and that he even had the audacity to travel to Moscow to meet with Gazprom CEO Miller and Prime Minister Medvedev. Boiko not only won as many regions as Poroshenko – 2 – but the eastern Ukraine clearly voted for him, which tells us all we need to know about where the true sympathies of the people of the Donbass really are. In fact, we can be pretty sure that this outcome has been carefully noted in Donetsk and Lugansk and that this only makes the position of the Novorussians vis-à-vis Kiev even stronger. Finally, it should also be noted here that the outcome of this first round of elections further confirms that the current Banderastan is falling apart and that this is an artificial country with artificial borders and no heritage (cultural, linguistic, religious or political) common to all the people currently living under the Nazi occupation.]

What we see here is a double effort by Poroshenko: on one hand he used his immense personal wealth and his equally immense “administrative resource” to buy as many votes as possible, while on the other hand he got the missing votes simply by falsifying the election. In fact, I think that pretty much all the main candidates agree that the election was stolen, except for the two who benefited from this.

[Sidebar: we will never know for sure how much of the votes were stolen but Rostislav Ishchenko, probably currently the best expert on the Ukraine, estimates that no less than 20% of the votes were stolen, and of these no less than 10% were stolen from Iulia Tymoshenko. Of course, this is just his best guesstimate, and 20% sounds extremely high to me, but he is the expert with deep connections on all levels in the Ukraine. What is certain – and everybody agrees on that – is that the fraud was massive, way bigger than in any previous Ukrainian election]

Will the Zionists replace the Nazis next?

First, I want to share with you this ecstatic “victory speech” by the The Tablet Magazine (“daily online magazine of Jewish news, ideas, and culture“) which, amongst many other interesting things, heaps lavish praise on Poroshenko for being so staunchly pious about the memory of the “Holocaust” and having Jewish aides:

Poroshenko will likely be remembered by the history books as the president who was most attentive to the work of honoring Holocaust memory since Ukraine gained its independence from Russia during the collapse of the Soviet Union. The 75th anniversary of the Babi Yar massacre, held in 2016, was an international event conducted by Poroshenko and his administration with immense tact and generosity. Poroshenko has also been personally comfortable with Jewish aides, including both of his chiefs of staff and the country’s current prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman.

Poroshenko has also been personally comfortable with Jewish aides, including both of his chiefs of staff and the country’s current prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman.

Amazing, no? Zionist praise for a Nazi junta leader? In fact, there is absolutely nothing amazing about that at all, not any more amazing than the so-called “Christians United For Israel“. I have always maintained that Zionism and National-Socialism are two sides of the same coin, born from the same ugly womb (European secular nationalism) and that all that separates them is a flipped hierarchical scale, that’s all. Fundamentally, Nazis and Zionists are twin brothers, even if deep down they hate (and often admire!) each other.

The Tablet article goes on to mention that while Tymoshenko is hiding her Jewish roots, Zelenskii does not. In fact, Zelenskii is just a glorified puppet and everybody in the Ukraine knows that his puppet-master is Igor Kolomoiskii who is waiting out the final outcome of the Presidential election safely hidden in, you guessed it, Israel. This is how the Tablet concludes:

The transformation wrought in Ukraine by the Maidan revolution has been an exhilarating roller coaster that has not bypassed Ukrainian Jewry, which is now in the midst of an exciting period of cultural revival paralleling that of the wider Ukrainian society, which is still just beginning to rediscover its own past and imagine an independent future. Whether this post-Soviet country will choose to elect an openly Jewish president, or a part-Jewish president, or continue with its current philo-Semitic president, the future of Ukraine’s Jews would appear to be brighter than anyone might reasonably have imagined.

This really says it all, doesn’t it?

So yes, if Zelenskii gets elected in the 2nd round, this will be a huge victory for the transnational “Grand Israel” otherwise known as the AngloZionist Empire. But can Zelenskii really get elected and will the Nazis accept defeat?

Comparing Poroshenko and Zelenskii

Where Poroshenko was the ultimate apparatchik Zelenskii is the ultimate outsider and just as the people of the USA did not vote “for” Trump as much as they voted “against” Hillary, so the people of the Ukraine did not really vote “for” Zelenskii, but “against” Poroshenko. In fact, Zelenskii does not have anything resembling a political program (only vague and nice sounding slogans) and he most certainly has no other political record other than being a standup comedian and actors in several (pretty good) satirical series. Frankly, it appears that Zelenskii was as stunned by his victory as Trump was by his. Still, in theory, it is almost impossible for Poroshenko to win this one. Not only do all the other candidates hate Poroshenko way more than they would dislike Zelenskii, voters for Tymoshenko or Boiko are far more likely to vote for Zelenskii than for Poroshenko.

This creates an extremely dangerous situation: Poroshenko can only win by a massive fraud.

Now Tymoshenko did declare that the first round was stolen, but she decided not to appeal this officially. Furthermore, it is now apparent that Tymoshenko was ditched by most of her US supporters, something which she clearly did not expect and which came as a total shock to her, hence her stunned reaction to the announced figures. She has always been, and still is, a remarkably intelligent lady and a very calculating realist: she simply knows that an official rejection of the outcome from her would make no difference. But you can be sure that behind the scenes the interests Tymoshenko represents are now talking to the people of Kolomoiskii and that Poroshenko is fully aware of that.

In spite of being the most universally hated politician in the Ukraine, Poroshenko managed, in extremis, not only to get into the 2nd round but he also managed to be opposed by a weak and generally ridiculous opponent like Zelenskii whom he would crush in a debate (which Zelenskii will probably refuse precisely for this reason) rather than against a formidable opponent by any measure like Tymoshenko. So that part of the plan worked. What did not work is that the Nazis clearly under-estimated how hated they have become.

Conclusion: a very interesting and very dangerous situation

Poroshenko is now truly cornered: he absolutely must win, or he must run. In order to win, his options are very limited: he can do more of the same (buy and/or steal votes), of course, but that is unlikely to be sufficient. But a massive crisis of some kind, preferably against Russia (of course!) would come in really handy right now. I hope that the Kremlin has placed everybody on high alert as the danger of a provocation (especially a false flag) are higher than ever before.

Another very real possibility in case of a Zelenskii victory is an violent insurrection by the Ukronazi death-squads (known as “dobrobats” in Ukrainian). Such an armed insurrection could have the support of key units and individuals in the police and security forces. Should that happen, it is very possible that Moscow would officially refuse to deal with the new junta and declare that Russia recognizes the Lugansk and Donetsk people’s republics which, paradoxically, could be a great deal for the Ukronazis as this would trigger a crisis serious enough to justify martial law and any imaginable crackdown in civil and human rights.

Alternatively, if Poroshenko comes up with some kind of pretext to either cancel the 2nd round or with some trick to prevent Zelenskii from participating, then there is a very real risk that the 80%+ of people who voted against Poroshenko and who hate the current regime with all their heart will protest, possibly violently. We can be sure that the repression will be ruthless and violent.

For all these reasons the situation right now is the most dangerous one since the Euromaidan.

The key issue here is what will the AngloZionist Empire decide? The problem here is that it has been years since the USA has had anything even vaguely resembling a “US foreign policy”. Under Obama and, even more so under Mr MAGA, the State Department has become just a public information agency whose sole role is to deliver either sanctions, or threats, or both. This is absolutely crucial so I will repeat it:

==>>There is no such thing as a “US foreign policy”<<==

What we do see is key agencies, actors, individuals all having their own “mini foreign policies” which sometimes brings about goofy results (like when the CIA and the Pentagon support different sides in a conflict). In fact, the two main branches of Ukrainian politics – Nazis and Zionists – are both richly represented in the US government and various entities support different candidates and different agendas. The same is also true for the EU, but since the EU is almost irrelevant (Victoria Nuland was quite right about that), this does not matter.

It would be an exaggeration to say that the US lost control of the Ukraine, but Trump clearly cares very little about the Ukronazis and as for Trump’s puppet masters, they don’t seem to be able to agree on a single policy towards this issue. Hence we see in the Ukraine what we see everywhere in Trump’s pretend foreign policy: absolute, total chaos.

What about Russia in all this?

Right now the big debate in Russia is “to recognize the outcome of this election or not?”. Both sides have very strong arguments and the Kremlin keeps making very vague statements clearly waiting for the outcome of the 2nd round of the election. This is a very tricky question made even more complex by a growing realization amongst many observers that recognizing the Poroshenko regime the first time around was a big mistake. Personally, it seems to me that at this point in time all the Kremlin can do is wait and see what will take place. After all, Poroshenko is truly cornered and there is a high likelihood that he will do something dramatic to avoid a 2nd round of voting. Consider this:

The infamous Minister of the Interior, Arsen Avakov, arguably currently the most powerful and dangerous man in the Ukraine, has made an most interesting statement about Zelenskii:

“A decent man from another world. From another plane. Ready to deal with problems, but at the same time recognizing that in many issues he is not fully competent. In my understanding, this means that he is ready to delegate authority. However, the question arises: can we – Ukrainian society – offer the quality of the elite, which can be entrusted with the implementation of such powers? After all, if he delegates authority to scoundrels – as it happens in some series of “Servants of the people” – it will be very bad for the country. Using expats is also not an option…”(…) “He knows for sure that from point A it is necessary to come to point B, and I am ready to agree with it. But the problem is how to go this way. Often, if you go head-on, you will crash into a wall or break. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the right path – and here should work competent and honest specialists”

In plain English this simply means: Zelenskii has no personal power base, he will be a puppet, so he better offer me a good deal (“delegate authority“), or I will turn against him and, how knows, an unpredictable accident (“you will crash into a wall or break“) can easily happen. Shocking? Welcome to “Ukrainian thug politics”! Besides, if the Nazis decide to kill Zelenskii they can easily blame it on Russia. Either that, or on a “lone, deranged, gunman” which they can find in the thousands amongst the various Nazi death-squads.

Right now the Nazis are in a total panic, they are declaring that Zelenskii’s victory is “Moscow’s triumph”, they say that Zelenskii will sell out everything Ukrainian and that he is a Putin agent. At the very least, they will now dig up as much dirt on Zelenskii as possible (whether real or manufactured). Thus literally anything can happen in the next couple of weeks, ranging from some kind of scandal in Zelenskii’s past to a Ukronazi attack on the Donbass.

This is why the Kremlin must now wait and see what happens next.

However, since in practical and political terms the difference between Poroshenko and Zelenskii is roughly the difference between Coca-Cola and Pepi-Cola, the Kremlin knows that no matter who actually wins, the russophobic policies of the current Ukronazi regime will not change. Furthermore, there is a increasingly vocal segment of the Russian public opinion which is totally fed-up and disgusted with the Ukronazis and which now demands a much tougher stance towards the Ukraine.

In truth, there is a broader unfavorable context which makes a redefinition of Russia’s policies towards her neighbors both urgently needed and very delicate: two key Russian allies (or “assumed allies”?) like Belarus and Kazakhstan are acting in very ambiguous and sometimes even anti-Russian manner and there is clearly a renewed effort of the Empire to break these two countries out of the Russian sphere of influence and subordinated them to AngloZionist interests. Right now the Kremlin is trying to appease Lukashenko by giving him even more money ($600 million) and I am not so sure that this is the right approach. As for Kazakhstan, so far the Russians are pretending that all is well and dandy in spite of the fact that an increasing number of ethnic Russians are, again, leaving the country and seeking refuge in Russia. Frankly, there is only that much one can get with carrots, and holding a visible stick might be more helpful in this case, especially considering that the Empire has many more “carrots” (money) to offer than Russia.

If insanity is doing the same thing expecting different results, it is time for the Russians to come up with new policies towards their most important neighbors. If not, then “more of the same, only worse” is all Russia will get.

As for the Empire, it does what it always does

Finally, I want to conclude here by focusing on the absolutely despicable, revolting and totally hypocritical self-induced blindness of the West about this election. If all this had happened in Russia (or Venezuela, or Iran) the entire united West would be up in arms denouncing the ‘stolen election’ and threatening fire and brimstone if the Russians did not immediately fall on their knees and kiss the Emperor’s ring (I wonder what kind of ring, if any, Trump has) or something to that effect. But since the toxic regime of Ukronazis cum Zionists in Kiev is “our son of a bitch”, the leaders of the Empire are acting like the three monkeys: see nothing, hear nothing and, above all, say nothing.

Truly, the AngloZionist Empire must be the most hypocritical and dishonest in world history. Think of it:

Pretty much all the candidates have declared that this election was stolen. As did all the Ukrainian media not controlled by Poroshenko. Not only that, but millions (some estimates are as high as 10 million) of Ukrainians (mostly, but not only, aboard) were prevented from voting. Thousands of complaints were officially lodged. But no, the global West did not notice. As for the US, it declared this election free and fair (now there is a surprise!).

At the very least, the Empire could have made a (very credible) “Guaido” out of Tymoshenko (who clearly should have been either first or second), but she was ditched, probably as way too smart and too potentially independent minded: the Empire likes its puppet to be stupid, or drunk, or both (think Eltsin or Poroshenko here). Having to chose between two non-entities like Zelenskiii or Poroshenko is much preferable for the Neocons than to have to deal with a smart women like Tymoshenko and, thus, no amount of russophobia on her part will be sufficient to reassure the World Hegemon that she is worth preserving.

There are such manufacturers.

A corrected version of the story is below:

Miramar, Florida, mayor declares Democratic presidential bid

A mayor you have never heard of is running for president — and believes he has a shot. Florida Democrat Wayne Messam announced his candidacy on Thursday

By TERRY SPENCER

Associated Press

Unless you are a Florida State University football fan, chances are you have never heard of the newest Democratic candidate for president — but Wayne Messam is hoping to quickly change that.

The mayor of Miramar, Florida, Messam announced Thursday that he is joining the crowded field seeking to unseat President Donald Trump in next year’s election.

Messam, who played for the Seminoles in the 1990s, believes Miramar has much that the rest of the United States would like to have — environmentally-friendly development, high-end manufacturing and major corporate operations.

The 44-year-old construction company owner also knows why pundits say he won’t win: low name recognition and funding; no sitting mayor has ever won the presidency; his lack of political experience and more.

But he is quick to respond with why he can.

Why does he have to be governor or a senator first? Trump wasn’t.

Who says mayors don’t have the necessary experience? Messam says he deals with infrastructure and business needs on a micro level in his Fort Lauderdale suburb in ways governors and senators don’t. Most politicians also haven’t run a small business for 20 years, he says, learning how to balance government regulations needed to protect the environment while allowing room for companies to prosper.

Messam also points out he is the only candidate from battleground Florida and the strategically important Deep South and his positions align with liberal voters. He favours universal health care, student loan forgiveness, infrastructure improvements, working to alleviate climate change and focusing education toward a high-tech future. He would repeal Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy to pay for it. He also would ban military-style rifles and tighten background checks for gun purchases.

“When people get elected into Washington with no local government experience, they are so high in the stratosphere that they have no concept, no consciousness of some of the local challenges that cities and communities face. And America is basically a network of cities and communities,” Messam said.

Miramar, with 140,000 residents, is larger than the city of the more attention-getting mayor eyeing the race, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. And while South Bend, population 103,000, is known for the University of Notre Dame, Miramar holds the headquarters of Spirit Airlines and has satellite operations for Carnival and Royal Caribbean cruise lines and American Express.

Messam said the United States needs an economic plan that emphasizes educating adults and children to thrive amid ever-increasing automation, and one that better competes internationally.

“China just released a manifesto, a 50-year plan about their dominance and how the world is going to need China’s exceptionalism and greatness and leadership. Where is our plan?” Messam said this week while cruising Miramar in his Cadillac Escalade.

Andy Oxenhorn, the president of JL Audio, said his 570-employee company manufacturers its high-end audio speakers in Miramar because Messam has maintained policies that predate the mayor, who was recently re-elected to a second four-year term. He said Messam, because of his proximity, understands the damage Trump’s tariffs are causing his company, which now pays a 10-per cent tax on imported parts.

“He is business-friendly, he has people working for him who are encouraging to our business and are not putting up obstacles to us getting the job done,” Oxenhorn said.

Messam grew up in South Bay, an agricultural town of 3,500 adjoining Lake Okeechobee. His parents emigrated from Jamaica — his father cut sugar cane before becoming a farm mechanic. His mother was a cook and housekeeper. He starred at Glades Central High, a football powerhouse, before coach Bobby Bowden recruited him to Florida State.

A wide receiver, he played on the Seminoles’ 1993 national championship team and had six catches for 103 yards in their 1996 Orange Bowl win over Notre Dame. After graduating with a degree in management information systems, he and his wife, Angela, started Messam Construction, which focuses on energy-efficient schools and government projects. They have three children in college.

His strategist, Phillip Thompson, believes Messam’s story will resonate in South Carolina, a key early primary state the campaign is focusing on to create momentum elsewhere. The Democratic electorate is 60 per cent African-American, much of the state is rural, college football is king and Messam is visiting the state frequently, courting local party officials.

If Messam gets traction there, Thompson believes, he will qualify for the party’s televised debates, putting him in front of a national audience.

Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina Democratic strategist not aligned with any campaign, said Messam faces tough competition in the state. Sens. Corey Booker and Kamala Harris, both African-Americans, are popular, as are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Buttigieg is working South Carolina hard.

“I don’t know what group his supporters would be,” Seawright said. “I’ve learned never to count anyone out because you’ll learn you can’t count, but he faces challenges.”",Correction: Election 2020-Florida Mayor story,Leader-Post,https://leaderpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/correction-election-2020-florida-mayor-story/wcm/71063efe-dff2-43a4-a743-5df02667a99b

The monthly Business Barometer index, by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, increased by 1.8 points in the province but Alberta business owners remain the least confident in the country.

“With a provincial election in full swing, Alberta’s entrepreneurs are looking for the parties to make meaningful policy commitments to help our province’s small and medium-sized business sector shake off the recession and start growing again. Having solid economic policies will be key to reinvigorating Alberta’s business confidence” said Richard Truscott, Vice-President, Alberta and BC, in a statement.

While small business confidence rose to 42.1 points in March, it continues to fall short of the national average of 55.9. The CFIB says the 65 to 75 point range (on the 100 point scale) indicates a healthy and growing economy.

The CFIB survey in Alberta also found that 11 per cent of business owners are expecting their full-time employment levels to go up in the near future, representing a two-point increase from February’s results. Also, 60 per cent expect their full time employment level to remain the same, and 29 per cent expect it to decrease.

The provincial numbers for March were: Nova Scotia (66.8), Quebec (65.3), Prince Edward Island (59.7), Ontario (59.5), New Brunswick (56.6), British Columbia (55.9), Manitoba (51.4), Saskatchewan (50.8), Newfoundland & Labrador (48.7), and Alberta (42.1).

“Small business confidence continues to disappoint. The index moved sideways, near 60, for most of 2018, but has averaged 57 so far in 2019. This subdued performance is consistent with a moderating economy and downwardly revised growth forecasts. Reinforcing this point is an easing in indicators of capacity constraints, including lower gauges of inflationary pressures and reduced incidence of labour shortages as a factor limiting production,” said Omar Abdelrahman, an economist with TD Economics.

“The resource-heavy provinces and natural resource sectors continue to weigh down on the index’s performance. With Alberta’s (oil producation) curtailment plan supporting prices in the near term, some of this weakness should be reversed. That said, confidence in the sector and the province are likely to remain weak for some time given structural issues related to market access, uncertainty related to global oil prices, and weaknesses in the outlook for some other commodities that will impact the Prairies more broadly.”

It will be the first time the plant has operated with just two shifts since 1993.

“It’s devastating,” said a visibly emotional Unifor Local 444 president Dave Cassidy at a Thursday afternoon news conference at the Turner Road union hall.

“It’s devastating for everybody.”

They go up and down, we have layoff weeks, there’s inventory adjustment and at that point there was no discussion of that at all

Cassidy and secretary-treasurer James Stewart were summoned to a meeting with Chrysler officials at 2 p.m.

“In our collective agreement they have to provide six months notice, so September of 2019 there could be, potentially, 1,500 jobs lost at Windsor Assembly Plant, going down to two shifts,” said Cassidy.

“This is not a General Motors/Oshawa issue, this is a sales and a business decision. I can tell you we are going to keep pressure on FCA … to fully utilize our facility.”

FCA Canada head of communications LouAnn Gosselin confirmed the news in an emailed statement.

“In order to better align production with global demand at its Windsor Assembly Plant, FCA notified Unifor today that it intends to return the plant to a traditional two-shift operation, beginning Sept. 30, 2019,” Gosselin wrote.

“Retirement packages will be offered to eligible employees. The Company will make every effort to place indefinitely laid off hourly employees in open full-time positions as they become available based on seniority.”

On Tuesday, FCA announced that Windsor Assembly, which currently employs 6,100 people, would be on shutdown for the weeks of April 8 and 15.

It will be the third time the plant is on shutdown this year, but Cassidy said he was blindsided by Thursday’s announcement.

“No, I had no indication,” Cassidy said.

“They announced the two-week shutdown and that’s all we knew. It’s cyclical, right? They go up and down, we have layoff weeks, there’s inventory adjustment and at that point there was no discussion of that at all. At 2 o’clock today James and I received the notice, the company asked us to come to a meeting, we went to a meeting.

“It’s so new.”

Asked about Mayor Drew Dilkens’ state of the city speech earlier this year where Dilkens stressed Windsor’s need to diversify, Cassidy became enraged.

“(Expletive) Drew,” Cassidy said.

“Seriously. Drew Dilkens, I have reached out to Drew Dilkens so many times, I have tried to bridge a gap there, the election is over, Drew Dilkens can’t take his finger off — there are two crown jewels in this city right tied to this local, Windsor Assembly Plant and Casino Windsor. Drew Dilkens needs to pay attention to this. This is devastating for the City of Windsor and I hope that Drew Dilkens might reach out to me.

“That’s it. I’m good.”

Cassidy then abruptly ended the news conference and bolted out of the union hall.

Yearly Canadian sales of the Pacifica were down 186 vehicles to 5,999 in 2018 while Caravan sales slipped by about 14,700 units to 32,253. Sales of the Pacifica in the U.S. (118,322) in 2018 were virtually unchanged. Caravan sales jumped from 125,196 in 2017 to 151,927 last year.

Within hours of the announcement provincial and federal politicians of all stripes weighed in on the news.

“In the face of this extremely disappointing announcement from Fiat Chrysler, our government will not waver in our support for the thousands of men and women that go to work in Ontario’s auto sector every day,” Premier Doug Ford said in a statement.

“I want the employees at the Windsor Assembly Plant to know that my government stands with you and your families. We will fight tooth and nail to protect the jobs of the autoworkers in Windsor.”

Ford said he will be speaking with FCA Canada president Reid Bigland and Unifor president Jerry Dias to urge them to work with him to protect those jobs.

“My message to Fiat Chrysler is this: do not make this decision based on the anti-business policies of the former government over the past 15 years,” Ford said.

“Our government is lowering taxes, lowering electricity rates and slashing red tape. There has never been a better time for auto manufacturers to invest in the Province of Ontario.”

NDP Opposition Leader Andrea Horwath urged the government to move quickly.

“We can be a world-leader in manufacturing the cars of the future for generations to come, but it won’t happen by accident,” Horwath said in a statement.

“We need the provincial government to take action to keep Ontario on the cutting edge of the auto sector. Tens of thousands of Ontario jobs in auto, auto parts and spinoff industries, are at risk if the province fails to take action.”

The federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Navdeep Bains also issued a statement.

“I am very disappointed by the news coming from the Windsor Fiat-Chrysler Automotive plant,” Bains said.

“My immediate thoughts are with the affected employees, their families and the community of Windsor. I will be travelling to Windsor tomorrow to offer our government’s unwavering support for these workers and their families, and our commitment to fight for their jobs.”

The three local NDP MPs also released a joint statement about the shift elimination.

“The prime minister and the innovation minister love to talk about innovation and a high tech economy but they have done noting to implement the national auto strategy that would ensure that Canadians actually get jobs,” said Windsor West MP and NDP Innovation, Science, Economic Development and Auto Critic Brian Masse.

“This is what abandoning manufacturing has led to. Prime Minister Trudeau campaigned on transitioning away from manufacturing and apparently he is getting his wish as workers lose their jobs.”

Issues of law and order are always ripe for political debate. But in recent years, there’s been much discussion of an increase in rural crime across the province.

In March 2018, the provincial government issued a seven-point plan, along with $10 million in funding, to mitigate rural crime.

Brooks-Medicine Hat NDP candidate Lynn MacWilliam says this plan created specialized Rural Crime Reduction Units and adds 39 new RCMP officers, 40 civilian staff and 10 prosecutors to focus on rural crime.

According to her, there’s been a 16 per cent reduction in rural crime between December 2017 and December 2018, with 480 fewer homes broken into, 3,500 fewer thefts and 1,200 fewer vehicles stolen.

“I need to stress that not every community has seen the same level of decreases and the problem won’t be solved overnight, but Rachel Notley and the RCMP have been making real progress,” said MacWilliam.

Michaela Glasgo, the UCP candidate in Brooks-Medicine Hat, says combating rural crime would be a major priority of a UCP government, pointing to their July 2018 report, “A Safer Alberta: United Conservative Strategy to Tackle the Rural Crime Crisis.”

“The recommendations contained in the report are actions that can be taken to strengthen police response capability, effectively deal with repeat offenders, improve data collection, combat court delays, improve services for victims, strengthen crime prevention efforts, and reduce property crime in rural communities,” said Glasgo.

She says a UCP government would also introduce a bill modelled after “Clare’s Law” in the U.K., which allows police to notify women if their partner has an abusive past.

According to Statistics Canada, Alberta has the third-highest rate of reported domestic violence in the country, behind Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

The riding’s Alberta Party candidate Jim Black – a former police officer – says the Alberta Party’s shadow budget includes funding for policing in rural municipalities.

“We’ve been saying this for over two years as part of our policy platform, so I think we’re ahead of the NDP in this area by a substantial margin,” he said.

Black says many rural police forces are understaffed and overwhelmed, which makes it harder to dedicate the resources necessary to effectively fight crime.

“That’s not a very pleasant position to be in, when you’re running from scene to scene. You end up chasing your tail because you don’t have enough manpower to support the community’s needs,” he said.

Todd Beasley, the independent conservative candidate for Brooks-Medicine Hat, says he wants to “re-allocate resources so we can improve the response times” for police in rural areas.

“I think we need to put law and order first, and law breakers second,” he said. “Our criminal justice system seems to have it wrong at times.”

He called it “ridiculous” that rural landowners who shoot intruders are criminally charged, the result of a “liberal law system that is protecting the criminal over protecting people in rural areas.”

Beasley says the province should pressure the federal government, which is responsible for amending the Criminal Code, to take a more “punitive” approach.

“I stand by the landowners,” said Beasley. “If you break the law, I’m not on your side. In fact, I’m your enemy.”

He said he likes the UCP’s plan, but “maybe it needs to be a little bit tougher.”

They say that instead of repaying the federal government, that money can now be reinvested in programs, wellness, governance and youth.

Chiefs from the Dehcho, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in, Sahtu, Tlicho and South Slave regions were in Detah on Tuesday to meet with Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett.

The Liberal government earmarked $1.4-billion over seven years for loan forgiveness across Canada in the 2019 federal budget.

Yellowknives Dene First Nation Chief Ernest Betsina said the decision is welcomed.

“This forgiveness grant will be provided to our future generations … and provide more opportunities that can support First Nations,” he said.

Betsina said past federal cutbacks under previous governments affected core funding, negotiations, language planning and housing.

Loan system to negotiate land claims not ‘successful’

In 2018, the federal government adopted a grant system to capture the “actual costs of self-government,” Bennett said.

The 2019 budget also sets aside $40 million over five years for First Nations to research and develop claims.

“Getting to self-government shouldn’t be based on loans anymore. People spending 20 years and then $30-million in debt to not quite get there, has just not been successful,” she said.

Negotiation on a loan basis was a hard-sell for communities, she said.

“If people don’t feel that things are fair then it’s pretty hard for them to get their communities behind them to do the work,” Bennett said.

‘Long ways to go’

Tlicho Grand Chief George Mackenzie told Bennett self-government will improve the future for young Indigenous people.

“Us in the Aboriginal world have a long ways to go yet, but we will not get there if we don’t have the federal support that we are seeking,” he said.

As the federal election approaches, Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”

“Our young people today, everywhere, are crying for help … we lack resources … we lack the funding,” he said.

Other negotiations proceeding

Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina announced that Akaitcho First Nations could have an agreement in principle this year. They have been negotiating since 1992.

Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian reminded Bennett that the Dehcho First Nations have been in talks with Canada for nearly 20 years, and negotiations are stalled over surface and subsurface resource rights.

The Dehcho First Nations want to temporarily set aside land and resources and work on issues like education and self-government, Norwegian said.

“We are trying to decide how that looks like for us. It is a struggle and we really would like to move forward, but make sure that it is on our terms, that we are moving toward self-determination,” Norwegian said.

Meanwhile, K’atl’odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel says the community is leaning toward self-government, but has concerns about keeping reserve status under the Indian Act.

“That’s really powerful to our people because we don’t want to lose that. I want you to recognize that,” she said to Bennett.

The world's top two economies themselves would be the biggest losers in the event of a 25 percent hike in duties on all trade in goods, the IMF said in a report released ahead of next week's spring meetings, to be held jointly with the World Bank.





Bilateral US-China trade could fall by up to 30 percent in the short-term as a result and by as much as 70 percent later on -- taking sizable chunks out of both countries' economies.





The 2019 spring meetings fall just as US and Chinese officials say they are in the home-stretch of negotiations to resolve their eight-month trade war, in which Beijing has put tariffs on all its US merchandise imports while Washington has slapped duties on about half of its Chinese imports -- more than $360 billion in two-way goods trade.





Citing success in the talks, US President Donald Trump has suspended plans to raise duties on a $200 billion tranche of Chinese goods to 25 percent, keeping them at the current 10 percent.





According to a range of models cited by the report, the hypothesis showed annual growth in China could be 1.5 percent lower, while such a scenario could shave as much as 0.6 percent off growth in the United States.





""The effect on China is typically larger across all models, as exports to the United States represent a larger share of the Chinese economy (than vice versa),"" the report said.





Under the scenario explored by the IMF, Canada and Mexico could ultimately benefit as they export more to the United States, making up for the shortfall in US imports from China.





And according to one model, these shifting export relations among countries would mean that, while the US trade deficit with China would fall somewhat, there would be ""no economically significant change"" in either country's overall trade balance.

WINNIPEG, March 27 (MarketsFarm) – ICE Futures canola contracts were weaker at the end of trading on Wednesday, as tensions between Canada and China has continued to weigh on values.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday he will consider sending a high-level delegation to China to discuss the ongoing situation between the two countries. His announcement came after China banned Viterra from selling canola to the country.

China took the action against Viterra yesterday in the same fashion it banned canola shipments from Richardson International earlier this month – in that Chinese authorities alleged they found hazardous pests in the shipments.

The dispute stems from the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou by Canadian authorities in December at the request of United States authorities. Meng is now facing extradition to the U.S., where she faces fraud charges.

The Canadian dollar was down at 74.57 U.S. cents by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, which provided some support.

Support also came from canola now being more competitive with other vegetable oils and improvements in the crush margins.

About 13,555 contracts were traded on Wednesday, which compares with Tuesday when approximately 24,000 contracts changed hands.

SOYBEAN futures at the Chicago Board of Trade were weaker on Wednesday.

Trade talks between the United States and China are set for Thursday and Friday in China, with a Chinese delegation travelling to the U.S. next week for further negotiations. While a final deal is still expected by the end of April, there are indications it might be delayed. U.S. President Donald Trump wants a deal completed no later than the 2020 Presidential Election, which kicks off early next year.

There are indications that tariffs the U.S. and China have imposed on each other in their trade war will not cease immediately with a final agreement. Rather, the tariffs could be gradually eliminated.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture releases two reports on March 29, its Prospective Planting report and its Grain Stocks report. Traders have been positioning themselves ahead of Friday.

The American Farm Bureau has estimated there is US$76 billion of corn and soybeans in the Mississippi and Missouri River basins that could be at risk to flooding. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has forecast unprecedented flooding this spring in those basins.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a press conference Tuesday that the pair had been expelled as the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin scandal continues.

Trudeau’s presser came minutes after Liberal MPs gathered on Parliament Hill for an emergency meeting to determine the future of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott in the party.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau said. “Earlier today, I met with caucus executive and leadership to hear the will of caucus. I met with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott to inform them of my decision.

“This has been a difficult few weeks for our government and for our Liberal team,” he continued.

“Amid the confusing and the competing narratives, Canadians rightly have had questions, and we wrestled with those questions too.”

Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould’s decision to secretly record a phone conversation with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick was “unconscionable.”

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns, and ultimately, if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team … then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

“If a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone, it’s wrong. When that politician is a cabinet minister secretly recording a public servant, it’s wrong. And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general of Canada, secretly recording the clerk of the Privy Council, it’s unconscionable.”

He said the decision to remove Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from caucus was necessary because the Liberal Party couldn’t afford infighting ahead of the federal election.

“The old Liberal Party was notorious for infighting,” said Trudeau. “My leadership was a commitment to change that.

“Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about us than them. That’s why I made the difficult decision to remove Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott from caucus.”

Trudeau’s remarks were followed by loud applause and a standing ovation from caucus.

Wilson-Raybould tweeted that she was informed of the decision just prior to Trudeau’s press conference.

“What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party,” she said.

“I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do so.”

Philpott said in a statement that it was “disheartening” that she was expelled without being given a chance to speak to caucus.

“I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the prime minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould. These accusations were coupled with public suggestions that I should be forced out of caucus,” Philpott said.

“These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

Philpott insisted that there was clear political interference into Wilson-Raybould’s work, and said her constitutional obligations compelled her to resign as president of the treasury board.

“This isn’t about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty — in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence — but to no avail.

“This also isn’t about political advantage or strategy. It is frankly absurd to suggest that I would leave one of the most senior portfolios in government for personal advancement or merely out of friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

The Conservative Party slammed Trudeau’s decision to expel Wilson-Raybould and Philpott as a “betrayal of justice.”

“Today, Liberal MPs have let Canadians know where they stand. They have chosen to condemn colleagues who spoke truth to power and to prop up a prime minister who is drowning in scandal,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement.

“The message they have sent today is clear: If you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party of Canada.

“Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them. However, in expelling Ms. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould from their caucus, they have done exactly that.”

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel criticized Trudeau for using women as “photo ops” before discarding them when they spoke out against him.

Earlier Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould sent caucus members a letter in which she defended her actions in the SNC-Lavalin affair and made a case for why she should be allowed to remain in caucus.

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” the letter read.

“In giving the advice I did and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess. I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened.”

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet over alleged political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The ensuing scandal has led to multiple resignations and damaged the party for eight weeks, with Trudeau’s approval rating dropping to record lows.

Wilson-Raybould testified before the House of Commons justice committee on Feb. 27, outlining in four explosive hours the details of what she described as a “consistent and sustained effort” to pressure her into intervening in the case by Trudeau and top political staffers.

But she was not invited back to address challenges to her testimony made during an appearance by Gerald Butts, former principal secretary to Trudeau, or in secondary appearances by Wernick or Deputy Attorney General Nathalie Drouin.

Instead, she submitted a package of material including a secretly recorded Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick that she said corroborated her testimony.

Wilson-Raybould faced criticism from her own party over her decision to secretly record her conversation with Wernick.

In the call, Wernick repeatedly asks Wilson-Raybould why she was not using all the tools at her disposal on the SNC-Lavalin case. She pushes back, saying she would not override the decision of the director of public prosecutions to pursue a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its activities in Libya.

Wernick told her Trudeau was “quite determined” on the matter and would likely “find a way to get it done one way or another.”

Members of the National Liberal Caucus

c/o Mr. Francis Scarpaleggia, M.P.

Chair, National Liberal Caucus

413 Justice Building

House of Commons

Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0A6

Dear Colleagues:

Re: Commitment to the Values, Principles, and Priorities of the Liberal Party of Canada

I am writing to all of you, members of the Liberal Caucus, to share some of my thoughts and observations about recent events and what they mean for us as a Party. I hope they are helpful to you.

There were many reasons I ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in 2015, including commitments on addressing climate change, the challenges of our criminal justice system, Indigenous reconciliation, and building an economy that supported all Canadians. For me, and I believe for our Party, all of these progressive policy commitments had underlying them a firm belief in the need for a transformation in our political culture, and the pursuit of a more responsive, representative, and less partisan approach to the governing of the country.

This commitment to a changed politics was not just about specific policies, such as proportional representation, but about every aspect of how we organize ourselves to govern, and the responsibilities. That each of us carry. We committed to break old and cynical patterns of centralizing power in the hands of a few unelected staffers, the marginalization of hundreds of Members of Parliament with expertise and insights to offer, and the practice of governing in the shadows, out of sight of Canadians. I believed we were going to uphold the highest standards that support the public interest, and not simply make choices to create partisan advantage.

As part of committing to this transformative and progressive path, we were also committing to a government and caucus that represented all Canadians. Diverse and inclusive, our Caucus was to be a microcosm of Canada — not just geographically, but demographically. Indeed, I believe we understood that to build a stronger Canada, we needed to reflect that Canada. This includes the challenges, opportunities, tensions, and insights that arise when seeking to forge a common path and understanding in a context of real diversity and difference. This is a vision that reflects the future. Young people identify in dozens of different ways before they identify with a political party – and they privilege diversity of experience, background, and belief and upholding the experiences of all, over simply following the paths laid out with those who claim hold to power.

I still believe all of these things as I know all of you do, too. I believe it is what the country needs, and I believe our collective future well-being as a country demands action on such a vision. And indeed, one of the main reasons I had no hesitation to stand up for what I believed to be right and necessary for the country since September 2018 regarding SNC-Lavalin was because of my belief in that vision.

In 2015, I believed the Liberal Party held such a vision, and I still believe the Liberals can and must advance such a vision. I do believe fundamentally that the Prime Minister also still shares this vision.

Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess. I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said.

Growing up as an Indigenous person in this country, I learned long ago the lesson that people believing what they wish about you does not, and cannot ever, make it the truth — rather than letting authority be the truth, let the truth be the authority. Indeed, if I had succumbed to interpreting the beliefs of other to be the truth, I never would have been able to push forward in the face of racism and misogyny that far too many Indigenous women, and others, still experience every day.

Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.

If indeed our caucus is to be a microcosm of the country it is about whether we are a caucus of inclusion or exclusion; of dialogue and searching for understanding or shutting out challenging views and perspectives; and ultimately of the old ways of doing business, or new ones that look to the future.

As I have stated recently to the constituents of Vancouver Granville, it has been my great privilege to serve as their Member of Parliament over the past three and a half years and to continue to have their confidence. With the support, guidance, and participation of Canadians our government has accomplished much — and, of course, there is important work yet to be done. My nomination has been confirmed and it is my intention to stand for re-election as the Liberal candidate for the 2019 federal election and continue with this work.

In private meetings Tuesday afternoon, Trudeau told the two they would be removed. The prime minister then invited media into what would normally have been a closed caucus meeting to announce the move publicly in front of a crowd of cheering Liberal MPs.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told the room. “Whether it’s taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.”

I have just been informed by the Prime Minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election. More to come… — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

Trudeau reserved particular scorn for Wilson-Raybould’s act of covertly recording a phone call with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, calling it “unconscionable.” Wilson-Raybould has said she made the extraordinary decision to record the call because she had been subjected to a lengthy campaign of political pressure to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, and wanted an “exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She submitted the recording to the Commons justice committee last week.

In his speech, Trudeau said he had tried to show “patience and understanding” with the complaints of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, but had to eject them because being in caucus comes with “rights and responsibilities.”

He pointed to the history of Liberal Party infighting, and said he had made a commitment to change that. “Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them,” he said. “Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided. We can’t afford to make that mistake. Canadians are counting on us.”

In the latter half of the speech, Trudeau pivoted to themes he plans to campaign on — such as attacking the Conservative Party over its stance on carbon pricing and climate change.

Following Trudeau’s speech, Wilson-Raybould posted on Twitter that she has no regrets, and “spoke the truth as I will continue to do.”

“What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party,” she said. She said she will take some time and talk to her supporters about what comes next.

In her own statement, Philpott lamented that she had been ejected without having a chance to address caucus, and said it is “profoundly disheartening for me, my staff and my family.”

She said the attacks on her and Wilson-Raybould have been based on “inaccuracies and falsehoods.”

“Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould’s credibility and attempt to blame her,” Philpott’s statement said.

“This isn’t about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty — in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence — but to no avail.”

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called the ejection of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott a “betrayal of justice.”

“The message they have sent today is clear: If you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party of Canada,” he said. “Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them.”

Liberals who spoke to the media after the caucus meeting said they supported Trudeau’s move. “I think that what was revealed on Friday in terms of the tape really crossed a line with most of us,” said Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett. She said smaller groups of Liberals had already discussed the matter. “I think last night at women’s caucus, today in Ontario caucus, there was a consensus that there was no trust, there was a breakdown of trust.”

Nate Erskine-Smith, a Liberal MP who has often argued for keeping diverse views in caucus, declined to speak to media after the meeting.

Earlier on Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould had sent a scathing letter to her Liberal caucus colleagues that said their choice on whether to remove her would reveal the values of the party.

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated,” said her letter, dated Apr. 2. “And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to.”

Wilson-Raybould said she acted as she did on the SNC-Lavalin file because she was trying to “protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

She has given evidence to the Commons justice committee that there was a sustained campaign by senior government officials during the fall of 2018 to pressure her into ordering a deferred prosecution for SNC-Lavalin — pressure that she resisted, warning it violated the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened,” her letter to caucus said.

Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of

In one section of her letter, Wilson-Raybould appeared to be addressing recent comments from some Liberal MPs that have attacked her motives. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, for example, has suggested she was trying to “entrap” Wernick when she recorded their conversation.

“Growing up as an Indigenous person in this country, I learned long ago the lesson that people believing what they wish about you does not, and cannot ever, make it the truth — rather than letting authority be the truth, let the truth be the authority,” the letter said. “Indeed, if I had succumbed to interpreting the beliefs of other to be the truth, I never would have been able to push forward in the face of racism and misogyny that far too many Indigenous women, and others, still experience every day.”

Wilson-Raybould said in the letter she still intended to stand as the Liberal candidate in the 2019 election. But in acknowledgement of the movement to eject her, she laid out a challenge.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up,” her letter said.

Tuesday also saw the release of additional evidence tabled at the Commons justice committee consisting of text messages between Wilson-Raybould and Gerald Butts, the former top aide to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Butts resigned over the controversy on Feb. 18.

Among the messages are exchanges between Wilson-Raybould and Butts after she was told on Jan. 7 she would be removed as justice minister and attorney general. The texts show an argument that evolved and grew increasingly hostile as the announcement of the cabinet shuffle drew near.

At first, Wilson-Raybould — who was on vacation in Bali at the time — protested the move over what it signalled for Indigenous Canadians.

“Timing of ‘pushing’ me out (which will be the perception — whether true or not) is terrible,” she wrote on Jan 8. “It will be confounding and perplexing to people. This is not about me — believe me when I say this — but this is about an approach to Indigenous Peoples…This situation is only going to deepen and I am very worried about it. I am getting texts/emails from indig leaders and B.C. etc.”

“Nobody is ‘pushing you out,’” Butts responded. “In fact, the PM has taken the extraordinary (in my experience unique) step of offering an alternative cabinet post to you.” The reference is to Wilson-Raybould turning down Trudeau’s first offer of the Indigenous services portfolio, saying she couldn’t take it given she’d spent her life opposing the Indian Act. She was made veterans affairs minister instead.

By Jan. 12, Wilson-Raybould was strongly implying she was being moved because of the SNC-Lavalin issue, though the texts don’t explicitly say so.

“For what it is worth, I feel compelled to say — one last time — that what is being proposed is a mistake — irrespective of where I am going. There is no way to fully explain this…My eyes are wide open on this shift,” she texted.

“What I know — as you must — is that there is a robust and proud record of what our government has done — through my work and that of the (Department of Justice)…I stand behind this hard work and all of my decisions and legal advice.”

Butts again defended the move. “I know this is tough but we have very good ideas to make it all work from a comms perspective,” he texted. “There’s an opportunity here for you to show people a side of yourself and your talent that you did not get as (minister of justice and attorney general).”

But Wilson-Raybould was unmoved, and accused Butts of wanting to staff the justice minister’s office with PMO aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques — both of whom had been pushing Wilson-Raybould’s office to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution. (Both Bouchard and Marques have remained in the PMO.)

“As to the ‘very good ideas’ you guys might want to consider sharing them with me,” she said. “But know I will be prepared for tomorrow. And I know why this is happening.”

The cabinet shuffle was announced on Jan. 14.

63,Politics,2019-04-04T01:00:00.0000000Z,"There’s absolutely no way that Indigenous people are going to find it within themselves to vote for the Liberal Party of Canada this time out, this October. Once again the arrogance of the ...","Indigenous leaders around B.C. say they’re frustrated and disappointed with Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government over sidelined promises, one-sided decisions and a lack of meaningful engagement.

Many of those leaders’ comments came before Vancouver Granville MP Jody Wilson-Raybould, a respected Indigenous lawyer who recently sat as Trudeau’s justice minister and attorney-general, was booted from the Liberal caucus this week.

James Hobart, the chief of the Spuzzum First Nation, said last week that there “was a lot of optimism” when the Liberal party was first elected. But several years after the party took office with a platform that promised to renew the nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Canadians, Hobart said his nation had yet to be visited by his local (Liberal) MP and its voice had yet to be heard.

“I’m thinking that people would think that somehow we are being acknowledged, that we are being interacted with and engaged in a positive way when we’re not,” Hobart said. “We were used to that kind of treatment with the (Conservative) government, but we really, really were hoping that we were going to be acknowledged this time.”

The Prime Minister’s Office issued a written statement that listed a series of recent actions the government had made, including funding increases for Indigenous Peoples and raised-water advisories on many reserves, as well as recent budget announcements like loan relief for talks and improved early learning and child care for Indigenous kids.

“We know that there is so much more to do, and that reconciliation cannot be achieved overnight after generations of discriminatory policies and neglect. We will continue to work closely with Indigenous Peoples. Reconciliation is an ongoing shared journey, and we are firmly committed to this work,” the statement read.

For Hobart, the relationship with his local MP for Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon, Jati Sidhu, factored into his frustration over the last few years. He said he felt exasperated and disrespected after many requests to meet “on neutral ground” or in his territory went unmet and after meetings elsewhere produced no tangible results other than photos for communications purposes.

“This is the longest time we’ve spent without even seeing a person in the territory,” he said. The previous MP for Hobart’s riding, Conservative MP Mark Strahl, came around several times, he said.

“It’s a hard thing sometimes to promote supporting First Nations because a lot of people have a bias sometimes and we understand that. So we’re saying let us help you help us. What do you need from us? … We’re not waiting for a handout. We’re waiting to help support an ongoing process that is a win-win for everybody,” Hobart said.

Sidhu said that every year he issues letters to all leaders in his riding — one that he said measured 350 kilometres end-to-end — to reach out with questions, comments or concerns.

“While it’s disappointing to hear some of the bands in this riding are dissatisfied with our levels of engagement, I am confident in my office’s First Nations outreach, especially in a riding so large and representing so many First Nations people,” he said in a statement.

Fred Sampson, the chief of the Siska First Nation who has served as an elected chief “for 24 years, going on 28,” said he believed First Nations people were now seeing more support from the public than from the Liberals.

“When Trudeau got in I really, really thought there was actually going to be true reconciliation that would happen with Indigenous people here in B.C., and Canada-wide. It’s certainly not looking that way anymore,” Sampson said.

For him, the government’s surprise decision to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline was the point when its relationship with First Nations “went cold.” He also pointed to a lack of legislative action on issues of importance to his nation.

“I really, really wish they would stop making promises to the Indigenous people of this country and never standing by them. I wish they would rather say, Nope, we’re not doing it.’ Then we know where we stand. And if they are going to do it, do it for real,” he said.

Patrick Michell, the chief of the Kanaka Bar Band, said he has met Sidhu several times, unlike his predecessors who he said he had never met. But he is still waiting for outcomes.

“We have this incredible opportunity to work together with Canada, but once again we seem to be swept under the rug,” he said.

Michell also cited the pipeline purchase as the moment things really went sideways.

“You can’t tell me that climate change is real and then slap a carbon tax on me, then approve (this) project. But the thing is, they still have time to say no.”

Terry Teegee, the regional chief of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, said he has seen some positive moves from the Liberal government, including in its latest budget. Yet First Nations are still waiting to see the full implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in this country, and it took a private-member’s bill from an NDP MP to get started in that direction, he said.

“I don’t think he lived up to his billing of what he was stating when he first came into office,” Teegee said of Trudeau on the day after Wilson-Raybould was turfed from caucus.

Asked whether a different party represented a better hope for First Nations in B.C., Teegee said other parties haven’t yet come forward with Indigenous platforms of their own. Now is a perfect time for that, he said. But regardless of what party gets into office, it will be implementing a “governance model that’s based on colonial doctrines and that’s always going to be a struggle for First Nations people,” he said.

Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, said the move to oust Wilson-Raybould “speaks volumes to Indigenous Peoples across this country.”

“Is this a prime minister who values his relationship with Indigenous Peoples? Is this a prime minister that supports women? Is this a prime minister who will fulfil all his promises to Indigenous Peoples, like implementing UNDRIP and the (truth and reconciliation commission) calls to action, and to respect and implement a nation-to-nation relationship?” Sayers said in a written statement.

“Trudeau already has a poor track record of keeping his promises to Indigenous Peoples and this deteriorates further any belief that he will do what he says, and how he treats Indigenous Peoples.”

Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, the head of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, spoke to Postmedia News on Tuesday, minutes after Wilson-Raybould was denied the right to run again for the Liberal party. He said he believed the Trudeau government’s reconciliation initiative was “dead in the water,” and that the wrong person was expelled. “It should have been the prime minister himself.”

When asked to ignore for a moment the Wilson-Raybould affair and to reflect on other aspects of the Liberals’s term, Phillip said the government has been “long on rhetoric and short on substance,” with “grandiose promises and commitments” that had been set aside.

“As I recall in the last federal election in 2015, there was 20 to 30 ridings that were heavily influenced by the Indigenous vote. There’s absolutely no way that Indigenous people are going to find it within themselves to vote for the Liberal Party of Canada this time out, this October. Once again the arrogance of the Liberal Party of Canada is going to cost them the next election.”

The Liberal Party of Canada issued a statement that said the prime minister and his team believe no relationship is more important to Canada than the relationship with Indigenous Peoples.

“The Liberal government is committed to a renewed relationship with Indigenous people based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.”

Hobart, when reached for further comment Thursday, said the optimist in him hoped that in a bid to put out its latest fire, the Liberals may really begin to engage with Indigenous Peoples.

OTTAWA — As federal Liberal MPs prepared to debate whether former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former health minister Jane Philpott should stay in their caucus, Wilson-Raybould wrote to them to explain her actions in the SNC-Lavalin affair and why she still wants to be a Liberal MP:

I am writing to all of you, members of the Liberal Caucus, to share some of my thoughts and observations about recent events and what they mean for us as a Party. I hope they are helpful to you.

CBC News has learned that MPs will discuss expelling the two women when they return to Parliament from their ridings next week.

Some MPs who don't want to be identified say that if the matter of the two MPs' caucus status isn't on Wednesday's caucus agenda, they'll stand up at the meeting and ask their colleagues to vote on ejecting Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

Liberal MPs from all regions of the country tell CBC News they feel the two former cabinet ministers can't stay.

""I've come to the conclusion that they both have lost any right to be a part of this team,"" Quebec MP Alexandra Mendès wrote in an email. She said serving in a party caucus requires ""loyalty and team spirit.""

Many caucus members who once said they thought Wilson-Raybould and Philpott could remain now say they don't understand how they can continue to identify as members of the Liberal Party given the damage done to the government by the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Trudeau punts on question of caucus status

At an event in Halifax yesterday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked if he thinks the two MPs should be permitted to stay.

""As for what Dr. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould intend to do as next steps, people are going to have to ask them,"" he replied.

CBC sent emails to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott; so far, neither has responded.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking an agreement that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4, saying she had lost ""confidence"" in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

Other senior Liberals have suggested that while the caucus is inclined to expel them, they feel the better option would be for Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to leave of their own accord, as did Whitby, Ont. MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes. She quit the Liberal caucus March 20 to sit as an independent.

Some Liberal MPs aren't ready to say one way or the other.

""Both of them have been great colleagues and, you know, we'll see how that evolves. But again, decision's not going to be mine. I'll be, of course, part of the caucus, but we'll just wait and see how things evolve from here,"" said New Brunswick MP Pat Finnigan.

'It would be a mistake to expel them' — MP Wayne Long

""I mean, any member who wants to stay part of the caucus has to say that they support the prime minister and, obviously, they support the Liberal agenda. We all got elected under the Liberal Party of Canada. I mean, I'll leave that question up to Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, whether or not they want to remain part of the caucus,"" said Ontario MP Francis Drouin.

Some caucus members say they still think the two MPs should be permitted to remain.

Jody Wilson-Raybould’s ouster from the federal Liberal caucus has left party members in British Columbia in limbo as they search for another candidate in Vancouver-Granville.

The party had nominated Ms. Wilson-Raybould as their candidate for the fall election. Last month, she was the centre of attention at a packed riding event where scores of supporters lined up to greet and take selfies with her and applauded her commitment to seek re-election as a Liberal.

The Globe and Mail reported in early February that officials in the Prime Minister’s Office put pressure on the former attorney-general to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She resigned from cabinet in mid-February and on Tuesday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled her from caucus along with former cabinet minister Jane Philpott.

Now, the Liberals have classed her riding as “unheld,” according to the party’s director in B.C., and the Liberals will have to field a new candidate in a riding where there seems to be a great deal of support for Ms. Wilson-Raybould.

In the 2015 election, Ms. Wilson-Raybould won the newly created riding with 44 per cent of the vote.

The stakes are high for the Liberals. They have 17 of 41 B.C. seats. The NDP have 13, the Tories have nine, the Greens one and there is Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who now sits as an independent.

University of the Fraser Valley political scientist Hamish Telford said the Liberals face losses across Canada, and will need to hold as many B.C. seats as possible to maintain their majority.

In Vancouver-Granville, Prof. Telford said that means a new Liberal candidate who can juggle defending the government over the SNC-Lavalin scandal, dealing with the damage to Mr. Trudeau’s reputation and dealing with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s candidacy if she runs for re-election as a candidate for another party or as an independent.

“I don’t envy the new candidate,” Prof. Telford said.

Gabe Garfinkel, the federal Liberals’ B.C. director, said the party is beginning to hear tentatively from prospective candidates for the party nomination. Any prospective successor for Ms. Wilson-Raybould would have to go through a nomination process or be appointed by Mr. Trudeau.

In Ottawa, Ms. Wilson-Raybould told reporters she would have to think and talk to her family and constituents before deciding what to do next politically.

Outside her constituency office on Wednesday, constituents expressed divided opinions on Ms. Wilson-Raybould.

“I don’t support the Liberals. I have never liked them, but I think she’s a good lady and if it came to it, I would support her,” said Chris Korvin, a retired doctor, describing her as honest, straightforward and decent.

As he walked by the door to the constituency office, retired coast guard diver Richard Foreman veered close and gave a thumbs up to those inside.

“I certainly want Jody to know we support her 100 per cent,” said Mr. Foreman, who voted for her in the last election. “We are supporting her in the future, whatever it holds for her.”

He said Canadians need to look beyond party labels to more closely assess the qualities of their MPs.

But Rosa Brussoni, a retired office worker, said she does not support Ms. Wilson-Raybould. “She betrayed the Liberal party,” she said, adding she would happily vote for a new Liberal candidate in Vancouver-Granville.

Greg Wilson, the president of the Vancouver-Granville riding association in 2015, said Liberals in the riding will now rally to gain the seat back.

“We’re going to lose some – the ones who came for her – but we’re also going to pick up the ones for the new candidate,” he said.

Both the NDP and the Conservatives in statements said there have been expressions of interest from prospective nominees to run for their parties.

Outside the Vancouver region, a vice-president of the Liberal riding association in Chilliwack-Hope quit in support of Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott. Louis De Jaeger said in an interview he would not run for the party in 2019 as he had in 2015, when he lost to the Conservative candidate.

Mr. De Jaeger said “backroom dealings” around SNC-Lavalin, and the move against a prominent Indigenous woman – Ms. Wilson Raybould – had shaken faith in the Prime Minister. “He’s blown it,” he said. “The party has a good shot of turning this around if they change the leader.”",Vancouver-Granville Liberals seek new candidate in the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s ouster,The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-vancouver-granville-liberals-seek-new-candidate-in-the-wake-of-wilson/

Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott have both been kicked out of the Liberal caucus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday, moments after their fellow government MPs had gathered on Parliament Hill for an emergency meeting to determine their future with the party.

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns, and ultimately, if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team … then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

The dissident MPs, both former senior cabinet ministers, risked a civil war within the Liberal party, he said. That’s how the Liberals lose power and Canada can’t afford it, he said.

“Canadians will view the removal of Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal caucus for exactly what it is: A betrayal of justice,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said. “Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them. However, in expelling Ms. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould from their caucus, they have done exactly that.”

Wilson-Raybould, whose explosive allegations of political interference by the Prime Minister’s Office appear to have deeply imperilled Liberal hopes of holding on to power in this fall’s federal election, wrote to her fellow — now former — caucus members earlier in the day in hopes of convincing them to let her stay.

But just minutes into Tuesday’s hastily convened meeting, Wilson-Raybould, who stepped down from Trudeau’s cabinet in February after he shuffled her out of the coveted justice portfolio, made it clear via Twitter that the letter hadn’t worked.

I have just been informed by the Prime Minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election. More to come… — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

“I have just been informed by the prime minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election,” she tweeted.

Minutes later, reporters and cameras were ushered into the caucus room to listen to Trudeau announce that both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were out.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told caucus members.

“It’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer be part of our Liberal team.”

The turmoil has roiled the top ranks of the Trudeau government for weeks, impelled by allegations that Wilson-Raybould was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

And it comes on the heels of a fresh uproar over a key phone conversation between the ex-minister and former Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat — a conversation Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded.

That recording was released Friday as part of her evidence of what Wilson-Raybould calls an intense pressure campaign to persuade her to override a decision to deny SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement, which would allow the engineering giant to avoid criminal proceedings on corruption and fraud charges.

In the weeks following Wilson-Raybould’s resignation, caucus had grown divided over the question of whether she and Philpott should be allowed to remain as Liberal MPs. Trudeau himself had initially suggested he would be willing to let them stay, saying repeatedly that he was reserving judgment.

But Friday’s release of Wilson-Raybould’s 17-minute phone conversation with Wernick — and the fact she recorded it — appeared to tip the scales.

“If a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone, it’s wrong. When that politician is a cabinet minister secretly recording a public servant, it’s wrong. And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general of Canada, secretly recording the clerk of the Privy Council, it’s unconscionable.”

He said he was chosen to be Liberal leader, and then prime minister, because he promised a more unifying style than the Conservatives before him.

“We won because we stood together as a team, which was, to be frank, a change from past iterations of this party. The old Liberal party was notorious for infighting. People on the same team used to identify themselves not as Liberals but as hyphenated Liberals,” he said. “Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them.”

For the sake of unity, he said, Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had to go.

Trudeau finished by swinging into a campaign speech, touting the Liberal record on the environment, the economy and minority rights.

“This is what this year’s election is about. This is what’s on the line,” he said.

In her appeal to her caucusmates, Wilson-Raybould said she rejected the prime minister’s pressure on SNC-Lavalin because she was standing up for Liberal values.

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself,” Wilson-Raybould wrote in her letter to caucus members.

“I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said.”

Toronto MP John McKay, who was unmoved by Wilson-Raybould’s letter, said he’s dismayed by her behaviour and believes she and Philpott are “joined at the hip.” Fellow MP Judy Sgro agreed the letter is “too little, too late.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne criticized Wilson-Raybould’s ethics, saying he had never recorded any conversations he had while working as a lawyer. Tourism Minister Melanie Joly called it “fundamentally wrong.”

In the call, Wernick repeatedly asked Wilson-Raybould why she was not using all the tools at her disposal on the SNC-Lavalin case. She pushes back, saying she would not override the decision of the director of public prosecutions to pursue a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its activities in Libya.

Wernick told her Trudeau was “quite determined” on the matter and would likely “find a way to get it done one way or another.”

NDP MP Jenny Kwan said Trudeau’s move Tuesday was an extension of that attitude — he’d decided he was going to get his way and threw two unco-operative women under the bus, she said.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of Justice to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene on SNC’s behalf. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

Philpott followed suit in early March, citing a loss in confidence in the government’s handling of the matter.

CTV News Vancouver





The Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs is slamming Justin Trudeau's decision to kick Jody Wilson-Raybould out of the Liberal party as a blow to Indigenous relations.

Wilson-Raybould was Canada's first Indigenous attorney general until Trudeau shuffled her out of the high-profile post in January. On Tuesday, she and fellow MP Jane Philpott were ejected from caucus altogether as the Liberals continue grappling with the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Grand Chief Stewart Philip said the UBCIC is ""absolutely disgusted"" at the move, arguing Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were punished for refusing to kowtow to political pressure.

""Apparently, this equates to being 'untrustworthy' in the shifty eyes of Justin Trudeau, who is clearly committed to propping up cronyism and the old boys' network,"" Philip said in a statement.

Kukpi7 Judy Wilson, the union's secretary treasurer, described the government's decision as ""yet another low in its treatment of Indigenous peoples.""

“Justin Trudeau’s ministerial mandate letters all claim that ‘no relationship is more important to Canada than the one with Indigenous peoples.’ This couldn’t be further from the truth.""

""We hold up our hands to Jody Wilson-Raybould for her fierce advocacy, honesty, and commitment to speak the truth and we applaud Dr. Philpott for standing up for our government’s democratic institutions and refusing to stay quiet while the Liberal Party incited a gaslighting of Wilson-Raybould to justify their own unconscionable behavior,"" she said.",Treatment of Wilson-Raybould 'another low' in Indigenous relations: UBCIC,BC CTV News,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/treatment-of-wilson-raybould-another-low-in-indigenous-relations-ubcic-1.4364153

Despite the controversial SNC Lavalin affair that has been dominating headlines, Atlantic MPs appear to continue to have faith in the party — an official Liberal party list identified 20 MPs that have been confirmed nominated, and SaltWire was able to confirm the candidacy of an additional six that are nominated, have plans to announce soon, or are on the verge of being nominated.

The only MPs that will not have their names on the ballot are long-time Nova Scotia MPs Bill Casey and Mark Eyking, one-term Nova Scotia MP Colin Fraser and one-term New Brunswick MP T.J. Harvey. Cape Breton MP Rodger Cuzner has stated publicly he is on the fence about his plans to run, and former treasury board president Scott Brison quit cabinet back in January and has since resigned his seat in order take a job in the private sector, so the Kings-Hants Liberal nomination still open.

“It’s important to remember that the Liberals swept all of Atlantic Canada at the last election. So there's certainly an incentive to run again if you’ve won the previous time,” said Dalhousie University sociology professor Howard Ramos.

Polling trends indicating a region that is still open to a Liberal federal government, and the Liberals’ movement on things like the National Shipbuilding Strategy and infrastructure are all reasons why the Atlantic Liberals are likely feeling confident, Ramos said.

Don Desserud, political science professor at the University of PEI said in many cases political parties have deep roots in certain ridings in Atlantic Canada, therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see that the Liberals have a full slate of candidates.

“I see this as basically party loyalty and something that comes with having members of the party that probably have long family roots and other reasons why they’re part of that of that team in the first place,” he said.

In Nova Scotia, however, the Liberals have suffered a major blow to their election lineup — with long-serving MPs like Casey, Brison, and Eyking out of the mix. Now Cuzner — who has spoken openly in the media about his disappointment in being left out of cabinet in the shuffle triggered by Brison’s departure — is also considering making an exit from politics.

Former Trudeau right-hand man (and Cape Breton native) Gerald Butts even expressed in his testimony to the justice committee on the SNC Lavalin affair internal concerns about the fate of the Liberals in Nova Scotia.

“I knew if the prime minister chose a minister from the class of 2015 (for cabinet, Cuzner and Eyking) could interpret that as a signal and perhaps not run again either. In short, in the span of a few months, we would go from holding all 11 seats in Nova Scotia with strong incumbents to having five of them open in the next election,” Butts told the committee.

For MPs like Cuzner that are still on the fence, Cape Breton University politics professor Tom Urbaniak said the current issues facing the Liberal party will likely be part of their considerations.

“There’s no question that there’s been an erosion of morale within the Liberal Party or for the past couple of months,” Urbaniak said.

“There’s nowhere to go but down for the Liberal Party in Atlantic Canada even though many poll numbers have still been favourable in the region.”

Meanwhile, the Conservative Party has nominated 13 candidates so far and the Green Party has six candidates, five in Nova Scotia and one in PEI.

The NDP have still only have a single candidate in place in Brison’s former riding of Kings-Hants.

“We have two nomination meetings planned so far in the month of April and several good candidates have expressed their interest in running for the NDP in the Atlantic provinces,” Guillaume Francoeur, who speaks for the NDP, said in an email. “The approval process is following its course and we are confident we will have strong candidates in every riding across the Atlantic provinces.”

Memorial University political science professor Alex Marland said he’s not wholly surprised to see a nearly blank roster as getting candidates who are willing to run for a party that has historically been third place isn’t an easy feat.

“If you’re a party that's polling third in the polls and has never formed a national government you have fewer tools to be able to invite people to run as a candidate because you say, ‘Well the chances are you’re not going to win, and there’s a good likelihood we’re not going to form government. So our ability to reward you for your time is limited as opposed to the other parties,’” he said.

Politics in Atlantic Canada is still quite neighbourly and door-knocking goes a long way, Urbaniak said. So it’s wise for the competition to have candidates on the ground good and early, especially in places that don’t have a strong incumbent.

But for the NDP, Urbaniak said he doesn’t think their lack of candidates at this point in the game is critical.

“What’s more critical is to clarify the brand. Make sure the leader is sure-footed (and establish) that comfort level between the leader and the population,” he said.

“There are many precedents for late nominated candidates doing surprisingly well because votes moves and trends happen during the period of a campaign when the public mind is really focused on the competition.”

While there’s still plenty of time before fixed October election date for parties to get their ducks in a row, there have been rumours circulating about the possibility of an early election call. But Ramos said that’s unlikely.

“I think that if (the Liberals) were to go to the polls now they wouldn’t go with their best foot forward as it seems that there’s quite a bit of division within the caucus,” he said. “I’m not holding my breath for an early election. I would expect there to be probably a fall election on course to give the summer time to reset and rebrand the message of the party.”",Federal election candidate lists taking shape in Atlantic Canada,The Chronicle Herald,https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/news/local/federal-election-candidate-lists-taking-shape-in-atlantic-canada-296815/

This is an open letter to all of you. I want to start it by telling you why I became a lawyer.

It was a movie, called The Oxbow Incident. It was a Western, released some 75 years ago, and it starred Henry Fonda. It was about how a mob hanged a man. The wrong man.

At the end, the lynch mob all gather in a bar, and Fonda reads a letter the dead man wrote to his wife. Here is some of it:

“Law is a lot more than words you put in a book, or judges or lawyers or sheriffs you hire to carry it out. It’s everything people ever have found out about justice and what’s right and wrong,” Fonda says, reading the dead man’s letter. “It’s the very conscience of humanity. There can’t be any such thing as civilization unless people have a conscience, because if people touch God anywhere, where is it except through their conscience? And what is anybody’s conscience, except a little piece of the conscience of all men that ever lived?”

That speech is why I became a lawyer. What Fonda said, in a long-ago Western. What he said about justice, and how it is the thing that makes us human.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, who I have never met, and Jane Philpott, who I have, remind me a little bit of Fonda, reading that dead man’s letter. They seem to believe, as I do, that if we do not have justice, we have not much left. They proudly gave up everything for it, after all.

After what you Liberals did, I suppose you are expecting me to liken you to a lynch mob. And, it is true: You were a bit like that.

Hell, you expelled Wilson-Raybould on the pretext of her making a tape on which a powerful man threatens her. When, a few days later, the prime minister of Canada spoke to Wilson-Raybould about why she’d been demoted — and he didn’t bother to tell her his principal secretary was secretly listening in. Keeping a record of what was said.

To use against her.

But, still, I will not call you a lynch mob. What you are, more accurately, is a group of people who belong to a cult. It is not a political party anymore. It is a cult.

It’s kind of understandable, although not ever forgivable. Justin Trudeau, to most of you, is the Liberal Party. He lifted the party from third place to first, and he propelled most of you into power. He made three big promises.

He said he’d be a feminist. He said he’d reconcile with indigenous people. And he said he’d bring back ethical government.

Well, he lied. His willingness to brutalize Wilson-Raybould, Philpott and Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes — and to cut a sweetheart deal for a sleazy donor — showed him to be none of those things. It showed him to be what this newspaper memorably called him this week: The fake feminist.

But still you follow him. Still you belong to his cult. Even when you know he has done wrong.

And so, you will end like all cults do: You will go down with your leader. You will perish with him, and you all richly deserve it.

Because voters understand — as they did at the end of The Oxbow Incident — that justice is all that keeps us from devolving into a lynch mob.

Which, as I say, you all resemble quite a bit.

And for which you will all pay.

Sincerely,

Warren",KINSELLA: Liberal Party has morphed into a cult,Toronto Sun,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/kinsella-liberal-party-has-morphed-into-a-cult

Jane Philpott, ousted from the federal Liberal party caucus today (April 2), issued the following statement on her Facebook page:

Tonight I was expelled from the caucus of the Liberal Party of Canada. Sadly the decision was made without me being provided any opportunity to speak to national caucus. This is profoundly disheartening for me, my staff and my family—and I know people in Markham-Stouffville will also be disappointed.

I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the Prime Minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould. These accusations were coupled with public suggestions that I should be forced out of caucus.

These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Rather than acknowledge the obvious—that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision—and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious—to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould’s credibility and attempt to blame her. That approach now appears to be focused on whether Jody Wilson-Raybould should have audiotaped the Clerk instead of the circumstances that prompted Jody Wilson-Raybould to feel compelled to do so.

I was not able to support the recommended response to deny these allegations. My constitutional obligations including Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility compelled me to resign as a Cabinet member under these circumstances.

This isn’t about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty—in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence—but to no avail.

This also isn’t about political advantage or strategy. It is frankly absurd to suggest that I would leave one of the most senior portfolios in government for personal advancement or merely out of friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould.

I have also been criticized for not telling my complete story in Parliament because I would be shielded by Parliamentary immunity. Much of the story has now been told by Jody Wilson-Raybould as a result of the additional information she provided to the Justice Committee. Anything else is covered by Cabinet privilege that has not been waived. It would be irresponsible for me to breach Cabinet privilege simply because I could do so without being prosecuted for the breach. Parliamentary privilege is not designed as a licence for breaching your constitutional and ethical obligations.

Throughout these events, I have continued to support Liberal policies and the commitments we made. As a member of Cabinet, I would have been compelled to support in Question Period and in the media the government’s response to the SNC-Lavalin case and speak in support of that response. I could not do this and as a result, I was compelled to resign. I thought there should be scope within the caucus and the party for a range of views on the SNC-Lavalin case including the views I expressed directly to the Prime Minister. Indeed, the need has never been greater for a measured re-evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue. What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth.

That being said, it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences to the party and to the country, and it has been decided that there is no place for me in the caucus.

I regret that relationships have been so fractured. I have nothing but good wishes for my former Liberal colleagues and all those who commit themselves to public service.

I ran to be a Member of Parliament for the purpose of improving people’s lives. Nothing will stop me from continuing in that pursuit. I will continue to proudly represent the people of Markham-Stouffville for the remainder of this term.",Jane Philpott posts Facebook statement after ouster from Liberal caucus,The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1222801/jane-philpott-posts-facebook-statement-after-ouster-liberal-caucus

The Poll Tracker ...,"Atlantic Canada was where the first domino of the SNC-Lavalin affair toppled in public — when Nova Scotia cabinet minister Scott Brison decided to resign his post. It's also where the Liberals have taken the biggest hit from the scandal's fallout.

What was once the party's most formidable electoral stronghold has now become one of its key regions of vulnerability.

According to the testimony of Gerald Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, the plan to replace Brison as president of the Treasury Board was supposed to be simple and tidy. Jane Philpott would go from Indigenous Services to Treasury Board and Jody Wilson-Raybould would take Philpott's place. David Lametti would be promoted into the justice portfolio vacated by Wilson-Raybould.

It didn't quite work out as planned.

The CBC's Canada Poll Tracker has recorded a six-point drop in Liberal support nationwide in the wake of the controversy surrounding Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet — but the party has fallen even further in Atlantic Canada.

The Poll Tracker estimates the Liberals are down to 37 per cent support in the region, just 2.5 points ahead of the Conservatives.

That's a 12-point drop from where the party stood on Feb. 5 — a few days before the Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources, first reported that Wilson-Raybould was pushed by senior people in the Trudeau government to allow the Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges by meeting a number of conditions laid out in a remediation agreement.

Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press More

That slide is twice as big as any drop the Liberals have suffered in other regions of the country and has been registered by every polling firm in the field over the last few weeks.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also has taken a bigger personal hit in Atlantic Canada than in the rest of the country. His approval rating in Atlantic Canada has averaged 32 per cent in three recent polls by three different polling firms. Those same three firms found Trudeau's approval rating averaging 46 per cent in Atlantic Canada in November and December.

Trudeau and the Liberals certainly had more ground to give up in Atlantic Canada than they did elsewhere. The party swept all 32 of the region's seats and beat the Conservatives by a margin of 40 points there in the 2015 federal election.

But the party has now gone from being 19 percentage points more popular in Atlantic Canada than in the country as a whole to just five points more popular there than nationwide. About one in four Atlantic Canadians who supported the Liberals at the beginning of February have since abandoned them. Nowhere else have the Liberals lost more than a fifth of their support.

It has a real impact on the Liberals' chances of holding their seats in the region.

The Liberal sweep could be swept aside

When Butts testified at the justice committee last month, he talked about the electoral conundrum that Brison's departure created for the Liberals.

""Not to give away a political strategy in this forum,"" he said, ""but my main political concern was our position in Nova Scotia.""

Butts was worried that with Brison gone — and with a few other Nova Scotia Liberals already at risk of not running for re-election in the fall, particularly if they weren't given a promotion to replace Brison — the party would be without incumbents in five of their 11 seats in the province, leaving those seats vulnerable.

""Tonight I was expelled from the caucus of the Liberal Party of Canada. Sadly the decision was made without me being provided any opportunity to speak to national caucus. This is profoundly disheartening for me, my staff and my family - and I know people in Markham-Stouffville will also be disappointed.

""I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the Prime Minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould. These accusations were coupled with public suggestions that I should be forced out of caucus.

""These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.

""Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould's credibility and attempt to blame her. That approach now appears to be focused on whether Jody Wilson-Raybould should have audiotaped the Clerk instead of the circumstances that prompted Jody Wilson-Raybould to feel compelled to do so.

""I was not able to support the recommended response to deny these allegations. My constitutional obligations including Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility compelled me to resign as a Cabinet member under these circumstances.

""This isn't about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty — in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence — but to no avail.

""This also isn't about political advantage or strategy. It is frankly absurd to suggest that I would leave one of the most senior portfolios in government for personal advancement or merely out of friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould.

""I have also been criticized for not telling my complete story in Parliament because I would be shielded by Parliamentary immunity. Much of the story has now been told by Jody Wilson-Raybould as a result of the additional information she provided to the Justice Committee. Anything else is covered by Cabinet privilege that has not been waived. It would be irresponsible for me to breach Cabinet privilege simply because I could do so without being prosecuted for the breach. Parliamentary privilege is not designed as a licence for breaching your constitutional and ethical obligations.

""Throughout these events, I have continued to support Liberal policies and the commitments we made. As a member of Cabinet, I would have been compelled to support in Question Period and in the media the government's response to the SNC-Lavalin case and speak in support of that response. I could not do this and as a result, I was compelled to resign. I thought there should be scope within the caucus and the party for a range of views on the SNC-Lavalin case including the views I expressed directly to the Prime Minister. Indeed, the need has never been greater for a measured re-evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue. What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth.

""That being said, it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences to the party and to the country, and it has been decided that there is no place for me in the caucus.

""I regret that relationships have been so fractured. I have nothing but good wishes for my former Liberal colleagues and all those who commit themselves to public service.

That’s how the Liberals lose power and Canada can’t afford it, he said.","'The trust … has been broken': It’s the latest twist in the turmoil that has roiled the top ranks of the Trudeau government for weeks

OTTAWA — Vancouver MP Jody Wilson-Raybould and Toronto area MP Jane Philpott have both been kicked out of the Liberal caucus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday, moments after their fellow government members of Parliament had gathered on Parliament Hill for an emergency meeting to determine their future with the party.

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns, and ultimately, if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team … then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

The dissident MPs, both former senior cabinet ministers, risked a civil war within the Liberal party, he said. That’s how the Liberals lose power and Canada can’t afford it, he said.

“Canadians will view the removal of Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal caucus for exactly what it is: A betrayal of justice,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said. “Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them. However, in expelling Ms. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould from their caucus, they have done exactly that.”

Wilson-Raybould, whose explosive allegations of political interference by the Prime Minister’s Office appear to have deeply imperilled Liberal hopes of holding on to power in this fall’s federal election, wrote to her fellow — now former — caucus members earlier in the day in hopes of convincing them to let her stay.

But just minutes into Tuesday’s hastily convened meeting, the Vancouver Granville MP, who stepped down from Trudeau’s cabinet in February after he shuffled her out of the coveted justice portfolio, made it clear via Twitter that the letter hadn’t worked.

“I have just been informed by the prime minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election,” she tweeted.

Minutes later, reporters and cameras were ushered into the caucus room to listen to Trudeau announce that both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were out.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told caucus members.

“It’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer be part of our Liberal team.”

Reflecting on what PM has done, my thoughts are w/ my constituents in #VanGran, my dedicated staff & volunteers, my family & friends & all Canadians who believed in a new way of doing politics. I will take the time to reflect & talk to my supporters about what happens next. (1/2) — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

The turmoil has roiled the top ranks of the Trudeau government for weeks, impelled by allegations that Wilson-Raybould was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

And it comes on the heels of a fresh uproar over a key phone conversation between the ex-minister and former Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat — a conversation Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded.

That recording was released Friday as part of her evidence of what Wilson-Raybould calls an intense pressure campaign to persuade her to override a decision to deny SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement, which would allow the engineering giant to avoid criminal proceedings on corruption and fraud charges.

In the weeks following Wilson-Raybould’s resignation, caucus had grown divided over the question of whether she and Philpott should be allowed to remain as Liberal MPs. Trudeau himself had initially suggested he would be willing to let them stay, saying repeatedly that he was reserving judgment.

But Friday’s release of Wilson-Raybould’s 17-minute phone conversation with Wernick — and the fact she recorded it — appeared to tip the scales.

“If a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone, it’s wrong. When that politician is a cabinet minister secretly recording a public servant, it’s wrong. And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general of Canada, secretly recording the clerk of the Privy Council, it’s unconscionable.”

He said he was chosen to be Liberal leader, and then prime minister, because he promised a more unifying style than the Conservatives before him.

“We won because we stood together as a team, which was, to be frank, a change from past iterations of this party. The old Liberal party was notorious for infighting. People on the same team used to identify themselves not as Liberals but as hyphenated Liberals,” he said. “Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them.”

For the sake of unity, he said, Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had to go.

Trudeau finished by swinging into a campaign speech, touting the Liberal record on the environment, the economy and minority rights.

“This is what this year’s election is about. This is what’s on the line,” he said.

In her appeal to her caucus mates, Wilson-Raybould said she rejected the prime minister’s pressure on SNC-Lavalin because she was standing up for Liberal values.

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself,” Wilson-Raybould wrote in her letter to caucus members.

“I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said.”

Toronto MP John McKay, who was unmoved by Wilson-Raybould’s letter, said he’s dismayed by her behaviour and believes she and Philpott are “joined at the hip.” Fellow MP Judy Sgro agreed the letter is “too little, too late.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne criticized Wilson-Raybould’s ethics, saying he had never recorded any conversations he had while working as a lawyer. Tourism Minister Melanie Joly called it “fundamentally wrong.”

In the call, Wernick repeatedly asked Wilson-Raybould why she was not using all the tools at her disposal on the SNC-Lavalin case. She pushes back, saying she would not override the decision of the director of public prosecutions to pursue a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its activities in Libya.

Wernick told her Trudeau was “quite determined” on the matter and would likely “find a way to get it done one way or another.”

NDP MP Jenny Kwan said Trudeau’s move Tuesday was an extension of that attitude — he’d decided he was going to get his way and threw two unco-operative women under the bus, she said.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of Justice to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene on SNC’s behalf. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

Philpott followed suit in early March, citing a loss in confidence in the government’s handling of the matter.

Trudeau told an emergency meeting of legislators on Tuesday that former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott had undermined the party and betrayed its trust.

The almost two-month old scandal centered on Wilson-Raybould, who in February said officials had inappropriately pressured her while she was justice minister to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc would escape a corruption trial.

In recent weeks, senior party figures and lawmakers had grown frustrated with Trudeau’s handling of the crisis, especially since both former ministers remained in the caucus despite their open hostility.

A long list of ministers and Liberal parliamentarians echoed Trudeau’s emphasis on party unity on Wednesday, but the opposition reiterated that the expulsions were proof of a cover up.

It is too soon to say whether Trudeau’s problems are over, political analysts said.

“This scandal has blotted out the sun. Now the question is, did he kill it?” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker. Last week Ipsos put the Conservative Party 10 points ahead of the Liberals, thanks to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“This issue has taken Trudeau into a territory where he could really lose,” Bricker said, adding that while the prime minister had now shored up his standing as party leader, he still must win back public opinion.

But another pollster, Frank Graves at Ekos, said there were signs the damage had been limited and that there was fatigue over the issue among the general public. Ekos polls showed the Liberals had lost 3-4 percentage points during the scandal.

“But the numbers we are seeing now are same as they were before,” Graves said.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, who quit as minister because she disagreed with how the SNC Lavalin affair was being managed, stood side-by-side while speaking to reporters on Wednesday.

They said they had defended the independence of the judiciary and had no regrets, but they stopped short of attacking Trudeau head on or threatening legal recourse.

The affair has hurt the prime minister’s image as a self-avowed feminist and a leader who has taken to heart the cause of Canada’s indigenous population.

He recruited candidates such as Wilson-Raybould, who was named as the first indigenous justice minister, and Philpott in part because they were new to politics.

During a special event in parliament aimed at encouraging more women to get involved in politics, some of the attendees turned their backs on Trudeau as he spoke, prompting several of his Cabinet ministers to come to his defense.

“We have a strong prime minister that is a feminist,” Tourism Minister Melanie Joly told reporters.

“I would argue that loyalty and feminism are two different things. There’s no male or female definition of loyalty. Either you want to work in a team, or you don’t.”","Embattled Trudeau buoyed by party, could still face wrath of Canadian voters",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1RF2GL-OCADN

Wilson-Raybould wrote a last-minute appeal that she sent to Liberal MPs on Tuesday, just as some met to discuss her fate. The caucus met at an emergency meeting Tuesday night.

In the two-page letter, the MP for Vancouver Granville said she joined the Liberal party to promote progressive policies on climate change, Indigenous reconciliation, criminal justice and the economy, and because she believed Liberals wanted to transform ""our political culture"" and to pursue ""a more responsive, representative, and less partisan approach to the governing of the country.""

""In 2015, I believed the Liberal party held such a vision, and I still believe the Liberals can and must advance such a vision. I do believe fundamentally that the prime minister also still shares this vision.""

That was her only reference to Trudeau, whom she did not name in the letter.

As far as olive branches go, it might not have been enough for some Liberals. Wilson-Raybould did not state outright — as many of her Liberal colleagues have demanded — that she personally continues to have confidence in Trudeau as the government leader.

""My mind is not changed,"" said Liberal MP Rob Oliphant (Don Valley West) after reading the letter.

Earlier, Oliphant had said Wilson-Raybould's continued presence in caucus would depend on several conditions. ""I would be looking for a statement of apology and I would ask for an absolute assurance that she was in agreement with the direction that the Liberal party and the prime minister are taking on every issue,"" he said.

Members of the Ontario Liberal caucus met for more than hour on the issue over lunch Tuesday. Philpott, who quit her position as president of the Treasury Board after saying she'd lost confidence in the government's handling of the matter, attended the meeting for just a short period.

She declined to comment as she left, saying ""my colleagues are having a really important meeting right now and I don't think, out of respect for them, that it would be appropriate.""

Asked by a reporter whether she planned to run as a Liberal in the next campaign, Philpott said, ""This isn't a time that I want to comment.""

Liberal MP John McKay said both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould should be given the opportunity to speak to caucus and explain ""why they should stay.""

Asked if he was swayed by the letter, McKay replied, ""Not particularly.""

McKay also said he sees no ""path"" for Wilson-Raybould or Philpott to remain in caucus, saying the two MPs are ""joined at the hip.

""I see them as frankly supporting one another. A decision for one is a decision for both,"" he said.

Kirsty Duncan, the minister of science and sport, said she was dismayed to learn that Wilson-Raybould had secretly taped a telephone conversation with then-Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, calling the move ""unethical"" and ""deceitful.""

Many other MPs were tight-lipped. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said only it was a ""good conversation.""

In trying to bridge the gap between her and her fellow caucus members, Wilson-Raybould empathized with their anger and frustration. She claimed she was trying to protect the prime minister rather than hurt him, and presented the stark choice of choosing an exclusive club stuck in old ways of exercising power or an inclusive one that embraces diversity of opinion.

And in a pointed jab, she said the party committed to ""break old and cynical patterns of centralizing power in the hands of a few unelected staffers.""

She acknowledged that ""many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself.

""I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess. I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened.""

""Enough has been said"" about all that, she wrote.

She cited racism and misogyny she has experienced as an Indigenous woman, saying she long ago learned that ""rather than letting authority be the truth, let the truth be the authority.""

Her former cabinet colleagues were in a regular weekly meeting and different groups of Liberals, such as the Ontario caucus, huddled on Parliament Hill to decide how to handle her future in caucus.

Wilson-Raybould's letter to the caucus said ""inclusive"" politics is the only way to attract young people ""over simply following the paths laid out with those who claim to hold power.""

She said that's why she had ""no hesitation to stand up for what I believed to be right and necessary for the country since September 2018 regarding SNC-Lavalin.

""Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.""

Canada’s former attorney general says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has told her she’s been removed from the Liberal party caucus amid a scandal that has rocked Trudeau’s government in an election year.

Jody Wilson-Raybould tweeted Tuesday that Trudeau removed her and will not be a Liberal candidate in the fall election.

Trudeau and Liberal lawmakers were meeting Tuesday evening to discuss Wilson-Raybould after she publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant.

Wilson-Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to minister of veterans’ affairs because she didn’t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company so that it would avoid a potentially crippling criminal prosecution.

The scandal has led to multiple resignations and damaged the party for eight weeks.

4 p.m.

Canada’s former attorney general pleaded with her colleagues Tuesday to let her remain in the Liberal party caucus amid a scandal that has rocked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government in an election year.

Liberal lawmakers are expected to vote as soon as Tuesday evening to oust Jody Wilson-Raybould after she publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant.

Trudeau is meeting with Liberal lawmakers and will make remarks to the media after.

Wilson-Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to minister of veterans’ affairs because she didn’t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company so that it would avoid a potentially crippling criminal prosecution.

The scandal has led to multiple resignations and damaged the party for eight weeks.

In a letter, Wilson-Raybould acknowledged her colleagues are enraged but said she was “trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” Wilson-Raybould wrote to colleagues.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.”

Trudeau has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 via sources that Trudeau’s staff put pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She denied she was the source of the story, writing “I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened.”

The secret recording Wilson-Raybould made public shows Wernick telling Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau “is determined, quite firm” in finding a way to avoid a prosecution that could put 9,000 jobs at risk.

It also reveals Wilson-Raybould saying she regards the pressure as “inappropriate.”

Wilson-Raybould has refused to express support for Trudeau, a demand many Liberal lawmakers say is necessary if she is to remain in Parliament as part of the party caucus.

Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said he expected Wilson-Raybould to be expelled.

“Her letter, I believe, sets the stage for her run at the Liberal leadership if the Liberals lose in October and Justin Trudeau steps down,” Wiseman said.

“She is a victim of the parliamentary system which in Canada imposes sturdier party discipline than in any of the other Westminster parliamentary systems. The letter reveals her naivete, as a rookie Member of Parliament, about how the system works.”

The Liberal caucus could also vote to remove Jane Philpott, a former Cabinet minister who stepped from her role after she said she lost confidence in how the government has handled the affair.

They were also barred from running for the party in the federal election this October.,"By Steve Scherer and David Ljunggren

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday sought to quell a crisis that threatens his chances of re-election, expelling from party ranks two former Cabinet members he said had undermined the ruling Liberals.

Trudeau said former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott would no longer be allowed to sit as Liberal legislators. They were also barred from running for the party in the federal election this October.

The Liberals have been in turmoil since Wilson-Raybould said in February that officials had inappropriately pressured her last year while she was justice minister to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escape a corruption trial.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus.

""Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them,"" said Trudeau, 47, who took office in November 2015 and faces a tough re-election battle this autumn.

Wilson-Raybould, who tweeted news of her ouster before Trudeau's announcement, was demoted in January and resigned the next month. Philpott quit shortly afterward, saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau was handling the matter.

""If people can't express trust in the party and the prime minister, then they need to find another political vehicle in order to advance their ideas. It's as simple as that,"" Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters.

The expulsion represented a change of course for Trudeau, who said as recently as last week that the Liberals needed strong legislators with differing points of view.

But increasingly angry parliamentarians had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity.

Opinion polls show the crisis has cut public support for the Liberals to such an extent that they could lose in October to the official opposition Conservatives.

Trudeau, who came to power promising ""sunny ways"" and a greater role for women in politics, admitted it ""has been a difficult few weeks.""

The scandal also cost him the services of his closest aide, Gerald Butts, and Michael Wernick, the head of the federal bureaucracy.

Wilson-Raybould said on Twitter: ""I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do.""

Last Friday, to back her case, she released the audio of a confidential conversation with Wernick, who did not know she was recording him. Trudeau said that was ""unconscionable.""

Philpott said on Facebook that she ""did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister ... it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences.""

Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing. The scandal is starting to hit his fortunes in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in October to remain in power.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau's decision sent a message that ""if you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party.""

Wilson-Raybould, whose explosive allegations of political interference by the Prime Minister’s Office appear to have deeply imperilled Liberal hopes of holding on to power in this fall’s federal election, wrote to her fellow — now former — caucus members earlier in the day in hopes of convincing them to let her stay.

But just minutes into Tuesday’s hastily convened meeting, Wilson-Raybould, who stepped down from Trudeau’s cabinet in February after he shuffled her out of the coveted justice portfolio, made it clear via Twitter that the letter hadn’t worked.

“I have just been informed by the prime minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election,” she tweeted.

Minutes later, reporters and cameras were ushered into the caucus room to listen to Trudeau announce that both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were gone.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told caucus members.

“It’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer be part of our Liberal team.”

It’s the latest dramatic twist in the turmoil that has roiled the top ranks of the Trudeau government for weeks, fuelled by allegations that Wilson-Raybould was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

And it comes on the heels of a fresh uproar over a key phone conversation between the ex-minister and former Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat — a conversation Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded.

That recording was released Friday as part of her evidence of what Wilson-Raybould calls an intense pressure campaign to persuade her to override a decision to deny SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement, which would allow the engineering giant to avoid criminal proceedings on corruption and fraud charges.

In the weeks following Wilson-Raybould’s resignation, caucus had grown divided over the question of whether she and Philpott should be allowed to remain in caucus. Trudeau himself had initially suggested he would be willing to let them stay.

But Friday’s release of Wilson-Raybould’s 17-minute phone conversation with Wernick —and the fact she recorded it—appeared to tip the scales.

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns, and ultimately, if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team … then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

“If a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone, it’s wrong. When that politician is a cabinet minister secretly recording a public servant, it’s wrong. And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general of Canada, secretly recording the clerk of the Privy Council, it’s unconscionable.”

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself,” Wilson-Raybould wrote in her letter to caucus members.

“I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said.”

Toronto MP John McKay, who was unmoved by Wilson-Raybould’s letter, said he’s dismayed by her behaviour and believes she and Philpott are “joined at the hip.” Fellow MP Judy Sgro agreed the letter is “too little, too late.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne criticized Wilson-Raybould’s ethics, saying he had never recorded any conversations he had while working as a lawyer. Tourism Minister Melanie Joly called it “fundamentally wrong.”

In the call, Wernick repeatedly asks Wilson-Raybould why she was not using all the tools at her disposal on the SNC-Lavalin case. She pushes back, saying she would not override the decision of the director of public prosecutions to pursue a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its activities in Libya.

Wernick told her Trudeau was “quite determined” on the matter and would likely “find a way to get it done one way or another.”

In a written submission that accompanied the audio, Wilson-Raybould acknowledged recording the conversation was an “extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step,” but said she felt it necessary to have an exact record of what was discussed.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of Justice to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene on SNC’s behalf. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

Philpott followed suit in early March, citing a loss in confidence in the government’s handling of the matter.","Trudeau says Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott no longer Liberal caucus members",Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/news/jody-wilson-raybould-says-trudeau-has-kicked-her-out-of-the-liberal-caucus/

More to come... — Jody Wilson-Raybould ...,"OTTAWA — Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott have been ejected from the Liberal Party caucus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday evening, saying “The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken.”

Wilson-Raybould had announced the news on Twitter Tuesday evening just as a national caucus meeting was about to begin to discuss her future in the party. She said she had also been removed as the party’s candidate in Vancouver-Granville for the 2019 election.

There was also no immediate word on whether former Philpott, the former Treasury Board president who resigned from cabinet over the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, had also been removed as a candidate for the upcoming election.

I have just been informed by the Prime Minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election. More to come... — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

Wilson-Raybould’s ejection comes on the same day she wrote a scathing letter to her Liberal caucus colleagues that said their choice on whether to remove her would reveal the values of the party.

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated,” says her letter, dated Apr. 2. “And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to.”

Wilson-Raybould says she acted as she did on the SNC-Lavalin file because she was trying to “protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

She has given evidence to the Commons justice committee that there was a sustained campaign by senior government officials during the fall of 2018 to pressure her into ordering a deferred prosecution for SNC-Lavalin — pressure that she resisted, warning it violated the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened,” her letter to caucus says.

In one section of her letter, Wilson-Raybould appears to be addressing recent comments from some Liberal MPs that have attacked her motives. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, for example, has suggested she was trying to “entrap” Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick when she recorded their phone conversation.

“Growing up as an Indigenous person in this country, I learned long ago the lesson that people believing what they wish about you does not, and cannot ever, make it the truth — rather than letting authority be the truth, let the truth be the authority,” the letter says. “Indeed, if I had succumbed to interpreting the beliefs of other to be the truth, I never would have been able to push forward in the face of racism and misogyny that far too many Indigenous women, and others, still experience every day.”

Wilson-Raybould says she still intends to stand as the Liberal candidate in the 2019 election. But in acknowledgement of the movement to eject her, she lays out a challenge.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up,” her letter says.

“If indeed our caucus is to be a microcosm of the country it is about whether we are a caucus of inclusion or exclusion; of dialogue and searching for understanding or shutting out challenging views and perspectives; and ultimately of the old ways of doing business, or new ones that look to the future.”

Tuesday also saw the release of additional evidence tabled at the Commons justice committee consisting of text messages between Wilson-Raybould and Gerald Butts, the former top aide to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Butts resigned over the controversy on Feb. 18.

Among the messages are exchanges between Wilson-Raybould and Butts after she was told on Jan. 7 she would be removed as justice minister and attorney general. The texts show an argument that evolved and grew increasingly hostile as the announcement of the cabinet shuffle drew near.

At first, Wilson-Raybould — who was on vacation in Bali at the time — protested the move over what it signalled for Indigenous Canadians.

“Timing of ‘pushing’ me out (which will be the perception — whether true or not) is terrible,” she wrote on Jan 8. “It will be confounding and perplexing to people. This is not about me — believe me when I say this — but this is about an approach to Indigenous Peoples…This situation is only going to deepen and I am very worried about it. I am getting texts/emails from indig leaders and B.C. etc.”

Nobody is ‘pushing you out,'” Butts responded. “In fact, the PM has taken the extraordinary (in my experience unique) step of offering an alternative cabinet post to you.” The reference is to Wilson-Raybould turning down Trudeau’s first offer of the Indigenous services portfolio, saying she couldn’t take it given she’d spent her life opposing the Indian Act. She was made veterans affairs minister instead.

By Jan. 12, Wilson-Raybould was strongly implying she was being moved because of the SNC-Lavalin issue, though the texts don’t explicitly say so.

“For what it is worth, I feel compelled to say — one last time — that what is being proposed is a mistake — irrespective of where I am going. There is no way to fully explain this…My eyes are wide open on this shift,” she texted.

“What I know — as you must — is that there is a robust and proud record of what our government has done — through my work and that of the (Department of Justice)…I stand behind this hard work and all of my decisions and legal advice.”

Butts again defended the move. “I know this is tough but we have very good ideas to make it all work from a comms perspective,” he texted. “There’s an opportunity here for you to show people a side of yourself and your talent that you did not get as (minister of justice and attorney general).”

But Wilson-Raybould was unmoved, and accused Butts of wanting to staff the justice minister’s office with PMO aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques — both of whom had been pushing Wilson-Raybould’s office to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution. (Both Bouchard and Marques have remained in the PMO.)

“As to the ‘very good ideas’ you guys might want to consider sharing them with me,” she said. “But know I will be prepared for tomorrow. And I know why this is happening.”

The cabinet shuffle was announced on Jan. 14.

The biggest standing ovation from the Liberal caucus during Tuesday evening’s SNC-Lavalin drama came when the prime minister wrapped up his speech with a pledge to protect Canadian jobs — under any circumstances.

And it’s also short-sighted, because Canada’s global Boy Scout reputation — offering stability and solid respect for institutions — is central to the country’s ability to attract investment and, by extension, jobs.

It’s one thing to stand up for jobs and growth. It’s quite another to unapologetically push the limits of the rule of law to do so.

The context is important here. One of those former ministers, Jody Wilson-Raybould, resigned from cabinet because she felt Trudeau inappropriately interfered in the administration of justice in order to ease the way for SNC-Lavalin — an employer of 9,000 people in Canada — through charges of fraud and corruption.

Branding is everything in the global competition to lure investment, as the federal Liberals know perfectly well.

The Trudeau government created Invest in Canada to showcase the country’s strengths and smooth the way for investors. On its website, our reputation is right there on the home page as a key reason why foreign firms should make Canada a destination: “#1 Most Reputable among G7 countries,” it says.

Early in their mandate, when they sought and then implemented outside advice on how to enhance economic growth in Canada, highlighting the country’s reputation to foreign investors was front and centre.

Trudeau himself has personified the branding effort. His progressive agenda caught the world’s attention when he was first elected, and he quickly sought to turn that adulation into investment deals, often meeting CEOs face to face.

Government officials spend a great deal of time and effort negotiating foreign investment protection agreements with other countries; they want to ensure that when Canadian firms venture into their territories, they are treated with respect and the rule of law. Those countries expect the same here.

And when Canada ran into diplomatic trouble with China last December for detaining Huawei executive Meng Wangzhou, its defence — which it shopped around the world — was that Canada always respects the rule of law.

“Our independent legal system is one of the finest, if not the finest, in the world. I trust it, Canadians should trust it, and our partners around the world should trust it, too,” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in December at a Toronto discussion that focused on the Huawei conflict.

But trust is difficult to market when the former justice minister has alleged political interference in that system, and the prime minister sees nothing wrong with that.

Dan Tisch is CEO of Argyle Public Relationships, a Toronto-based firm that is involved in global studies comparing countries’ reputations — including the one featured on the Invest in Canada website. He says the world ignores most of what goes on in Canada, but is taking note now — to the detriment of Canada’s brand.

Canada has received top marks because it’s a beautiful and friendly place, but also because of its strong governance and stable economy, Tisch says. The SNC-Lavalin controversy obviously doesn’t change the beautiful and friendly part, but it does take aim at Canada’s economic and political reputation. “It’s potentially very serious for Canada because it strikes a blow in two of the three directions,” Tisch said.

So it was no accident that Export Development Canada (EDC), the government’s export financing agency responsible for promoting Canadian business overseas, quickly hired outside counsel to look into allegations in a CBC report that SNC-Lavalin may have paid bribes in a 2011 project in Angola that was partly financed by EDC.

“EDC has strict commitments for responsible business conduct and we would never, under any circumstances, knowingly participate in a transaction tainted by bribery or corruption,” the agency said in a statement. “This behaviour goes against EDC’s core values and deep-rooted culture of business integrity.”

The EDC clearly knows which side its bread is buttered on. Canada’s reputation for upholding the rule of law is primordial to good business.

Freeland seemed prescient — but perhaps went unheeded — last December when she said, “We’re seeing a lot of countries around the world that are starting to play fast and loose with democratic institutions and with rule of law. Canada is not going to be one of those countries. And it’s not always so easy to be a rule-of-law country. But in the fullness of time, we’re always going to be glad that we stick to that.”

“Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we care about them,” Trudeau told reporters. “That’s why I made the difficult decision to remove Ms. Wilson Raybould and Dr. Philpott from the Liberal caucus.

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns. But ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team, despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team.”

Meantime, May said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are “very brave. But they’re not the norm.”

An audience member remarked that as far as she could see no laws were broken and yet Wilson-Raybould “is burning down the House.”

May replied that that “the laws weren’t broken because she held firm.”

“The constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence really matters,” the Green Party leader said. “We can’t be a country where if you’re big enough and rich enough, you get a get-out-of jail-free card.

“In this case the prosecutorial independence is not the attorney general’s, the prosecutorial independence is to protect the independence of the director of public prosecutions,” she said. “She’s the only one, other that the attorney general, who’s looked through the evidence they have on SNC-Lavalin and made a determination under the law, does this corporation qualify for this new tool, deferred prosecution agreement, which I voted for because it looked pretty benign when I read the whole omnibus budget.

“I didn’t know it was for SNC-Lavalin,” May said. “I read the reasons it could be used and thought they were satisfactory. Well, I think they may be satisfactory because the director of public prosecutions in this country looked at the criteria under the deferred prosecution agreement, which included such things as a corporation can qualify if it self-reported its crime. SNC-Lavalin didn’t self-report.”

“We need to look at the evidence,” May said, “before we decide that the attorney general should do something unprecedented and intervene and tell the director of public prosecutions you’re going to give this company a deal.”

Speaking to the entire national Liberal caucus at an emergency meeting on Parliament Hill, Trudeau cited the “will of caucus,” and said that while it was his decision, the trust that more than 170 Liberal members had with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had been “broken,” and it was clear they had to be removed.

“Whether it’s taping conversations without consent or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer be part of our Liberal team,” Trudeau said.

The prime minister said that he spoke with caucus leadership earlier on Tuesday and also met with Philpott and Wilson-Raybould to inform them of his decision.

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns but ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team, despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

Minutes before Trudeau announced this, Wilson-Raybould tweeted that she had been informed by Trudeau that she was no longer in the caucus and had been dropped as the candidate for Vancouver Granville, B.C.

She was seen leaving West Block in the minutes before her tweet. In follow up posts, she said she is reflecting on “what PM has done,” and said her thoughts are with all who “believed in a new way of doing politics.”

“I hold my head high… I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do,” she said.

In a post on Facebook, Philpott said she was “profoundly” disheartened that the decision was made without her being given the opportunity to speak directly to the national caucus. She denied that she was disloyal or that her involvement in the affair had anything to do with political advantage.

“I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the Prime Minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” Philpott said. “These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

Philpott said that “it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences to the party and to the country,” and is vowing to remain the representative for her Markham Stouffville riding “for the remainder of this term.”

This decision comes nearly two months after the SNC-Lavalin scandal first broke.

The controversy centres on allegations from Wilson-Raybould that she faced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" for months by nearly a dozen government officials pressuring her to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, out of concern for jobs and Quebec political prospects.

The scandal began unfolding after Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were both shuffled into new cabinet positions in January. Days after the initial story broke about her being pressured, Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet, and Philpott followed suit a few weeks later, citing a loss in confidence in the way the government was handling the entire SNC-Lavalin affair. Since then both have offered additional information or commentary on the matter that Liberal MPs now appear to have been unable to reconcile with.

The pair’s removal from caucus follows a series of regional caucus meetings in which Liberal MPs discussed whether they should be allowed to remain with the Liberal team.

“This has been a difficult few weeks for our government and for our Liberal team. On the issues surrounding SNC-Lavalin we’ve seen allegations made, and different versions of events, details. Amid the confusing and competing narratives, Canadians rightly have had questions,” Trudeau said, adding that the government has too grappled with these questions about the role of government in protecting jobs, and respecting Canadian democratic institutions.

He said that the Liberals came to power pledging to do politics differently -- a promise Wilson-Raybould says the government has reneged on -- and in doing things differently, “we encounter difficult moments.”

As he finished his remarks to caucus, Trudeau received a standing ovation, and at least one voice in the room could be heard saying “bravo.”

The Liberal caucus will hold another meeting on Wednesday, likely to discuss all other business now that the most pressing matter has been addressed. Then, Trudeau will partake in the annual Daughters of the Vote event where 338 delegates descend on the Hill, in the name of encouraging more women to enter politics.

Wilson-Raybould was received warmly by a number of the delegates at a reception on Monday night and some critics have questioned whether the Liberals wanted to be seen throwing out two female caucus members on the same day as the Equal Voice-run event.

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were federal political rookies, first elected in 2015. They were both appointed to Trudeau’s first and historic gender-balanced cabinet, and were seen to be key to the government’s pledge of reconciliation and developing a new nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people.

Prior to her career in politics, Philpott was a family doctor, and Wilson-Raybould was a crown prosecutor and regional chief.

Speaking to questions over whether this move damages the government’s brand as a feminist government, Liberal cabinet minister Melanie Joly said: “We have a feminist prime minister and I profoundly think that loyalty has nothing to do with gender, you’re either loyal or you’re not.”

In a statement reacting to the news, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said that the pair’s removal “should tell Canadians everything they need to know about how things work in the Liberal Party of Canada,” and offered that there is a place in the Conservative Party for anyone who believes that “speaking truth to power should be rewarded, not punished.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said that this is the way that Trudeau thinks he can make the SNC-Lavalin scandal go away, but it is “not leadership.”

Last-chance letter asking to stay

Trudeau leaning into the narrative about the Liberals’ approach to politics appeared to be speaking directly to some of what Wilson-Raybould had to say in a last-chance letter to her entire caucus, sent Tuesday around noon.

The letter hit the inboxes of Liberal MPs as some were gathering, grim-faced, to discuss her fate. In the letter Wilson-Raybould said she wanted to remain a Liberal MP -- something she has maintained throughout this affair -- and implored her colleagues to consider “what kind of party you want to be a part of.”

In the letter the Vancouver-Granville MP spoke of the Liberals’ 2015 election commitment to do politics differently, more transparently, and by empowering MPs. She stopped short of explicitly saying that she still has confidence in Trudeau.

“I believed we were going to uphold the highest standards that support the public interest, and not simply make choices to create partisan advantage,” she wrote.

She said the vision that the Liberals came into power with was “one of the main reasons” she didn’t hesitate to stand up for what she thought was right in the case of SNC-Lavalin.

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess,” Wilson-Raybould writes in the letter, obtained by CTV News.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said,” her letter said.

Those final few words are something that it seems the entire Liberal caucus agrees with.

“By their actions they have excluded themselves so for us now it’s time to move on,” said Liberal cabinet minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.

His colleague and fellow minister Jim Carr said that “when trust is broken it’s sad and inevitably in public life and in politics, trust and loyalty, and pulling in the same direction is the kind of commitment that is necessary for all team members,” Carr said.

Outrage over secret audio

Over the last two days, numerous Liberal MPs have been speaking out, and expressing disappointment and condemnation over Wilson-Raybould's decision to secretly record and subsequently make public a December conversation she had with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick about SNC-Lavalin.

That audio was released on Friday along with dozens of additional pages of testimony, text messages, transcripts, and copies of emails to supplement her Feb. 27 hours-long testimony.

Speaking to this, Trudeau said it is an “especially wrong” thing for a politician, especially a cabinet minister, to have done.

“And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general… it is unconscionable,” Trudeau said.

Wilson-Raybould defended her recording on Monday, saying it was a ""reasonable, rational thing to do in an unreasonable and irrational situation,"" and that she felt she needed to protect herself.

House filibuster, study shut down again

Since she testified to the allegations, Trudeau has faced calls to resign and the House of Commons has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, the latest being a budget debate filibuster from Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre which is poised to enter its third day.

Early Tuesday the House Justice Committee met behind closed doors to determine next steps for the new studies it decided to take on after ending its probe into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The opposition did try to revive its proposal to resume the study that Liberal MPs shut down a few weeks ago, but that was unsuccessful. Despite the committee having ended its meetings on the matter, it is still receiving new evidence. The latest came in today from Trudeau’s former top adviser Gerald Butts who resigned amid this scandal. He turned over texts and other messages between he and Wilson-Raybould that show the tensions between the PMO and the former justice minister as she was being shuffled into a different portfolio, a move Wilson-Raybould said she thinks was because of her intransigence over not interfering in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal case.

In his televised comments to caucus Tuesday night, Trudeau indicated a desire to refocus the government’s agenda on other matters, and took aim at his opponents.

“Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them, that’s why I made the difficult decision,” Trudeau said.

“Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided, we can’t afford to make that mistake. Canadians are counting on us,” he said.

An Indigenous woman, new to the Liberal party and its ancient history and customs in Canadian politics, introduced massive disruption to the status quo. Certainly that's how her supporters and the opposition ...","Jody Wilson-Raybould appears to have written a whole new manual on how to lose your job in politics.

Maybe there have been other politicians who turned a cabinet demotion into a three-month-long crisis for their governments, though none spring to mind. Perhaps there are other ministers who have spent days warning their bosses not to move them out of their jobs.

But no one in Canada, until Wilson-Raybould, appears to have done this so publicly and with such bridge-burning tenacity — up to and including Tuesday's fiery warning to fellow Liberals against ejecting her from caucus.

None of the warnings worked. In the space of three months, Wilson-Raybould has become the former justice minister, the former veterans affairs minister and, as of Tuesday night, a former Liberal MP and no-longer candidate for Vancouver Granville in the next election.

""More to come,"" Wilson-Raybould said in the tweet announcing her ejection from Trudeau's caucus. No doubt that's true — for a minister who was notoriously media-shy while in cabinet, she's been a magnet for controversy and attention since leaving it.

Regardless of what one thinks of Wilson-Raybould — and her story has polarized politics, even friends and families — her long-running exit from Trudeau's fold is unprecedented in terms of the damage it's done to all sides.

Why Trudeau let it go on so long is one mystery of this saga — the prime minister is well-versed in ejecting troublesome colleagues, be they appointed Liberal senators or errant MPs. His speech to Liberal caucus on Tuesday night, his fans and critics will say, is one he might well have delivered weeks ago.

The ""how"" of it going on so long, however, is less of a mystery. If we've learned nothing else in the latest wave of revelations about the behind-the-scenes conversations leading to her demotion, Wilson-Raybould's fierce streak of self-preservation has shone through.

She secretly taped a conversation in December with Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council — a move that Trudeau described as ""unconscionable"" in his Tuesday night speech.

She sat on vacation in Bali in early January, tapping out multiple warnings in text messages to Gerald Butts, the prime minister's principal secretary — messages revealed on Tuesday when Butts handed over his emails and texts to the Commons justice committee.",Trudeau-Wilson Raybould parting unlike any other in Liberal history,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9265324-trudeau-wilson-raybould-parting-unlike-any-other-in-liberal-history/
89,Politics,2019-04-03T18:24:00.0000000Z,"The two former ministers, Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, had been in the gallery overlooking the Commons earlier Wednesday, offering standing ovations as young women from each of Canada’s ... her from the Liberal Party caucus Chris Selley ...","OTTAWA — A weary-looking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau entered the temporary House of Commons chamber, with its literal glass ceiling, took the podium and began to deliver a speech to a sea of young women. One by one, more than 40 of them rose from their seats to turn their backs on him.

The silent protest just after noon on Wednesday came during Trudeau’s first public appearance after expelling former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould, who accused him of trying to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of Montreal construction firm SNC-Lavalin, and Jane Philpott, who resigned in solidarity with her, from his Liberal caucus on Tuesday evening.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, locked out of the regular weekly caucus meeting Wednesday morning, visited the House of Commons gallery and sat to listen statements by some of the Daughters of the Vote delegates — 338 women, aged 18 to 23, chosen by the Equal Voice organization to represent all of Canada’s ridings for a day on Parliament Hill.

Dozens of young women here for Daughters of the Vote turn their backs as Trudeau speaks -in solidarity with Ms Wilson-Raybould and Ms Philpott pic.twitter.com/aAhdlDHrcS — Peter Julian (@MPJulian) April 3, 2019

The two sat with Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who quit the Liberal caucus in the wake of reporting on SNC-Lavalin. She snapped her fingers sometimes in agreement with the young women’s pronouncements. All three gave standing ovations for statements on issues including climate change, Indigenous suicide, accessibility and religious freedom, along with the rest of the room, which brimmed with loud enthusiasm for each speaker.

Ducking out to speak with reporters, neither Wilson-Raybould nor Philpott would address the elephant in the room — that here were young women being encouraged to speak up when Wilson-Raybould’s whistle-blowing is what ultimately led to their excommunication from caucus. Caesar-Chavannes told the National Post “we needed that little boost today,” though. “We are in the gallery watching, having, we hope, made a mark on the 42nd Parliament. And here are young women in those seats saying, ‘yeah, we are going to continue this,’” she said.

When he finally arrived, Trudeau, the self-proclaimed feminist and “minister of youth,” would face more than one rebuke from the young women in front of him. And he was not alone — dozens of them walked out on Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer while he spoke, because of a distaste for his policies. Upon their return, the women, including a majority of those who wore a hijab, got as much applause as Scheer had for his short speech.

During a question-and-answer session with Trudeau, Indigenous Nova Scotia delegate Hannah Martin, facing him, declared the Liberal government was perpetrating violence with its inaction on Indigenous issues. “You cannot be a feminist if you are allowing corporations to rape the land, because as Indigenous peoples, that is our mother,” she said. He thanked her for her “strong voice.”

Other delegates, talking in a buzz outside the Commons after the event, accused Trudeau of failing Indigenous people and women both by expelling Wilson-Raybould, who was the first Indigenous attorney general. “It was like a microcosm of the history of Canada, white men telling Indigenous women where they can or cannot be and exercising power,” said Riley Yesno, from Toronto.

“I don’t believe Justin Trudeau is a feminist,” said Brit Sippola, from Saskatchewan, recalling a section of his opening statement when he said nobody in the room would want to have to “pick who to believe between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Chrystia Freeland” or “know that one person has to be right and one person has to be wrong between Jane Philpott or Maryam Monsef.” The prime minister was deflecting attention away from his own mistakes by saying it was “Jane’s word versus Maryam’s,” Sippola said. “He’s the one who’s pitting women against women here.”

Other cabinet ministers were marching out in the early afternoon to say that the decision to remove Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had had nothing to do with feminism. Politicians had breached the trust of their colleagues. They hadn’t been team players. Loyalty wasn’t a gender issue, full stop.

But Trudeau’s long day of defending himself was nowhere near over.

During question period, he stood up again and again to answer all of the opposition’s questions, accusing him of fake feminism, calling him a coward and demanding his resignation over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He was interrogated on details in the testimony and evidence that Wilson-Raybould had provided to the House justice committee’s perfunctory study of the affair. For the first time, after weeks of being grilled day in and day out, Trudeau admitted that yes, Wilson-Raybould had asked him, during a September meeting, if he was trying to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution. He said he told her no.

But that wasn’t good enough for Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who would go on later Wednesday to continue a multi-day, marathon filibuster over the issue. He pointed out that in Trudeau’s earlier statements nobody had raised any concerns with him about interference.

“Now the prime minister has caught himself in a trap of his own making,” he said.

“The member opposite is twisting himself into rhetorical knots to try to make a point that is simply not there,” Trudeau responded.

New Democrats seized upon the Daughters of the Vote protest as a symbolic repudiation of Trudeau’s credentials as a feminist prime minister. “What have they seen this week? They have seen women speak truth to power and then get shown the door,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said.

OTTAWA—Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott say they have no regrets for defending the “independence of the judicial system” even if it cost them their seats in the Liberal caucus.

She said she made her decision “on the basis of what I believe is best for Canadians, to stand up for the truth, and to stand up for the independence of the justice system.

Philpott, who quit her cabinet post as president of the Treasury Board in March because she had “lost confidence” in how the Trudeau government handled allegations of political pressure on Wilson-Raybould, acknowledged that recent weeks have been “very difficult.”

“That’s why I did it and that’s what I’ll continue to do.”

“It’s very unfortunate that it has come to this but we have to make difficult choices in politics,” she said. “We aren’t always in control of all of the things that will happen,” the Markham-Stouffville MP said.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott spoke with reporters before taking their new seats in the Commons as independent MPs, no longer sitting in the Liberal benches after being ejected from the party caucus.

“But you have to be able to hold your head high and look at yourself in the mirror at the end of the day and say that the choices that you made were the best ones under the circumstances.”

Trudeau announced the expulsions in a tough speech to Liberal MPs on Tuesday night. He declared that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had lost the trust of fellow caucus members, and singled out Wilson-Raybould’s secret taping of a telephone conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick as “unconscionable.”

But Wilson-Raybould denounced that criticism Wednesday, saying it’s “alarming” that people are focused on her decision to record the conversation rather than on what it revealed.

In that recording, the former attorney general repeatedly warned Wernick that Trudeau and his officials were engaging in political interference with the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

The 17-minute call on Dec. 19 ended with Wernick warning Wilson-Raybould he was concerned about how the prime minister would react to her refusal to intervene in the trial and negotiate a remediation agreement with the Quebec company.

“Trust is a two-way street,” said Wilson-Raybould, who until now has said the pressure Trudeau and his officials applied to her was “inappropriate” but not unlawful.

On Wednesday, she seemed to take a harder line. “Talking about unconscionable, I think … it’s unconscionable to tread over the independence of the prosecutor. It is unconscionable not to uphold the rule of law.”

Wilson-Raybould defended her decision to record her conversation with Wernick. She said there was nothing “illegal” about it and that “in any other circumstance, it would be inappropriate.

“I was protecting myself. I knew that something very dangerous and wrong was going to happen and my job was at risk,” Wilson-Raybould said.

Philpott turned aside the question about whether any law was broken. “To say that ‘it’s good enough if something hasn’t broken a law’ is a very, very low bar to hold,” she said, “and I would hope that all politicians would say that we would also not cross ethical boundaries.”

Trudeau said that neither MP would be allowed to run for the Liberals in the October election.

Philpott has committed to serving out her term, while Wilson-Raybould said she continues to think about her next steps. Both declined to say whether they would run again.

“I need to take some time to reflect. This has ... been an incredibly difficult time, not only for the two of us but also for our families,” Wilson-Raybould said. “I need to be very considered in what happens next.”

Philpott, a first-term MP who was seen as a rising star in cabinet, said Wednesday she wasn’t “going to bat” for Wilson-Raybould when she quit cabinet in March.

Rather, she said she found it impossible in “good conscience” to publicly back the government’s position on the SNC-Lavalin file and “deny” there had been any high-level interventions.

Philpott also suggested she was surprised by the expulsion from caucus.

“What happened yesterday was not something that I anticipated would happen, certainly in the manner that it happened,” she said. Asked if she was disappointed in Trudeau, she said in French that “I’d like to say the prime minister has led our country well in these past years and I wish him the best. I wish him the opportunity to continue his good work.”

Philpott, a medical doctor, said she could return to her former career, “which I loved,” but felt politics was a way she could use her experience to “contribute in a significant way.”

“I would like to think that there are maybe steps I could continue in a political role somehow,” she said.

Their removal from the Liberal caucus put Trudeau and Liberals MPs on the defensive Wednesday about their commitment to the party’s feminist and Indigenous agenda.

Conservative MP Candice Bergen accused Trudeau of ejecting the two women from caucus as punishment for drawing attention to questionable conduct by the prime minister and top officials on the SNC-Lavalin file.

“When these two women told the truth, he didn’t want them around. He punished them. Clearly the message is, if you tell the truth in the Liberal caucus, you get booted out. It’s unconscionable to watch this happen,” said Bergen.

The tough questions came on a day when young women from across the country gathered on Parliament Hill for an initiative to promote the engagement of women in politics. The “Daughters of the Vote” event, organized by Equal Voice Canada, brings together 338 delegates, one for each riding, who take a seat in the House of Commons.

Trudeau faced a protest from some of the women delegates, who were unhappy with the removal of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from caucus and the pace of the government’s reconciliation agenda with Indigenous peoples.

As he prepared to speak in the Commons, some 40 women stood and turned their backs. Others left the chamber.

Trudeau tackled the topic head-on, acknowledging what he called “disagreements” in the Liberal caucus.

“This is part of what politics needs to be about, hearing from different voices, learning from each other,” he said.

“It’s not going to be easy. It’s not going to be simple,” Trudeau said.

“Diversity only works if there is trust. Within a team, when that trust gets broken, we have to figure out how to move forward,” he said.

One delegate asked about the government’s pledges on reconciliation. “What about the promise that you made to Canada, about restoring a nation-to-nation agreement?” she asked.

Trudeau responded that his government is making progress but cautioned against quick fixes.

“Parliament in Canada has failed Indigenous peoples, for decades, for generations … with policies aimed at assimilation, marginalization, eradication,” he said.

“We have taken significant steps in trying to get Canada back on the right path,” he said. “But what took centuries to break is not going to be simply fixed in a year or two. We know this is a long-term job.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer faced his own protest as a large number of women left the chamber during his speech, returning only after he was finished.

Riley Yesno, of the Eabametoong First Nation in Northern Ontario, said the expulsion of Wilson-Raybould from caucus evoked images of colonial repression over Indigenous peoples.

“To see an Indigenous woman expelled from a high position of power speaks volumes,” said Yesno, who called Wilson-Raybould “an important role model.”

“It was like a microcosm of the history of Canada, with white men telling Indigenous women where they can and cannot be and exercising their power and privilege over top of them,” said Yesno, who left the chamber for the speeches by both Trudeau and Scheer.

Sabine Moller, of the riding Esquimalt — Saanich — Sooke, stayed in the chamber but turned her back on the prime minister.

“I turned my back to say that this is a silent protest. We’re not going to be disruptive, but we must be heard that there needs to be more done on reconciliation. It can’t just be talk,” Moller said.

Liberal MPs defended the government’s record and rejected questions about whether the loss of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott was a step backward for the government’s feminist agenda.

“Absolutely not. This issue is about two members of Parliament ... it’s not about female members,” said Jennifer O’Connell (Pickering-Uxbridge).

Melanie Joly, minister for tourism, official languages and la Francophonie, defended the prime minister.

“We have a feminist agenda. Our record speaks for itself. As to my two colleagues, I would argue that loyalty and feminism are two different things. And actually, there is no female or male definition of loyalty. It’s either you have team spirit, you want to work in a team, or you don’t,” Joly said.

Treasury Board President Joyce Murray, who had hoped both women would remain in caucus, said Wednesday she was fine with the decision. She said it was clear to her that the prime minister had worked hard to keep the two in caucus “but there had to be support on their part for the prime minister and for the work that we do.”

Our Nation’s Oil, From Alberta to Saudi Arabia

Pipelines have been running through our nations lands dating back to the 1950s, when this method of transportation was developed to carry oil and natural gas to Eastern Canada and the U.S., eventually being carried North.

Pipelines have been running through our nations lands dating back to the 1950s, when this method of transportation was developed to carry oil and natural gas to Eastern Canada and the U.S., eventually being carried North.

The pipelines originate in Alberta, running in all directions: west to British Columbia, north towards the Northwest Territories, south to Texas, and east up until Quebec, with a pipeline even running between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. There are more than 840,000 km of pipelines criss-crossing the country.

These lines are not without controversy, as production within the Canadian tar sands generate greenhouse gases. While oil and gas are a valuable part to Canadian economy, the nation competes with Saudi Arabia, who ships their oil to Eastern Canada.

Environmental concern isn’t the only dispute: pipelines run through Indigenous lands, not all of which have been granted approval. Canadian law states that First Nations must be consulted about pipeline projects. Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted to allow Indigenous groups access to the right of consent towards resource development projects that go through their land. However, as long as the government has attempted a sincere consultation, project can legally proceed even without Indigenous approval.

The most recent debate on pipelines has resurrected due to tensions recently exemplified within the Wet’suwet’en nation, as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police forcibly removed of activists preventing TransCanada Coastal GasLink from being constructed on their land.

And that’s just part of the tensions surrounding pipeline construction.

The federal government announced it had purchased the existing Trans Mountain pipeline, built in 1953, and its expansion project for $4.5 billion last September. The price of the expansion itself is estimated to be about $7.4 billion. The project, which would expand the capacity to transfer oil from Alberta to BC, has gained criticism from both politicians and environmentalists.

“There are concerns by Indigenous communities and environmentalists that the pipeline poses threats,” Saint-Lazare Councillor Brian Trainor told The Link. “Due to the possibility of a spill on route overland and at sea with the threat to marine life, in particular whales, of the increased tanker traffic.”

Forty-three First Nations signed agreements signalling their support for the Trans Mountain expansion project. However, the six First Nations of Tsleil-Waututh Nation, Coldwater Indian Band, The Stó:lō Collective, Squamish Nation, Upper Nicola Band, and Stk’emlupsemc te Secwepemc of the Secwepemc Nation, are leading challenges against the project in court, which could have a major impact on the future of the expansion.

“If any of the First Nations are successful, the whole underlying approval goes away,” Eugene Kung with West Coast Environmental Law told Huffington Post. “Canada is assuming that risk.”

The Trans Mountain pipeline, bought in 2005 by Kinder Morgan Inc., covers 1,150 km from Strathcona County near Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, BC.

The planned expansion would build a second pipeline alongside the existing one and would increase the transportation of oil from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day. Further, it would increase the traffic off of BC’s coast from approximately five to 35 tankers a month.

“Shipping is the most efficient type of transportation and plays a significant role in Canadian and global trade,” said Fadi Harb, a Concordia professor in the economics department. “However, it has some negative externalities and it creates environmental pollution.”

Under pressure from the Alberta government and the oil industry, the federal government purchased the existing Kinder Morgan pipeline. Trainor said it became obvious that Kinder Morgan had decided not to proceed with the required investment given economic uncertainty due to legal delays and dropping world oil prices.

“In terms of construction and making way for a new pipeline, in all aspects, this was the least impactful way in environmental terms of solving the problem of not having a way of getting [Canada’s] resources to new markets,”said Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister for Youth Affairs Peter Schiefke. “This is important because we are losing anywhere from $7 to $15 billion a year, because the U.S. is buying our oil at a reduced cost—because they know we have no choice.”

“Not only did the Liberals spend $4.5 billion of taxpayers’ money buying a pipeline that a private company wanted to build without a single tax dollar, but they failed in the negotiations, spending a billion more than the Independent Parliamentary Budget Officer [Yves Giroux] had estimated,” said Luc Berthold, Mégantic-l’Érable MP for the Conservative Party.

“The Liberals have no plan for expansion, and each year of delay increases the costs by hundreds of millions of dollars.”

Shortly thereafter, the federal Court of Appeal ruled that further consultations with First Nations would be necessary and the National Energy Board will have to review the the effects of more tankers off the BC. coast before the expansion project can continue. Trainor said these consultations are currently ongoing but the Liberal government is under extreme pressure from Albertans and the oil industry to advance the project as soon as possible. As it stands, the conclusion of these consultations doesn’t have a deadline.

“Indigenous consultations are inextricably intertwined with review of marine impacts—orcas have important cultural significance,” said Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada to the Vancouver Sun. “So charging ahead on this before sorting out the Indigenous consultation piece seems like a mistake.”

“From an economic perspective, there are always benefits and costs associated with a pipeline project, and one needs to study how efficient would the pipeline project be in enhancing Canada’s economy,” Harb said.

According to the Conference Board of Canada, it’s estimated the pipeline project would create the equivalent of 15,000 construction jobs, not to mention the equivalent of 37,000 jobs per year of operations in direct, indirect and induced jobs in Alberta and BC. An increase in the taxes collected could also be used for public services such as health care and education.

Last Spring, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley called the pipeline expansion “a major step forward for all Canadians.” She said the pipeline is a financially feasible and will generate profits. She conceded that governments may be held accountable if there is a spill, however, Notley said spills are not occurring as often.

But critics say The Trans Mountain pipeline will raise the amount of tankers in BC waters, increasing the chances that one of them will hit something and cause a spill of fuel into the ocean.

A major oil pipeline leak in 2011 was caused by the rupture of the Plains Midstream Canada Rainbow pipeline. It resulted in 28,000 barrels of oil spilling in northern Alberta, and was reported as the biggest spill in the province in 35 years. Some of the oil had seeped into the wetlands nearby. But in 2016 there were fewer than 100 spills larger than seven tonnes reported, compared to 3,000 in 1974.

“More than 100,000 people in the energy sector have already lost their jobs, and thousands more are unaware when construction will begin,” said Berthold. “Every day the construction is delayed further undermines Canada’s reputation as a stable and predictable place to invest—that is why the majority of Canadians believe that failing to build pipelines is a national crisis.”

“The federal government has to represent every province and territory, and if any sector is struggling, our job is to ensure that we’re doing everything we can to get the most out of that sector and provide jobs for those people,” said Schiefke.

According to Schiefke, this is especially the case for Calgary, as the city currently has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.

“One of the obvious reasons for opposing pipelines is the threat they pose to drinking water. If this pipeline spills at the Outaouais river, this could make water undrinkable for millions in the province of Quebec, since the St. Laurent [river] provides a key source.”

— Vincent Duhamel

In 2016, British Columbia said it didn’t support the Trans Mountain pipeline, in part out of concerns about the lack of information provided by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners for their proposed spill prevention and clean-up program. Kinder Morgan has increasingly been using the pipeline to transport diluted bitumen from the tar sands, which is much more corrosive than regular oil. Bitumen is a thick tar-like mix of hydrocarbons that is toxic and very difficult to clean up if there was a spill.

“One of the obvious reasons for opposing pipelines is the threat they pose to drinking water,” said Vincent Duhamel from Climate Justice Montreal. “If this pipeline spills at the Outaouais river, this could make water undrinkable for millions in the province of Quebec, since the St. Laurent [river] provides a key source.”

“I think pipeline expansion is digging a deeper hole in terms of our reliance on fossil fuels,” said Emily Carson-Apstein, external coordinator of Sustainable Concordia. “This is super harmful to vulnerable communities in Canada, like Indigenous communities on the West Coast and people around the world who can’t afford to escape the effects of climate change.”

The crude oil pipeline Enbridge Line 9 provides oil to Montreal’s Suncor Refinery from Sarnia, Ontario. It’s processing on average 24,300 barrels of diluted bitumen a day. The TransCanada Corp. canceled its Energy East Pipeline and Eastern Mainline projects, after being subject to increased regulations and facing opposition from environmental groups.

Saudi Oil and Canadian Pipelines’ Impacts on Indigenous Land

Canada not only receives its oil from the Alberta tar sands, but also from Saudi Arabia. “Alberta crude extraction is a relatively recent phenomenon and Canada has been importing Middle Eastern oil for a very long time,” said Syed Ahsan, a Concordia professor emeritus in the economics department.

Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are the second largest in the world. According to the National Energy Board, Canada has approximately 80,000 barrels of oil imported from the kingdom every day and we pay them about $2 billion a year, versus the $3.8 million barrels of oil produced by Canada per day.

The situation is a matter of money. Acquiring Saudi’s oil through affordable transportation and having it refined in New Brunswick is cheaper than the complex and expensive process of extracting the oil from Alberta’s tar sands and refining it.

Only certain refineries can turn Alberta bitumen into gasoline, which are mainly located in Alberta and BC The greenhouse gas emissions for extracting and processing oil sand are larger than for regular crude oil, and contribute to global warming. The oil is then moved to the Burnaby Terminal—a distribution point for crude oil to local terminals.

The Irving refinery in St. John, New Brunswick receives 40 per cent of its crude oil from Saudi Arabia. However, in light of the fractured diplomatic relations between the two countries, some economists say Canada could easily replace the Saudi Arabian crude oil with its own if the kingdom stops selling it.

Ahsan explained why this hasn’t happened. “The heavy crude can only be economically extracted at a certain price floor, possibly close to $50 USD [per] barrel, while Middle Eastern oil has a much lower threshold for profitable extraction.”

Indigenous nations are particularly affected by the pipelines threatening their land. The Wet’suwet’en is the most recent nation to publicly oppose pipelines and face attacks from the RCMP. The nation called for a stop on the Coastal GasLink pipeline project because the RCMP enforced a court injunction for access through the Unist’ot’en camp, about 15 minutes from the worksite.

“We review major projects proposed on Wet’suwet’en territories,” Mike Ridsdale, environmental assessment coordinator for the Office of the Wet’suwet’en.

“We monitor the province and make the proponents know of the hereditary decisions on the lands where there is proposed works,” said Ridsdale. “Currently, we are working with lawyers to stop Coastal GasLink pipeline due to their cultural genocide of our historical evidence on the land.”

The Oceans Protection Plan, a $1.5 billion federal policy unveiled by the current Liberal government in 2016, attempts to address environmental consequences brought on by oil transportation and potential spills. It includes provisions to protect chinook salmon, fund new research on water contaminants, and plans to reduce noise from the thousands of vessels that travel near the whales each year.

“When we took office, only one per cent of our coastline was protected, after 152 years of existence as a country,” said Schiefke. “We vowed that by the end of our first term we would bring that up to 10 per cent. So far we are at 8.7 per cent.”

Apstein fears the environmental impact of these pipelines. “The Canadian economy runs on fossil fuels right now and we don’t have a lot of time to find a different way to run the country, because this just isn’t going to cut it.”

“Going oil-free should definitely be in the interest of every economy moving forward,” said Harb. “From an environmentalist’s point of view, building a pipeline that could eventually no longer be operational in two decades’ time is quite costly and detrimental to the environment.”

Schiefke said he believes an environmental and economical balance is needed. “It’s about being realistic about our economic needs, and then doing the hard work necessary to innovate and look for ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors by using revenues to invest in green technology,” said Schiefke.

With the upcoming federal election later this year, the pressure to decide on the fate of the Trans Mountain Pipeline may come into the forefront of Canadian concern. If the project goes according to plan, the added construction is expected to take about 30 months, which means the pipeline could be operational in 2022.

Wilfred Moore, NDP MP Gord Johns, Camille Labchuk of Animal Justice and former Marineland trainer Phil Demers ...","After several years of swimming through the parliamentary process, often against a wave of Conservative opposition, the ‘Free Willy’ bill is nearing the end of its journey and set to splash down in the House of Commons for a final debate and vote.

At the House fisheries committee’s clause-by-clause consideration Tuesday afternoon, MPs voted in favour of Bill S-203, which would ban whale and dolphin captivity in Canada, without making any amendments to it.

There were concerns over the weekend that several technical amendments to the bill would be put forward by Liberal MP Pat Finnigan of New Brunswick. Even a single amendment to the bill would have required it to be voted on again in the Senate, where it languished for years as a result of stall tactics by Conservative senators.

Given that this parliamentary session is quickly winding down and an election set to be called, proponents of the bill said sending it back to the Red Chamber would have been a death sentence.

Conservative MPs Todd Doherty, Rob Nicholson and Blaine Calkins put forward a handful of amendments during clause-by-clause, some of which aimed to address concerns by Marineland, one of two facilities in Canada that has captive cetaceans. Two weeks ago, a lawyer for the facility told the committee he believed the bill was unconstitutional.

One by one, they were voted down. When it came time to move his amendments, Finnigan withdrew each of them.

It made for a dramatic afternoon. Over the weekend, supporters of the bill, including politicians, NGOs and concerned individuals, had mobilized, organizing a phone and email campaign aimed at Liberal MPs and ministers. It’s estimated close to 15,000 calls were made from Canadians heading into the committee meeting. Behind the scenes, the bill’s original sponsor, former Sen. Wilfred Moore and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, its current sponsor, were on the phone with the decision-makers.

Even half an hour before the meeting started, all signs were the Liberals had no intention of withdrawing the amendments.

Moore said he arrived resigned to defeat.

“I knew if the Liberals went ahead with their amendments, we were sunk. I knew if it went back to the Senate, given the tactics that had been used by the opposition there and how they know how to work the rules, to rag the puck and run the clock down, it was over.”

While there are rules that allow a vote to be forced on a government bill, the same rules don’t extend to private members’ bills, which meant stalling tactics could have continued until the Senate rose for the summer. Ahead of the election, the bill would have died when the writ dropped.

The Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act was first introduced by Moore in December 2015. In addition to banning captivity, it includes a grandfather clause for those animals already in facilities in Canada and permits legitimate research, as well as the rescue of animals in distress. It would also ban breeding and the trade of reproductive materials, though nothing in the bill criminalizes the conduct of researchers. At committee in the Senate, the bill was amended to affirm the rights of Indigenous peoples.

Sen. Murray Sinclair took on sponsorship of the bill when Moore retired in January 2017.

The entire time the bill was in the Senate, it was up against a tide of Tory opposition led by Sen. Don Plett, the Conservative whip and caucus critic of the bill, who repeatedly used procedural obstruction to keep it from moving to a vote. It was a tactic that appeared to have the support of the Conservative caucus.

In late October 2018, the bill went to a vote in the Senate and was passed.

The Senate fisheries committee held 17 meetings to study the bill and heard from more than 40 witnesses from around the world.

Before Tuesday’s meeting started, Liberal MPs on the committee all walked out together and met in the hallway. NDP MP Gord Johns had walked over to the meeting with them and said he was really upset about what he thought was going to happen.

“I just thought it was a deep injustice. How could it happen after all this work and time? Clearly the arguments were there on the science and moral side,” he said.

“When I was sitting there (at the committee table) I wasn’t seething, but really feeling hurt, that this was wrong. To see the Liberals pull back their amendments and change their tune, I was completely blown away. A huge sense of relief and emotion hit me. I had been so upset and trying to contain my disappointment with my colleagues, but then I wanted to run over there and give them all hugs.”

Asked later why he’d withdrawn his amendments, Finnigan said he wasn’t comfortable with them.

“I was waiting for some clarification. I wasn’t comfortable without the clarification I was looking for so I decided to withdraw,” he said.

“There was some argument to be made for those amendments, but there were some questions I had on some of them.”

As for whether they’ll be put forward in Bill C-68, the government’s overhaul of the Fisheries Act which is now before the Senate and has some similar cetacean-related provisions, Finnigan said “it will be up to the Senate to decide whether they want to do that.”

Camille Labchuk, an animal rights lawyer and executive director of Animal Justice, said given that Liberals across the country were inundated with phone calls in recent days in ridings where people feel strongly about the issue, she had no doubt those MPs in turn put pressure on their colleagues on the committee and the minister on the file.

“We know it had an impact. There’s no way this bill would have come back from the brink at committee today without that support. Legislators heard us. I don’t think they were interested in going down in history as the folks who voted down this whale and dolphin protection bill.”

Barbara Cartwright, CEO of Humane Canada, a federation of SPCAs and humane societies, said the Canadian public really stepped up to make this happen.

“For it to get hung up on what seems like a procedural problem, it was devastating. I came here ready for it to be over. I’m shocked (by the outcome),” she said.

“It feels important because it’s going to shift the landscape with how cetaceans are treated in Canada and how we consume our entertainment. (Keeping cetaceans in captivity) is no longer acceptable and the country’s recognized that.”

NDP MP Fin Donnelly said the government should also be acknowledged.

“This was a good thing. They listened to the people, Canadians who were concerned about cetaceans. This is a victory for cetaceans.”

Former Marineland trainer Phil Demers, who has been an outspoken critic of the facility and the target of lawsuits as a result, was largely speechless when the meeting wrapped up.

“There’s an energy about this,” he said. “Ripples of divinity coming back from all the years of work. It’s hard to put into words. But it feels beyond surreal, almost magic.”

Johns said had things played out differently, hundreds of thousands of people across the country would have been furious.

“Apathy is real in the Canadian public about legislators doing the right thing and taking partisan politics out to do the right thing,” he said.

“When it comes to our whales, people expect that politicians are going to put their differences aside and put animal welfare ahead of politics.”

Moore was moved to introduce S-203 after watching the documentary Blackfish several times at the urging of his son. The film examines the plight of orcas in captivity through the story of Tilikum, an orca captured at a young age in Iceland and kept in tanks his entire life at several parks. Along the way he was involved in the deaths of three people.

If his bill passes in the House, it will be the first of its kind in North America. While Ontario and California have introduced similar legislation, their scope is more limited than what will come into effect here.

“It feels so good to do the right thing,” Moore said. “Canada is better for it.”

95,Canada,2019-04-03T17:13:00.0000000Z,"The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership. Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince ...","On Friday, Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen offered some advice to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he is likely to ignore. Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

She alleges that her refusal was the reason ...","OTTAWA—Liberal backbenchers and cabinet ministers alike condemned former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould on Monday for surreptitiously recording a phone conversation with the country’s top public servant, Michael Wernick.

For many of them, the recording was the last straw in the SNC-Lavalin saga that has engulfed the Trudeau government and proof that the former minister can’t be trusted as a member of the Liberal caucus.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould? Should be gone. Gone. Should’ve been gone long ago”, said Prince Edward Island MP Wayne Easter, calling her secret recording “about as low as you can go.”

The same sentiment was applied by most Liberal MPs to Jane Philpott, who quit cabinet in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould early last month, saying she no longer had confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“The moment you stop trusting the government, I mean obviously you shouldn’t be in the government or you shouldn’t be in the caucus that supports the government,” said Montreal MP Alexandra Mendes.

Easter, a longtime MP who once served as solicitor general, suggested Philpott might have been “used” by Wilson-Raybould and several others said they’d like to know whether she condoned the secret taping.

Wilson-Raybould submitted the 17-minute audio recording to the House of Commons justice committee last week to bolster her contention that she was improperly pressured last fall to intervene to stop the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. The recording confirms her earlier oral testimony about the content of a Dec. 19 phone conversation with Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council—although whether anything he said amounted to “veiled threats,” as she has alleged, is a matter of opinion.

In a written submission to the committee, Wilson-Raybould said she took the admittedly “extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step” of recording the conversation because she was home alone in Vancouver without a staffer to take notes and wanted to “ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.”

Tourism Minister Melanie Joly said if Wilson-Raybould simply wanted a record of what was said, she should have told Wernick she was taping the call for that purpose.

As it was, several Liberal MPs suggested the recording smacked of “entrapment.”

“In my listening to it, I felt she had to be reading from a script at times to try and draw out, to make the clerk and the prime minister and cabinet colleagues and us that sit in caucus with her look bad,” said Easter. “Of course I’m angry.”

Mendes called the secret recording “unethical” and “treasonous, really.”

“Even if she had taped that conversation for the purpose of bringing it to the prime minister’s attention, the thing is she never did.”

Montreal MP Marc Miller called the secret recording “distressing” and “somewhat repugnant.” He noted that courts are typically skeptical about such “one-sided” recordings because “there’s an ability of the person recording to prime the evidence, consciously or unconsciously.”

Toronto MP Adam Vaughan said the revelation “impacts the frankness by which we have conversations with people.”

A former journalist, Vaughan said: “I know that when you use a microphone and you know it’s being recorded and the other person doesn’t, it puts the other person at a significant disadvantage. It also puts the person recording it at inappropriate advantage. I think for those reasons there are rules for lawyers, there are rules for journalists, there are rules in place for how recorded conversations are used as evidence.”

Transport Minister Marc Garneau said it was “very inappropriate” to record the conversation without telling Wernick. “It is not an honourable thing to do.”

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have said they intend to remain in the Liberal caucus and run as Liberal candidates in this fall’s election.

“Why would I resign?” Wilson-Raybould told Global News as she left Parliament Hill on Monday. “I’m just doing the best job I can.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has thus far been unwilling to kick the former ministers out, maintaining that the Liberal party is a big tent that can accommodate diverse views. And until the secret recording was released Friday, Liberal ministers and backbenchers dutifully used Trudeau’s script.

They now appear determined to take the matter into their own hands at their weekly caucus meeting Wednesday. Some are pushing for an emergency meeting earlier to boot the pair of former ministers out of caucus as soon as possible.

But a handful of Liberals are still willing to accommodate the former ministers, both of them former stars in the cabinet whose open criticisms of Trudeau have coincided with noticeable declines in Liberal popularity.

“We’re putting it behind us and my aim is that (Wilson-Raybould) and Jane are welcome and comfortable as part of our caucus,” said Treasury Board president Joyce Murray.

While the secret tape has galvanized the Liberal caucus against Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, it has fortified opposition parties in their call for a thorough investigation of the entire SNC-Lavalin affair.

The recording proves Trudeau “not only had knowledge about the pressure being applied on the former attorney general but he and his office were, in fact orchestrating it,” Conservative House leader Candice Bergen told the Commons, accusing Trudeau of providing “false and deceitful information” to Canadians about the affair.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, meanwhile, launched a one-man filibuster of the government’s budget until the Liberals agree to further investigation of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“I have the ability to speak an unlimited period of time (on the budget) and I will be using that ability to demand the government end the coverup (and) agree to a parliamentary investigation into the SNC-Lavalin scandal,” he told a news conference before heading into the Commons to begin an hours-long speech.

House of Commons rules say the finance minister and the Opposition’s finance critic can speak as long as they want about the budget, but only within the time allotted each day for government business. That means Poilievre’s plan won’t disrupt most other activities in the Commons and he has to speak for only a few hours at a time. Debate on the budget is also restricted to four sitting days.

The Ottawa-area MP said he wants senior members of Trudeau’s staff, as well as the prime minister himself, to testify before the justice committee about the pressure exerted on Wilson-Raybould.

“When they agree to that, I’ll stop speaking.”

Wilson-Raybould has said she endured a months-long campaign of PMO pressure, including from Wernick and Butts, to arrange a so-called remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges that it used bribery and fraud to get business in Libya. Conviction could include a 10-year ban on bidding on federal contracts in Canada.

She alleges that her refusal was the reason Trudeau shuffled her out of the prestigious justice portfolio and into Veterans Affairs in mid-January. She resigned from cabinet a month later.","JWR, Philpott no longer welcome in Liberal caucus; secret tape the last straw",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/jwr-philpott-no-longer-welcome-in-liberal-caucus-secret-tape-the-last-straw-182525/
97,Business,2019-04-04T02:05:00.0000000Z,"Finance Minister Carole James introduced a bill Tuesday to launch a beneficial ownership registry, which would be the first of its kind in Canada and ... by B.C. Green party Leader Andrew Weaver ...","VICTORIA — People who hold an interest in B.C. property through corporations, trusts and numbered companies could soon have their names published in a government registry, according to new legislation.

Finance Minister Carole James introduced a bill Tuesday to launch a beneficial ownership registry, which would be the first of its kind in Canada and designed to increase transparency of land ownership in an attempt to combat tax fraud and money laundering.

“This act addresses government’s commitment to end the hidden ownership of land,” said James. “For years, people were able to use shell companies, trusts and partnerships to hide who really owns property in British Columbia.”

The registry, to go online in 2020, is intended to cut through the levels of secrecy and anonymity that surrounds corporate ownership of property through numbered companies, offshore trusts, blind trusts and corporations. Examples include when land is owned by one numbered company, which is then controlled by another numbered company, even though both companies are the same person.

James said the lack of transparency is contributing to money laundering, criminal activity and by extension the high price of real estate in Metro Vancouver.

“We need to make sure the opportunity is there to know who is behind those companies,” said James. “Because shining light on transparency is one of the best things you can do when you talk about money laundering or bad action when it comes to housing. We know that drives prices up.”

Whether increased transparency like this actually affects housing prices in Metro is legitimately unknown, said Tom Davidoff, the University of B.C.’s director of the Centre for Urban Economics and Real Estate. “It might. There’s certainly a view out there that people who don’t really want their identity to be known are putting money in Vancouver because it’s easy to hide your identity here. People think that’s a force in the housing market. I honestly don’t know the magnitude.

“To the extent it’s a big force, obviously this stuff does matter. To the extent it’s really rich millennials, immigration and rich guys from overseas who aren’t hiding their identity, then this is really more about tax fairness.”

The legislation also proposes to gather more information about beneficial ownership in bare trusts, though ministry officials confirmed it doesn’t immediately plug a loophole raised by B.C. Green party Leader Andrew Weaver that allows some people to get around property transfer taxes and land-title registration by simply selling controlling shares in companies that hold land rather than selling the land itself.

Opposition Liberal finance critic Tracy Redies said those types of outstanding issues raise questions about the effectiveness of the registry.

“Anything that prevents tax evasion is a good thing,” said Redies. “I guess we’re just trying to understand how this registry is going to be used … is it just about tax evasion or is it about finding more ways to tax companies and their assets?”

Redies said the government is already collecting a lot of personal data from people through this and other measures like the speculation tax, and she worries it could be used to craft new ways to tax people and businesses.

When the registry goes online later next year, the public will have access to names and property details similar to B.C.’s current land-title office, for a fee, said James.

More sensitive information will only be shared with law-enforcement, tax and regulatory agencies to address fraud and money laundering, said James.

The legislation proposes to record the names, birthdates, social insurance numbers, residency status and any relevant tax numbers of beneficial owners. Beneficial status is defined as anyone that stands to benefit by the land sale, as well as anyone who owns 10 or more per cent of the shares of a company, or anyone with the power to appoint or remove a corporate director.

Penalties for remaining hidden under the legislation include fines of up to $100,000, or 15 per cent of the assessed property values, for criminal offences.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the B.C. Green Party’s effective and harsh criticism of the new NDP legislation on LNG, the questions left unanswered after a new report on ride-hailing and the politics being played with big changes and caps to auto insurance.

The registry was a promise of the NDP’s housing affordability plan first announced in 2018. Since then, the government has consulted with the Union of B.C. Municipalities and produced a study paper with draft legislation for feedback.

Summary

A Conservative government will bring in tax-free home energy – completely removing the federal tax from your home heating and energy bills. This will save the average Canadian household $107 per year!

We will scrap the Liberals’ carbon tax, reverse Justin Trudeau’s increased taxes on daily essentials, and put that money back in your pocket.

Why

Heating your home in the winter isn’t a luxury for Canadians; it is a necessity. Currently, the federal government doesn’t tax most essentials.

Medical supplies, prescription drugs, and most groceries are all tax exempt. We don’t tax other basic necessities like groceries, and we shouldn’t be taxing home heating.

Trudeau’s Policy

At a time when Canadians are already paying big home heating and energy bills, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have introduced a Carbon Tax which will increase the cost of everyday essentials like gasoline, groceries, and home heating.

This will drive up the cost of heating your home even more.

Background Information

How much will the average Canadian household save?

The average household will save $107 per year, but some could save as much as $150.

What is included?

All home energy for primary residences – electricity, natural gas, heating oil, propane, wood pellets, and other heating sources will be exempt from the GST. The Canada Revenue Agency will work with utility companies to rebate the 5% GST to consumers, capped at $200 per household.

What is not included?

Commercial energy use will not be exempt from the GST. Investment properties will also not receive the exemption.",Conservative Party of Canada,Conservative Party of Canada,https://www.conservative.ca/home-heating/

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a press conference Tuesday that the pair had been expelled as the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin scandal continues.

Trudeau’s presser came minutes after Liberal MPs gathered on Parliament Hill for an emergency meeting to determine the future of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott in the party.

I have just been informed by the Prime Minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election. More to come… — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau said. “Earlier today, I met with caucus executive and leadership to hear the will of caucus. I met with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott to inform them of my decision.

“This has been a difficult few weeks for our government and for our Liberal team,” he continued.

“Amid the confusing and the competing narratives, Canadians rightly have had questions, and we wrestled with those questions too.”

WATCH: Trudeau says Wilson-Raybould secret recording is ‘unconscionable’

Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould’s decision to secretly record a phone conversation with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick was “unconscionable.”

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns, and ultimately, if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team … then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

“If a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone, it’s wrong. When that politician is a cabinet minister secretly recording a public servant, it’s wrong. And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general of Canada, secretly recording the clerk of the Privy Council, it’s unconscionable.”

He said the decision to remove Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from caucus was necessary because the Liberal Party couldn’t afford infighting ahead of the federal election.

“The old Liberal Party was notorious for infighting,” said Trudeau. “My leadership was a commitment to change that.

“Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about us than them. That’s why I made the difficult decision to remove Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott from caucus.”

Trudeau’s remarks were followed by loud applause and a standing ovation from caucus.

Wilson-Raybould tweeted that she was informed of the decision just prior to Trudeau’s press conference.

“What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party,” she said.

“I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do so.”

Philpott said in a statement that it was “disheartening” that she was expelled without being given a chance to speak to caucus.

“I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the prime minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould. These accusations were coupled with public suggestions that I should be forced out of caucus,” Philpott said.

“These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

Philpott insisted that there was clear political interference into Wilson-Raybould’s work, and said her constitutional obligations compelled her to resign as president of the treasury board.

“This isn’t about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty — in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence — but to no avail.

“This also isn’t about political advantage or strategy. It is frankly absurd to suggest that I would leave one of the most senior portfolios in government for personal advancement or merely out of friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

The Conservative Party slammed Trudeau’s decision to expel Wilson-Raybould and Philpott as a “betrayal of justice.”

“Today, Liberal MPs have let Canadians know where they stand. They have chosen to condemn colleagues who spoke truth to power and to prop up a prime minister who is drowning in scandal,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement.

“The message they have sent today is clear: If you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party of Canada.

“Canadians will view the removal of Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal caucus for exactly what it is: A betrayal of justice.

“Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them. However, in expelling Ms. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould from their caucus, they have done exactly that.”

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel criticized Trudeau for using women as “photo ops” before discarding them when they spoke out against him.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould deserved better.

“Ms. Wilson-Raybould wanted to do politics differently — putting integrity & what’s right for Canadians over what helps the Liberals,” Singh said in a tweet.

“Today PM Trudeau & the Liberal gov’t showed us exactly what they think about integrity. Thank you Jody for being loyal to [Canadians]. You deserve better.”

Earlier Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould sent caucus members a letter in which she defended her actions in the SNC-Lavalin affair and made a case for why she should be allowed to remain in caucus.

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” the letter read.

“In giving the advice I did and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess. I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened.”

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet over alleged political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The ensuing scandal has led to multiple resignations and damaged the party for eight weeks, with Trudeau’s approval rating dropping to record lows.

Wilson-Raybould testified before the House of Commons justice committee on Feb. 27, outlining in four explosive hours the details of what she described as a “consistent and sustained effort” to pressure her into intervening in the case by Trudeau and top political staffers.

But she was not invited back to address challenges to her testimony made during an appearance by Gerald Butts, former principal secretary to Trudeau, or in secondary appearances by Wernick or Deputy Attorney General Nathalie Drouin.

Instead, she submitted a package of material including a secretly recorded Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick that she said corroborated her testimony.

Wilson-Raybould faced criticism from her own party over her decision to secretly record her conversation with Wernick.

In the call, Wernick repeatedly asks Wilson-Raybould why she was not using all the tools at her disposal on the SNC-Lavalin case. She pushes back, saying she would not override the decision of the director of public prosecutions to pursue a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its activities in Libya.

Wernick told her Trudeau was “quite determined” on the matter and would likely “find a way to get it done one way or another.”

In the call, Wernick stated the prime minister was 'firm' on securing a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC Lavalin, the Quebec engineering company.

Wilson-Raybould called the phone call and previous conversations on the matter with senior people in government ""inappropriate"" and said they constituted ""political interference."" The clerk was not aware the conversation was recorded.

Conservative deputy leader Lisa Raitt sat down with The House to discuss her reactions to the tape.

""I think Jody Wilson-Raybould's testimony has only been underscored and affirmed and supported by the testimony that she delivered to the justice committee Friday,"" she said. ""But it's not different than what she said. The fact base that we had back when she gave her testimony is the same as it is now, but it has a bit more colour around it and it gives more detail and it gives more proof.""

Raitt said she wasn't sympathetic to the clerk, despite his obvious discomfort during the phone call, since she believes he did not have to make that call to Wilson-Raybould.

""The big thing for me that I took away was from what the clerk was saying, very clearly to Jody Wilson-Raybould, that if you do not find a way to deliver the solution that the prime minister wants, then you have to be aware of the fact that something could happen,"" she said.

China, Canada and Canola

China has banned shipments of canola from major Canadian companies, and some experts say it's a political move.

After Chinese authorities banned two major Canadian companies from shipping canola seed to China, producers say they're hoping for a quick resolution to the dispute — but are prepared to look to other markets.

Earlier this month, Chinese customs authorities revoked the licence of Winnipeg-based agricultural handler Richardson International, and then pulled a similar move on Regina-based Viterra Inc. on Tuesday.

China alleges Canadian canola has harmful pests in it, but the ban is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive with Chinese telecom giant Huawei, at the behest of the United States.

""It's certainly not about the quality of Canadian canola, in my mind,"" Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada, told Chris Hall, host of CBC Radio's The House, in an interview airing Saturday.

Last week, the Canola Council of Canada announced orders from China had mysteriously dried up for a number of canola sellers other than Richardson and Viterra.

On Friday, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said the government is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's ban on Canadian canola imports.

But Everson — who met with with the two ministers on Friday — said he is hoping China's market reopens soon.

As China shuts down more canola imports from Canada claiming they're contaminated, we talk to the president of the Canola Council of Canada about what this means for the industry and what farmers want the government to do. 6:49

""We've talked to [the ministers] quite a bit about the issues in terms of re-engaging and engaging China and restoring that market, and that's the first priority,"" Everson said, adding he hopes the government sends a delegation to China to address the issue.

Everson said producers are ready to look elsewhere to sell their canola, but added that it might be a difficult task, given that roughly 40 per cent of Canadian canola seed exports normally go to China.

""It is very difficult to very quickly diversify away from such an important market to other market opportunities,"" he said.

Six months from an election

Only six months remain before the federal election and the question remains how the SNCLavalin scandal, trade tensions with China and the newly introduced federal budget will affect the results. The strategist panel — Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party, Hamish Marshall, chair of the Conservative campaign and Michael Belagus, campaign co-chair for the NDP — weighed in on each party's strategy this election year.

Cowan acknowledged the damage the SNCLavalin scandal has done to the Liberal Party and the prime minister, but said its members remain focused.

""Obviously it's been a tough news cycle and it's been going on for quite some time,"" said Cowan. ""This will likely continue to percolate for some time, but really where my team and I've been focused is ... on supporting the team, nominating candidates, supporting the prime minister and getting ready for what was always going to be a challenging campaign.""

Belagus and Marshall both said they think the SNCLavalin scandal will benefit the NDP and the Conservatives politically.

""There is a real sense of disappointment with the prime minister, a lot of people who came to us and said, 'Hey, look, I voted Conservative when you guys won a majority in 2011, but I was tired of Harper and I wanted a change,"" said Marshall.

""Trudeau seemed like change and, wow, was that a mistake. And we get that again and again and it's not just in, you know, seats we lost by a couple of points, so you'd expect we're hearing that in the core of Toronto and right across the country.""

On foreign policy and the recent canola seed trade conflict with China, the panel agreed that how a party deals with those issues is going to be important to voters.

2019 has been a busy year so far, and it's only March. With the clock ticking down to the federal election in October, how are the parties preparing? We ask three backroom strategists working on the campaign plans for the NDP, Conservatives and Liberals. Michael Balagus, Hamish Marshall and Suzanne Cowan join us. 12:56

""Yeah, I would agree that foreign policy as it affects jobs, as it affects people's ability to earn a living, is the prism that, come election time, people look at it through,"" said Belagus. ""But I would add one more layer. I think foreign policy is also an opportunity where voters can get a sense of a leader and a party's values.""

Notwithstanding whether the federal government's newly announced budget will make an impact on the Liberal Party's prospects this year, Cowan said the government takes those budget commitments seriously.

""These were tangible plans to implement a national pharmacare program, which is a huge priority for Canadians and has been for this Liberal government,"" said Cowan. ""We as the government are in a position to actually (produce) action and not just talk about it, and we are taking a responsible approach to that.""",The House: A tale of the tape,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/the-house-a-tale-of-the-tape-1.5077180

On Sunday, Notley promised to balance the province’s budget by 2023-24, as she unveiled her party’s election platform. She also pledged to expand $25-per-day child care, build long-term care beds for seniors and construct new schools.

Notley’s date for balancing the books is a year later than what’s promised by her principal rival, Jason Kenney. But Notley says Kenney’s math doesn’t add up.

Where the leaders were Monday on the campaign trail:

NDP Leader Rachel Notley

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley says the United Conservative Party’s budget plan will leave oil in the ground, limit job creation and cost the province $2.2 billion in royalties.

Notley says UCP Leader Jason Kenney needs to account for lost revenue in his budget platform, since he would cancel the government’s plan to get more oil to market by leasing rail cars. Kenney has said the $3.7-billion lease deal doesn’t make financial sense.

Notley will get a chance to put her concerns to Kenney directly in the leaders’ debate Thursday. Her campaign team has confirmed she will join three other party leaders in the televised forum.

Notley commented on Kenney’s budget plan Monday while in Calgary on Monday as the election campaign nears its midpoint. Notley told reporters the rail lease deal will move an additional 120,000 barrels a day.

“Not only will this investment make a $2.2-billion profit for Albertans, it will help get people back to work,” she said.

“It will help us get our production up so we can bring curtailment to an end sooner, and it will do so of course without affecting (rail) shipments of our agricultural goods.”

Since the start of the year, Notley’s government has also mandated production cuts in oil for large producers to reduce a widening gap in prices that threatened layoffs or similar drastic industry countermeasures.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney says if he wins the Alberta election, a formal court challenge of the federal carbon tax will be launched by the end of the month.

Kenney, who has already pledged to axe Alberta’s carbon tax, says he would instruct his attorney general to file the challenge in Alberta’s Appeal court no later than April 30.

“It is in Alberta’s vital economic interests, for the future of jobs and prosperity in this province, that we not only defeat this tax-hiking NDP government, but that we also defeat their close ally in Ottawa — Justin Trudeau,” Kenney said Monday.

“I, as leader of the United Conservative party, will do everything within our power to ensure that he is not returned as prime minister.”

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel

Mandel talked about how an Alberta Party government would keep more of Albertans’ money within the province, to help fund schools, hospitals and other provincial services and reduce what he says is a power imbalance between Alberta and the federal government.

“Every year, Albertans send billions of dollars to Ottawa that aren’t spent on Albertans, but instead given away to other provinces,” Mandel said in a statement.

“And in return, we receive rejection, scorn and attacks on our industries and our way of life. We see that with a hijacked coastline, and an unfair equalization program, and refusals to consider pipelines like Energy East.”

Mandel would demand Alberta have the same powers and privileges as Quebec.

“Albertans are tired of being taken for granted by Ottawa and others. The NDP have been in cahoots with the Trudeau government and failed us. Jason Kenney failed us when he was in Ottawa for nearly 20 years,” Mandel said.

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan

In Calgary, Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan announced the party’s affordable dental care platform.

“Albertans are paying the highest dental prices in Canada,” Khan said. “We will bring prices down for all Albertans.”

The Liberal party would make the industry more competitive by directing the Alberta Dental Association and College allow dentists greater freedom to advertise their services.

The party would also lift restrictions on dentists being able to offer promotions or special pricing for groups such as seniors or children. Dentists would be required to discuss prices up front and publicly list their standard prices in comparison to the Dental Fee Guide.

“These consumer-friendly changes will drive prices down. We will also make the Dental Fee Guide mandatory for essential dental services,” Khan said.

The Liberals would improve access to dental services for children and low-income people with a $50-million funding increase to affordable, community-based dental care.

“We will pressure the federal government to fund a universal essential dental care program. This will be achieved by working to build consensus among the provinces for this program.”

102,,2019-04-04T06:43:00.0000000Z,"It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities. So at this critical juncture ...","The ghastly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand recently show that the rise of far-right extremism has not only proven itself to be a major global threat to peace and security, but also an existential threat to conservatism itself, which has come under heavy fire for breeding, or at least tolerating in its ranks, xenophobic elements.

In a way, the New Zealand attacks may prove to become a pivotal moment for the right-wing.

Though the racism of far-right extremism has long been identified as something real and dangerous, it has also, to a large extent, remained under the radar; something ugly simmering under the surface.

But after 50 people (nearly all visible minorities) were slaughtered at a house of worship, in a modern western nation deemed to be one of the safest in the world, that ugliness has boiled over for the world to see.

What’s now clear is that it’s past time for conservatives to utterly separate themselves from any notion or any segment of their membership base that ascribes even remotely to xenophobic or Islamophobic views. It should go without saying that conservatism is a movement in which racists are not welcome. Unfortunately, this is a message that must now be shouted by conservatives across the world, including here in Canada, where anti-immigrant views have, as of late, begun to stain the brand.

READ MORE: When terror strikes the populist leaders cash in

After the New Zealand mosque attack, the leader of the People’s Party of Canada refused to offer comment (even to denounce it). Similarly, the leader of the Conservative Party’s first statement focused on how “freedom” had come under attack (not Muslims), needing a second try to get it right. The delay left the impression that the Conservative Party feared alienating a kind of voter who may hold anti-immigrant views.

Both parties have also been skeptical of Canada’s signing of the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. The Conservatives have argued that it will erode the sovereignty of our borders, while the PPC says it will open the doors to masses of migrants from poor countries. Both claims seem geared toward stoking fear among anti-immigration voters, and contrary to the reality of the massive value of immigration.

Of course, south of the border, the president of the United States has openly fraternized with far right and white supremacists while routinely raising fears about immigrants, whether it’s about building a wall to keep out Mexicans or imposing a travel ban to keep out Muslims.

It’s as if an element of the right has forgotten, or perhaps has simply not truly understood, that there is a huge difference between “nationalism” and “nation building”.

“Nationalism” as we understand it today, is increasingly a movement based on bigotry and fear-based racism—one that’s often associated with populist far right movements in Europe that have ridden a wave of anti-migrant sentiment. “Nation building” however, is a very different and noble cause; one that is about wanting to make your country great—it is not to be associated with the pettiness of racism, bigotry or Islamophobia at all.

There needs to be a refocus on positive conservatism, a movement that embraces immigration and minorities. After all, immigration is what made the U.S. the dominant power in the world, by welcoming and nurturing the best minds to fuel technology and ingenuity. (Immigrants contribute 10 per cent of America’s annual GDP and are, according to the Brookings Institution, more likely to become Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine.)

We’ve seen the immense benefits of immigration here as well, but there’s a lot more potential we have yet to tap into. And conservative thinking should be obsessed with wanting to build Canada up to reach its true greatness.

Conservatism at its best is a movement that champions individual liberties and fiscal responsibility; small government and social values. Campassionate conservatives also believe in helping others, be they refugees or fellow citizens. It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities.

So at this critical juncture, what is stopping Canadian conservatives from building a party that embraces open doors and offers a safe haven to the world’s most needy, while making Canada an economic powerhouse? Nothing. Because most right of centre voters in Canada are welcoming to refugees and immigrants and would welcome the economic growth and innovation they bring.

This is what the new conservatism, a positive conservatism, can look like. It’s got to be about nation building, not nationalism. It’s got to be about achieving the best for Canada, in a way that includes everybody, and cuts at the root of far-right extremism. It’s time to make a separation between racist nationalism, and the positive, inclusive patriotism of nation building.

The report comes at a time when Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party is planning, if it wins the election on April 16, to pick a fight over equalization payments, another federal program to which Albertans contribute disproportionately.

Unlike equalization, though, provinces can opt out of participation in the CPP; Quebec already has.

In 2017, 16.5 per cent of all CPP contributions came from Alberta workers, while just 10.6 per cent of CPP expenditures made their way back to the province. The difference between what was paid in and paid out was $2.9 billion in 2017, the most recent year for which data are available. (Alberta paid in $8.1 billion and received $5.2 billion.) Between 2008 and 2017, Albertans have contributed $27.9 billion more to CPP than retirees in the province have received back.

“What we were trying to do is really use a case study to illustrate the disproportionate contributions Albertans make to national programs,” said Jason Clemens, one of the study’s authors, in an interview on Tuesday.

Ontario is the next highest contributing province in Canada. Over the same period, from 2008 to 2017, Ontario paid in $7.4 billion more than it received back — more than $20 billion less than the loss in Alberta, and that’s in a province with more than 14 million people, compared to Alberta’s roughly four million.

However, Ontario’s fortunes turned around in 2017. The province contributed about $24 billion, but received back about $25 billion.

British Columbia paid in $8.2 billion in 2017, and received back $8 billion.

Were Alberta to drop out of the CPP — which Clemens says they’re not recommending — other provinces would have to pick up the slack by raising individual contribution rates. Were the province to withdraw, Albertans could pay as low as 5.85 per cent into an Alberta pension plan, while the rest of the country would need to up their contributions from 9.9 per cent (the 2017 contribution rate) to 10.6 per cent, the study says. The federal government already raised the contribution rate (shared equally by employers and employees) to 10.2 per cent in January, and plan to increase it to 11.9 per cent by 2023.

There are three main reasons why Albertans pay more into CPP than what retirees get out of it. More Albertans are of working age — between 15 and 64 — compared to the province’s overall population, than in other provinces in Canada.

Among that group, there are traditionally higher employment rates in Alberta. “Which means they have a higher share of the population that’s working,” Clemens said.

And, as is a partial explanation for higher equalization contributions, Albertans simply make more money than workers in other provinces, so the province has more contributions per worker. What the study does, Clemens said, is point out to the rest of Canada the contributions Alberta makes to federal programming, and it helps explain why Albertans feel left behind by the federal government and other provinces.

“The hope would be back to the discussion of, there’s a give and take,” Clemens said. “The rising frustration in Western Canada, particularly in Alberta, is legitimate, in terms of what is the balance right now of the give and take?”

JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

The leader of Alberta’s NDP is looking to win over voters who chose right-leaning candidates in the past, saying the rival United Conservative Party has not rid itself of its predecessors’ biggest shortcomings: the Progressive Conservatives’ sense of entitlement and the Wildrose’s intolerance.

“What is more clear every day is that Mr. Kenney didn’t bring the best of the PCs and the Wildrose together,” Rachel Notley said Wednesday. “He brought the sky palace to the shores of the lake of fire.”

A penthouse suite atop Edmonton’s Federal Building, dubbed the “sky palace,” came to symbolize what was perceived as a sense of entitlement by a former PC government led by Alison Redford.

In the 2012 election, the Wildrose Party blew a late lead in the polls, in part, because then-party leader Danielle Smith refused to sanction a candidate who penned an anti-gay blog urging homosexuals to repent or face eternal damnation in hell’s “lake of fire.”

Notley said she respects why people had put their trust in the long-governing former Progressive Conservative party, since it had a strong tradition of defending Alberta. But she said the PCs were in power too long and left working people vulnerable by not doing enough to diversify the economy.

Notley’s New Democrats toppled the PCs after 44 years in power by winning a majority in the 2015 election. The PCs and Wildrose merged to form the UCP in 2017.

In the leadup to the April 16 election, two UCP Calgary candidates — Caylan Ford and Eva Kiryakos — resigned over intolerant remarks.

The candidate for Drayton Valley-Devon, Mark Smith, has also been criticized for past remarks about homosexuality. He was the UCP’s education critic.

On Tuesday, audio surfaced from a sermon Smith delivered in 2013 that was posted on the website of the Calvary Baptist Church in Drayton Valley, Alta.

On the recording, Smith discusses how TV programs try to convince people that love among homosexuals is “good love.”

Story continues below advertisement

“Heck, there are even people out there, I could take you, I could take to you places on the website, I’m sure, where you could find out that there’s, where pedophilia is love,” he said in the recording.

Smith said he did not mean to equate homosexuality to pedophilia.

“I believe that people have the right to choose to be in the relationship that they desire. My comments from 2013 did not reflect that belief, and I unequivocally apologize for this. Period,” he wrote on Facebook.

Kenney said Wednesday he condemns Smith’s past remarks, but that the candidate would continue to run for the UCP on the values of “inclusion and dignity.” Kenney said he hoped Smith would reach out to LGBTQ Albertans.

Other candidates have replaced Ford and Kiryakos. When asked if Smith is staying on because the nomination deadline has passed, Kenney did not answer directly.

“Mr. Smith has been a member of the legislature for the past four years and his conduct suggests to me that he respects the policy of our party, which is one of respect for people regardless of who they love, their sexual orientation or sexual identity,” Kenney said.

Notley said she expects the UCP record on LGBTQ issues will be a big ballot box consideration, along with the economy.

“We cannot let our economic troubles, as frustrating as they are, be an excuse to abandon our better selves,” she said.","Alberta’s UCP brings together worst of former PCs and Wildrose, Rachel Notley says",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-albertas-ucp-brings-together-worst-of-former-pcs-and-wildrose-rachel/

Yes, you read that right, Andrew Scheer and his Conservative Party think that it's a good idea to send mass-texts to campaign against the federal government's carbon tax.

This new tactic comes on the heels of new campaign ads released this week that accuses Justin Trudeau of being a ""fake feminist"". Canada's official opposition party is still using classic outreach tactics like television advertising and door-to-door campaigning, but this mass-text initiative is a clever new tactic.

In an apparent effort to modernize the campaigning process, Andrew Scheer and his Conservative government believe this to be the best way to reach a massive amount of voters.

The party is taking phone numbers from various databases and will randomly generate other numbers. So even if you're not a card-carrying Conservative, you might just get a text today.

TL;DR Canada's Conservative Party might just send you a mass-text today to campaign against Justin Trudeau's proposed carbon tax. Andrew Scheer and the Conservative party believe that this controversial initiative is all about utilizing 21st-century methods to help with voter outreach. Critics say that this isn't illegal, but it's definitely unconventional.

@cpc_hqembedded via

You might remember that this isn't the Conservative Party's first foray into using technology to attract voters. In 2011, Stephen Harper's government used robocalls to attract voters and to report fake polling information.

After over 40,000 Canadians reported them to the authorities, the Conservatives quickly backtracked and apologized for using such murky campaigning tactics.

According to a CBC report, the federal carbon tax will kick in on April 1st in four provinces, which will increase gas prices by almost 5 cents per litre. In the House of Commons, Trudeau's government has come under fire because of this proposed carbon tax.

@cpc_hqembedded via

Liberals are quick to point out that 90% of the revenue will return to Canadians, as each household in the affected provinces will be able to claim a tax deduction on the carbon tax.

Conservative provincial governments in Ontario and Saskatchewan are challenging the plan in provincial courts, claiming that the carbon tax is unconstitutional.

One of the texts will read ""Andrew Scheer here. Trudeau's carbon tax will raise gas prices 5 cents on Monday, so fill your tank!"" There are a few more texts planned as well.

So the Conservative party is now spamming us with text messages... not cool. Thumbs down! Lost my vote, ha! You never had it to begin with. Solitifies my vote to vote against the conservatives. No privacy and no integrity. Slimy like a used car salesman! pic.twitter.com/w5x6jbRmZx — Kim (@kimacox3) March 28, 2019

Conservatives are quick to accuse the Liberals of instituting a carbon tax as a ""cash grab"". The Liberals retort by saying that this is in the name of environmental protection. Trudeau's government says that this policy is an attempt to meet emissions reduction goals for 2030.

Experts say that placing a carbon tax on the most polluting industries is the easiest and cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Canadians who are affected by this carbon tax may not agree with that but since Trudeau is offering a tax deduction on affected expenses, they might come to appreciate it.

I'm not sure of how effective it is to mass-text Canadian citizens to promote your political party, but the Conservatives seem to think it'll work out for them. We'll see how this plays out.

If you get a text from a weird number today, that might just be Andrew Scheer hitting you up. You won't be able to text back though!

April 1 was Day 1 of the federal carbon-tax backstop, imposed on the four provinces that have failed to bring in their own carbon taxes. The four – Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Ontario – are run by conservative governments. Canadian conservative parties now practise uncompromising opposition to carbon pricing; they insist that it’s a plot to spark a recession and destroy your family’s finances.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative government did not declare April 1 as a day of mourning, but that’s only because “Ontario’s Government for the People” is visibly gleeful at the arrival of Trudeau’s Tax. They think attacking it is a winner. So do Andrew Scheer’s federal Conservatives.

On the evening of March 31, nearly all of Mr. Ford’s MPPs dutifully drove to gas stations and took photos and videos of themselves filling their cars. Then, just in time for Easter, they tweeted out their take on the (service) stations of the cross: the last day before carbon taxes; the last hour before carbon taxes; the moment at midnight when carbon taxes were loosed upon the world, the price of regular unleaded went up by 4.4 cents a litre, and Armageddon began.

But back to where we started: Carbon taxes, today’s conservative bugbear, began life as a conservative idea.

They’re an economically logical, pro-market way of lowering greenhouse-gas emissions. A way of using prices – the basic mechanism of free markets – to reduce pollution. A way of putting billions of small environmental decisions in the hands of millions of people, rather than handing them over to a big government bureaucracy. And a way to tax something societies need less of, namely pollution, while lowering taxes on things we all want more of, like business investment and personal income.

And it wasn’t just egghead economists or cranky right-wing think-tankers who favoured carbon taxes. In 2008, the government of British Columbia – the Liberal Party, a.k.a. B.C.’s conservative party – brought in carbon taxes on fuels such as gasoline.

It was and still is a model for the rest of the country, since it was intended to be revenue-neutral – with every cent raised by the carbon tax going back into people’s pockets, mostly through tax reductions. Thanks in part to carbon taxes, lower- and middle-income earners in B.C. pay the country’s lowest income taxes.

Story continues below advertisement

Then in 2014, Preston Manning, the godfather of Canada’s modern conservative movement, came out in favour of carbon taxes.

In Ontario, the pre-Doug Ford version of the PC Party was all for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Until Patrick Brown’s leadership imploded a little over a year ago, that was the Ontario PC platform. Higher taxes on pollution were going to pay for lower taxes on everything else.

Conservatives are usually in favour of remembering and honouring history but, on this topic, not so much. What happened to the Ontario PC’s pre-Ford platform? It’s now the Trudeau government platform.

In Ontario, gas prices went up by 4.4 cents a litre on Monday, thanks to Ottawa’s carbon tax. But the feds are returning every cent raised at the pump to the people and businesses of the province. The average person will receive more in rebates than they pay in carbon taxes.

The carbon tax, however, will bite a little. It’s supposed to. The whole point of raising the price of gasoline is to push people to think about how to avoid those costs coming out of their left pocket, while enjoying the carbon-tax rebate in their right pocket. A slightly more fuel-efficient car? Driving less? Taking public transit to work sometimes? The idea is to leave it to people to decide for themselves if they want to lower their carbon costs, and how to do so.

That used to be a conservative idea. Yes, really.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh

EDMONTON – Alberta’s NDP is calling on United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney to fire former education critic Mark Smith for offensive remarks – an accusation Smith disputes.

NDP candidate Sarah Hoffman says Kenney must cancel Smith’s candidacy in the April 16 provincial election.

“Mark Smith’s comments are offensive, homophobic and completely neglect women’s rights,” Hoffman said in a statement issued Tuesday.

“Jason Kenney must fire him immediately.”

Smith, a former high school teacher who is running for re-election in Drayton Valley-Devon, had served as the caucus education critic.

Earlier Tuesday, a snippet of audio surfaced on social media from a sermon he delivered in 2013 that was posted on the website of the Calvary Baptist Church in Drayton Valley.

On the recording, Smith is heard questioning how anyone who has an abortion could say it’s done out of love.

He also discusses how TV programs try to convince people that love among homosexuals is “good love.”

“Heck, there are even people out there, I could take you, I could take to you places on the website I’m sure, where you could find out that there’s, where pedophilia is love,” he said in the recording.

Smith issued a statement on social media later Tuesday.

In it, he said he doesn’t recall making the remarks, but said, “I did not say that love between same-sex couples was not love. I merely remarked on media commentary.

“That said, I regret how my commentary was framed at the time,” wrote Smith.

“Of course I do not believe that homosexuality is akin to pedophilia. I unequivocally apologize if anyone was offended or hurt. Obviously that would never be my intention.

“Our leader and party have been clear. It doesn’t matter who you love or how you worship. All are welcome in our party and I am fully supportive of that.”

The recording was posted Tuesday on Twitter by Gaywire, a show that airs on Edmonton radio station CJSR.

The UCP has already seen two of its Calgary candidates – Caylan Ford and Eva Kiryakos – resign over intolerant remarks on social media.

The issue of LGBTQ rights and protections for minorities have become an issue in the Alberta election, with critics of Kenney saying he cannot be trusted to enforce them.

But Kenney, a Catholic, has promised that if he becomes premier he would not legislate on divisive social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage that have already been settled by courts and lawmakers.

However he has been criticized for promising to roll back some legislated protections for children who join gay-straight alliance clubs at schools.

112,Politics,2019-04-02T00:13:00.0000000Z,"The Conservative MP for the riding of Carleton ... but they have a GDP per capita that is almost the same as Canada, even though it’s a, what shall I call it, a city-state….”","OTTAWA — It was a little after 5:30 p.m. on Monday afternoon, and Pierre Poilievre was regaling a mostly-empty House of Commons chamber with an ode to Hong Kong’s criminal justice system.

The Conservative MP for the riding of Carleton had already been on his feet speaking for about four hours that day, but he showed no sign of slowing down.

“Hong Kong has a British legal system, respected around the world — at least for now,” Poilievre said. “Commercial interests from around the world actually go to Hong Kong to litigate their differences, because the system there is so successful in managing British common law, inherited from generations of the British people who brought that system over to that jurisdiction before the reunification. Therefore, we won’t get into the quality of life of Hong Kong, but they have a GDP per capita that is almost the same as Canada, even though it’s a, what shall I call it, a city-state….”

And so it went for some time. If the very few other members in the House listened long enough, they would hear Poilievre’s speech come back around to the subject he was ostensibly there to discuss — the SNC-Lavalin scandal and the importance of Canada’s independent criminal justice system — before veering off on another tangent.

Poilievre was in the midst of a “marathon speech,” as he put it — a one-man protest over the disinterest Liberal members of the House justice committee have shown in further investigating how senior members of the Liberal government put pressure on then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Before entering the House earlier that day, Poilievre — a veteran for his years, having served in the House since his election in 2004 at the age of 24 — had promised reporters he would speak for “hours and hours on end,” filling the Commons with his dulcet tones “until the Prime Minister agrees to end the cover-up and begin the investigation so Canadians can get the full truth.”

Whether his efforts can accurately be called a filibuster is a matter of some debate among parliamentary procedure wonks. The speech is expected to last for four days (though it will break around 6:30 p.m. each evening and continue the next morning), but it won’t actually disrupt any government business.

Instead, it will simply take up all of the time allotted for responses to the Liberal government’s budget, preventing any other MP from speaking on the budget. By the standing orders of the Commons, there must be four days of debate after the budget is tabled, and the first opposition speaker has no time limit on their speech. Thus, Poilievre is speaking for four days.

It is a much less punishing tactic than the one they deployed two weeks ago, when the Conservatives forced the chamber through a gruelling all-night voting session on spending estimates. But they won’t have the chance to do that again until June, most likely, so they are using the tools they have available as the opposition to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the spotlight, and demand that more witnesses be called to testify at the justice committee.

Across the chamber, the Liberal benches were nearly deserted, just six MPs obliging Poilievre with an audience. Among them, however, was the central figure in the SNC-Lavalin affair, Wilson-Raybould herself. Though present, her attention seemed to come and go; she seemed to pay little attention to Poilievre’s Hong Kong soliloquy, for example, typing messages on her phone instead.

Despite the controversy in which she has embroiled the government, Wilson-Raybould’s seat in the House of Commons remains in the front row on the Liberal side. That may soon change, as Liberal MPs have started publicly musing about ejecting Wilson-Raybould from caucus.

Should that happen, Wilson-Raybould would join the archipelago of misfits in the back corners of the chamber, among them Maxime Bernier (who quit the Conservatives to start his own party), Erin Weir (who was booted from the NDP over his response to a harassment investigation), and Wilson-Raybould’s friend Celina Caesar-Chavannes (who quit the Liberals after slamming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in an interview). Another former cabinet minister, ex-Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, may be sentenced to join Wilson-Raybould there after herself resigning over the Lavalin scandal.

Many Liberals were especially upset over Friday’s revelation that Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded a phone call with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, a recording she then submitted to the justice committee as evidence.

“That tells me that we have a real problem, that I don’t feel safe in caucus,” Liberal MP Rob Oliphant told reporters Monday, explaining that he wouldn’t want his own conversations secretly recorded. “And so I would want caucus to act.”

Commercial interests from around the world actually go to Hong Kong to litigate their differences, because the system there is so successful in managing British common law, inherited from generations of the British people who brought that system over to that jurisdiction before the reunification... Pierre Poilievre

Transport Minister Marc Garneau wouldn’t speak to what caucus would do, but he also condemned Wilson-Raybould’s choice to record Wernick. “It is not an honourable thing to do,” he said.

The Conservatives will be presenting a motion at the justice committee on Tuesday morning to add more sittings for the SNC-Lavalin study and invite witnesses who haven’t yet been called. The committee is already in possession of additional evidence tabled by Gerald Butts, the former principal secretary to Trudeau who resigned over the SNC-Lavalin affair on Feb. 18; the evidence, consisting largely of text messages, is expected to be made public on Tuesday.

And if the Conservative motion is voted down, Poilievre will continue his House of Commons marathon monologue, while his colleagues start looking for their next opportunity to keep the SNC-Lavalin story alive.

Trudeau told an emergency meeting of legislators on Tuesday that former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott had undermined the party and betrayed its trust.

The almost two-month old scandal centered on Wilson-Raybould, who in February said officials had inappropriately pressured her while she was justice minister to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc would escape a corruption trial.

In recent weeks, senior party figures and lawmakers had grown frustrated with Trudeau’s handling of the crisis, especially since both former ministers remained in the caucus despite their open hostility.

A long list of ministers and Liberal parliamentarians echoed Trudeau’s emphasis on party unity on Wednesday, but the opposition reiterated that the expulsions were proof of a cover up.

It is too soon to say whether Trudeau’s problems are over, political analysts said.

“This scandal has blotted out the sun. Now the question is, did he kill it?” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker. Last week Ipsos put the Conservative Party 10 points ahead of the Liberals, thanks to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“This issue has taken Trudeau into a territory where he could really lose,” Bricker said, adding that while the prime minister had now shored up his standing as party leader, he still must win back public opinion.

But another pollster, Frank Graves at Ekos, said there were signs the damage had been limited and that there was fatigue over the issue among the general public. Ekos polls showed the Liberals had lost 3-4 percentage points during the scandal.

“But the numbers we are seeing now are same as they were before,” Graves said.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, who quit as minister because she disagreed with how the SNC Lavalin affair was being managed, stood side-by-side while speaking to reporters on Wednesday.

They said they had defended the independence of the judiciary and had no regrets, but they stopped short of attacking Trudeau head on or threatening legal recourse.

The affair has hurt the prime minister’s image as a self-avowed feminist and a leader who has taken to heart the cause of Canada’s indigenous population.

He recruited candidates such as Wilson-Raybould, who was named as the first indigenous justice minister, and Philpott in part because they were new to politics.

During a special event in parliament aimed at encouraging more women to get involved in politics, some of the attendees turned their backs on Trudeau as he spoke, prompting several of his Cabinet ministers to come to his defense.

“We have a strong prime minister that is a feminist,” Tourism Minister Melanie Joly told reporters.

“I would argue that loyalty and feminism are two different things. There’s no male or female definition of loyalty. Either you want to work in a team, or you don’t.”","Embattled Trudeau buoyed by party, could still face wrath of Canadian voters",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1RF2GL-OCADN

But was it?

It certainly looked like it in the aftermath of the story that broke when CJSR, a campus radio station at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, played parts of a recording of a sermon by Mr. Smith to his Baptist church in the Drayton Valley-Devon riding made before he entered politics and left online. He was first elected as a Wildrose MLA in 2015.

The reaction to Pastor Smith’s sermon was harsh, including from conservative commentators whom one might have expected to be more forgiving of offensive commentary by members of the party of Jason Kenney. After all, there have been more than two dozen bozo eruptions and Mr. Kenney has forgiven many of them.

But there was something different about Mr. Smith’s ugly message to his former congregants, delivered in a smug preacher voice, that “You don’t have to watch any TV for any length of time today where you don’t see on the TV programs them trying to tell you that homosexuality and homosexual love is good love. Heck, there are even people out there, I could take you to places on the website, I’m sure, where you could find out that there’s … where pedophilia is love.”

This was all the more troubling because Mr. Smith is an accredited schoolteacher, lately touted as a likely minister of education in a Kenney cabinet. He is the man, in other words, who would be in charge of satisfying the UCP’s many opponents of LGBTQ rights in the controversy about NDP legislation, unpopular with social conservatives, that prevents school officials from outing students to their parents if they join a gay-straight alliance.

In a scathing interview on Toronto conservative broadcaster Charles Adler’s program, Edmonton radio host Ryan Jespersen, a small-c conservative commentator, bitterly denounced Mr. Smith and, by extension, Mr. Kenney for tolerating him and his offensive and out-dated views.

“It does represent Jason Kenney’s values, and that’s why Jason Kenney’s not doing a damn thing about it,” Mr. Jespersen fumed to Mr. Adler. “Jason Kenney is beholden to the Wilberforce Project, he’s beholden to Right Now, he’s beholden to Parents for Choice in Education, he’s beholden to the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, he’s beholden to Ezra Levant and Rebel Media, he’s beholden to John Carpay who has compared the Pride flag to the Nazi swastika, he’s beholden to home schoolers and anti-vaxxers, he’s beholden to anti-choice activists, he’s beholden to the people on the fringe that are providing a huge amount of support to him from the social conservative side of things.”

He continued: “What I want to do right now is ask my friends who are in the centre, or the centre right, of the spectrum, that have conservative values but that have a moral compass … how in good faith they are going to support a party that is supporting candidates that are making disgusting comments like the ones that Mark Smith made five years ago in front of a congregation full of people?”

The full clip is worth a listen.

The term Lake of Fire, by the way, is a reference to comments made by another evangelical pastor, Allan Hunsperger, that people who live a gay lifestyle are doomed to burn forever in a lake of fire. Pastor Hunsperger’s blog post was discovered just before the 2012 election that the Wildrose Party was widely expected to win.

It proved to be a dramatic turning point in that election. Albertans swiftly turned against the Wildrose Party, and the Progressive Conservatives were re-elected under Alison Redford.

But Pastor Hunsperger seemed sincerely motivated by a wish to help people avoid the eternal fate he believed they faced. In that regard, at least, his words were not as offensive as those of Pastor Smith, who, when discovered, said he didn’t remember speaking them, then issued an apology of the sorry-if-anyone-took-offence variety.

As for Mr. Kenney, he failed to live up to his long-ago promise to dump any candidate who expressed such opinions. It is also pretty clear that his promise the UCP would “rigorously” vet its candidates was never kept. The party seems to have had no vetting process at all, unless Mr. Kenney actually wanted these types to represent the UCP.

But to return to the fundamental question, as it were, whether or not this is a true Lake of Fire moment depends a bit on how you define the term.

If you mean it will change the course of the election from the longstanding narrative Mr. Kenney’s election is a certainty, that remains to be seen. No matter what, the NDP has a steep hill to climb, and little time remains before the election on April 16.

Even if, as some polls suggest, the polls are trending in the NDP’s favour, can they change fast enough?

If you mean it’s set back the Opposition party, even if it still wins, that too is unclear.

But if you mean it’s an embarrassment, Mr. Smith’s exposure should meet that low bar. But Mr. Kenney has played cute on that score several times already, telling people who are offended that he’s offended too – then doing nothing. That amounts to a wink to his social conservative base, despite many calls by moderate conservatives to toss the pastor out.

This has been true when the issue was LGBTQ rights. (Mr. Carpay, a founder of the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedom and the man who compared the Pride flag to a swastika, is still a welcome member of the party.) And it’s been true when candidates expressed sympathy for white supremacist views and publicly doubted climate change is a real thing.

One thing is for sure. Drayton Valley-Devon is probably the safest UCP seat in the province. Mr. Smith will be elected there no matter what he says. Even if Mr. Kenney were to do the right thing and kick him out, he’d be elected because it’s now too late to get another UCP candidate on the ballot.

So the jury’s still out on whether Mr. Smith’s undoubted bozo eruption will add up to a true Lake of Fire moment.

Tony Abbott, where is he now?

Speaking of Drayton Valley, what’s with the candidates Conservatives find to run there?

Alert readers will recall Tony Abbott, the PC MLA for the Drayton Valley-Calmar riding, and also an evangelical pastor, who famously accused Ontario MP Belinda Stronach of “whoring herself out for power” when she crossed the floor of the House of Commons from the Conservatives to the Liberals in 2005.

He later had some kind of a confrontation in the back halls of the Legislature Building, the details of which are unclear, with an Alberta Liberal MLA who had criticized him in the House.

It must be something in the water.

According to the Wikipedia, Mr. Abbott now lives in San Antonio, Texas, home of the Alamo, and runs a printing press called Presto Printing. Perhaps this is a tribute to Preston Manning.

Rule of law rears its head; judge punts Kamikaze Campaign injunction bid

Good try, but late yesterday, a Calgary judge punted the bid by six applicants to halt the investigation into in Jeff Callaway’s 2017 UCP leadership campaign by the Office of the Election Commissioner.

The applicants, who all played roles in Mr. Callaway’s campaign, had sought the injunction on the grounds the investigation into their past election activities interfered with their fundamental right to take part in the current provincial election campaign.

Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Anne Kirker ruled it is in the public interest that the investigation continue.

By The Canadian Press on April 3, 2019.

CALGARY – The leader of Alberta’s NDP is urging voters who chose right-leaning candidates in the past to pick her party in the April 16 provincial election.

Rachel Notley say she respects why people had put their trust in the long-governing former Progressive Conservative party, since it had a strong tradition of defending Alberta.

But she says the PCs were in power too long and left working people vulnerable by not doing enough to diversify the economy.

Notley’s New Democrats toppled the PCs after 44 years in power by winning a majority in the 2015 election.

She says Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party brings together the worst aspects of the former PC and Wildrose parties, which merged in 2017.

She says the UCP represents entitlement and intolerance rolled into one neat package.

“What is more clear every day is that Mr. Kenney didn’t bring the best of the PCs and the Wildrose together,” Notley said Wednesday at the Calgary Currie office of NDP incumbent Brian Malkinson.

“He brought the sky palace to the shores of the lake of fire.”

A lavish penthouse suite atop Edmonton’s Federal Building, dubbed the “sky palace,” came to symbolize what was perceived as a sense of entitlement by the former PC government led by Alison Redford.

In the 2012 election, the Wildrose Party blew a late lead in the polls, in part, because then-party leader Danielle Smith refused to sanction a candidate who penned an anti-gay blog urging homosexuals to repent or face eternal damnation in hell’s “lake of fire.”

The UCP has seen two of its Calgary candidates – Caylan Ford and Eva Kiryakos – resign over intolerant remarks on social media. Another candidate, Mark Smith, has also been criticized for past remarks about homosexuality.

On Tuesday, a snippet of audio surfaced on social media from a sermon Smith delivered in 2013 that was posted on the website of the Calvary Baptist Church in Drayton Valley, Alta.

On the recording, Smith discusses how TV programs try to convince people that love among homosexuals is “good love.”

“Heck, there are even people out there, I could take you, I could take to you places on the website, I’m sure, where you could find out that there’s, where pedophilia is love,” he said in the recording.

Notley criticized Kenney on Wednesday for keeping Smith as the candidate for Drayton Valley-Devon.

“Mr. Kenney thinks he can just walk past the level of bigotry and divisiveness that was articulated by his hand-picked education critic and potential minister, and that Albertans won’t hold him to account,” she said.

Buried within the UCP’s full election platform released Saturday is a proposal to return to “allowing banked hours to be paid out at regular pay instead of time-and-a-half,” referring to a section of Alberta’s employment standards code that had been in place prior to 2017. Under it, a worker who banks eight hours of overtime would only receive eight hours off with pay, not the 12 hours with pay Alberta’s employment standards code currently requires.

The NDP claims this is effectively a clawback of overtime pay for workers — a charge UCP Leader Jason Kenney described as “ridiculous” and “an utter lie being told by the NDP.” He told reporters on Monday the proposal would not reduce worked overtime pay for Albertans. The UCP’s platform doesn’t mention an explicit reduction in overtime pay. But Alberta Federation of Labour (AFL) president Gil McGowan says the proposal for banked overtime is still a way for bosses to save money on overtime. “It’s clear that a Kenney government would make it possible for employers to get around paying overtime to their workers,” McGowan said. “In particular, they would make changes that allow employers to use the banked time system as a mechanism to avoid paying time-and-a-half.”

Part of this loophole has to do with how Alberta’s employers and workers figure out overtime arrangements at their workplaces, whether that means banked overtime or simply extra pay. This takes the form of a collective agreement if the workers are unionized or simply a written agreement between both parties if they aren’t. At least 50 per cent of the workers and the employer must sign the agreement. But McGowan said many workers aren’t aware of this provision and, in practice, employers simply impose overtime agreements on behalf of their workforces.

According to Bob Barnetson, a labour relations professor at Athabasca University, workers can be told to accept an overtime agreement that requires them to take banked overtime. This would mean bosses save money by not paying employees time-and-a-half. If the workers refused, Barnetson said, employers are in a position to coerce or push them into agreeing. “Any employer under the UCP proposal could implement an overtime banking arrangement and then refuse to give workers time off in lieu and then pay out overtime, essentially, as straight time,” Barnetson said.

Article Continued Below

Defenders of the UCP proposal described it as a fair deal for industries where special circumstances like weather or season often keep staff at work longer than a typical day. Dwayne Chomyn, an Edmonton-based labour lawyer who represents employers, said overtime pay is used as a disincentive to work employees longer than a normal day. But he said this doesn’t make sense for industries that require long work days in good weather conditions, such as roofing or paving. “In certain industries, like roofing, nobody wants to discourage overtime pay,” he explained. “The employer doesn’t because you can only roof for certain parts of the year. You can’t roof when the roof is covered in snow.” The old overtime banking system proposed by the UCP was also a way for Alberta employers to reduce costs, Chomyn added, especially in light of the province’s current economic conditions. However, Barnetson said saving money through the UCP’s proposal won’t translate into additional jobs. “It’s going to encourage employers to work existing workers harder rather than hiring additional staff,” he said. Workers in a variety of sectors frequently bank time during long stretches on the job. According to past Statistics Canada data issued by the AFL, workers in the province’s oil-and-gas, construction, and manufacturing sectors are the most likely to clock overtime — whether that’s in the form of banked time or overtime pay. Skilled tradespeople can find themselves working 10-hour days, seven days a week when an oil-and-gas plant or similar facility shuts down for maintenance, according to Derrick Schulte, executive secretary of the Alberta Regional Council of Carpenters and Allied Workers. The council’s 11,000 members wouldn’t be impacted by the UCP proposal, Schulte explained. Overtime banking clauses are a staple of the collective agreements negotiated by unions. But the proposal, if enacted, would change Alberta’s employment standards norms, which could make negotiations with employers difficult in the future. “It would not affect us at this point in time, however, any future subsequent collective agreements could be affected,” Schulte said. It also isn’t clear what the proposal could mean for seasonal workers. Schulte said they would have to run through any banked hours they accrued before receiving employment insurance. “I’ve seen it where … they bank the hours and then when they get laid off, they get the payout, which means they get delayed in their EI benefits because they’ve got a cash amount they have to use up first,” he explained. As it stands, the UCP’s policy would mean less paid time off for Alberta workers who take banked overtime, although Chomyn disagrees. “They would not earn less,” he said. “But what would happen is they would get less time off.” Brennan Doherty is a work and wealth reporter with Star Calgary.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre says he’ll filibuster the government’s budget until the Liberals agree to further investigation of the SNC-Lavalin affair. As the Official Opposition’s spokesman on the budget, Poilievre can talk about it in Parliament for as long as he likes. And on Parliament Hill Monday morning, the Ottawa-area MP says he’ll use it to pressure Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to end what Poilievre calls a coverup. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre took to his feet Monday in the House of Commons in an effort to filibuster the government’s budget until the Liberals agree to further investigation of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“The debate will begin on Justin Trudeau’s coverup budget — you’ll recall that he introduced a budget that splashed around billions of dollars to distract Canadians from the SNC-Lavalin scandal,” Poilievre told a news conference Monday on Parliament Hill.

“I will be responding on behalf of the opposition to that budget. I have the ability to speak an unlimited period of time and I will be using that ability to demand the government end the coverup (and) agree to a parliamentary investigation into the SNC-Lavalin scandal.”

Following the news conference, Poilievre headed into the House of Commons chamber to begin his speech.

House of Commons rules say the finance minister and the Opposition’s finance critic can speak as long as they want about the budget, but only within the time allotted for government business. That means Poilievre’s plan won’t disrupt most other activities in the House of Commons and he has to speak for only a few hours at a time. Debate on the budget is also restricted to four sitting days.

The Ottawa-area MP said he wants senior members of Trudeau’s staff, as well as the prime minister himself, to testify before the Commons justice committee about the pressure former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould came under to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution over its allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

“When they agree to that, I’ll stop speaking.”

The Commons justice committee has heard testimony from Wilson-Raybould, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick and Trudeau’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts, among others.

Wilson-Raybould said she endured a months-long campaign of PMO pressure, including from Wernick and Butts, to arrange a so-called remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges that it used bribery and fraud to get business in Libya. Conviction could include a 10-year ban on bidding on federal contracts in Canada.

She alleges that her refusal is why Trudeau shuffled her out of the prestigious justice portfolio and into Veterans Affairs. She resigned from cabinet a month later, followed shortly by fellow senior minister Jane Philpott. The resignations have shaken the Liberal party and led to the suggestion from some of their fellow MPs that if they don’t believe in Trudeau’s leadership, they don’t belong in the Liberal caucus.

Poilievre said the witnesses who have already testified before the justice committee haven’t yet told the full story.

The Conservatives used procedural tactics two weeks ago to force more than 250 separate votes on spending plans, using the round-the-clock session in the Commons to draw more attention to the SNC-Lavalin affair as well.

""I'm very concerned that things could go sideways in terms of what has been a pretty positive relationship for the last number of years,"" said Frank Bruseker, who served as president of the Alberta Teachers' Association from 2003 to 2009.

Bruseker made his comments during an interview on the Ledge, CBC's political podcast.

In 2002, more than 20,000 Alberta teachers went on strike.

It crippled the public school system and left the provincial government scrambling.

This week, the United Conservative Party (UCP), and the NDP released their education platforms. The NDP wants more teachers, schools and playgrounds. The UCP wants better grades and more teacher accountability. 23:37

Ideas from the past given new life

Bruseker's warning went much further than the policy concerns raised earlier this week by the current ATA president.

""Teachers never really want to go out on strike,"" Bruseker said. ""There are times when teachers are driven to a point where they feel such a level of frustration that there is nothing more left for them to do.""

This week, the United Conservative Party and the NDP released their education platforms.

The NDP said it wants to add 1,000 new teachers, and include funding for playgrounds when building new schools.

The UCP said it wants to see improved grades for students, and wants schools, teachers and principals to be more accountable.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he wants to improve student performance by bringing back Grade 3 provincial achievement tests, and returning to a 50-50 marking split between course work and diploma exams for Grade 12 students.

""Math and reading scores have continued to decline under the NDP,"" Kenney said at a news conference on Monday. ""It's time to bring common sense to education.""

Bruseker said he was particularly disturbed to see that the UCP appears prepared to resurrect ideas from the former Progressive Conservative government's 2014 task force for teaching excellence.

Frank Bruseker, former Liberal MLA and past-president of the ATA, is warning of labour troubles ahead if old ideas about how to improve education are resurrected. (Frank Bruseker)

ATA president Greg Jeffery said among the ideas his members find particularly ""insulting"" is a recommendation from that report that ""teachers would be evaluated every five years to determine whether their certification to teach should be maintained.""

The ATA is currently involved in centralized contract negotiations with the provincial government.

Bruseker said if the UCP wins the election, teachers could find themselves in a position similar to 2002.

""What that could mean if teachers again at some point feel that level of frustration is you could have a province-wide shut down of education.""

Good evening to you.

The Lead

Former attorney general Jody Wilson Raybould says she has been removed from the Liberal caucus and will not be permitted to stand as a party candidate in this fall’s election.

In a post on Twitter Tuesday evening, Wilson-Raybould said she had just been informed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the decision to remove her from caucus and as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Granville.

UPDATE: Jane Philpott has also been removed from caucus.

Marco Vigliotti has the latest.

CTV reported earlier today that the Liberal caucus is holding a previously unscheduled meeting Tuesday evening to discuss whether Wilson-Raybould or Jane Philpott can remain party MPs. Both of them resigned earlier this year from cabinet in protest of the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.

Also earlier today, CBC News reported that Wilson-Raybould had written to the caucus, in an effort to keep them from kicking her out of the Liberal Party.

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed too,” she said, according to the letter tweeted by CBC News.

And keeping on the same topic, a new submission to the House justice committee suggests Wilson-Raybould never mentioned SNC-Lavalin in any text messages she sent to the prime minister’s former top advisor before being removed as attorney general and justice minister.

The claim comes from the 41-page submission of Trudeau’s former top aide, Gerry Butts, to the Parliamentary body that’s been studying the SNC-Lavalin controversy. The submission was publicly released on Tuesday. Butts resigned in February amid allegations that officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, including himself, attempted to pressure Wilson-Raybould to provide SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement, instead of allowing its criminal prosecution to proceed.

In a tweet, Butts said he submitted the additional evidence after reviewing the submission that Wilson-Raybould made to the committee last week. Charlie Pinkerton has the latest.

In Canada

Canada’s international trade minister says the Trudeau government does not want to “escalate” an ongoing trade dispute with China over Canadian canola exports.

In testimony before the House international trade committee Tuesday, Jim Carr said Canada had not drafted a list of potential items that could be hit with retaliatory tariffs.

“We don’t think it’s in Canada’s best interest to escalate the tension,” he said. Kelsey Johnson has the full story.

The committee appearance came only hours after the Liberals blocked a Conservative MP from asking the House of Commons to consider holding an emergency debate on the canola dispute.

This morning Winnipeg-North MP Kevin Lamoureux stood up in the Commons on a point of order and asked that the House of Commons skip over its daily list of tasks, including the time allocated to make requests for emergency debate, so that it could proceed immediately to Orders of the Day. The request was initially denied by MPs in the Commons, which triggered a recorded vote. The Liberals won that vote since they have a majority in the House of Commons. Johnson also this story.

And keeping on the topic, a third Canadian grain company has been issued a single notice of non-compliance by the Chinese government because of alleged pest concerns in its canola exports, a senior Agriculture Canada official says.

“(The Chinese) have given company names,” Fred Gorrell, the assistant deputy minister for international affairs for Agriculture Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) told reporters following an emergency meeting of the House agriculture committee on Tuesday.

Gorrell declined to name the Canadian grain company “because it’s (about) non-compliance for another company.” Johnson has this one as well.

Staying on the committee circuit, the fisheries and oceans committee voted Tuesday to send a bill that would ban dolphin and whale captivity in Canada back to the House without any amendments. Bill S-203 passed through the Senate last year.

iPolitics will have a full story on the committee meeting later tonight.

Parliament’s spending watchdog is warning that Canadians will pay more for prescription drugs under the new North American trade deal.

In a report released Tuesday, the Parliamentary Budget Office said a provision in the trade pact extending the period of data protection for biological drugs would delay the introduction of lower cost generic alternatives known as “biosimilars” by two years, leading to increased costs for “Canadians and their drugs plan.” Marco Vigliotti reports.

Canada’s environmental commissioner is slamming the federal government for failing to clearly determine what constitutes “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies, something the Liberal government has promised to phase out by 2025.

In her spring reports released this morning, Julie Gelfand found that the definition of “inefficient” by Environment and Climate Change Canada and Finance Canada was so broad or incomplete it couldn’t guide their assessments on which oil and gas subsidies could potentially be phased out. Jolson Lim has more.

Former Conservative MP Tony Clement on Tuesday announced he will not seek re-election in this fall’s general election. Clement, who left the Tory caucus amid a sexting scandal last year, made the announcement on his MP website, saying it was “actually not a difficult decision” that he had the support of his family. Vigliotti has more.

The sponsor of a bill that would ban the import and export of shark fins in Canada says he’s disappointed the federal government is looking to make amendments at the eleventh hour when it’s had two years to bring them forward.

During second reading debate on Bill S-238, the Ban on Shark Fin Importation and Exportation Act, on Monday night, Sean Casey, parliamentary secretary to the minister of fisheries and oceans, told the House of Commons that while the government supports the bill, it may need amendments to avoid violating international trade agreements.

An Alberta judge is to decide tomorrow whether to grant an injunction postponing the probe into the United Conservative Party’s leadership race until after the April 16 provincial election, reports The Canadian Press.

While a lawyer for several people involved in the campaign for failed candidate Jeff Callaway slammed the investigation by Alberta’s election commissioner as inappropriate, the counsel for the commissioner said suspending the investigation because of a complaint from those being investigated may give rise to “reasonable apprehension of bias in the other direction.”

Documents that were leaked last month suggest Jason Kenney’s campaign team directed Callaway to criticize Kenney’s main rival Brian Jean in the leadership race for the party, created by a merger of the Progressive Conservatives and the Wildrose Party. Kenney won the leadership race.

Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Anne Kirker said she would make her ruling Wednesday afternoon.

Opposition to Premier François Legault’s bill, aimed at settling once and for all Quebec’s debate over religious signs, is growing, with a new twist. Québec Solidaire, the party whose membership has grown younger with the arrival of Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois as co-spokesperson, effectively co-leader, voted overwhelmingly at a weekend convention to put aside the whole issue of religious signs.

Instead, Québec Solidaire proposes a shift in focus to climate change, judging greenhouse gas emissions a real threat and the “problem” of religious signs Legault has pledged to resolve, as a non-issue.

“This debate divides people. It creates tension,” explained Nadeau-Dubois, who was a leading figure of Quebec’s boisterous 2012 tuition strike. “We don’t need to exclude people to be free.” Kevin Dougherty has the latest.

Internationally:

U.S. President Donald Trump is once again threatening the close his country’s southern border unless something is done to slow the flow of illegal migrants, namely a deal with Congress strengthening restrictions on immigration. On Tuesday, he told reporters that “if we don’t make a deal with Congress, the border is gonna be closed — 100 per cent.”

But as CNN reports, citing internal sources, Trump’s own officials have repeatedly warned him that shutting down the border with Mexico could result in billions of dollars in “economic losses, destabilize border towns and cities, and do little to stem the flow of migrants across the southern border.”

CNN also reported that after Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the president would follow through on his threat “unless something dramatic” happened, aides in the West Wing met to discuss ways to prevent Trump from doing just that and if that wasn’t possible, to figure out logistical issues.

Keeping with Washington, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is vowing to not permit a vote on the revised North American trade deal until Mexico agrees to change its labour laws, reports Politico. In an interview, Pelosi said Mexico must first pass and implement the labour law reforms required under the so-called new NAFTA deal before the House considers any support for the pact, which is a major legislative priority of the Trump administration.

“Unless you do this, we can’t even consider it. … We have to see that [Mexico passes] the legislation, that they have the factors in place that will make sure it’s implemented and they demonstrate some commitments in sincerity, because it’s a big issue how workers are treated in Mexico,” she said.

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday said she will ask for another extension of the country’s deadline to leave the European Union after a marathon meeting of her cabinet that remains largely divided on the issue.

As the Associated Press reports, May said in a statement after the meeting that she would request a delay of Britain’s exit — currently set for April 12 — to forge a deal with the opposition parties to break the impasse over Brexit that has emerged as the country’s largest political crisis in decades.

The comments come after the EU’s chief negotiator warned about the costly chaos that would be sowed should the U.K. leave the transnational union without any agreement.

It also comes after a cross-partisan section of MPs in the British House announced they would advance a bill that would require May to ask for another extension of the country’s deadline to leave the European Union.

The bill is being presented by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and its supporters hope they can pass it through the House in one day, reports the BBC.

Algeria’s embattled President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is resigning before the end of his fourth term on April 28, his office said Tuesday in a statement.

As reported by the Associated Press, the president’s office said the ailing Bouteflika, who has been in power since 1999, would take “important steps to ensure the continuity of the functioning of state institutions” during this transition period.

Some of their support in Ontario and Western Canada had eroded, but Quebec and Atlantic Canada gave the party enough of a base to look for re-election in October.","Atlantic Canada was where the first domino of the SNC-Lavalin affair toppled in public — when Nova Scotia cabinet minister Scott Brison decided to resign his post. It's also where the Liberals have taken the biggest hit from the scandal's fallout.

What was once the party's most formidable electoral stronghold has now become one of its key regions of vulnerability.

According to the testimony of Gerald Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, the plan to replace Brison as president of the Treasury Board was supposed to be simple and tidy. Jane Philpott would go from Indigenous Services to Treasury Board and Jody Wilson-Raybould would take Philpott's place. David Lametti would be promoted into the justice portfolio vacated by Wilson-Raybould.

It didn't quite work out as planned.

The CBC's Canada Poll Tracker has recorded a six-point drop in Liberal support nationwide in the wake of the controversy surrounding Wilson-Raybould's resignation from cabinet — but the party has fallen even further in Atlantic Canada.

The Poll Tracker estimates the Liberals are down to 37 per cent support in the region, just 2.5 points ahead of the Conservatives.

That's a 12-point drop from where the party stood on Feb. 5 — a few days before the Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources, first reported that Wilson-Raybould was pushed by senior people in the Trudeau government to allow the Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges by meeting a number of conditions laid out in a remediation agreement.

Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press More

That slide is twice as big as any drop the Liberals have suffered in other regions of the country and has been registered by every polling firm in the field over the last few weeks.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also has taken a bigger personal hit in Atlantic Canada than in the rest of the country. His approval rating in Atlantic Canada has averaged 32 per cent in three recent polls by three different polling firms. Those same three firms found Trudeau's approval rating averaging 46 per cent in Atlantic Canada in November and December.

Trudeau and the Liberals certainly had more ground to give up in Atlantic Canada than they did elsewhere. The party swept all 32 of the region's seats and beat the Conservatives by a margin of 40 points there in the 2015 federal election.

But the party has now gone from being 19 percentage points more popular in Atlantic Canada than in the country as a whole to just five points more popular there than nationwide. About one in four Atlantic Canadians who supported the Liberals at the beginning of February have since abandoned them. Nowhere else have the Liberals lost more than a fifth of their support.

It has a real impact on the Liberals' chances of holding their seats in the region.

The Liberal sweep could be swept aside

When Butts testified at the justice committee last month, he talked about the electoral conundrum that Brison's departure created for the Liberals.

""Not to give away a political strategy in this forum,"" he said, ""but my main political concern was our position in Nova Scotia.""

Butts was worried that with Brison gone — and with a few other Nova Scotia Liberals already at risk of not running for re-election in the fall, particularly if they weren't given a promotion to replace Brison — the party would be without incumbents in five of their 11 seats in the province, leaving those seats vulnerable.

Our Nation’s Oil, From Alberta to Saudi Arabia

Pipelines have been running through our nations lands dating back to the 1950s, when this method of transportation was developed to carry oil and natural gas to Eastern Canada and the U.S., eventually being carried North.

Pipelines have been running through our nations lands dating back to the 1950s, when this method of transportation was developed to carry oil and natural gas to Eastern Canada and the U.S., eventually being carried North.

The pipelines originate in Alberta, running in all directions: west to British Columbia, north towards the Northwest Territories, south to Texas, and east up until Quebec, with a pipeline even running between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. There are more than 840,000 km of pipelines criss-crossing the country.

These lines are not without controversy, as production within the Canadian tar sands generate greenhouse gases. While oil and gas are a valuable part to Canadian economy, the nation competes with Saudi Arabia, who ships their oil to Eastern Canada.

Environmental concern isn’t the only dispute: pipelines run through Indigenous lands, not all of which have been granted approval. Canadian law states that First Nations must be consulted about pipeline projects. Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted to allow Indigenous groups access to the right of consent towards resource development projects that go through their land. However, as long as the government has attempted a sincere consultation, project can legally proceed even without Indigenous approval.

The most recent debate on pipelines has resurrected due to tensions recently exemplified within the Wet’suwet’en nation, as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police forcibly removed of activists preventing TransCanada Coastal GasLink from being constructed on their land.

And that’s just part of the tensions surrounding pipeline construction.

The federal government announced it had purchased the existing Trans Mountain pipeline, built in 1953, and its expansion project for $4.5 billion last September. The price of the expansion itself is estimated to be about $7.4 billion. The project, which would expand the capacity to transfer oil from Alberta to BC, has gained criticism from both politicians and environmentalists.

“There are concerns by Indigenous communities and environmentalists that the pipeline poses threats,” Saint-Lazare Councillor Brian Trainor told The Link. “Due to the possibility of a spill on route overland and at sea with the threat to marine life, in particular whales, of the increased tanker traffic.”

Forty-three First Nations signed agreements signalling their support for the Trans Mountain expansion project. However, the six First Nations of Tsleil-Waututh Nation, Coldwater Indian Band, The Stó:lō Collective, Squamish Nation, Upper Nicola Band, and Stk’emlupsemc te Secwepemc of the Secwepemc Nation, are leading challenges against the project in court, which could have a major impact on the future of the expansion.

“If any of the First Nations are successful, the whole underlying approval goes away,” Eugene Kung with West Coast Environmental Law told Huffington Post. “Canada is assuming that risk.”

The Trans Mountain pipeline, bought in 2005 by Kinder Morgan Inc., covers 1,150 km from Strathcona County near Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, BC.

The planned expansion would build a second pipeline alongside the existing one and would increase the transportation of oil from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day. Further, it would increase the traffic off of BC’s coast from approximately five to 35 tankers a month.

“Shipping is the most efficient type of transportation and plays a significant role in Canadian and global trade,” said Fadi Harb, a Concordia professor in the economics department. “However, it has some negative externalities and it creates environmental pollution.”

Under pressure from the Alberta government and the oil industry, the federal government purchased the existing Kinder Morgan pipeline. Trainor said it became obvious that Kinder Morgan had decided not to proceed with the required investment given economic uncertainty due to legal delays and dropping world oil prices.

“In terms of construction and making way for a new pipeline, in all aspects, this was the least impactful way in environmental terms of solving the problem of not having a way of getting [Canada’s] resources to new markets,”said Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister for Youth Affairs Peter Schiefke. “This is important because we are losing anywhere from $7 to $15 billion a year, because the U.S. is buying our oil at a reduced cost—because they know we have no choice.”

“Not only did the Liberals spend $4.5 billion of taxpayers’ money buying a pipeline that a private company wanted to build without a single tax dollar, but they failed in the negotiations, spending a billion more than the Independent Parliamentary Budget Officer [Yves Giroux] had estimated,” said Luc Berthold, Mégantic-l’Érable MP for the Conservative Party.

“The Liberals have no plan for expansion, and each year of delay increases the costs by hundreds of millions of dollars.”

Shortly thereafter, the federal Court of Appeal ruled that further consultations with First Nations would be necessary and the National Energy Board will have to review the the effects of more tankers off the BC. coast before the expansion project can continue. Trainor said these consultations are currently ongoing but the Liberal government is under extreme pressure from Albertans and the oil industry to advance the project as soon as possible. As it stands, the conclusion of these consultations doesn’t have a deadline.

“Indigenous consultations are inextricably intertwined with review of marine impacts—orcas have important cultural significance,” said Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada to the Vancouver Sun. “So charging ahead on this before sorting out the Indigenous consultation piece seems like a mistake.”

“From an economic perspective, there are always benefits and costs associated with a pipeline project, and one needs to study how efficient would the pipeline project be in enhancing Canada’s economy,” Harb said.

According to the Conference Board of Canada, it’s estimated the pipeline project would create the equivalent of 15,000 construction jobs, not to mention the equivalent of 37,000 jobs per year of operations in direct, indirect and induced jobs in Alberta and BC. An increase in the taxes collected could also be used for public services such as health care and education.

Last Spring, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley called the pipeline expansion “a major step forward for all Canadians.” She said the pipeline is a financially feasible and will generate profits. She conceded that governments may be held accountable if there is a spill, however, Notley said spills are not occurring as often.

But critics say The Trans Mountain pipeline will raise the amount of tankers in BC waters, increasing the chances that one of them will hit something and cause a spill of fuel into the ocean.

A major oil pipeline leak in 2011 was caused by the rupture of the Plains Midstream Canada Rainbow pipeline. It resulted in 28,000 barrels of oil spilling in northern Alberta, and was reported as the biggest spill in the province in 35 years. Some of the oil had seeped into the wetlands nearby. But in 2016 there were fewer than 100 spills larger than seven tonnes reported, compared to 3,000 in 1974.

“More than 100,000 people in the energy sector have already lost their jobs, and thousands more are unaware when construction will begin,” said Berthold. “Every day the construction is delayed further undermines Canada’s reputation as a stable and predictable place to invest—that is why the majority of Canadians believe that failing to build pipelines is a national crisis.”

“The federal government has to represent every province and territory, and if any sector is struggling, our job is to ensure that we’re doing everything we can to get the most out of that sector and provide jobs for those people,” said Schiefke.

According to Schiefke, this is especially the case for Calgary, as the city currently has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.

“One of the obvious reasons for opposing pipelines is the threat they pose to drinking water. If this pipeline spills at the Outaouais river, this could make water undrinkable for millions in the province of Quebec, since the St. Laurent [river] provides a key source.”

— Vincent Duhamel

In 2016, British Columbia said it didn’t support the Trans Mountain pipeline, in part out of concerns about the lack of information provided by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners for their proposed spill prevention and clean-up program. Kinder Morgan has increasingly been using the pipeline to transport diluted bitumen from the tar sands, which is much more corrosive than regular oil. Bitumen is a thick tar-like mix of hydrocarbons that is toxic and very difficult to clean up if there was a spill.

“One of the obvious reasons for opposing pipelines is the threat they pose to drinking water,” said Vincent Duhamel from Climate Justice Montreal. “If this pipeline spills at the Outaouais river, this could make water undrinkable for millions in the province of Quebec, since the St. Laurent [river] provides a key source.”

“I think pipeline expansion is digging a deeper hole in terms of our reliance on fossil fuels,” said Emily Carson-Apstein, external coordinator of Sustainable Concordia. “This is super harmful to vulnerable communities in Canada, like Indigenous communities on the West Coast and people around the world who can’t afford to escape the effects of climate change.”

The crude oil pipeline Enbridge Line 9 provides oil to Montreal’s Suncor Refinery from Sarnia, Ontario. It’s processing on average 24,300 barrels of diluted bitumen a day. The TransCanada Corp. canceled its Energy East Pipeline and Eastern Mainline projects, after being subject to increased regulations and facing opposition from environmental groups.

Saudi Oil and Canadian Pipelines’ Impacts on Indigenous Land

Canada not only receives its oil from the Alberta tar sands, but also from Saudi Arabia. “Alberta crude extraction is a relatively recent phenomenon and Canada has been importing Middle Eastern oil for a very long time,” said Syed Ahsan, a Concordia professor emeritus in the economics department.

Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are the second largest in the world. According to the National Energy Board, Canada has approximately 80,000 barrels of oil imported from the kingdom every day and we pay them about $2 billion a year, versus the $3.8 million barrels of oil produced by Canada per day.

The situation is a matter of money. Acquiring Saudi’s oil through affordable transportation and having it refined in New Brunswick is cheaper than the complex and expensive process of extracting the oil from Alberta’s tar sands and refining it.

Only certain refineries can turn Alberta bitumen into gasoline, which are mainly located in Alberta and BC The greenhouse gas emissions for extracting and processing oil sand are larger than for regular crude oil, and contribute to global warming. The oil is then moved to the Burnaby Terminal—a distribution point for crude oil to local terminals.

The Irving refinery in St. John, New Brunswick receives 40 per cent of its crude oil from Saudi Arabia. However, in light of the fractured diplomatic relations between the two countries, some economists say Canada could easily replace the Saudi Arabian crude oil with its own if the kingdom stops selling it.

Ahsan explained why this hasn’t happened. “The heavy crude can only be economically extracted at a certain price floor, possibly close to $50 USD [per] barrel, while Middle Eastern oil has a much lower threshold for profitable extraction.”

Indigenous nations are particularly affected by the pipelines threatening their land. The Wet’suwet’en is the most recent nation to publicly oppose pipelines and face attacks from the RCMP. The nation called for a stop on the Coastal GasLink pipeline project because the RCMP enforced a court injunction for access through the Unist’ot’en camp, about 15 minutes from the worksite.

“We review major projects proposed on Wet’suwet’en territories,” Mike Ridsdale, environmental assessment coordinator for the Office of the Wet’suwet’en.

“We monitor the province and make the proponents know of the hereditary decisions on the lands where there is proposed works,” said Ridsdale. “Currently, we are working with lawyers to stop Coastal GasLink pipeline due to their cultural genocide of our historical evidence on the land.”

The Oceans Protection Plan, a $1.5 billion federal policy unveiled by the current Liberal government in 2016, attempts to address environmental consequences brought on by oil transportation and potential spills. It includes provisions to protect chinook salmon, fund new research on water contaminants, and plans to reduce noise from the thousands of vessels that travel near the whales each year.

“When we took office, only one per cent of our coastline was protected, after 152 years of existence as a country,” said Schiefke. “We vowed that by the end of our first term we would bring that up to 10 per cent. So far we are at 8.7 per cent.”

Apstein fears the environmental impact of these pipelines. “The Canadian economy runs on fossil fuels right now and we don’t have a lot of time to find a different way to run the country, because this just isn’t going to cut it.”

“Going oil-free should definitely be in the interest of every economy moving forward,” said Harb. “From an environmentalist’s point of view, building a pipeline that could eventually no longer be operational in two decades’ time is quite costly and detrimental to the environment.”

Schiefke said he believes an environmental and economical balance is needed. “It’s about being realistic about our economic needs, and then doing the hard work necessary to innovate and look for ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors by using revenues to invest in green technology,” said Schiefke.

With the upcoming federal election later this year, the pressure to decide on the fate of the Trans Mountain Pipeline may come into the forefront of Canadian concern. If the project goes according to plan, the added construction is expected to take about 30 months, which means the pipeline could be operational in 2022.

English teacher Derek Horneland is photographed at Ross Sheppard High School in Edmonton on Tuesday. Horneland said Bill 24 made him feel more comfortable to openly identify as a gay man at his workplace. ( Codie McLachlan / Star Edmonton )

Horneland began his teaching career in 2016. In his first year, he was openly out to his colleagues, but not his students — until an amendment was made to the province’s School Act under Bill 24 in 2017, which affirmed protections of each staff member employed by all school authorities under the Human Rights Act. The amendments, which require all schools to develop policies that protect the diversity of staff and students, made Horneland feel like there was support he could fall back on as a teacher, and made him more comfortable to be open about his identity. “When I talk about my partner in front of my class, or when I talk about my experiences coming out with the (school’s gay-straight alliance) ... that’s something I feel really safe and comfortable doing,” he said.

But with a possible reversal of Bill 24 under a United Conservative Party (UCP) government, Horneland and other LGBTQ teachers have expressed worries about theirs and their colleagues’ future in Alberta schools, as leader Jason Kenney stated his intent on the campaign trail to scrap the School Act and replace it with the Education Act of 2012. While a key piece of Bill 24 is the protection it provides for the privacy of students who are part of a gay-straight alliance at their school, it also spells out specific protections for staff members under Section 45.1, in accordance to Alberta’s Human Rights Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and extends those protections to private schools. This “works to echo and reinforce — and arguably extend — obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or other grounds,” said Jessica Eisen, a law professor at the University of Alberta. Eisen added Bill 24 also provides alternatives to costly and lengthy Human Rights Act processes, and gives the education minister power to look into possible breaches and make orders to remedy them. Those protections are not affirmed under the Education Act. Eisen said the reversal of Bill 24 “would send a dangerous message that Alberta and its education system’s commitment to diversity and inclusion are eroding.” The future of LGBTQ teachers in Alberta has since been pushed further to the forefront as a key issue in the province’s 2019 election with reports of Mark Smith, the UCP candidate for Drayton Valley-Devon, pushing for the drafting of policies to allow the firing of gay teachers in 2015. Smith is touted as the potential future education minister if the UCP forms the next provincial government.

In response to Smith’s comments on LGBTQ teachers, the UCP said they “support long-standing law on these matters, both statute and case law.” “We believe that when issues of competing constitutional rights arise, they are better resolved by the judiciary than by politicians,” a UCP spokesperson said in an email.

For Alix Adair, an early childhood educator in the small town of Stettler who identifies as non-binary, Bill 24 not only affirms legal protections for LGBTQ teachers, but it also provides social assurances and an overall feeling of being accepted in Alberta’s school system. “It is the difference between being seen for who you are and having to fake it,” Adair said. Adair added having the bill in place gives them confidence to ask for their preferred pronouns to be used at their workplace, and gives them protection to disclose their identity to parents and colleagues without fear of backlash or losing their jobs. “Bill 24 enables us to say, this is a safe space, and you can philosophically disagree with us, but you can’t hurt us here,” Adair said. Legally, experts say the bill ensures there is nothing left up to interpretation when observing rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Alberta’s Human Rights Act, which recently included expressions of gender identity under protected ground in 2017. “(Bill 24) clarified and solidified the expectation that boards needed to be compliant with both those pieces of legislation to ensure there’s no wiggle room or way around skirting the Human Rights Act,” Robert Mazzotta, member services co-ordinator for the Alberta Teachers’ Association, said. These protections are exceptionally important, Mazzotta said, as more Alberta teachers are beginning to openly identify as members of the LGBTQ community, and have expressed worries about the security of their employment. The reversal of Bill 24, he added, could put some of those teachers’ careers in jeopardy, especially those working in the province’s private schools. Alberta teachers would remain protected under the province’s Human Rights Act even with the reversal of Bill 24, but Bridget Stirling, a trustee at the Edmonton Public School Board and a researcher on gay-straight alliances in the province, said human rights cases are often lengthy and detrimental to the livelihood of teachers. Bill 24, she said, attempts to avoid discrimination against LGBTQ teachers entirely. “People are forced into the courts, and even if they win, it’s often years of a person’s life and often huge damage to their career and their future,” Stirling said. She referenced the case of Jan Buterman, a transgender St. Albert teacher who was fired from his role in 2008, and filed a human rights complaint that lasted almost a decade in court. Ultimately, both Stirling and Horneland said the protection of LGBTQ staff means the ability to have a more diverse representation of teachers for their students, especially those who also identify as LGBTQ. “If we protect LGBTQ kids, but then we force their teachers into the closet, then we don’t show them that there’s a place for them to be when they grow up,” Stirling said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday sought to quell a crisis that threatens his chances of re-election, expelling from party ranks two former Cabinet members he said had undermined the ruling Liberals.

Trudeau said former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott would no longer be allowed to sit as Liberal legislators. They were also barred from running for the party in the federal election this October.

The Liberals have been in turmoil since Wilson-Raybould said in February that officials had inappropriately pressured her last year while she was justice minister to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escape a corruption trial.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus.

""Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them,"" said Trudeau, 47, who took office in November 2015 and faces a tough re-election battle this autumn.

Wilson-Raybould, who tweeted news of her ouster before Trudeau's announcement, was demoted in January and resigned the next month. Philpott quit shortly afterward, saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau was handling the matter.

""If people can't express trust in the party and the prime minister, then they need to find another political vehicle in order to advance their ideas. It's as simple as that,"" Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters.

The expulsion represented a change of course for Trudeau, who said as recently as last week that the Liberals needed strong legislators with differing points of view.

But increasingly angry parliamentarians had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity.

Opinion polls show the crisis has cut public support for the Liberals to such an extent that they could lose in October to the official opposition Conservatives.

Trudeau, who came to power promising ""sunny ways"" and a greater role for women in politics, admitted it ""has been a difficult few weeks.""

The scandal also cost him the services of his closest aide, Gerald Butts, and Michael Wernick, the head of the federal bureaucracy.

Wilson-Raybould said on Twitter: ""I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do.""

Last Friday, to back her case, she released the audio of a confidential conversation with Wernick, who did not know she was recording him. Trudeau said that was ""unconscionable.""

Philpott said on Facebook that she ""did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister ... it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences.""

Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing. The scandal is starting to hit his fortunes in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in October to remain in power.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau's decision sent a message that ""if you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party.""

In private meetings Tuesday afternoon, Trudeau told the two they would be removed. The prime minister then invited media into what would normally have been a closed caucus meeting to announce the move publicly in front of a crowd of cheering Liberal MPs.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told the room. “Whether it’s taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.”

I have just been informed by the Prime Minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election. More to come… — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

Trudeau reserved particular scorn for Wilson-Raybould’s act of covertly recording a phone call with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, calling it “unconscionable.” Wilson-Raybould has said she made the extraordinary decision to record the call because she had been subjected to a lengthy campaign of political pressure to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, and wanted an “exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She submitted the recording to the Commons justice committee last week.

In his speech, Trudeau said he had tried to show “patience and understanding” with the complaints of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, but had to eject them because being in caucus comes with “rights and responsibilities.”

He pointed to the history of Liberal Party infighting, and said he had made a commitment to change that. “Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them,” he said. “Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided. We can’t afford to make that mistake. Canadians are counting on us.”

In the latter half of the speech, Trudeau pivoted to themes he plans to campaign on — such as attacking the Conservative Party over its stance on carbon pricing and climate change.

Following Trudeau’s speech, Wilson-Raybould posted on Twitter that she has no regrets, and “spoke the truth as I will continue to do.”

“What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party,” she said. She said she will take some time and talk to her supporters about what comes next.

In her own statement, Philpott lamented that she had been ejected without having a chance to address caucus, and said it is “profoundly disheartening for me, my staff and my family.”

She said the attacks on her and Wilson-Raybould have been based on “inaccuracies and falsehoods.”

“Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould’s credibility and attempt to blame her,” Philpott’s statement said.

“This isn’t about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty — in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence — but to no avail.”

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called the ejection of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott a “betrayal of justice.”

“The message they have sent today is clear: If you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party of Canada,” he said. “Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them.”

Liberals who spoke to the media after the caucus meeting said they supported Trudeau’s move. “I think that what was revealed on Friday in terms of the tape really crossed a line with most of us,” said Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett. She said smaller groups of Liberals had already discussed the matter. “I think last night at women’s caucus, today in Ontario caucus, there was a consensus that there was no trust, there was a breakdown of trust.”

Nate Erskine-Smith, a Liberal MP who has often argued for keeping diverse views in caucus, declined to speak to media after the meeting.

Earlier on Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould had sent a scathing letter to her Liberal caucus colleagues that said their choice on whether to remove her would reveal the values of the party.

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated,” said her letter, dated Apr. 2. “And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to.”

Wilson-Raybould said she acted as she did on the SNC-Lavalin file because she was trying to “protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

She has given evidence to the Commons justice committee that there was a sustained campaign by senior government officials during the fall of 2018 to pressure her into ordering a deferred prosecution for SNC-Lavalin — pressure that she resisted, warning it violated the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened,” her letter to caucus said.

Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of

In one section of her letter, Wilson-Raybould appeared to be addressing recent comments from some Liberal MPs that have attacked her motives. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, for example, has suggested she was trying to “entrap” Wernick when she recorded their conversation.

“Growing up as an Indigenous person in this country, I learned long ago the lesson that people believing what they wish about you does not, and cannot ever, make it the truth — rather than letting authority be the truth, let the truth be the authority,” the letter said. “Indeed, if I had succumbed to interpreting the beliefs of other to be the truth, I never would have been able to push forward in the face of racism and misogyny that far too many Indigenous women, and others, still experience every day.”

Wilson-Raybould said in the letter she still intended to stand as the Liberal candidate in the 2019 election. But in acknowledgement of the movement to eject her, she laid out a challenge.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up,” her letter said.

Tuesday also saw the release of additional evidence tabled at the Commons justice committee consisting of text messages between Wilson-Raybould and Gerald Butts, the former top aide to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Butts resigned over the controversy on Feb. 18.

Among the messages are exchanges between Wilson-Raybould and Butts after she was told on Jan. 7 she would be removed as justice minister and attorney general. The texts show an argument that evolved and grew increasingly hostile as the announcement of the cabinet shuffle drew near.

At first, Wilson-Raybould — who was on vacation in Bali at the time — protested the move over what it signalled for Indigenous Canadians.

“Timing of ‘pushing’ me out (which will be the perception — whether true or not) is terrible,” she wrote on Jan 8. “It will be confounding and perplexing to people. This is not about me — believe me when I say this — but this is about an approach to Indigenous Peoples…This situation is only going to deepen and I am very worried about it. I am getting texts/emails from indig leaders and B.C. etc.”

“Nobody is ‘pushing you out,’” Butts responded. “In fact, the PM has taken the extraordinary (in my experience unique) step of offering an alternative cabinet post to you.” The reference is to Wilson-Raybould turning down Trudeau’s first offer of the Indigenous services portfolio, saying she couldn’t take it given she’d spent her life opposing the Indian Act. She was made veterans affairs minister instead.

By Jan. 12, Wilson-Raybould was strongly implying she was being moved because of the SNC-Lavalin issue, though the texts don’t explicitly say so.

“For what it is worth, I feel compelled to say — one last time — that what is being proposed is a mistake — irrespective of where I am going. There is no way to fully explain this…My eyes are wide open on this shift,” she texted.

“What I know — as you must — is that there is a robust and proud record of what our government has done — through my work and that of the (Department of Justice)…I stand behind this hard work and all of my decisions and legal advice.”

Butts again defended the move. “I know this is tough but we have very good ideas to make it all work from a comms perspective,” he texted. “There’s an opportunity here for you to show people a side of yourself and your talent that you did not get as (minister of justice and attorney general).”

But Wilson-Raybould was unmoved, and accused Butts of wanting to staff the justice minister’s office with PMO aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques — both of whom had been pushing Wilson-Raybould’s office to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution. (Both Bouchard and Marques have remained in the PMO.)

“As to the ‘very good ideas’ you guys might want to consider sharing them with me,” she said. “But know I will be prepared for tomorrow. And I know why this is happening.”

The cabinet shuffle was announced on Jan. 14.

125,,2019-04-03T05:33:00.0000000Z,"Conservative MPs Todd Doherty, Rob Nicholson and Blaine Calkins put forward a handful of amendments during clause-by-clause, some of which aimed to address concerns by Marineland, one of two facilities in Canada that ... and Green Party Leader Elizabeth ...","After several years of swimming through the parliamentary process, often against a wave of Conservative opposition, the ‘Free Willy’ bill is nearing the end of its journey and set to splash down in the House of Commons for a final debate and vote.

At the House fisheries committee’s clause-by-clause consideration Tuesday afternoon, MPs voted in favour of Bill S-203, which would ban whale and dolphin captivity in Canada, without making any amendments to it.

There were concerns over the weekend that several technical amendments to the bill would be put forward by Liberal MP Pat Finnigan of New Brunswick. Even a single amendment to the bill would have required it to be voted on again in the Senate, where it languished for years as a result of stall tactics by Conservative senators.

Given that this parliamentary session is quickly winding down and an election set to be called, proponents of the bill said sending it back to the Red Chamber would have been a death sentence.

Conservative MPs Todd Doherty, Rob Nicholson and Blaine Calkins put forward a handful of amendments during clause-by-clause, some of which aimed to address concerns by Marineland, one of two facilities in Canada that has captive cetaceans. Two weeks ago, a lawyer for the facility told the committee he believed the bill was unconstitutional.

One by one, they were voted down. When it came time to move his amendments, Finnigan withdrew each of them.

It made for a dramatic afternoon. Over the weekend, supporters of the bill, including politicians, NGOs and concerned individuals, had mobilized, organizing a phone and email campaign aimed at Liberal MPs and ministers. It’s estimated close to 15,000 calls were made from Canadians heading into the committee meeting. Behind the scenes, the bill’s original sponsor, former Sen. Wilfred Moore and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, its current sponsor, were on the phone with the decision-makers.

Even half an hour before the meeting started, all signs were the Liberals had no intention of withdrawing the amendments.

Moore said he arrived resigned to defeat.

“I knew if the Liberals went ahead with their amendments, we were sunk. I knew if it went back to the Senate, given the tactics that had been used by the opposition there and how they know how to work the rules, to rag the puck and run the clock down, it was over.”

While there are rules that allow a vote to be forced on a government bill, the same rules don’t extend to private members’ bills, which meant stalling tactics could have continued until the Senate rose for the summer. Ahead of the election, the bill would have died when the writ dropped.

The Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act was first introduced by Moore in December 2015. In addition to banning captivity, it includes a grandfather clause for those animals already in facilities in Canada and permits legitimate research, as well as the rescue of animals in distress. It would also ban breeding and the trade of reproductive materials, though nothing in the bill criminalizes the conduct of researchers. At committee in the Senate, the bill was amended to affirm the rights of Indigenous peoples.

Sen. Murray Sinclair took on sponsorship of the bill when Moore retired in January 2017.

The entire time the bill was in the Senate, it was up against a tide of Tory opposition led by Sen. Don Plett, the Conservative whip and caucus critic of the bill, who repeatedly used procedural obstruction to keep it from moving to a vote. It was a tactic that appeared to have the support of the Conservative caucus.

In late October 2018, the bill went to a vote in the Senate and was passed.

The Senate fisheries committee held 17 meetings to study the bill and heard from more than 40 witnesses from around the world.

Before Tuesday’s meeting started, Liberal MPs on the committee all walked out together and met in the hallway. NDP MP Gord Johns had walked over to the meeting with them and said he was really upset about what he thought was going to happen.

“I just thought it was a deep injustice. How could it happen after all this work and time? Clearly the arguments were there on the science and moral side,” he said.

“When I was sitting there (at the committee table) I wasn’t seething, but really feeling hurt, that this was wrong. To see the Liberals pull back their amendments and change their tune, I was completely blown away. A huge sense of relief and emotion hit me. I had been so upset and trying to contain my disappointment with my colleagues, but then I wanted to run over there and give them all hugs.”

Asked later why he’d withdrawn his amendments, Finnigan said he wasn’t comfortable with them.

“I was waiting for some clarification. I wasn’t comfortable without the clarification I was looking for so I decided to withdraw,” he said.

“There was some argument to be made for those amendments, but there were some questions I had on some of them.”

As for whether they’ll be put forward in Bill C-68, the government’s overhaul of the Fisheries Act which is now before the Senate and has some similar cetacean-related provisions, Finnigan said “it will be up to the Senate to decide whether they want to do that.”

Camille Labchuk, an animal rights lawyer and executive director of Animal Justice, said given that Liberals across the country were inundated with phone calls in recent days in ridings where people feel strongly about the issue, she had no doubt those MPs in turn put pressure on their colleagues on the committee and the minister on the file.

“We know it had an impact. There’s no way this bill would have come back from the brink at committee today without that support. Legislators heard us. I don’t think they were interested in going down in history as the folks who voted down this whale and dolphin protection bill.”

Barbara Cartwright, CEO of Humane Canada, a federation of SPCAs and humane societies, said the Canadian public really stepped up to make this happen.

“For it to get hung up on what seems like a procedural problem, it was devastating. I came here ready for it to be over. I’m shocked (by the outcome),” she said.

“It feels important because it’s going to shift the landscape with how cetaceans are treated in Canada and how we consume our entertainment. (Keeping cetaceans in captivity) is no longer acceptable and the country’s recognized that.”

NDP MP Fin Donnelly said the government should also be acknowledged.

“This was a good thing. They listened to the people, Canadians who were concerned about cetaceans. This is a victory for cetaceans.”

Former Marineland trainer Phil Demers, who has been an outspoken critic of the facility and the target of lawsuits as a result, was largely speechless when the meeting wrapped up.

“There’s an energy about this,” he said. “Ripples of divinity coming back from all the years of work. It’s hard to put into words. But it feels beyond surreal, almost magic.”

Johns said had things played out differently, hundreds of thousands of people across the country would have been furious.

“Apathy is real in the Canadian public about legislators doing the right thing and taking partisan politics out to do the right thing,” he said.

“When it comes to our whales, people expect that politicians are going to put their differences aside and put animal welfare ahead of politics.”

Moore was moved to introduce S-203 after watching the documentary Blackfish several times at the urging of his son. The film examines the plight of orcas in captivity through the story of Tilikum, an orca captured at a young age in Iceland and kept in tanks his entire life at several parks. Along the way he was involved in the deaths of three people.

If his bill passes in the House, it will be the first of its kind in North America. While Ontario and California have introduced similar legislation, their scope is more limited than what will come into effect here.

“It feels so good to do the right thing,” Moore said. “Canada is better for it.”

The case is a reminder to luxury retailers that Canada is the only country in the 36--member Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to have a national sales tax but no rebate program for international visitors, and that those visitors want ways to avoid paying the tax.

article continues below

It also comes amid sluggish retail data. Statistics Canada on March 22 revealed that the country’s retail sales dropped for an unexpected third month in a row in January, causing some retailers to voice concerns about their futures.

“Retail is taking hits right, left and centre,” said Lugaro Jewellers principal Clara Agopian. “How many more hits can a retailer take? Think about it. Internet has hit us below the belt. The malls are charging extraordinary rents.”

Montecristo Jewellers’ scheme saw owner Pasquale Cusano, senior employee Huan (Jean) Chen and others agree to sell and accept payment for jewelry, priced at up to $1 million, at the company’s Vancouver stores. They would then go to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) front office at Vancouver International Airport, where they would deliver the jewelry and a partially filled-out export form.

CBSA staff would then finish filling out the form, stamp it and then either walk past customs to deliver the jewelry to the buyer behind security or allow the Montecristo Jewellers employee to carry the jewelry to security, before presenting the item to the customer.

The Tax Court of Canada ruled in 2016 that these sales, between April 2010 and March 2013, did not meet Canada Revenue Agency exports criteria because they were executed in Canada.

Judge Kathleen Lyons rejected Montecristo Jewellers’ appeal in her January 31 judgment.

Had Montecristo Jewellers used a customs broker to handle the exports and had the customers received their purchases in their home country, the sales could have legitimately been classed as exports, as long as the customers were non-residents of Canada, according to the judgment.

It found that customs brokers were not used because customers did not want to send the jewelry via a third party “because of possible tampering.”

Many customers who bought jewelry from Montecristo Jewellers and received their goods at the airport also turned out to be permanent residents of Canada. That raised CBSA suspicions that the goods would have eventually returned to Canada, according to the judgment.

Foreign visitors to Canada were allowed to claim a rebate on money paid toward the GST starting in 1991, when Brian Mulroney’s Conservative government introduced the tax, until 2007, when Canada became the first OECD country to cancel a visitors’ rebate program.

Stephen Harper’s government ended the rebate program after estimating that it cost $86 million in administrative costs. A scaled-down rebate program for the accommodation portion of tour packages was then eliminated in 2017.

The Tourism Industry Association of Canada opposed the cancellation of the GST rebate program in 2007. Its annual submissions to the government ever since claim the move has harmed Canada’s tourism industry.

A Retail Council of Canada report in late 2018 found that axing the tax rebate was penny wise and pound foolish, given that the rebate policy increased tourism spending by what it estimated to be $595.7 million each year.

“Cumulatively, that means a $5.9 billion impact on Canada’s GDP [gross domestic product] was lost because of this policy change,” the report noted.

The report used Statistics Canada data and standardized 2018 dollars to show that international overnight visitors spent 12.8% less during their trips in 2017 compared with 2007.

The association divided visitor spending into pre-trip spending, such as plane fares, accommodation and convention fees, and in-trip spending, such as food, entertainment and souvenirs.

While overnight visitors to Canada in 2017 spent an average $626.66 per person on pre-trip spending, up 9.7% since 2007, it was the spending during the trips that decreased by an even more sizable 12.8%, to $450.32, the report noted.

The result is that high-end retailers in Vancouver want to bring the GST-rebate back.

“We lose a lot of business to other major shopping centres in Europe, where customers can get a rebate on their tax,” said Manuel Bernaschek, president of Stefano Ricci Vancouver – a high-end menswear store on Alberni Street, where suits can sell for $10,000.

“Some customers comment on it because they know it is not a possibility [to get a rebate,] or they want to confirm the situation.”",Canadian retailers push for return of GST rebate for tourists,Richmond News,https://www.richmond-news.com/business/canadian-retailers-push-for-return-of-gst-rebate-for-tourists-1.23776756

LONDON – The alarms are flashing, the cliff-edge is coming closer – but can Britain avoid tumbling out of the European Union?

After lawmakers rejected the government’s Brexit deal on three occasions, and twice failed to agree on any other option, the U.K. has just 10 days to come up with a new plan or crash out of the EU.

A look at what might happen next:

NO DEAL

Michel Barnier, who has been the chief Brexit negotiator for the other 27 EU countries, has warned that a ‘no-deal’ Brexit is “likely” because of Britain’s political impasse.

Earlier this month, the EU agreed to postpone the original Brexit date of March 29, but gave Britain only until April 12 to come up with a new plan and seek a further extension, or leave without an agreement or a transition period to smooth the way.

Most politicians, economists and business groups think leaving the world’s largest trading bloc without an agreement would be damaging for the EU and disastrous for the U.K. It would lead to tariffs imposed on trade between Britain and the EU, customs checks that could cause gridlock at ports and which could spark shortages of essential goods.

A hard core of Brexiteer legislators in May’s Conservative Party dismiss this as “Project Fear” and argue for what they call a “clean Brexit.” But most lawmakers are opposed to leaving without a deal. Parliament has voted repeatedly to rule out a ‘no-deal’ Brexit – but it remains the default position unless a deal is approved, Brexit is cancelled or the EU grants Britain another extension.

May says the only way to guarantee Britain does not leave the EU without a deal is for Parliament to back her deal, which lawmakers have already rejected three times.

Barring that, Parliament could try to take drastic action such as toppling the government or legislating to force it to avoid ‘no-deal’ – though these are risky and tricky options.

MAY’S UNDEAD DEAL

After almost two years of negotiations, Britain and the EU struck a divorce deal in November, laying out the terms of the departure from the bloc and giving a rough outline of future relations.

But it has been roundly rejected by lawmakers on both sides of the Brexit divide. Pro-Brexit lawmakers think it keeps Britain too closely tied to EU rules. Pro-EU legislators argue it is worse than the U.K.’s current status as an EU member.

Parliament has thrown it out three times, although the latest defeat, by 58 votes, was the narrowest yet. It was rejected even after May won over some pro-Brexit lawmakers by promising to quit if it was approved.

May is considering one last push this week, arguing that Parliament’s failure to back any other deal means her agreement is the best option available. But the odds of success look long.

___

SOFT BREXIT

On Monday, Parliament voted on four alternative proposals to May’s rejected deal after lawmakers seized control of the schedule from the government.

None got a majority, but the votes revealed a solid block of support for a “soft Brexit” that would maintain close economic ties between Britain and the EU. A plan to keep the U.K. in an EU customs union, ensuring seamless trade in goods, was defeated by just three votes.

May has ruled those options out, because sticking to EU trade rules would limit Britain’s ability to forge new trade deals around the world.

But tweaking her deal to adopt a customs union could gain May valuable votes in Parliament. It also would likely be welcomed by the EU and would allow Britain to leave the bloc in an orderly fashion in the next few months.

However, it would also cause a schism in the Conservative Party, sparking the potential resignation of pro-Brexit government ministers.

___

NEW BREXIT REFERENDUM

Parliament also narrowly rejected a proposal for a new referendum on whether to leave the EU or remain.

The proposal for any Brexit deal to be put to public vote in a “confirmatory referendum” was defeated by 12 votes. It was backed by opposition parties, plus some of May’s Conservatives – mainly those who want to stay in the bloc.

Her government has ruled out holding another referendum on Britain’s EU membership, saying voters in 2016 made their decision to leave.

But with divisions in both Parliament and in May’s Cabinet, handing the decision back to the people in a new plebiscite could be seen as the only way forward.

___

BREXIT DELAYED

The alternative to a “no-deal” departure is to delay Brexit for at least several months, and possibly more than a year, to sort out the mess. The EU is frustrated with the impasse and has said it will only grant another postponement if Britain comes up with a whole new Brexit plan.

The bloc is reluctant to have a departing Britain participate in the May 23-26 European parliament elections, but that would have to be done if Brexit is delayed. Still, EU Council President Donald Tusk has urged the bloc to give Britain a Brexit extension if it plans to change course.

In an unprecedented show of support for renewed internationalism and multilateralism — rejecting the rising global tide of unilateralism and protectionism — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced this morning Canada has submitted a formal proposal to the United Nations (UN) to have its headquarters moved from New York City to a new secure, state-of-the-art campus dubbed the ‘Global Village’ on a Lake Ontario waterfront site on the Portlands, just east of downtown Toronto.

This will effectively turn Toronto into the world’s capital city.

The federal government will fund the construction of the $6.2-billion headquarters campus at no cost to the UN, as well as cover annual operations and maintenance costs of the complex.

“Canada has begun the process of signalling a new era for the United Nations by providing the organization with a new fully-funded central headquarters near downtown Toronto,” Trudeau said in a release.

“Our government is promising openness and new Canadian leadership on matters that relate to all Canadians and contributes to our country’s standing in the world. We believe in the collective goal of creating a world that is better and safer, and more sustainable, prosperous, and just. Canada’s resolve for supporting and enforcing the principles of the United Nations has never been greater.”

Additionally, if the UN moves to Toronto, the Canadian federal government will sign an agreement to provide the UN’s Regular Budget with a significant boost in annual funding that is 30 times larger than Canada’s most recent annual contribution of $76.23 million in 2019.

Trudeau will provide the UN with $2.8 billion annually, starting on the year the UN finalizes the agreement to move the 193-member intergovernmental organization’s headquarters to Canada’s largest city.

Normally, member states contribute an amount that is based on the country’s capability to pay, with a formula that takes into account gross national income, debt, and per capita income.

This plan proposed by Canada requires extensive consultation amongst the member nations, UN staff, and a vote in the General Assembly. A formal announcement on the details of the plan will be made at the existing UN headquarters in New York City later today.

UN Global Village headquarters in Toronto’s Portlands

A media backgrounder indicates a 60-acre waterfront industrial parcel on the southwest corner of the Portlands will be redeveloped into a 4.5 million sq. ft. headquarters for over 16,000 employees with the UN Community that are currently working at the East River complex in NYC.

These employees work for the UN’s specialized agencies, programmes, funds, affiliates, and missions.

Not only will the campus provide vast office spaces, it will also provide significant common spaces and new meeting chambers for the General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council, Trusteeship Council, and various other conference rooms for both formal and informal settings.

The headquarters entails a 600-ft-tall, 45-storey office tower that has a ‘beacon to the world’ architectural concept. Lower podium structures, up to 100 feet or seven storeys in height, are enclosed in glass and feature vast accessible green roofs that extend the natural landscape into the campus.

The UN’s private collections will also be relocated from the Dag Hammarskjöld Library at the NYC office to a new state-of-the-art library at the new headquarters. Amenities provided to staff and visitors will include a 1,000-seat international food court, a dozen restaurants for more intimate dining experiences and sit-down meetings, and a 400-bed short-term stay hotel. Additionally, for the organization’s leadership, the Secretary General’s offices will include a private residence that accommodates not only the leader but also their family.

A helipad atop the tower provides the ability for UN officials and world leaders to be transported to the headquarters by helicopter, shortening trips from Toronto Pearson International Airport.

A number of green design features — such as a district utility system, rainwater capture system for irrigation and to flush toilets, superior insulation, and passive heating and cooling — will earn the campus a LEED Platinum environmental certification.

The potential exists to integrate some of the headquarters’ utilities and infrastructure with Google’s Sidewalk Labs, which could potentially expand beyond the Quayside district and include a large portion of the Portlands to border the UN headquarters.

The Canadian government assumes the UN will retain ownership of its 1952-built, Rockefeller-funded, 18-acre NYC headquarters, which recently completed a $2-billion renovation. The UN could retain a small portion of its original headquarters office space after the move to Canada, and lease out the building’s remaining spaces to non-profit and non-governmental organizations or even corporations, providing the UN with a major new source of revenue to help support its programs.

Creation of a new UN museum

The entire headquarters site in Toronto will be fenced off, declared an international territory that will no longer belong to Canada, and exempt from property taxes.

Ample plaza and green spaces between the campus buildings and the perimeter will provide a spacious security buffer.

However, there will be a major publicly accessible component on the periphery of the headquarters site on the northeast corner, where a 180,000-sq-ft, state-of-the-art UN history museum and educational centre — named the Kofi Annan United Nations Museum — will be built. This will also be the staging area for regular guided tours of the campus.

According to the backgrounder, the museum will pay homage to World War II, reminding visitors of the UN’s post-war purpose — the preeminent and powerful tool for promoting peace and security, providing a forum for the development of relations between nations, and fostering cooperation on economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian issues, as outlined in the UN Charter.

UN Peacekeeping Missions will be another showcase, along with educational components on the various specialized agencies and programmes, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the accelerating impact of climate change.

The $371-million construction cost of the new museum is included in the overall $6.2 billion cost of the new campus, with the federal government also subsidizing the annual operating costs of the museum. It is anticipated the guided headquarters tours and museum visits combined could result in two million combined annual visitors upon opening.

Infrastructure exists to support UN headquarters

The federal government’s analysis shows the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and the wider Golden Horseshoe region has the economic and population critical mass, housing stock, and transportation infrastructure to support the sudden influx of the UN headquarter’s presence.

Toronto Pearson International Airport is Canada’s busiest airport, ranking amongst the top 30 busiest in the world in terms of number of aircrafts arriving and departing daily.

It has a reach to over 180 destinations around the world, including numerous direct flights to nearly every country in Europe and links to many key destinations in Asia, the Caribbean, and South America. Its network to the United States and Mexico is also extensive, and domestic operations are also supplemented by the flights serving the nearby Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport. Furthermore, Pearson Airport’s capacity and reach continues to grow each year.

The redundancies of Toronto’s extensive highway and arterial road network also allow for traffic changes and street closures for the route between Pearson Airport, hotels in downtown Toronto, and the UN headquarters, particularly for the annual General Assembly sessions when the leaders of 193 member nations converge to meet.

When it comes to the short-term accommodations required for these major General Assembly sessions, Toronto has the hotel room capacity to accommodate the world leaders and their staff and security, with about 45,000 rooms within the GTA, including 26,000 rooms within over 100 hotels in the city of Toronto, of which 17,000 are located in the city centre.

For those working in Toronto, whether they be member state ambassadors and their diplomatic staff, UN staff, or UN-affiliated staff, the federal government finds there is sufficient housing capacity in the GTA, specifically the capacity and flexibility to respond to UN housing demand — and already-existing housing challenges — and build new housing stock as required.

The federal government’s proposal also takes note of continuing efforts to improve Toronto’s transportation infrastructure, including new subway and LRT lines.

However, work would have to accelerate on localized improvements to support the headquarters campus, specifically the widening of Cherry Street into a six-lane arterial road, including new fixed bridges across both Keating Channel and Ship Channel.

Cherry Street has been identified as the main thoroughfare to reach the headquarters from Lake Shore Boulevard. Land expropriation to perform the road widening is not required as the municipal government owns the surrounding properties north of the federal government-owned site.

In addition to improved local roads, new public transit connections would also have to be established, such as the extension of the streetcar network to reach the western sector of the Portlands.

Estimated costs to Toronto and Ontario

A joint Toronto Global Village Police Unit — working in collaboration with the UN Department for Safety and Security — will be established by the federal government to organize and provide the security needs for the UN headquarters and the UN community.

The unit will be comprised of the RCMP, Toronto Police Service, York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police (where Pearson Airport is located), Canada Border Services Agency, Canadian Forces, and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.

The Canadian costs of the unit are estimated to be at approximately $100 million per year, with much of the costs expended towards the security and road closures for the General Assembly session involving world leaders. Costs incurred by the police forces of municipal governments will be largely reimbursed by the federal government.

Currently, New York City, which oversees public school education in the city, covers the cost of providing public school education to all of the children of UN Community staff residing in the city. A similar program is expected to be launched in Toronto, however, it will be covered by the Ontario provincial government at a cost of about $83 million annually, based on the expectation that about 4,500 children of UN staff will require public schooling.

All three levels of government — City of Toronto, provincial government, and federal government — are expected to create their own liaison offices for their respective relations with the diplomatic community at a combined cost of approximately $9 million annually.

The federal government acknowledges some taxes for the governments will be foregone, such as property tax exemptions, personal income tax exemptions, sales tax exemptions, and even traffic and parking violation fines, but no fiscal estimate has been made at this time.

Immense economic impact for Toronto

Construction activity from the new headquarters is expected to generate approximately 9,000 jobs during the building phase.

When the headquarters reaches completion, the UN Community will support over 26,000 full-time and part-time jobs, including 16,000 staff working directly for the organization.

The GTA’s GDP will rise by an estimated $4.9 billion per year upon the full opening of the headquarters, which accounts for the direct and indirect spinoffs from the activities of the UN organization, staff, and visitors that support local businesses and jobs, such as entertainment, hotels, restaurants, retail, transportation, and services.

According to UN statistics, the UN issues about 31,000 accreditations for high-level visitors, such as high-ranking government officials and VIPs, per year to attend meetings and conferences. Moreover, over 200,000 temporary accreditations are issued annually for special events such as cultural events, non-governmental organization seminars, and Model United Nations conferences.

Annual wages paid to UN Community workers residing in Canada are estimated be approximately $3.4 billion.

New investments in political science university programs

Taking advantage of Canada’s new permanent role on the world’s centre stage, if the headquarters is relocated to Toronto, the federal government will provide new capital and operational investments to Canada’s top post-secondary political science and international relations programs, with the intended effect of helping foster new generations of Canadians into becoming the next global leaders.

The selected universities are the University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and the University of Ottawa, which will see increased funding for their political science and international relations programs to better equip their students with a strong understanding of the UN system and pertinent global issues.

Approximately $70 million is budgeted over the first five years of the program, which is supplemented by increased funding for Global Affairs Canada’s grants and initiatives, such as supporting Canadian non-governmental organizations, Model United Nations conferences, and intercultural exchange initiatives.

Canada’s new funding for the UN

Shortly after winning the 2015 federal election, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared “Canada is back” to mark his government’s new approach on international relations policy, vowing that the country would regain its traditionally “constructive and compassionate” approach to global affairs.

Those words reverberated to Canada’s allies abroad, and it has now seemingly culminated with an ambitious proposal of universal proportions.

Not only is Canada providing the UN with a new $6.2-billion home, the relocation plan comes with a promise to the UN of providing the organization with $2.8 billion in Canadian-supported annual funding, which will put Canada just behind the United States when both the all UN budgets, including peacekeeping, are accounted for.

The bid may even bolster Canada’s contention in June 2020 against Norway and Ireland for a two-year seat on the Security Council, for the term between 2021 and 2022.

Since returning to power, the federal Liberal government under Trudeau has renewed Canada’s standing as an active global player. More recently, in December 2018, Canada played a major role in propelling the United Nations Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration to help support safer migration amidst the ongoing refugee crisis.

The migration agreement was signed by over 150 countries, although it also faced opposition within Canada, including from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer who raised concerns that that the compact could erase the country’s borders.

“Canadians and Canadians alone should make decisions on who comes into our country, and under what circumstances,” said Scheer at the time.

“Instead of signing international agreements that erode our sovereign right to manage our borders, the prime minister should focus on restoring order at home.”

But a barn-burning speech made by Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland in the House of Commons nearly two years ago set Canada’s new tone and bold approach, perhaps serving as an overture for the federal government’s now-public heightened aspirations and goals for the UN.

“Now, it is clearly not our role to impose our values around the world. No one appointed us the world’s policeman. But it is our role to clearly stand for these rights both in Canada and abroad,” she said.

“International relationships that had seemed immutable for 70 years are being called into question. From Europe, to Asia, to our own North American home, long-standing pacts that have formed the bedrock of our security and prosperity for generations are being tested… Turning aside from our responsibilities is not an option. Instead we must think carefully and deeply about what is happening, and find a way forward.”

In her speech, she evoked the profound legacy of Lester Pearson, the Canadian foreign diplomat who was instrumental to launching the UN’s first peacekeeping mission — helping de-escalate the 1956 Suez Crisis — and awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for this efforts.

The UN was founded from the rubble created from the Second World War, and those who lived in its aftermath “appreciated viscerally that a world without fixed borders or rules for the global economy, was a world of strife and poverty. They sought to prevent that from ever happening again.”

“That is why [previous generations of Canadians] risked and gave their lives to fight in a European war. That is why, when they came home, they cheerfully contributed to the great project of rebuilding Europe and creating a post-war world order. That is why they counted themselves lucky to be able to do so.”

But it was Freeland’s concluding comments that truly set the stage.

“Our job today is to preserve their achievement, and to build on it; to use the multilateral structures they created as the foundation for planetary accords and institutions fit for the new realities of this century,” she said.

“They rose to their generation’s great challenge. And so can we.”

One by one, more than 40 of them rose from their seats to turn their backs on him.

The silent protest just after noon on Wednesday came during Trudeau’s first public appearance after expelling former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould, who accused him of trying to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of Montreal construction firm SNC-Lavalin, and Jane Philpott, who resigned in solidarity with her, from his Liberal caucus on Tuesday evening.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, locked out of the regular weekly caucus meeting Wednesday morning, visited the House of Commons gallery and sat to listen statements by some of the Daughters of the Vote delegates — 338 women, aged 18 to 23, chosen by the Equal Voice organization to represent all of Canada’s ridings for a day on Parliament Hill.

Dozens of young women here for Daughters of the Vote turn their backs as Trudeau speaks -in solidarity with Ms Wilson-Raybould and Ms Philpott pic.twitter.com/aAhdlDHrcS — Peter Julian (@MPJulian) April 3, 2019

The two sat with Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who quit the Liberal caucus in the wake of reporting on SNC-Lavalin. She snapped her fingers sometimes in agreement with the young women’s pronouncements. All three gave standing ovations for statements on issues including climate change, Indigenous suicide, accessibility and religious freedom, along with the rest of the room, which brimmed with loud enthusiasm for each speaker.

Ducking out to speak with reporters, neither Wilson-Raybould nor Philpott would address the elephant in the room — that here were young women being encouraged to speak up when Wilson-Raybould’s whistle-blowing is what ultimately led to their excommunication from caucus. Caesar-Chavannes told the National Post “we needed that little boost today,” though. “We are in the gallery watching, having, we hope, made a mark on the 42nd Parliament. And here are young women in those seats saying, ‘yeah, we are going to continue this,’” she said.

When he finally arrived, Trudeau, the self-proclaimed feminist and “minister of youth,” would face more than one rebuke from the young women in front of him. And he was not alone — dozens of them walked out on Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer while he spoke, because of a distaste for his policies. Upon their return, the women, including a majority of those who wore a hijab, got as much applause as Scheer had for his short speech.

During a question-and-answer session with Trudeau, Indigenous Nova Scotia delegate Hannah Martin, facing him, declared the Liberal government was perpetrating violence with its inaction on Indigenous issues. “You cannot be a feminist if you are allowing corporations to rape the land, because as Indigenous peoples, that is our mother,” she said. He thanked her for her “strong voice.”

Other delegates, talking in a buzz outside the Commons after the event, accused Trudeau of failing Indigenous people and women both by expelling Wilson-Raybould, who was the first Indigenous attorney general. “It was like a microcosm of the history of Canada, white men telling Indigenous women where they can or cannot be and exercising power,” said Riley Yesno, from Toronto.

“I don’t believe Justin Trudeau is a feminist,” said Brit Sippola, from Saskatchewan, recalling a section of his opening statement when he said nobody in the room would want to have to “pick who to believe between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Chrystia Freeland” or “know that one person has to be right and one person has to be wrong between Jane Philpott or Maryam Monsef.” The prime minister was deflecting attention away from his own mistakes by saying it was “Jane’s word versus Maryam’s,” Sippola said. “He’s the one who’s pitting women against women here.”

Other cabinet ministers were marching out in the early afternoon to say that the decision to remove Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had had nothing to do with feminism. Politicians had breached the trust of their colleagues. They hadn’t been team players. Loyalty wasn’t a gender issue, full stop.

But Trudeau’s long day of defending himself was nowhere near over.

During question period, he stood up again and again to answer all of the opposition’s questions, accusing him of fake feminism, calling him a coward and demanding his resignation over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He was interrogated on details in the testimony and evidence that Wilson-Raybould had provided to the House justice committee’s perfunctory study of the affair. For the first time, after weeks of being grilled day in and day out, Trudeau admitted that yes, Wilson-Raybould had asked him, during a September meeting, if he was trying to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution. He said he told her no.

But that wasn’t good enough for Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who would go on later Wednesday to continue a multi-day, marathon filibuster over the issue. He pointed out that in Trudeau’s earlier statements nobody had raised any concerns with him about interference.

“Now the prime minister has caught himself in a trap of his own making,” he said.

“The member opposite is twisting himself into rhetorical knots to try to make a point that is simply not there,” Trudeau responded.

New Democrats seized upon the Daughters of the Vote protest as a symbolic repudiation of Trudeau’s credentials as a feminist prime minister. “What have they seen this week? They have seen women speak truth to power and then get shown the door,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said.

Speaking to the entire national Liberal caucus at an emergency meeting on Parliament Hill, Trudeau cited the “will of caucus,” and said that while it was his decision, the trust that more than 170 Liberal members had with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had been “broken,” and it was clear they had to be removed.

“Whether it’s taping conversations without consent or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer be part of our Liberal team,” Trudeau said.

The prime minister said that he spoke with caucus leadership earlier on Tuesday and also met with Philpott and Wilson-Raybould to inform them of his decision.

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns but ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team, despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

Minutes before Trudeau announced this, Wilson-Raybould tweeted that she had been informed by Trudeau that she was no longer in the caucus and had been dropped as the candidate for Vancouver Granville, B.C.

She was seen leaving West Block in the minutes before her tweet. In follow up posts, she said she is reflecting on “what PM has done,” and said her thoughts are with all who “believed in a new way of doing politics.”

“I hold my head high… I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do,” she said.

In a post on Facebook, Philpott said she was “profoundly” disheartened that the decision was made without her being given the opportunity to speak directly to the national caucus. She denied that she was disloyal or that her involvement in the affair had anything to do with political advantage.

“I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the Prime Minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” Philpott said. “These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

Philpott said that “it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences to the party and to the country,” and is vowing to remain the representative for her Markham Stouffville riding “for the remainder of this term.”

This decision comes nearly two months after the SNC-Lavalin scandal first broke.

The controversy centres on allegations from Wilson-Raybould that she faced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" for months by nearly a dozen government officials pressuring her to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, out of concern for jobs and Quebec political prospects.

The scandal began unfolding after Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were both shuffled into new cabinet positions in January. Days after the initial story broke about her being pressured, Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet, and Philpott followed suit a few weeks later, citing a loss in confidence in the way the government was handling the entire SNC-Lavalin affair. Since then both have offered additional information or commentary on the matter that Liberal MPs now appear to have been unable to reconcile with.

The pair’s removal from caucus follows a series of regional caucus meetings in which Liberal MPs discussed whether they should be allowed to remain with the Liberal team.

“This has been a difficult few weeks for our government and for our Liberal team. On the issues surrounding SNC-Lavalin we’ve seen allegations made, and different versions of events, details. Amid the confusing and competing narratives, Canadians rightly have had questions,” Trudeau said, adding that the government has too grappled with these questions about the role of government in protecting jobs, and respecting Canadian democratic institutions.

He said that the Liberals came to power pledging to do politics differently -- a promise Wilson-Raybould says the government has reneged on -- and in doing things differently, “we encounter difficult moments.”

As he finished his remarks to caucus, Trudeau received a standing ovation, and at least one voice in the room could be heard saying “bravo.”

The Liberal caucus will hold another meeting on Wednesday, likely to discuss all other business now that the most pressing matter has been addressed. Then, Trudeau will partake in the by-annual Daughters of the Vote event where 338 delegates descend on the Hill, in the name of encouraging more women to enter politics.

Wilson-Raybould was received warmly by a number of the delegates at a reception on Monday night and some critics have questioned whether the Liberals wanted to be seen throwing out two female caucus members on the same day as the Equal Voice-run event.

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were federal political rookies, first elected in 2015. They were both appointed to Trudeau’s first and historic gender-balanced cabinet, and were seen to be key to the government’s pledge of reconciliation and developing a new nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people.

Prior to her career in politics, Philpott was a family doctor, and Wilson-Raybould was a crown prosecutor and regional chief.

Speaking to questions over whether this move damages the government’s brand as a feminist government, Liberal cabinet minister Melanie Joly said: “We have a feminist prime minister and I profoundly think that loyalty has nothing to do with gender, you’re either loyal or you’re not.”

In a statement reacting to the news, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said that the pair’s removal “should tell Canadians everything they need to know about how things work in the Liberal Party of Canada,” and offered that there is a place in the Conservative Party for anyone who believes that “speaking truth to power should be rewarded, not punished.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said that this is the way that Trudeau thinks he can make the SNC-Lavalin scandal go away, but it is “not leadership.”

Last-chance letter asking to stay

Trudeau leaning into the narrative about the Liberals’ approach to politics appeared to be speaking directly to some of what Wilson-Raybould had to say in a last-chance letter to her entire caucus, sent Tuesday around noon.

The letter hit the inboxes of Liberal MPs as some were gathering, grim-faced, to discuss her fate. In the letter Wilson-Raybould said she wanted to remain a Liberal MP -- something she has maintained throughout this affair -- and implored her colleagues to consider “what kind of party you want to be a part of.”

In the letter the Vancouver-Granville MP spoke of the Liberals’ 2015 election commitment to do politics differently, more transparently, and by empowering MPs. She stopped short of explicitly saying that she still has confidence in Trudeau.

“I believed we were going to uphold the highest standards that support the public interest, and not simply make choices to create partisan advantage,” she wrote.

She said the vision that the Liberals came into power with was “one of the main reasons” she didn’t hesitate to stand up for what she thought was right in the case of SNC-Lavalin.

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess,” Wilson-Raybould writes in the letter, obtained by CTV News.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said,” her letter said.

Those final few words are something that it seems the entire Liberal caucus agrees with.

“By their actions they have excluded themselves so for us now it’s time to move on,” said Liberal cabinet minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.

His colleague and fellow minister Jim Carr said that “when trust is broken it’s sad and inevitably in public life and in politics, trust and loyalty, and pulling in the same direction is the kind of commitment that is necessary for all team members,” Carr said.

Outrage over secret audio

Over the last two days, numerous Liberal MPs have been speaking out, and expressing disappointment and condemnation over Wilson-Raybould's decision to secretly record and subsequently make public a December conversation she had with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick about SNC-Lavalin.

That audio was released on Friday along with dozens of additional pages of testimony, text messages, transcripts, and copies of emails to supplement her Feb. 27 hours-long testimony.

Speaking to this, Trudeau said it is an “especially wrong” thing for a politician, especially a cabinet minister, to have done.

“And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general… it is unconscionable,” Trudeau said.

Wilson-Raybould defended her recording on Monday, saying it was a ""reasonable, rational thing to do in an unreasonable and irrational situation,"" and that she felt she needed to protect herself.

House filibuster, study shut down again

Since she testified to the allegations, Trudeau has faced calls to resign and the House of Commons has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, the latest being a budget debate filibuster from Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre which is poised to enter its third day.

Early Tuesday the House Justice Committee met behind closed doors to determine next steps for the new studies it decided to take on after ending its probe into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The opposition did try to revive its proposal to resume the study that Liberal MPs shut down a few weeks ago, but that was unsuccessful. Despite the committee having ended its meetings on the matter, it is still receiving new evidence. The latest came in today from Trudeau’s former top adviser Gerald Butts who resigned amid this scandal. He turned over texts and other messages between he and Wilson-Raybould that show the tensions between the PMO and the former justice minister as she was being shuffled into a different portfolio, a move Wilson-Raybould said she thinks was because of her intransigence over not interfering in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal case.

In his televised comments to caucus Tuesday night, Trudeau indicated a desire to refocus the government’s agenda on other matters, and took aim at his opponents.

“Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them, that’s why I made the difficult decision,” Trudeau said.

“Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided, we can’t afford to make that mistake. Canadians are counting on us,” he said.

Party of Canada in the ...","'The trust … has been broken': It’s the latest twist in the turmoil that has roiled the top ranks of the Trudeau government for weeks

OTTAWA — Vancouver MP Jody Wilson-Raybould and Toronto area MP Jane Philpott have both been kicked out of the Liberal caucus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday, moments after their fellow government members of Parliament had gathered on Parliament Hill for an emergency meeting to determine their future with the party.

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns, and ultimately, if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team … then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

The dissident MPs, both former senior cabinet ministers, risked a civil war within the Liberal party, he said. That’s how the Liberals lose power and Canada can’t afford it, he said.

“Canadians will view the removal of Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal caucus for exactly what it is: A betrayal of justice,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said. “Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them. However, in expelling Ms. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould from their caucus, they have done exactly that.”

Wilson-Raybould, whose explosive allegations of political interference by the Prime Minister’s Office appear to have deeply imperilled Liberal hopes of holding on to power in this fall’s federal election, wrote to her fellow — now former — caucus members earlier in the day in hopes of convincing them to let her stay.

But just minutes into Tuesday’s hastily convened meeting, the Vancouver Granville MP, who stepped down from Trudeau’s cabinet in February after he shuffled her out of the coveted justice portfolio, made it clear via Twitter that the letter hadn’t worked.

“I have just been informed by the prime minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election,” she tweeted.

Minutes later, reporters and cameras were ushered into the caucus room to listen to Trudeau announce that both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were out.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told caucus members.

“It’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer be part of our Liberal team.”

Reflecting on what PM has done, my thoughts are w/ my constituents in #VanGran, my dedicated staff & volunteers, my family & friends & all Canadians who believed in a new way of doing politics. I will take the time to reflect & talk to my supporters about what happens next. (1/2) — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

The turmoil has roiled the top ranks of the Trudeau government for weeks, impelled by allegations that Wilson-Raybould was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

And it comes on the heels of a fresh uproar over a key phone conversation between the ex-minister and former Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat — a conversation Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded.

That recording was released Friday as part of her evidence of what Wilson-Raybould calls an intense pressure campaign to persuade her to override a decision to deny SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement, which would allow the engineering giant to avoid criminal proceedings on corruption and fraud charges.

In the weeks following Wilson-Raybould’s resignation, caucus had grown divided over the question of whether she and Philpott should be allowed to remain as Liberal MPs. Trudeau himself had initially suggested he would be willing to let them stay, saying repeatedly that he was reserving judgment.

But Friday’s release of Wilson-Raybould’s 17-minute phone conversation with Wernick — and the fact she recorded it — appeared to tip the scales.

“If a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone, it’s wrong. When that politician is a cabinet minister secretly recording a public servant, it’s wrong. And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general of Canada, secretly recording the clerk of the Privy Council, it’s unconscionable.”

He said he was chosen to be Liberal leader, and then prime minister, because he promised a more unifying style than the Conservatives before him.

“We won because we stood together as a team, which was, to be frank, a change from past iterations of this party. The old Liberal party was notorious for infighting. People on the same team used to identify themselves not as Liberals but as hyphenated Liberals,” he said. “Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them.”

For the sake of unity, he said, Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had to go.

Trudeau finished by swinging into a campaign speech, touting the Liberal record on the environment, the economy and minority rights.

“This is what this year’s election is about. This is what’s on the line,” he said.

In her appeal to her caucus mates, Wilson-Raybould said she rejected the prime minister’s pressure on SNC-Lavalin because she was standing up for Liberal values.

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself,” Wilson-Raybould wrote in her letter to caucus members.

“I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said.”

Toronto MP John McKay, who was unmoved by Wilson-Raybould’s letter, said he’s dismayed by her behaviour and believes she and Philpott are “joined at the hip.” Fellow MP Judy Sgro agreed the letter is “too little, too late.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne criticized Wilson-Raybould’s ethics, saying he had never recorded any conversations he had while working as a lawyer. Tourism Minister Melanie Joly called it “fundamentally wrong.”

In the call, Wernick repeatedly asked Wilson-Raybould why she was not using all the tools at her disposal on the SNC-Lavalin case. She pushes back, saying she would not override the decision of the director of public prosecutions to pursue a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its activities in Libya.

Wernick told her Trudeau was “quite determined” on the matter and would likely “find a way to get it done one way or another.”

NDP MP Jenny Kwan said Trudeau’s move Tuesday was an extension of that attitude — he’d decided he was going to get his way and threw two unco-operative women under the bus, she said.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of Justice to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene on SNC’s behalf. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

Philpott followed suit in early March, citing a loss in confidence in the government’s handling of the matter.

Conservative whites “who dislike diversity ...","“How are the Gulf Islands being changed by global migration patterns?”

That was the title for a talk I was to give on the Gulf Islands, after a library committee asked me to hop on the ferry and meet some of those whose homes are surrounded by the Salish Sea.

Gulf Island organizers of the talk tacked up small posters about it at their community centres, their (often-organic) grocery stores and (vegetarian) cafes.

But there was a misunderstanding. Many locals assumed, since the notices said there was to be a presentation about “global migration patterns,” I was going to talk about … birds.

It turns out bird migration may be more germane to nature-loving, kayak-paddling Gulf Islanders than the trans-national migration of humans, a phenomenon that is a key issue in Metro Vancouver but far less noticeable on the islands.

Unlike Metro Vancouver, where the population is almost half foreign-born, the demographic reality is vividly different just a short B.C. Ferries ride away from the big, bustling city.

The number of foreign-born residents who have made a home in the past two decades on the Southern Gulf Islands is just two per cent. And, unlike Metro Vancouver where the 2016 census shows whites comprise about 49 per cent of residents, the proportion of people of European origin on the Southern Gulf Islands is a notable 97 per cent.

You don’t have to be a demographer to recognize something happens when you join passengers on a ferry to the Southern Gulf Islands, Sunshine Coast, Northern Gulf Islands, or, to a slightly lesser extent, Vancouver Island. The ferry’s population suddenly turns quite European in origin.

It’s part of a long-term trend, according to Statistics Canada. More than 85 per cent of immigrants to B.C., most of whom are Asians or other people of colour, move to Metro Vancouver.

At the same time, roughly 9,000 whites and Aboriginals each year depart Metro Vancouver for different parts of B.C., especially towns on the southwest coast.

Let’s take the Southern Gulf Islands as an illustration. The region of rocky beaches and forest (comprising Galiano, Mayne, Pender and Saturna) provides a graphic example of the urban-rural split in regards to ethno-cultural enclaves.

While large sections of Richmond are more than two-thirds ethnic Chinese, and the core of north Surrey is more than two-thirds South Asian, more than nine of 10 of the 4,660 permanent residents of the Southern Gulf Islands are of English, Scottish or Irish descent.

The total visible minority population of the Southern Gulf Islands is only 143 people. The biggest minority cohort is Japanese, followed by Chinese and Latin Americans. And most of them settled several decades ago, if not earlier. Strikingly, the census shows no South Asians make a home on the Southern Gulf Islands.

The Indigenous proportion of the Southern Gulf Islands, meanwhile, is about five per cent, almost as high as the B.C. average. However, none of those speak an Aboriginal language. That is unlike the 195 who have German, Dutch or Danish as a second language.

The strong European roots of the Southern Gulf Islands — where the vast majority of immigrants came, before 1980, from Britain or the United States — has cultural and even political implications.

Voters on the Southern Gulf Islands have recently, for instance, sent a Green party candidate to both Ottawa and Victoria. That unique achievement reflects a Mainstreet poll that suggests B.C. whites are far more inclined to vote for the Green party than people of colour.

The shift to ethnic enclaves is likely to continue across B.C. Similar to human movements in Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and elsewhere, a segment of whites are leaving behind highly diverse neighbourhoods of Metro Vancouver and Toronto for nearby predominantly white regions.

Political scientist Eric Kaufmann, who was raised in Vancouver to mixed-race parents, has created a chart showing how the proportion of whites jumped by roughly 20 per cent in a recent period in municipalities such as Squamish, North Vancouver and Port Moody.

Saanich, West Vancouver and Abbotsford are somewhat similar, Kaufmann found, retaining populations in which four of five are white.

Why are such trends occurring in the increasingly ethnically diverse West?

Demographers have long realized that many members of ethno-cultural groups tend to flock together for the sense of familiarity and the economic and social support.

In his new book, Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities, Kaufmann cites studies showing whites tend to move out of urban neighbourhoods that are changing as a result of in-migration.

And, surprisingly, the studies show white liberals leave ethnically diverse neighbourhoods for more Caucasian ones at a slightly higher rate than white conservatives (partly because liberals are more inclined in general to move).

Conservative whites “who dislike diversity don’t retreat from it any more than pro-diversity whites do,” writes Kaufmann, who is at the University of London, Birkbeck.

“What people say and do seems almost totally disconnected.”

Such trends make up the demographic experiment that is Metro Vancouver, which, along with Toronto, ranks as the most ethnically super-diverse region of Canada, if not the world. Meanwhile, the broad geography of Canada remains predominantly white.

For a moment, I was tempted to suggest the headline for this article about the Southern Gulf Islands could be: “Journey into the heart of whiteness.”

That would have played on the title of Joseph Conrad’s famous book, The Heart of Darkness, which was about a harrowing journey into the Congo, which Francis Ford Coppola turned into Vietnam in Apocalypse Now.

But such a headline would likely feed more half-jokes about whites. And that’s a North American cultural trend that Reihan Salam took apart in a brilliant essay in The Atlantic, titled The Utility of White Bashing.

Salam explains how anti-white rhetoric can be a way to get ahead socially and “often smacks of intra-white status jockeying.”

As with members of other ethnic enclaves in urban Canada, it is easiest to leave the white Southern Gulf Islanders to their pursuits, be they alternative energy, gardening, amateur music bands, Green party politics, orca-watching, or birding.

As people of any origin know, delight can be found in grabbing a pair of binoculars and focusing on the annual “global migration patterns” of cormorants, oystercatchers and hummingbirds.

The announcement came at the end of an emergency caucus meeting to consider expelling former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould after she released a secret recording last week that reignited the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Former Budget Minister Jane Philpott, who had quit in protest over Mr Trudeau's handling of the controversy, was also removed.

The Liberals have been in turmoil since February when Ms Wilson-Raybould said officials had inappropriately pressured her to ensure a major construction company escaped a corruption trial when she was justice minister last year.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Mr Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus.

""Whether it's taping conversations without consent or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it's become clear that (both) can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Angry legislators had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity.

Opposition leader Andrew Scheer said the prime minister's decision to expel the two ministers shows ""if you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party.""

Justin Trudeau’s fall from grace

The Canadian Liberal party surged in popularity under the leadership of Justin Trudeau, son of popular former PM Pierre Trudeau.

Having finished the 2011 election in third place, Mr Trudeau’s Liberals secured a 20 per cent swing at the 2015 election and over 140 seats to knock the ruling Conservative party out of power.

Once seen as a poster boy for progressive politics, the shine has come off Mr Trudeau’s political tenure.

He was embroiled in a conflict of interest scandal in December 2017 over a family vacation to the island of business magnate Aga Khan, who has received funding from the Canadian Government to support his philanthropic efforts.

Mr Trudeau also came under strong criticism over an eight day visit to India last year, where he accidentally dined with a Sikh extremist found guilty of the attempted murder of an Indian minister.

AFP

Now his leadership has been derailed by a prosecution meddling scandal just months before Canada goes to the polls in Autumn.

SNC-Lavalin is a prominent engineering and construction company based in Montreal, who have offices in over 50 countries including Australia.

The firm is facing a number of fraud and corruption charges over business dealings in Libya.

The company has been pushing for the charges to be resolved with a deferred prosecution agreement, a new measure legislated by the Trudeau government last year.

A deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) would allow large companies accused of crimes like corruption, bribery and fraud to escape trial and criminal prosecution and instead pay an economic penalty.

AFP/Getty Images

On February 7, a report from the newspaper The Globe and Mail alleged SNC-Lavalin had lobbied the Prime Minister's Office to secure a DPA.

The report claimed the Prime Minister's office had pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the case and persuade prosecutors to drop the criminal trial.

Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned from her cabinet affairs in the days following the story’s release.

She then testified to the Justice Committee, saying she'd experienced ""consistent and sustained"" political pressure to interfere in the case, including ""veiled threats.""

Mr Trudeau steadfastly denied the claims.

“The Attorney General has been historically in charge of Prosecutions, but in the last decade much of that function has been given over to the director of public prosecutions,"" explains Dr Victoria Colvin, a University of Wollongong lecturer and former criminal prosecutor in British Columbia.

“Part of the purpose of having that office is to insulate prosecution from politics.""

""The Attorney General does have some powers to intervene, but the idea is decisions are made independent of political considerations and potentially the appearance of those considerations.”

Last Friday the scandal took another turn after Ms Wilson-Raybould released a phone recording along with other documents to support her claims.

The recording of a call between Ms Wilson-Raybould and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick contains a conversation in which Mr Wernick signals the Prime Minister's concerns over plans to prosecute SNC-Lavelin.

Mr Trudeau described Ms Wilson-Raybould’s decision to secretly record the phone call as ‘unconscionable’.

Dr Colvin says the alleged actions of Mr Trudeau's office could contravene the Shawcross Doctrine, a longstanding constitutional convention in British Commonwealth nations.

""We have a long established convention and understanding that the decisions to prosecute individual cases are separate from the political process,"" she explains.

“How that actually works in practice is very rarely tested.”

Ms Wilson-Raybould responded to her expulsion on Twitter and says she did ‘what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party.”

What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party. I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do. (2/2) — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

Fellow expelled MP Jane Philpott said her expulsion is “profoundly disheartening.”

“This isn’t about a lack of loyalty,” she wrote in a statement on Facebook.

“This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty, in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence, but to no avail.”

“These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.”",Trudeau expels two ministers from party as corruption scandal threatens re-election,SBS,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/trudeau-expels-two-ministers-from-party-as-corruption-scandal-threatens-re-election

Although cannabis retailers across Canada have faced product shortages since legalization, Gawri said his store received everything it ordered. When asked whether he was worried ...","Customers lined up at Ontario’s first brick-and-mortar cannabis stores on Monday, but fewer than half of the province’s government-licensed outlets were ready to open.

The Progressive Conservative government had planned to have 25 private stores launch on April 1, but some were still working through a lengthy approval process.

Premier Doug Ford defended his government’s decision to hold a lottery to determine who could apply for store licences, saying more shops would be opening soon.

“Over the next few weeks we’ll get it done,” he said. “If it means another week or two to get it right, let’s do it.”

Recreational cannabis has so far only been available for purchase legally in Ontario through a government-run website. Other provinces have long had the option to buy legal pot in stores since legalization in October.

The Alcohol and Gaming Commission, which is overseeing Ontario’s vetting process, said 10 stores were given the green light to open Monday – three in Ottawa, two in Kingston and one each in Toronto, Brampton, Burlington, London, and St. Catharines.

In Toronto, Stephanie Shamoon was the second person in line outside the Hunny Pot Cannabis Co. She said she braved the unseasonal cold from 10 p.m. Sunday to be part of a significant moment.

“It’s kind of a history-in-the making kind of thing,” said the 20-year-old, noting that shopping in a physical store was much easier than buying pot online. “You can come in right away, pick up what you want… you can smell it.”

Hunny Gawri, owner of the sprawling store, said he got barely an hour’s sleep as employees rushed to get ready for the opening.

“We have a full house in here,” he said. “It’s everything we could have asked for.”

Although cannabis retailers across Canada have faced product shortages since legalization, Gawri said his store received everything it ordered. When asked whether he was worried about running out of product in the coming days, he said, it would depend on customer demand.

In Burlington, Art Jackes lined up at 4 a.m. at RELM Cannabis Co., which had about two dozen people waiting outside when doors opened.

Jackes, 67, who is a medicinal cannabis user, said his overall experience at the store was good but he felt the prices were too high.

“The government’s not going to have any chance of dealing with the black market if they don’t lower the cost,” he said.

Gord Nichols, who arrived at the store at 5:30 a.m., said he lined up because he wanted to be part of an important day.

“I just wanted to wait and see what the excitement is about,” he said, adding that he hoped legalization lifts some of the stigma around cannabis. “It’s the end of prohibition.”

Store owner David Nguyen said he was happy to be one of the few shops that were open.

“We’re all here to make history,” he said. “We have great educators to teach about products and we also have security to ensure that they’re checking IDs.”

In the nation’s capital a long line formed outside Fire & Flower, located in Ottawa’s tourist hub, the Byward Market.

Niki Schaap said she was at the store celebrating her first day of retirement and looking for something to help with pain management.

“I’m open to lots of things in life,” she said. “I also wanted to be part of the opening of the store and the first day.”

Store owner Michael Patterson said he is confident he will be able to meet customer demand.

“Everyone is coming in the door with a big smile and is leaving with an even bigger smile,” he said.

In Kingston, roughly 500 to 600 customers had come through the Spiritleaf store by noon, said Darren Bondar, chief executive of the cannabis-retail chain that had partnered with the lottery winner who applied for the store licence.

Bondar said Spiritleaf was “thrilled” to work on the store but hoped the next wave of retail licensing was handled differently.

“I hope that for the next round of licences, that AGCO and OCS consult with industry. There’s a lot of provinces that did it different ways, so we know what works.”

Lawyer Caryma Sa’d, who specialized in cannabis cases, said there was much “disappointment” over the launch of cannabis shops in Ontario.

The way that it rolled out with a lottery that seemed completely arbitrary, no real merit component, it’s not surprising that only a handful of stores in an already artificially low number of licenses, were able to open,” she said.

The Tory government had initially said there would be no cap on the number of retail pot shops. But in December, citing national supply issues, the government said it was issuing licences for just 25 stores.

Stores face escalating penalties for delays – failing to open a store Monday results in a $12,500 draw down on a letter of credit, while not opening by the end of April means applicants risk losing their entire $50,000 letter of credit.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath slammed the government for the delays, saying it had time to put a proper system in place last fall but failed.

“This lack of access we have today is squarely at the feet of Mr. Ford and his government,” she said.

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said the Tory plan was failing the public.

“The competition here is between organized crime and private stores,” he said. “Ten stores across the province is not going to put a dent in organized crime.”

By Robert Stevens

4 April 2019

The plot by a neo-Nazi, Jack Renshaw, to murder Labour Party MP Rosie Cooper was finally revealed following the end of a seven-week trial at London’s Old Bailey.

Renshaw was on trial, accused of being a member of a fascist organisation, National Action, which was banned by the Conservative government in November 2016 and proscribed as a terrorist group. Last July, the leader of National Action, Christopher Lythgoe, was jailed for eight years after being found guilty of membership of the group. Another fascist, Matthew Hankinson, was jailed for six years for membership. They had been arrested by police who were investigating the plot to kill Cooper after a tip-off.

That court heard evidence that Lythgoe was aware that Renshaw, then aged 22, intended to kill Cooper, the MP for West Lancashire. At the beginning of that trial, Renshaw pleaded guilty to preparing to kill Cooper and admitted that he purchased a replica 19-inch Roman Gladius sword for that purpose.

He had spent just under a month planning to kill Cooper, explaining, “I wanted to send a message to the state that if you beat a dog long enough it bites—she [Cooper] just happened to be my local MP.”

He planned to “turn up at one of her social events” and then “hack” at her jugular vein with the knife. He also admitted planning to kill a police officer, Victoria Henderson, who was investigating him for sexual offences, including grooming children for sex.

The plot to kill Cooper was initiated just one year after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by the fascist Thomas Mair, who stabbed and shot her to death outside a library in her west Yorkshire constituency of Batley and Spen. The killing took place on June 16, 2016, just one week before the referendum on the UK’s European Union (EU) membership.

National Action, which was established in 2013, was banned after it hailed the murder of Cox.

At their trial, Lythgoe, Renshaw and four other defendants denied membership of National Action between December 2016 and September 2017. The court heard that just days before the ban, Lythgoe sent out an e-mail to National Action members as to how they would respond: “It’s going to be a piece of p**s. We discard the name and symbolism of National Action… The important thing is that what we’ve built up stays together… Secondly, at the regional level we should all split up into autonomous regional groups. Though behind the scenes it’ll still be run much the same. We’ll keep away from the proactive stuff for now... just focus on effective activism.”

The plot to murder Cooper came to light after a former National Action member, Robbie Mullen, contacted Matthew Collins, a member of the Hope not Hate anti-racist organisation in July 2017. Mullen became disillusioned with the fascist outfit and began to inform on its activities that April.

Collins said he received a message from Mullen while on holiday in Portugal, asking him to “call me ASAP”. When they spoke the following morning, Mullen told Collins that Renshaw had discussed killing Cooper during a meeting in a pub in Warrington.

Lythgoe was found not guilty of encouragement to murder Cooper, but the jury heard a tape recording of him telling Mullen that he would prefer it if a Conservative MP, Amber Rudd, was killed instead.

The jury failed to reach a verdict on whether Renshaw was a member of National Action after it was banned, leading to a retrial, which began last month. At his latest trial, another jury were also not able to reach unanimous or majority verdicts on whether Renshaw was a member of National Action. He will be sentenced on May 17, in relation to his admission that he planned to kill Cooper.

Still in his early 20s, Renshaw has been heavily involved in fascist organisations since his youth. Aged 15, he joined the English Defence League (EDL), founded by Tommy Robinson before joining the British National Party (BNP). He met its then leader, Nick Griffin, and became a leading figure in BNP Youth. In October 2014, he stood as a candidate for the BNP in a Blackpool council ward by-election. As a BNP member he worked for a period at the European Parliament in Brussels. He was forced to leave a university course at Manchester Metropolitan University in 2015 after an investigation into his incitement of racial hatred.

By 2015, Renshaw was a member of National Action. At a “Yorkshire Forum for Nationalists” event of the group, he called for Jews to be “eradicated”. Described as a National Action “spokesman” he stated, “Hitler was right in many senses but you know where he was wrong? He showed mercy to people who did not deserve mercy... As nationalists we need to learn from the mistakes of the National Socialists and we need to realise that, no, you do not show the Jew mercy.”

Last July, Renshaw was charged by the Crown Prosecution Service for incitement to racial hatred related to statements made at a demonstration in 2016 in Blackpool of another fascist group, the North West Infidels (where he described Jews as “parasites”) and at a Yorkshire Forum for Nationalists event the previous month.

In January 2018, Renshaw was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison for the offences.

Between this conviction and sentencing he was jailed, in June, after being found guilty of four counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, after grooming two boys online, aged 13 and 15.

The cases of Renshaw and Mair and the horrific massacre of 50 Muslim worshippers—carried out at two mosques in New Zealand by Australian fascist Brenton Tarrant last month—confirm the warnings made by the Socialist Equality Party that a significant layer of the far right are now engaged in the planning and carrying out of terrorist activity, including the killing of elected politicians.

Under conditions of a systemic crisis of the capitalist system and mounting social and political tensions in every country, fascist and other right-wing forces are targeting those they consider to be the “left” and “Marxists”. On March 3, while Renshaw was appearing in court, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was violently attacked by a pro-Brexit thug who had previously stated on a Facebook page that he would like to kill opponents of Brexit.

She is currently the executive director of Premier Rachel Notley’s Southern Alberta office.

The Gauntlet: Why should students vote for you?



Anne McGrath: Well, I think students have a very important choice ahead of them. For one thing, students on campus must recognize that if [the NDP] had not won in 2015, there were going to be deep cuts to post-secondary education. As a result of having an NDP government for the last three-and-a-half, four years, there has been not only sustained funding but there has been increased investment in post-secondary education, particularly on this campus. And of course, affordability as well is a big part of who is able to access post-secondary education and this government froze tuition fees so that most students will have realized a savings over the period of the government of about $2,000.

Gauntlet: You alluded to how post-secondary tuition in Alberta has been tied to the rate of inflation and previously has been frozen, which will extend for another year. Do you think that this is an appropriate end solution for students, and if not, how would you approach post-secondary tuition policy if you were elected?



McGrath: I think over time it would be good to see increases in tuition limited and even decline, because I think it is and can be a barrier for students in attending. It is a small part of the funding formula right now, but a significant thing for many, many students. I’m actually very committed to making sure post-secondary education is accessible to everybody who is able to attend and who wants to attend.

Gauntlet: Have you put much thought into international student tuition, which is not currently regulated for students?



McGrath: International tuition, I have not looked at it recently, to be honest. But I do know that having international students at a university only benefits a university. We should be attracting international students because it not only benefits themselves and the communities they’re coming from but they also enrich the student community here and enrich the classroom experience.



Gauntlet: More broadly, can you tell me about the issues you think are facing residents of Calgary-Varsity that are most important in this election?



McGrath: I think the issues in Calgary-Varsity are the same as the issues anywhere. I think it’s around jobs and the economy. It’s around what kind of programs and services we have as a society. And most fundamentally, the question for residents of Calgary-Varsity and all around the province is, who do you want to be the premier? There’s a very stark choice, I believe, in this next election.



We can either have Jason Kenney, who I believe is dedicated to making cuts to things that are important to us, who has questionable attitudes towards vulnerable groups, has been on the record in opposition to basic women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, those kinds of things. Who, I think, wants to give very big tax giveaways to the richest and most powerful in our society at the expense of others and who has no plan to diversify the economy and take us out of the boom and bust cycle. The choice is between that kind of leadership and the leadership of Rachel Notley, who inherited a very difficult situation and has done an excellent job, has invested in some very important programs, is steadily bringing down the deficit and who is taking action on diversifying our economy.

Gauntlet: To move back to a few youth-related and student-related issues, I’m curious about your thoughts on a lower minimum wage for youth workers.



McGrath: Fundamentally, a lower minimum wage for young people means that it’s not a minimum wage. A minimum wage is a minimum wage and I don’t think there are two classes of citizens. I think it’s actually discriminatory to have a lower minimum wage for youth. I think it’s absolutely wrong and Rachel Notley is on record saying that will never happen under her watch.

Gauntlet: The two largest universities in Alberta are now reaching deferred maintenance costs over $1.5 billion. Do you think that this needs to be addressed, and if so, how?



McGrath: Well, we have been addressing it, and you can see it in things like the upgrades to the MacKimmie Complex and other areas on campus. One of the things that we did when we were first forming government in 2015 was, instead of making big cuts we decided to invest and in particular, to invest in capital infrastructure, which is the place where deferred maintenance costs come from. We’re very committed to capital infrastructure for a number of reasons. One is that it makes economic sense and the other is that we need those things. But also, in addition to that, when you have capital infrastructure programs, you have to staff them and you have to fund them. In this riding, for instance, we’re building a cancer care centre that was promised over and over again by previous governments and was never built. We will build it and we will staff it.

138,World,2019-04-03T20:56:00.0000000Z,"But when they look at the growing divide over Israel within the Democratic Party, they have concerns about how the progressive candidates are breaking with what they viewed as conventional pro-Israel policy. ""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to ...","Not long ago, if a U.S. presidential hopeful from either party was mounting a serious bid for the Oval Office, the candidate would seek a spot on the main stage at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference, the largest U.S. gathering of the pro-Israel lobby.

This year, it seems, not so much.

While the 2019 speakers list was stacked with officials from President Donald Trump's administration and Republican Party grandees, most major Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 were missing from the conference altogether.

The three-day event, which ended Tuesday, included speeches from Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.

So I am troubled that leading Democrats seem to have some difficulty plainly calling out anti-semitism within their own ranks. And I am troubled that many of the declared Democrat presidential candidates seem to be avoiding <a href=""https://twitter.com/AIPAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@AIPAC</a> this year. —@senatemajldr

Nine of the biggest names in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination skipped the conference this year, and not one Democratic candidate was on the speakers list.

Jewish Americans have long aligned themselves with liberal causes. About 75 per cent of Jews voted Democratic in the 2018 midterms. But some delegates at this year's conference noted with dismay recent comments by freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar that they felt trafficked in stereotypes about Jewish political influence and money.

Recent polling suggests there is more willingness among younger progressive voters to criticize Israel.

Some AIPAC attendees who spoke with CBC News wondered whether the party has shifted too far to the left. Here's what some of them said.

Michael Goldberg, 49, Democrat from New York:

Michael Goldberg is waiting for a more 'centrist' Democrat to get in the race. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""It used to be that Democrats and Republicans had to fight to get a spot on the stage,"" Goldberg said.

Noting the lack of 2020 candidates on the speakers' list, he asked, ""Who's here that's running for the presidency for the Democrats?""

The attorney and father of three admitted that he feels ""a bit politically lost.""

He supported Barack Obama during his two terms in office. He and his wife have been ""lifelong Democrats,"" and are still registered with the party. But they voted for Trump in 2016 and may do so again in 2020, unless a Democrat they consider ""more centrist"" decides to run.

The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! <a href=""https://twitter.com/OANN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@OANN</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/foxandfriends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@foxandfriends</a> —@realDonaldTrump

Asked about talk of an ""Exodus"" or ""Jexodus"" — a movement begun by conservatives to woo Jewish-Americans away from the Democrats to the Republicans — Goldberg gave a knowing nod.

""It's me and my wife. That's what happened,"" he said. ""The Democrats were friends of the Jewish people. They were friends of Israel. But it's a different party now.""

Vicki Fishman, 47, Independent from Washington, D.C.:

Vicki Fishman is an Independent who lives in Washington. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""The American Jewish community stands for social justice, and the Democratic Party has positioned itself as being the party of social justice,"" Fishman said.

She's aware the eventual Democratic nominee often addresses AIPAC in an election year, as has been the case in the past three presidential election cycles, and that the upcoming election is still 19 months away.

""This is an off-year,"" she said.

Indeed, AIPAC's policy is to invite presidential candidates to speak only in election years. Even so, Hillary Clinton addressed AIPAC in 2016 as well as the off-year in 2015. Obama spoke there before the 2008 election, as well as in 2011 and again in the lead-up to his re-election in 2012. In 2007, a non-election year, both Clinton and Obama competed for Jewish voters, holding big events at AIPAC.

Rep. Ilhan Omar's tweets have ""complicated"" the public discourse for the Democratic Party, Fishman said. But she considers it to be a distraction.

""We're living in a polarized country right now, and that's just adding to the general polarization, and maybe that's taking up within the party.""

Katie Draisen, 20, Democrat from Boston:

Katie Draisen supports Elizabeth Warren's bid to be the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""There are so many conservative politicians here. It's really concerning to me as someone who is pro-Israel, Jewish-American because it feels to me like Jewish-Americans are being used by Republicans to gain voters,"" said Draisen, a self-described liberal Democrat.

""Knowing that Mitch McConnell is here, that makes me want to throw up.""

Draisen, a student at Boston University, supports Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren's bid for the Democratic nomination, though she declined to attend the conference.

Trump's closeness with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has aroused skepticism among her Gen Z progressive friends ""who see Israel and pro-Israel Americans as villains,"" Draisen said.

Netanyahu was listed as a speaker, but skipped AIPAC after a Gaza rocket attack. Netanyahu sent in a video address from Israel on Tuesday. A few months earlier, he reportedly told an aide, ""We don't need AIPAC anymore,"" reasoning he had enough support from American evangelicals and Trump.

Dismayed as she was that major Democratic 2020 hopefuls didn't attend, Draisen also said she saw political risk for them had they showed up at AIPAC. Doing so, she said, would be ""a big turnoff to most liberal Democrats.""

""It's unfortunate because I think most people don't understand the importance of supporting Israel, supporting a two-state solution, and learning.""

Marcia Jacobs, 86, Republican from Los Angeles:

Marcia Jacobs says she likes many of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Trump wasn't Jacobs's first choice to be president, but she has come to see the commander-in-chief as a staunch ally of Israel. Among the actions that convinced her was the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, as well as its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by moving the embassy there.

""He supports it so strongly, and [Democrats] are so anti-Trump that they're letting it affect any other issue,"" she said.

Jacobs was appalled by reports that the liberal non-profit MoveOn.org had urged Democratic candidates not to attend AIPAC.

""That's absolutely horrific,"" she said.

She also praised Trump for his tweet last week reversing more than 50 years of U.S. foreign policy on the Golan Heights by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the strategically important strip of rocky highlands located where the borders meet between northern Israel, southern Lebanon and Syria.

Manny Srulowitz, 18, Independent from Long Island, N.Y.:

Manny Srulowitz says he's noticed a new wave of Democrats who are critical of Israel. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Srulowitz, a moderate, said he was receiving emails last week from a pro-Israel organization informing him about the latest Democrats to pull out of AIPAC. He comes from a Republican household that voted for Trump in 2016.

""I wouldn't have enough knowledge to give you a confident answer about why the Democrats are all leaving,"" he said, ""but it's very evident the Democrats are not here.""

The high school senior from Long Island will be 20 years old in 2020, but doesn't see a Democratic candidate yet who would capture his vote.

""I have noticed there is a new wave of young and critical Democrats, usually the younger ones,"" he said of what he sees as declining support for Israel among people of his generation. ""I am not one of them. I am a big fan of the state of Israel.""

Ira and Susan Kapinow, 78 and 76, Independents from Potomac, Md.:

Susan and Ira Kapinow say they can't see themselves voting for Trump in 2020, but they don't like some of the things they see going on in the Democratic Party. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

As ""middle-of-the-roaders"" who try to avoid extremes in their politics, this is a fraught time for Ira and Susan Kapinow, married retirees and strong supporters of Israel.

Susan was troubled by support among at least two Democratic newcomers in Congress for the so-called BDS movement — a campaign calling for a boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.

""I find it offensive. Israel is a strong ally and a strong friend,"" Susan said.

The Kapinows can't see themselves happily voting for Trump in 2020. But when they look at the growing divide over Israel within the Democratic Party, they have concerns about how the progressive candidates are breaking with what they viewed as conventional pro-Israel policy.

""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to be generational,"" Ira said. ""The older Democrats were more supportive of Israel, the more traditional way. The younger Democrats are moving more and more to the left on Israel. Way too far left.""

Stewart Eisenberg, 64, Democrat from Philadelphia:

Stewart Eisenberg says he wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls at the conference this year. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

A liberal Democrat who voted for Clinton in 2016, Eisenberg has attended AIPAC's annual policy conference more than 20 times.

""You would like to see some presidential candidates from both sides, but we don't have the presidential candidate from the Republican side, either,"" he said.

He wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls this year, noting that top Democrats in Congress such as Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave speeches, as well as House majority leader Steny Hoyer.

Eisenberg balked at the idea of a ""Jexodus.""

""I think it's overblown,"" he said. ""You have certain people on the right and certain people on the left that have different views about Israel. Both parties have taken a turn to the radical side on both extremes, but in the general majority of the party on both sides, there has always been bipartisan support for Israel. That continues.""",Lack of big-name Democratic candidates at pro-Israel conference confirms for some voters the party has changed,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/aipac-democrats-jexodus-1.5072069

The leaders of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. signed an agreement last year after 13 months of difficult negotiations. But the deal will not come into force unless the legislatures of the three countries vote to approve it.

U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi during a news conference on health care in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, DC. on April 2, 2019. In an interview with the U.S. website Politico, Pelosi said that the text of the new NAFTA agreement must be changed to allow for stronger enforcement of provisions on labour standards. ( Alex Wong / GETTY IMAGES )

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s comments were the latest indication that a ratification vote is not close to happening in Congress. Pelosi said that the text of the agreement must be changed to allow for stronger enforcement of provisions on labour standards. Pelosi said it would not be sufficient to deal with these concerns only in the U.S. legislation eventually written to implement the deal, since U.S. laws do not govern the behaviour of Canada and Mexico. “We’re saying that enforcement has to be in the treaty, not in the implementing legislation,” Pelosi said in a public interview by the U.S. website Politico. “Implementing legislation only bears on how we act, it doesn’t have to bear on how all three countries act.”

The Canadian government has expressed opposition to a reopening. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters last month that “Canada has done its part” and that the negotiations were “very thorough.” Freeland told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday that the Canadian government shares Democrats’ concerns about Mexico’s labour situation. Pelosi also said the House would not hold a vote until Mexico not only passes a new labour law, which could happen this spring, but also demonstrates “some commitment, sincerity” to putting that new law into practice. “It’ll take some time. We have to see the evidence of what’s happening, not only that they pass the bill but they implement the policy,” Pelosi said. Additional negotiations were needed to finalize the original NAFTA after that deal was signed in the early 1990s. In that case, “side letters,” separate from the main text of the agreement, were added to the deal package to address Democratic concerns.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has called on President Donald Trump’s administration to eliminate its tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, suggesting Canada would not ratify the deal until the tariffs are gone. If Canada did not hold a ratification vote by June, the vote almost certainly would not happen until after the Canadian federal election expected in October. That would take the U.S. firmly into the Democrats’ presidential primary season, when party legislators could be even more reluctant to vote in favour of a Trump priority.

Citing the Canadian election, senior Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said Monday that Trump needs to remove the tariffs to get the deal done this year. “I would think the president would want to get it done this year,” he said.

For Democratic presidential candidates, it’s 300-plus events, 24 states and hundreds of voter questions.

The Iowa caucus is still 10 months away, but the Democratic primary campaign is already an all-out sprint — passing eye-popping markers for campaign activity and voter engagement. Voters in Florida and Ohio may not see it, but weekends in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — not to mention a handful of select states — are a blitz of candidate rallies and local meet-and-greets.

For some candidates the frenetic pace is the message, a way of casting themselves as tireless and willing to take every last question. Elizabeth Warren and Beto O’Rourke are trying to make an ambitious schedule and accessibility part of their brands, but Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand have done their parts to keep up with several dozen events each, most in early-voting states.

READ MORE: Democratic hopefuls Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg raise $12 million and $7 million, respectively

It’s far from clear that the candidate who holds the most events, whether leaping onto tables or addressing big rallies, will emerge as the candidate with the most votes. Still, Democrats watching the display from a distance say the engagement, the activity and the enthusiasm bode well.

“Broad picture: This is incredibly good for the Democratic Party,” said Jim Messina, who managed President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign.

The Democrats’ contested 2008 primary and the GOP’s packed 2016 field showed “that enthusiasm in primaries becomes very important in a general election,” Messina said. That’s because engaged backers are “more likely to do two things you need them to do” in order to win, he said: donate money and help persuade their social networks to vote.

WATCH: Democrats demand full Mueller report

For all the recent upheaval in politics, the 2020 campaign so far shows some things haven’t changed. Retail campaign stops are still essential to breaking through in early-voting states that will play a central role in choosing the nominee. They are, perhaps, even more important in the social media era. One live-streamed rally that goes viral on social media can reach more voters than dozens of smaller events.

Even though no one metric can predict success, a look at the campaigns’ tallies of on-the-ground engagement shows how the some busiest road warriors are faring at the end of the first quarter.

Warren and O’Rourke are logging mileage in areas their party hasn’t always traveled to early on and underscoring their appetite for grassroots interaction, a style Pete Buttigieg is also cultivating. Warren took more than 200 questions from voters and O’Rourke answered more than 350, according to their campaigns’ first-quarter estimates.

That’s a notable feat for O’Rourke, who only entered the race last month. The former Texas congressman has logged 55 first-quarter events in nine states where he publicly took voter questions, according to his campaign. Gillibrand held 59 public events in eight states since launching an exploratory committee in January, according to the New York senator’s campaign. Buttigieg has held 35 events in 11 states since the South Bend, Indiana, mayor started an exploratory committee that same month. WATCH: Beto O’Rourke kicks off presidential campaign, says Trump uses ‘fear and division’

California Sen. Kamala Harris has emerged as a top-tier contender despite fewer public events than some opponents, clocking in with 26 public first-quarter events in eight states since launching her campaign in January, according to an AP estimate. Harris’ campaign said Monday night that she took more than 100 voter questions during first-quarter events, where total estimated turnout has topped 37,000.

Warren, a former law professor whose campaign is keeping detailed statistics, took questions at 48 events in 12 states over all three months, according to the Massachusetts senator’s campaign. Her aides measure her commitment to voter engagement partly in selfies — estimating that she’s taken more than 12,000 with voters so far. The tally of extra time after events is itself a strategic move, an argument that availability can win the day while other candidates spend time on the high-dollar fundraisers she’s sworn off.

Other Democrats are consciously mixing up their number and types of public events. Booker is holding a bigger kickoff of a national tour soon after holding smaller events. The New Jersey senator’s campaign estimates that he has held more than 50 public events in seven states since he jumped into the race in February.

A handful of other candidates have lagged behind in their total number of first-quarter events. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar logged 18 events in nine states since forming her campaign in February, according to an AP tally, with former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee each holding 12 events. Former housing secretary Julian Castro has held more than a dozen of his own over the first quarter.

All of these candidates tend to fall behind Bernie Sanders in early polling of the Democratic field. Sanders, the runner-up in 2016, has held 17 major events in eight states and Washington, D.C., since declaring his candidacy in early March.

Not all of Sanders’ events — nor those of other candidates — feature the sort of real-time voter questions that are a fixture of Warren’s and O’Rourke’s appearances. But Sanders’ crowds illustrate his formidable ability to engage voters on his own terms: The Vermont senator’s campaign projects a total turnout of 74,000 people for all of his events so far.

President Donald Trump famously upended the traditional calculus of campaigning in 2016 by making fewer retail visits as he powered past more than a dozen GOP rivals. Whether anyone in the Democratic field can repeat that model remains to be seen.

“We want to fall in love like we did with Barack Obama,” Messina said of Democratic voters, “and to do that, you need to do the retail part of this.”

Several candidates have made a point of veering off the beaten track, hoping a stop outside the early states will earn them some extra media attention and voter good will.

O’Rourke crossed six states in one week on his post-announcement road trip. Warren has made unexpected trips to Puerto Rico and the Deep South, eager to find a way to set herself apart from the pack.

Casten is a Democratic Green New Deal defector, one of a group of moderates who are rejecting the progressive package that has become a lightning rod for critics and are instead crafting their own climate-change policies. Among the ideas some defectors are considering are measures that would impose a national mandate for the use of cleaner power sources or implementing a carbon tax.

Many, such as Virginia freshman Democratic Representative Elaine Luria, defeated Republican incumbents in moderate-to-conservative districts and helped their party win back the House.

“The Green New Deal is aspirational,” Luria said. “What we plan to do is offer tangible, achievable things.”

The Green New Deal calls for shifting to 100 percent clean power within 10 years, upgrading all U.S. buildings and providing health care and housing for all. It’s captured national attention but has also been used by Republicans to label Democrats as socialists who want to ground air travel, ban hamburgers and paying people who aren’t working.

The Green New Deal would do none of those things, but its still only supported by 39 percent of House Democrats -- 92 out of 235 Democrats. In the Senate, the plan is backed by all six of the chambers presidential hopefuls, but only 12 out of its 49 Democrats.

“I like the fact a lot of new members are coming up with ideas that we need to look at like the Green New Deal, but we’re going to look at all different options,” said Frank Pallone, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who has questioned the political and technical feasibility of the plan. “We’re looking at a number of things that could be done to address greenhouse gasses and the problem with climate change.”

One of them is a federal mandate that could require the use of clean energy sources such as wind, solar and other renewables as well as possibly nuclear and coal with carbon capture technologies as well, according to Paul Bledsoe, an adviser with the Progressive Policy Institute who says he’s had discussions with congressional committee aides on the various ideas.

A carbon tax is also being eyed by the House’s main tax writing committee, which is led by Green New Deal holdout Richard Neal of Massachusetts, who said he plans to hold a hearing on the fee in the future.

A $25-per-ton fee, paid by oil refiners, utilities and other carbon dioxide emitters could generate $1 trillion, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, but it lacks the GOP support needed to become a reality. Representative Don Beyer, a Ways and Means Committee member, hopes the Green New Deal changes that.

“The Green New Deal has almost created a space on in them middle and on the center right for carbon pricing as something that is concrete and real and supported by economists across the political spectrum,” Beyer, a Virginia Democrat, said.

Paris Revisited

Another bill that would require the U.S. to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets under the Paris climate agreement that Trump has vowed to pull out of is being championed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has dismissed the Green New Deal as a “green dream.”

The alternatives come as some moderate Democrats believe the House passage of a Green New Deal is important ahead of the 2020 presidential elections. Critics say it’s a needless political risk that will end up costing Democrats seats.

“They correctly believe that the notion of the keep it in the ground crowd are both political liabilities and unnecessary at this point,” Bledsoe, who worked on climate change issues in the Clinton White House, said in an interview. “The Democrat party became captive to far left environmental groups for the last couple of decades and it’s become a political disaster.”

""For eight years, four election cycles, we heard from our friends on the Republican side that there would be calamity and catastrophe if the New York State Senate went to the Democrats in the majority,"" Nassau and state Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs said at a news conference in Garden City.

""All sorts of terrible things would happen, and of course we would be owned lock, stock and barrel by New York City, and so today we come here with less than 100 days from their coming into office, with the results,"" said Jacobs, who praised the Democratic senators for, ""standing up for the suburbs, standing up for Nassau and Suffolk County.""

The six Long Island state senators hailed passage of a permanent property tax cap, a statewide ban on plastic bags and a plan to phase-in Nassau's countywide property reassessment over five years.

The lawmakers also pointed to increased education funding for Nassau and Suffolk school districts. And they touted new oversight of the Long Island Rail Road, including an independent forensic audit of the railroad and a new standard for on-time performance.

""We're going to account for every penny and ensure greater oversight … [so] that money goes to the railroad, not a bloated bureaucracy,"" said State Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach).

In the new state budget, funding for Long Island public school operations is slightly more than $3 billion for the 2019-20 academic year, although the increase is the smallest percentage gain in eight years.

Critics also said state legislators did not do enough to expand ""foundation"" aid, which is New York's main formula for distributing extra money to districts with large numbers of students who are impoverished or non-English speaking.

“Three months into one-party rule of our state government and everything we warned about has come true,"" said Scott Reif, spokesman for minority Senate Republicans.

""The 100 percent Democrat-made budget raised taxes by billions of dollars, put the rights of criminals and illegal immigrants ahead of the rights of law-abiding citizens, and increased state aid to schools in New York City at Long Island’s expense,"" Reif said. ""Let’s not mince words here — the Democrats have been a disaster for Long Island.”

But Sen. John E. Brooks (D-Seaford) said, ""I thought Long Island did well in a difficult year.""

Spending rose by $7 billion in the $175.6 billion budget approved early Monday, although state officials cited a $3 billion revenue shortfall from the prior fiscal year.

A Senate proposal to provide a $200 million state tax credit for Nassau homeowners whose taxes are set to rise under reassessment was not included in the final budget. State Sen. Anna Kaplan (D-Great Neck) acknowledged Tuesday that the plan was ""not alive.""",Long Island Democratic senators: We didn't roll over for NYC,Newsday,https://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/state-senate-budget-long-island-1.29292295

Sakchai Lalit/The Associated Press

Thailand’s ruling military junta has filed a complaint accusing the leader of a popular new political party of sedition and aiding criminals, a move he described as politically motivated.

The party, Future Forward, ran a strong third in elections last month that were also contested by a pro-military party.

Future Forward’s leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, said he would report to police on Saturday to answer the summons against him. He could face up to nine years in prison.

The summons did not specify what actions prompted the complaint. It said Thanathorn was accused of sedition for using words or writing “to raise unrest and disaffection amongst the people in a manner likely to cause disturbance in the country.”

Several criminal complaints and protests to the Election Commission have already been lodged against Thanathorn and his party.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday before a tour of a Bangkok neighbourhood to thank voters, Thanathorn said the new legal action was expected and “nothing new.”

“We are prepared mentally. There’s nothing to worry about,” he said. “We believe in our innocence. We believe these cases are politically motivated.”

Thanathorn commented further about the summons on his Facebook page, saying it was clear “that old political games don’t end after elections but in turn become even more intense because they are afraid of Future Forward, afraid of our victory that surpassed many people’s expectations.”

He said he would answer the summons to show his innocence and “prove that Thailand’s justice system will not submit to becoming a tool for dictators.”

Preliminary results of the March 24 general election failed to give any single party a majority, making it unclear whether pro- or anti-junta parties will hold a majority in the House of Representatives. The Future Forward Party is a junior partner in an anti-junta coalition that claims have a majority of seats, but the final official results won’t be released until May 9.

Between now and then, there could be shifts in party alliances, and there is concern that the state Election Commission, widely regarded as sympathetic to the junta, could disqualify the elected candidates of its opponents.

The army has several times publicly shown its disdain for Future Forward’s policies. The country’s influential army chief on Tuesday issued a thinly veiled attack on the party, not mentioning it by name but implying that it has foreign-influenced ideas unsuitable for the “Thai-style democratic system,” which is a constitutional monarchy.

Gen. Apirat Kongsompong, the ruling junta’s secretary-general, said the army would do its duty, “which is to protect, maintain and defend the institutions of nation, religion, and monarchy.”

Respect for the monarchy is a sensitive and emotional issue in Thailand, and accusations of disrespect are sometimes used by opportunists to smear their political opponents. Thailand has a lese majeste law that makes criticism of the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment per offence.

Thanathorn has said his party’s primary agenda is to stop Thailand’s military from intervening in politics, and also suggested its budget be slashed.

The new party’s critics also have tried to tried to sow suspicion that it is allied with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by the military in a 2006 coup and is treated as the arch-enemy of Thailand’s royalist establishment. The party denies any such ties, and a large part of its appeal appears to be that it supports neither the military nor Thaksin.

The co-founder of Future Forward, law scholar Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, has come under pressure as well, including a summons to be a witness in what appears to be Thanathorn’s case.

Piyabutr has been in hot water with conservative Thais who see him as a threat to the monarchy after social media began circulating a video of a Feb. 17, 2013, lecture in which he described the role of the monarchy in democratic governments. He responded that the posting was misleading and was not about Thailand’s system.

An obscure conservative organization filed a complaint about him with the Election Commission, and on Wednesday singer and actress Haruthai Muangboonsri formally submitted a legal complaint to police accusing him of being a threat to national security.

The military has governed Thailand since then-army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha staged a coup in 2014 against an elected government. Since then, Prayuth has served as junta leader and prime minister, and is the candidate of the pro-military Palang Pracharath Party, which according to preliminary results grabbed the biggest share of the popular vote in last month’s election.

According to a new constitution implemented under the junta, prime ministers are chosen by a joint vote of the elected House of Representatives and the appointed Senate, giving Prayuth a great advantage. However, his opponents could still control a majority in the lower house, making it difficult for him to pass laws or get a budget approved, and making any government he would head unstable because of the possibility it would face a vote of no confidence.",Thai junta files sedition complaint against new party Future Forward’s leader,The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-thai-junta-files-sedition-complaint-against-new-party-future-forwards/

Given the intensive early candidate travel to key early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic ...","It will be 10 months before U.S. voters begin the process of choosing a Democratic Party presidential nominee through the caucuses and primary elections that get underway in February of next year. But already 15 or more Democrats are busy campaigning to be the one to take on President Donald Trump next year.

The 2020 Democratic field is a diverse mix of women, men, minorities and contenders with varying levels of political experience.

In Washington this week, several Democratic presidential contenders auditioned for support before union and liberal activist groups at the “We the People” forum.

“The Trump administration is a walking, talking, living, breathing threat to national security, and we just have to call it out,” said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren to cheers from the audience.

Warren is one of several women candidates in the field who do not hesitate to criticize President Donald Trump, a group that includes Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar.

“He somehow thinks that organized hate is more powerful than unorganized love. Well, maybe he’s right. But how do we respond to that? We organize, right! We organize and we win,” vowed Klobuchar.

​Diverse field

Several minority candidates have also stepped up to the 2020 stage, including California Senator Kamala Harris, former cabinet secretary Julian Castro and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who often focuses on national unity as a theme.

“This election will be more than just taking one person out of office. This will be the beginning of the next era of America where dreams are not just words or songs but a reality for all!”

Unity is also a theme for former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, who officially announced his candidacy in his hometown of El Paso.

“Let those differences not define us or divide us. Let us agree going forward that before we are anything else, we are Americans first!” he said.

O’Rourke told Monday’s “We the People” forum that he would support eliminating the electoral college system for choosing a president, and would favor a direct popular vote instead to decide the outcome.

Poll surges

O’Rourke has risen into double-digit support in some recent polls. Other newcomers who have seen poll surges are South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Senator Kamala Harris.

The latest Quinnipiac University poll had former Vice President Joe Biden leading the Democratic race at 29 percent support, followed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 19 percent, O’Rourke at 12 percent and Harris at 8 percent.

In a recent Emerson poll of Iowa voters, Buttigieg had surged into third place with 11 percent support, trailing only Biden and Sanders and slightly ahead of Harris and Warren.

Biden is expected to join the race soon but is under fire after complaints from several women about unwanted close physical contact. On Wednesday, the former vice president posted a video on Twitter noting that “the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset.” Biden added that he will be more “mindful about respecting personal space in the future.”

Biden is considered by many Democrats to be the front-runner but his lack of success in two previous campaigns has some party activists wary.

Scrutiny already

Given the intensive early candidate travel to key early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic activists are already scrutinizing the contenders.

“Democratic voters are basically interviewing candidates on two topics,” said American University expert Bill Sweeney. “First and most importantly is their policy vision for the United States in the years ahead. And then secondly, are they the person to beat Trump in the 2020 election?”

Some of the newcomers to the national stage tend to focus on one or two key issues. In the case of Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, that issue is climate change.

“It is a unique moment because we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last generation that can do something about it,” Inslee told the Monday forum in Washington.

Despite all the newcomers in the 2020 mix, the one familiar face from the 2016 campaign is Bernie Sanders.

Sanders is once again offering bold promises on expanding the role of government in health care, free college education and economic fairness.

“And what I pledge to you, if elected president, is to be a president that will be traveling all over this country as part of a grass roots political movement,” Sanders told the “We the People” forum.

Sanders got some encouraging news this week. His fundraising totals for the first quarter of this year topped $18 million, leading the Democratic field. On Wednesday, O’Rourke reported that he has raised $9.4 million in donations during his initial period of campaigning, another sign he could be a contender with staying power.

Other top fundraisers included Harris who reported a $12 million haul and Buttigieg raised $7 million, an impressive total for someone virtually off the radar just weeks ago.

Lots of choices

With the final total of contenders likely to be somewhere between 15 and 20, Democratic activists will have plenty of different personalities and governing philosophies to choose from, said George Washington University analyst Matt Dallek.

“Do primary voters want someone who is not going to be a centrist like Bill Clinton? Who is not going to be as cautious as former President Obama? Who is really going to tackle income equality as the central issue?” he said.

For his part, President Trump says he is eager to take on whomever the Democrats nominate next year.

“We could lose the country, we really could. Because these people are stone cold crazy,” Trump told a Republican fundraiser in Washington on Tuesday.

When the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren spoke in a New Hampshire town hall last month, she promised to break up Silicon Valley monopolies and levy a wealth tax on “the Rembrandts and the diamonds” of the super-rich, before quipping: “I’m sick of freeloading billionaires.”

Days earlier, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders had addressed a rally in Concord, 45 miles west. He said his was a campaign that “tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of Wall Street, corporate America and the billionaire class”.

During a road trip through the state days later, the former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke stopped at a university in Keene to lament an economy that only works for “the very few”. “We never had this kind of income and wealth inequality unless you go all the way back to the last Gilded Age,” he said.

Much has been said about the unprecedented diversity among Democrats vying to replace Donald Trump in the White House in 2020. But voters in New Hampshire, which will hold the first in the nation primary next year, can be forgiven for feeling they all sound kind of similar.

Reporters on the campaign trail constantly ask Democrats if they self-define as a “socialist” or “capitalist”. Yet a better label for several of the frontrunners may be “populist” – at least in the moderate, diluted form in which the term is commonly used in the US.

That reflects a wider populist turn in Democratic politics, born from a realisation that in 2016 it was Trump, a real estate billionaire, who did better than Democrat Hillary Clinton at channeling widespread voter frustration at economic elites.

Now Trump has become emblematic of the swamp he once promised to drain. The president has given tax cuts to America’s wealthiest, given his family White House portfolios, stacked his cabinet with friends and donors with a combined net worth estimated to be worth over $4bn, and overseen an administration that some historians argue is the most corrupt America has endured since the 1920s.

“All that is perfect terrain for a leftwing populist to pounce,” said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University and the author of a book on American populism.

The movement that spawned the word ‘populism’

It is against this backdrop that Democrats are looking to a us-v-them style of politics redolent of the US agrarian revolts of the 1890s – the movement that spawned the word “populism” in the first place.

That was the era when an anti-elitist alliance of impoverished farmers, rail workers and union members briefly formed the Populist party, which called for an end to monopolies, a progressive income tax and government ownership of the railroads, telegraph services and post office.

After briefly threatening to upend America’s two-party system, the Populist party collapsed after selecting the Democratic nominee for president, William Jennings Bryan, who lost in 1896. But the movement has been credited with giving rise to a progressive era in Democratic politics that culminated in Franklin D Roosevelt’s 1930s New Deal.

The meaning of populism has evolved considerably since then, and scholars today generally accept populism can be deployed by capitalists as well as socialists. Rightwing populists came to the fore in American politics in the mid-2oth century with figures such as the segregationist governor of Alabama, George Wallace, and the Republican anti-communist senator Joseph McCarthy.

What populists across the spectrum have in common is a claim to serve the popular will of ordinary people in their quest to overcome powerful, self-serving elites. Kazin, who edits the leftwing magazine Dissent, said there has long been a rich seam of opposition to entrenched elites in American politics that “has always been there to be tapped” by politicians of all stripes.

Surges in populist rhetoric tend to be prompted by perceived political and economic crises. Kazin argues the current populist wave leads back to the 2008 financial crisis, which has framed American political discourse for more than a decade.

However, Kazin said he could not remember a presidential primary when so many prominent Democrats were running on a leftwing populist agenda – or a presidential contest, as 2020 may turn out to be, when both the Democrat and Republican are nominees are populists. “You’re probably not going to have a leading candidate this year – except, perhaps, Joe Biden – who is not going to be talking in pretty strongly populist terms,” he said.

The populist label

That may be an exaggeration. In addition to Biden, who has not announced his presidential campaign, moderate senators such as Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand have held back from populism.

Others, meanwhile, are probably stretching the definition. When Kamala Harris launched her campaign in Oakland in January, an aide to the California senator told New York magazine she was claiming the mantle of “a new populism”.

Her campaign slogan – “for the people” – is a nod to her career as San Francisco district attorney, but also a classically populist term. Yet while her speech referred to “the people” 15 times, it contained none of the sharp condemnation of elites that is also a hallmark of populist discourse. On the contrary, Harris made a point of stressing “our United States of America is not about us versus them”.

Even Barack Obama once toyed with the populist label. Reflecting on some of his leftwing policies, Obama openly mused on the idea that he might be a populist, but hedged: “Maybe somebody can pull up in a dictionary quickly the phrase ‘populism’.”

Had anyone bothered to do so they might have discovered the word is routinely misused. In Europe, it is often used pejoratively to refer to far-right, nationalist politics of leaders such as Italy’s Matteo Salvini and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. Many supporters of leftwing radicals such as the UK’s Jeremy Corbyn or France’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon balk at the populist label, which they argue tarnishes their candidates by association.

In the US, there is perhaps better understanding of the idea that populism can be a political language used by the right or left. But the word has also lost some of its meaning as it increasingly becomes a shorthand for economic redistribution. As a result, no candidate is more routinely referred to as populist than Sanders, but others include Warren and – until he dropped of the race – the Ohio senator Sherrod Brown.

Brown, one of the few politicians to embrace the populist label, dedicated a page on his campaign website to explaining “what populism is – and what it isn’t”. The page argued that populism “doesn’t fan resentments and exploit grievances”, a claim that might be disputed by scholars of leftwing populists such as Hugo Chávez – or even the original American populists, like Bryan Jennings.

‘We’re living in another Gilded Age’

Sixteen Democrats have so far formally declared bids for the presidency, and another dozen are criss-crossing the early caucus and primary states to test the waters. They include New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who recently stopped by the Strange Brew Tavern in Manchester, for “happy hour with young Democrats”.

He told around a dozen party faithfuls gathered around a pool table that his “line” resonating most Iowa and South Carolina was that “there’s plenty of money in the country, it is just in the wrong hands”. “It don’t think it is an accident,” he added. “People are fed up.”

He later told the Guardian that populism was “very much part of who I am”.

“Recently in public discourse somehow populism has been described as a rightwing phenomenon, through a negative prism, when I think there’s a very rich history in the United States of progressive populism, centered on economic issues, referencing working people’s lives, and that’s what we have got to get back to,” he said.

De Blasio added he agreed with Warren’s proposal to break up technology giants. “I do see an emerging frustration with the technology sector that is about unfettered power. But also connects to the notion of large corporations, unaccountable to the people – just as people felt about Wall Street.”

“We’re living in another Gilded Age. The income inequality levels today are comparable to the time of the robber barons,” he added, arguing that a slew of political advances – anti-trust laws, progressive taxation and limits on corporate money in politics – were born of the populist backlash of the late 19th century.

“Those are all ideas that go back 100 years and more in this country,” he said. “Full circle, these ideas are now coming to life in much bolder form today.”

That much seemed evident in nearby Exeter, when Warren delighted the crowd, days earlier, with her unabashed attack on America’s “ultra millionaires”.

Nodding emphatically from a balcony above the stage was Janice, a woman in her 60s in a faded Mickey Mouse T-shirt. She declined to give her last name because she was embarrassed to admit she had voted for Trump in 2016.

“My friend kept saying: ‘Trump’s for the little people,’” she recalled – stressing that, at the time, she was holding down two jobs and struggling to pay the rent, so did not have time to vet the candidates.

She now believes Trump “talked that way to become president” – and after hearing Warren speak, she felt she’d found a more authentic version of the candidate she had been looking for. “Warren sounds like she’s on our side. And it’s us v them,” she said.",Why the populist wave is setting the tone for Democratic candidates,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/04/why-the-populist-wave-is-setting-the-tone-for-democratic-candidates

ALEX WROBLEWSKI/Reuters

The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to authorize subpoenas for special counsel Robert Mueller’s full, unredacted report and underlying evidence from his investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election.

The 24-17 vote along party lines – with Democrats in favour and U.S. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans opposed – authorized the panel’s chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to subpoena Mr. Mueller’s material. The measure also authorized Mr. Nadler, a Democrat, to subpoena documents and testimony from five former Trump aides, including former political adviser Steve Bannon and former White House Counsel Donald McGahn.

The committee vote escalated congressional pressure on Attorney-General William Barr to hand over all that Mr. Mueller documented during his 22-month probe, including grand jury evidence.

The committee’s focus shifted to subpoenas when it became clear that Mr. Barr would ignore a Democratic demand for him to turn over the full report by April 2. Mr. Barr has pledged to share a redacted copy of the nearly 400-page report with Congress and the public by mid-April.

Democrats fear that Mr. Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Mr. Trump and his campaign.

“The Trump administration has an idea. They want to redact the Mueller report before they provide it to Congress,” Mr. Nadler said at committee meeting before the vote. “This committee has a job to do. … That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves.”

Mr. Barr’s March 24 summary of the Mueller report said the special counsel did not establish that Trump campaign officials conspired with Russia during the presidential election, but also did not exonerate Mr. Trump on obstruction of justice. Mr. Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mr. Mueller’s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant obstruction criminal charges against the President.

Mr. Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. Moscow says it did not try to interfere in the election, even though U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that it secretly tried to sway U.S. voters in Mr. Trump’s favour.

NEW LEGAL FRONT

Issuing subpoenas would open a new legal front against the Trump administration by Democrats who won control of the House in last year’s congressional elections.

But it is not clear if the Justice Department would simply hand over all the documents they now seek. The department could ignore the subpoena, running the risk of being held in contempt of Congress, and prepare for a potentially lengthy battle in the courts.

Democrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report.

“If the department still refuses, then it should be up to a judge – not the President or his political appointee – to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record,” Mr. Nadler said.

It was not clear when Mr. Nadler might start issuing subpoenas, if authorized to do so.

“I will give him [Barr] time to change his mind. But if we cannot reach an accommodation, then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas,” the New York Democrat said.

Mr. Trump took a dig on Tuesday at Mr. Nadler and House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, one of the President’s strongest critics in Congress about the Russia investigation.

The President wrote on Twitter, “There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!”

Republicans contend that Mr. Barr is being transparent under Justice Department regulations adopted after former president Bill Clinton’s impeachment in the 1990s, which allow the attorney-general wide latitude in what he releases from special counsel inquiries. They also contend that Democrats are seeking grand jury material that federal law precludes the Justice Department from sharing.

“He [Nadler] is picking the fight because fighting makes good headlines, and because his caucus [other Democratic lawmakers] is desperate for dirt on this President,” said Representative Doug Collins, top Republican on the panel.

The New Kentucky Project, cofounded by former State Auditor and current gubernatorial candidate Adam Edelen, is reportedly closing up shop.

""We've got a lot going,"" Edelen said in 2017. ""It's all about trying to take the information that people need to win the kitchen counter debate, getting it to them. It's about training people to step up and be the next generation of leaders in Kentucky because lord knows we need them.""

But the Lexington Herald-Leader reports the project is shutting down a little more than two years after it was launched.

Edelen tells the news outlet the decision was driven largely by economics and Jones reports he lost money on the project.

The party on Monday started its organizational conference, the first for its new leader Mustafa Omer who took over last year after the former leader was deposed over human rights infractions.

Abiy has over the last year kept a close eye on the SDP – formerly the Somali Peoples Democratic Party, SPDP, which is a satellite party of the four-member ruling coalition, the EPRDF.

He recently met with Omar and leader of the party Ahmed Shide – who happens to the Finance Minister, to help resolve intra-party issues. Shide was elected chair of the party with Omer as deputy chairman.

Political watchers had projected that the party was expected to undergo significant reforms since its creation in 1998. Shortly after taking office, Omer’s leadership made two main changes – with respect to the state’s name and its flag.

The name change from Ethiopia Somali regional state to Somali regional state was officially ratified by members. A new logo was also adopted on day two of the conference.

Now, she's the Democratic representative for New York's 14th congressional district and pushing the Green New Deal, a policy which represents massive government intervention in the US economy.

In a recent MSNBC town hall with Chris Hayes, Ocasio-Cortez sat down to discuss the GND and make a case for its necessity. She said the country should ""have a serious conversation"" about the Green New Deal, and that it should happen sooner rather than later.

The hour-long town hall featured plenty of soundbites, applause-inducing declarations, and far-fetched statements. These weren’t, despite her pleas about serious conversations, particularly serious words.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Ocasio-Cortez's view of the United States in its current form is, at times, almost post-apocalyptic. At one point she said, ""To get out of this situation, we have to create dignified jobs for working Americans, to guarantee healthcare, and elevate our educational opportunities. We will have to mobilise our economy around saving ourselves and taking care of this planet.""

The numbers don't align with her outlook. The current unemployment rate in the US is 3.8 per cent, and the Labor Department reported the existence of 7.6 million job openings across the country. More people than ever before are attending college and have college degrees.

Another tactic employed by Ocasio-Cortez when asked to defend the Green New Deal was to tick off a list of American problems as if the GND will serve as a magic elixir to cure them all. ""People are dying because their insulin is skyrocketing. Kids are getting sent to schools with lead in the water,” she said during the town hall. She did the same in an impassioned speech talking about floods in Nebraska and the hurricane damage in Puerto Rico.

What she never does, however, is explain how her plan solves those issues or why it involves the intervention of the federal government. How will the Green New Deal address the issue of insulin prices, Flint Michigan's water issue and flooding in Nebraska? It’s extremely unclear.

At one point during that MSNBC discussion, tagged as 'The Case for the Green New Deal,’ AOC said, ""This does not mean we change our entire structure of government. But what it means is that we need to do something! Something. And that's what this solution is all about.” But this misses the point entirely. No criticism of the Green New Deal invokes the argument it will change the structure of government. People do argue it will change the structure of the economy with such a high level of government intervention. That’s something she has yet to address.

The simple fact is that nothing gets Ocasio-Cortez more excited than pretending we're on the precipice of a cataclysmic scenario. She said the need to pass the Green New Deal comes from the notion that ""we have an expiration date."" She classified those who favor caution as an attitude of one that is ""privileged and removed from reality."" Her pessimistic outlook is informed by the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that she says claims we have ""12 years to turn it around.""

But the IPCC report isn't quite as urgent as AOC makes it seem. They do make arguments for what would happen in the worst-case scenario, and that involves a situation in which humanity makes no attempts to curb carbon emissions at all.

Ironically, Ocasio-Cortez made the argument for those urging a slower approach than what she wants. At one point, she invoked the 9/11 attacks, saying the government decided to go to war in two countries as a knee-jerk reaction — wars she argued were utterly unnecessary. The 9/11 attacks also paved the way for The Patriot Act, sweeping legislation that created a climate for the government to infringe on civil liberties. That's what happens when people urge the government to immediately ""do something"" in the face of what some say is a ""crisis.""

Unfortunately for the Democratic Party, legislators such as Ocasio-Cortez see not only Republicans as a bulwark to their agenda, but other Democrats as well, and she said as much during the town hall. She bristled at the comparison of her movement to the Tea Party, but it's not hard to see how the argument is valid. Democratic House gains in 2018 were not a green light for a massive expansion of government that throws caution to the wind.

If AOC continues down the path she's chosen, it could spell trouble for Nancy Pelosi (who has mockingly referred to the GND as “the green dream, or whatever they call it”) holding on to her Speaker’s gavel. The American people aren't ready for something like the Green New Deal and Ocasio-Cortez, contrary to what she and her supporters say, is not making the right case for its passage.

This stands in contrast to the party's rival for the social democratic mantle in Quebec — the Parti Québécois. The PQ's interim leader, Pascal Bérubé, indicated last week that he ...","This weekend, at a CEGEP in Quebec City, Québec Solidaire continued its transformation of left-wing politics in the province.

No longer does the party support banning police officers, judges and Crown prosecutors from wearing religious symbols.

By a wide margin, party members voted instead to adopt a new, and what is these days, more radical position: it's now opposed to any restriction on what religious symbols a public-sector worker can wear.

Along with another resolution that limits when face coverings can be prohibited, the party has given itself the secularism policy that is most diametrically opposed to the one put forward by the Coalition Avenir Québec government.

Bill 21, tabled last week, seeks to prevent a host of ""authority figures"" — including public-school teachers — from wearing religious garments such as the hijab or kippa.

""I think we are the official opposition on this issue,"" QS parliamentary leader Manon Massé said on Saturday, even though her party has far fewer seats than the official opposition, the Quebec Liberals.

To be sure, few were questioning QS's progressive bona fides before this weekend, given its promises to nationalize natural resources and make the entire education system free.

But its secularism policy was conspicuously centrist, taking up as it did the so-called Bouchard-Taylor compromise, the position recommended by a government inquiry in 2008.

""All the party's positions on the environment, on social justice, I agreed with it. The only issue that I didn't back was this one,"" said Tasnim Rekik, a party member from Montreal who campaigned for the platform change.

""I'm someone who identifies with the left, and QS is the party I identity with the most. So for me, it was very important that QS stands for inclusion and for human rights, and for my own human rights.""

How secularism became conservative

For much of the 20th century, pushing for the separation of Church and state was a key battleground for progressives, especially in Quebec, where the Catholic Church was a valuable ally of Maurice Duplessis's quasi-reactionary government.

But over the past two decades or so, the language of secularism has been appropriated by conservative politicians.

In their hands, it's used as a tool for the preservation of cultural legacies they feel are necessary for keeping together social bonds threatened by globalization.

The far-right takes this argument even further. In France, for example, Marine Le Pen has effectively weaponized the notion of laïcité to suggest Muslim immigration is incompatible with traditional French values.

These developments have prompted some leftist parties, though by no means all, to rethink their attitudes toward secularism (see the Two Lefts debate in France).

MNA Catherine Fournier's departure from the Parti Québécois prompted the party to question its appeal to young voters. (Radio-Canada)

Québec Solidaire's new position on religious symbols is, arguably, a closer reflection of its other social justice commitments, such as tackling systemic racism and economic inequalities.

This stands in contrast to the party's rival for the social democratic mantle in Quebec — the Parti Québécois.

The PQ's interim leader, Pascal Bérubé, indicated last week that he supported the broad outlines of Bill 21.

In fact, he felt it didn't go far enough, proposing that yet more people should be prohibited from wearing religious symbols, including daycare workers.

The party, it should be noted, is attempting to patch over a deep generational divide among its members.

The younger among them are reportedly uncomfortable with the party's militant secularism, which places it on the conservative side of the spectrum when it comes to identity issues.

When Catherine Fournier, once the PQ's youngest MNA, abruptly left the party earlier this month, one of the reasons she gave was the drift away from its social democratic roots.

Who is the true opposition on Bill 21?

That leaves QS and the Quebec Liberals as strange bedfellows in the fight against Bill 21.

The Liberals, though, are really only half-opposed to its contents. It was the previous Liberal government, after all, that proposed forcing Muslim women to uncover their faces in order to access public services.

The proposal was widely decried by civil rights advocates, and is subject to a court challenge, but was included in the CAQ bill.

Thus Massé's bold claim to be the ""official opposition"" on Bill 21.

Whatever the electoral merits of QS's new position, they've established a distinct leftist alternative to the current politics of secularism in Quebec.","With new position on secularism, Quebec Solidaire redefines left-wing politics in the province",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/with-new-position-on-secularism-quebec-solidaire-redefines-left-wing-politics-in-the-province-1.5079087
152,World,2019-04-01T03:29:00.0000000Z,"Flores, a former Nevada state representative and the 2014 Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor, told The Associated Press on Sunday that she had been mulling coming forward for years. She said she approached New York Magazine about publishing ...","WASHINGTON — Former Vice-President Joe Biden on Sunday defended his interactions with women, saying he doesn’t believe he’s ever acted inappropriately. But a Nevada politician’s assertion that Biden’s kiss on the back of her head made her feel uncomfortable prompted some Democrats to question whether the 76-year-old is too out of step with his own party to run a successful 2020 presidential campaign.

The episode, recounted by Democrat Lucy Flores, highlighted an aspect of Biden’s persona that has been publicly known for years: the affectionate whispers, hugs and shoulder squeezes he has long doled out to women, often on camera and at high-profile public events. In a moment of national reckoning over sexual harassment and the treatment of women by powerful men, some Democrats said Biden’s actions have taken on a new light.

“It looks different in 2019,” said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist. Cardona said that while Biden’s behaviour is not automatically disqualifying for the presidency, “it all depends on how he continues to respond to this. He has to acknowledge that his behaviour made some women uncomfortable.”

In a statement on Sunday, Biden said it was never his intention to make women feel discomfort and if he did so, “I will listen respectfully.”

Several women who worked for Biden stepped forward over the weekend to vouch for his character. And Stephanie Carter, the wife of former Defence Secretary Ash Carter, disputed characterizations of her interactions with Biden during her husband’s swearing-in ceremony. Pictures of the then-vice-president whispering in Carter’s ear and placing his hands on her shoulders ricocheted across the internet at the time.

“The Joe Biden in my picture is a close friend helping someone get through a big day, for which I will always be grateful,” Carter wrote in a post on the website Medium.

Flores’ account of the 2014 incident comes at a crucial moment for Biden. He’s been wrestling for months with a final decision on whether to run for president, blowing through several self-imposed deadlines. Advisers are now eyeing an announcement later in April.

But the Democratic primary has sped on without him, with more than a dozen candidates in the race, including a record number of women and minorities. Veterans like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have shown surprising strength, while newer White House hopefuls like California Sen. Kamala Harris and Texan Beto O’Rourke have drawn big crowds and displayed early fundraising prowess.

Biden still leads most early polls, buoyed by broad name recognition and the goodwill he generated during eight years as President Barack Obama’s No. 2. Given his experience and appeal with white working-class voters in Midwestern battleground states, he’s also seen by some Democrats as the best-positioned candidate to defeat President Donald Trump.

Nancy Bobo, an Iowa activist who was among Obama’s earliest supporters in the state, shares that view. She fears the episode with Flores suggests Democrats may try to tear down their most-qualified candidate.

“I can just see what’s coming at him,” Bobo said. “And it’s going to come at him from the Democrats.”

None of Biden’s potential rivals defended him following Flores’ allegations. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she believed Flores and that Biden “needs to give an answer” about what occurred. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Lucy Flores felt demeaned, and that is never okay. If Vice-President Biden becomes a candidate, this is a topic he’ll have to engage on further.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said, “I believe it’s important to listen and take seriously any incident like this.”

White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway said Flores was “quite bold” to “go up against the highest levels of her political party” with the allegations and suggested that Biden should consider apologizing to Flores. Conway deflected questions about the numerous women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, allegations he denies.

Flores, a former Nevada state representative and the 2014 Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor, told The Associated Press on Sunday that she had been mulling coming forward for years. She said she approached New York Magazine about publishing her story and that the magazine had fact-checked her piece after she submitted it.

According to Flores, the incident with Biden occurred in 2014 as the two were waiting to take the stage during a rally in Las Vegas.

“I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. ’Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?”’ she wrote. “He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head.”

Biden spokesman Bill Russo said the former vice-president doesn’t remember kissing Flores.

The AP tried to contact several advisers and aides from Flores’ 2014 campaign, but was unable to obtain any independent verification of her account.

Flores, who endorsed Sanders in the 2016 campaign, said Biden’s team has not been in touch with her since her story was published. She said she would be satisfied if Biden simply acknowledged the discomfort the episode caused her.

Biden has been warned by advisers that his past statements and actions, including his long history of hugging and showing affection to women, would face fresh scrutiny in the 2020 campaign. In some cases, Biden’s policy positions, such as his support for the 1994 crime bill that is blamed for mass incarcerations of minorities, are out of step with a party that has shifted to the left. But at other moments, like when he touts his ability to forge compromises with Republicans, he can appear to be speaking about a political era that many Democrats believe no longer exists.

Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said Biden’s team needs to answer a key question before launching a White House bid: “Do they feel confident in their ability to understand this electorate and campaign in 2020, which is already different than 2016?”

Even before Flores made her allegations, some Democrats were wondering whether Biden was meant for this moment. His team was widely panned following reports that they were considering tapping a younger Democrat or a minority like 2018 Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams as a running mate early in the primary in an attempt to counteract questions about Biden’s age.

While Biden’s team denied that he was considering that step, Biden did float the idea to Abrams over a recent lunch, according to a Democrat with knowledge of the discussion. The Democrat was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity.

Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz said that while Flores’ descriptions may feel familiar to those who have watched Biden hug and hold hands with women for years, she put the focus on the women who were on the receiving end of his affections.

“What Lucy Flores so bravely did is say, ’This is the way he made me feel,”’ Katz said. “No one has ever done that before with Joe Biden.”",Joe Biden faces new scrutiny from Dems over behaviour with women,Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/world/joe-biden-faces-new-scrutiny-from-dems-over-behaviour-with-women

NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Facebook has deleted 712 accounts and 390 pages in India and Pakistan for ""inauthentic behavior"", it said on Monday, many linked to India's opposition Congress party days before a national election, and others related to Pakistan's military.

Facebook has come under increasing pressure around the world to ensure its social media platform is not abused for political purposes or to spread misinformation.

The action against accounts with alleged links to Congress, the party led by the Gandhi family that has dominated Indian politics for much of its post-independence era, marks a bold move by Facebook.

The platform has more than 300 million users in India, where it has been a key political campaigning tool in the election - the largest democratic exercise in the world - starting on April 11.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his rivals use official Facebook accounts to send political messages to millions of followers, thousands of unverified pages also share posts to support or criticize politicians.

Among the most significant things it has removed, Facebook said it had taken down 549 accounts and 138 pages linked to India's Congress for ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"".

In a Tweet, Congress said none of its official pages or those run by its verified volunteers had been taken down. The party is awaiting a response from Facebook to provide a list of all pages and accounts which were removed, it said.

Also removed were 15 accounts linked to an Indian IT company which, among other things, issued posts on Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and alleged misconduct of political opponents including Congress, Facebook said.

The Digital Forensic Research Lab at think tank Atlantic Council, which partnered with Facebook for the review, said the accounts linked to Congress pushed satirical posts, while pro-BJP pages ""carried vitriolic posts against opposition leaders"".

""The fact that partisans on both sides resorted to such tactics is a troubling feature,"" it said in a blog post.

In the face of increasing calls for tougher regulation of online content, Facebook has been taking similar measures elsewhere.

In Pakistan, it removed 57 accounts, 24 pages, seven groups and 15 Instagram accounts, also for inauthentic behavior, as part of a network that originated there and was linked to employees of a unit of the Pakistani military.

Nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan both sent warplanes to attack each other's territory in February after a suicide bomb attack claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group killed 40 Indian paramilitary police in the disputed region of Kashmir. The attack also led to a deluge of fake news, another issue social media companies have been grappling with.

CRITICISM OF POLITICIANS

Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said the firm had removed accounts based on their behavior, not their content.

The company's review found individuals using fake accounts and issuing posts including criticism of the BJP who were ""associated with an INC (Indian National Congress) IT Cell"".

Two of the samples shared by Facebook were of posts that criticized Modi's initiatives and called for supporting the Congress party and its president, Rahul Gandhi.

Separately, Facebook removed 12 accounts and one page, plus one group and one Instagram account, which linked to individuals related to an Indian IT firm Silver Touch. Asked what Silver Touch's link with politics was, Gleicher told Reuters earlier it was ""associated with"" a mobile app promoted by Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

After BJP's IT head, Amit Malviya, told Reuters both the party and the app had ""nothing to do with Silver Touch"", Facebook in a new statement late on Monday said it had ""seen no evidence to date of Silver Touch being associated with the NaMo App on our platform,"" referring to the Narendra Modi app.

""We won’t be speculating about off-platform connections of the actors we took down today,"" a spokeswoman said.

Facebook's actions on Monday also included the removal of a ""pro-BJP"" page called ""The India Eye"", which had more than 2 million followers, ""was strongly nationalist"", a vocal supporter of Modi and a critic of Gandhi, Atlantic Council said.

Credit : Voice of America (VOA) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click ...,"With House Democrats ramping up their wide-ranging investigations of President Donald Trump, Congress and the administration are bracing for what is shaping up to be a long, hard fight over access to documents and witnesses that could go on for the remainder of Trump’s first term in office.

On Wednesday the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas to obtain the full report on Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election from special counsel Robert Mueller, as well as the testimonies of five former White House officials interviewed by the special counsel

While Trump has left it to Attorney General William Barr to decide whether to release the complete report, the president is expected to assert what is known as executive privilege over some portions of records other congressional committees are seeking as part of their investigation of the administration. That has set the stage for a showdown between Democrats in Congress and the White House, raising the specter that the issue may ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

But if the past is any indication, the coming battle is likely to be fought — and eventually settled — through political give and take between the executive and legislative branches of government rather than the courts, said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and author of an acclaimed book on executive privilege.

“Historically, I found in my studies on executive privilege that presidents and Congress have done a good job of engaging in a negotiating process and settling these matters because they both understood that they had a real incentive not to let this go into the courts and not to let these matters drag on,” Rozell said.

Executive privilege

Executive privilege is the right of the president and his senior advisers to protect certain communications from disclosure to Congress and the courts. While the courts have long recognized that power, as well as Congress’ authority to investigate the executive branch, they’ve been reluctant to decide disputes over access to records between the two branches of government.

“Courts have typically required the executive and the legislative branches to engage in a good faith back-and-forth accommodation process about the information before the court will ultimately decide the issue of whether certain documents or testimony are required to be provided to the Congress,” said Margaret Taylor, a senior editor at the popular Lawfare legal blog and a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.

Short of serving a subpoena, Congress has other tools it can use to seek access to information from the executive branch, including the power of appropriation and the power to confirm senior administration officials, Taylor said.

“These are other tools that Congress can use to hasten … the provision of information from the executive branch to the Congress,” Taylor said.

Congress’ power to investigate

While not enshrined in the Constitution, Congress’ power to investigate and obtain confidential information from the executive branch is “extremely broad” and has been recognized as essential to its legislative function, according to the Congressional Research Service.

To obtain information or testimony from executive branch officials, congressional committees initially submit a request. When that fails, Congress can resort to another means of compulsion: subpoenas.

Failure to comply with a congressional subpoena can lead to a vote by the full House or Senate holding the person in contempt of Congress and referring him or her to the Department of Justice for prosecution. If the Justice Department is unwilling to bring charges, Congress can seek a civil judgment from a federal court compelling the individual to respond.

​With the power of executive privilege, presidents have wide latitude to refuse to fully comply with congressional subpoenas. While there is no consensus on the scope of executive privilege, Taylor said presidents have claimed executive privilege over several categories of information — sensitive or classified information; presidential deliberations with advisers; attorney-client communications; law enforcement investigations and national security matters.

“These claims of executive privilege aren’t always successful,” Taylor said. “Sometimes the president ends up waving the privilege and going ahead and sharing the information.”

While presidents going back to Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s have asserted executive privilege, previous presidents “exercised various forms of presidential secrecy that are consistent with what we today call executive privilege,” Rozell said.

Past examples

But it was during the 1970s Watergate scandal that the concept became firmly established when the Nixon administration unsuccessfully fought a grand jury subpoena to turn over secret recordings of White House conversations between President Richard Nixon and his aides.

“The Supreme Court in that case said there is a principle of executive privilege, but it does not apply in this particular instance because there are allegations of wrongdoing, and criminal justice requires access to as much information as possible in order to get the facts,” Rozell said.

Since Nixon, American presidents have invoked executive privilege to varying degrees of success.

In 2001, President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege over internal Justice Department deliberations regarding the FBI’s handling of confidential informants in the 1960s. Turning over the documents, Bush wrote, would “inhibit the candor necessary” to the deliberative process and would be “contrary to national interest.” Congress fought back and eventually reached an agreement with the Justice Department to receive the documents.

On occasion, presidential claims of executive privilege have ended up in court, although by the time a court has issued a verdict, the issue has become moot.

In 2011, the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed internal Justice Department communications and other records as part of its investigation of “Operation Fast and Furious,” a federal gun-running program run amok. Then-President Barack Obama invoked executive privilege to deny the committee access to the records. Three and half years later, a federal court rejected Obama’s assertion of privilege while recognizing that some records were protected and ordering the two sides to negotiate an agreement.

The Supreme Court has never considered a case over a congressional subpoena versus executive privilege. But given the apparent unwillingness of both the administration and congressional Democrats to compromise, experts say the possibility the issue will land before the high court can’t be discounted.

“I don’t think it’s likely that a subpoena dispute will end up before the Supreme Court,” Rozell said. “Usually, it would be a lower level federal court that would get involved. But it could conceivably be a battle that goes all the way to the United States Supreme Court.”

Zeynep Bilginsoy and Suzan Fraser, The Associated Press





ISTANBUL -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party led Sunday's mayoral elections but suffered setbacks as the opposition regained hold of the capital Ankara and made significant inroads in other parts of Turkey. The elections, which the Turkish strongman had depicted as a fight for the country's survival, were largely seen as a test of his support amid a sharp economic downturn.

Both the ruling party and the opposition claimed victory in the neck to neck race in Istanbul.

Erdogan's conservative, Islamic-based Justice and Development Party, or AKP, took 44 per cent of the votes in the elections after 99 per cent of the more than 194,000 ballot boxes were counted, according to the official Anadolu Agency. The secular, main opposition party, the Republican People's Party, or CHP had 30 per cent.

The CHP's mayoral candidate for Ankara, Mansur Yavas, however, won control of Ankara after 25 years of rule by the AKP and a predecessor party. The 63-year-old lawyer received nearly 51 per cent of the votes, according to Anadolu. The CHP and its allies also posted gains elsewhere, increasing the number of city mayoral seats from 14 in the previous local elections in 2014 to 20, according to the preliminary results.

""History is being written in Ankara,"" said deputy CHP leader Haluk Koc, while thousands of supporters celebrated outside the party's headquarters in Ankara.

Former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, the ruling party's candidate for mayor of Istanbul declared victory even though the race in Turkey's largest city and commercial hub was too close to call. Yildirim garnered 48.70 per cent of the votes against the opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu's 48.65 per cent, according to Anadolu, which drew criticism for failing to update results in Istanbul after Yildirim's declaration.

CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu rebuked Yildirim for declaring victory in Istanbul ""in haste"" and claimed his party had now control of Turkey three largest city: Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Imamoglu said he had won Istanbul by more than 29,000 votes, according to results tallied by his party.

Erdogan attaches great importance to Istanbul where he began his rise to power as its mayor in 1994. He has said at campaign rallies that ""whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey."" He refrained from declaring victory in the city of 15 million people.

Ankara was considered the main battleground of the race, where a former government environment minister, Mehmet Ozhaseki, ran for mayor under the banner of Erdogan and his nationalist allies. The ruling party accused his opponent Yavas of forgery and tax evasion. Yavas said he is the victim of a smear campaign.

""Ozhaseki and his dirty politics have lost,"" Yavas said in a victory speech.

Sunday's elections were a first test for Erdogan since he won re-election under a new system of government that gave the presidency expanded powers. Erdogan campaigned tirelessly for AKP's candidates, framing the municipal elections as a matter of ""national survival."" He also portrayed the country's economic woes as attacks by enemies at home and abroad.

""Those who have tried to bring our country on its knees by damaging our people's unity and togetherness, have once again been dealt a blow,"" Erdogan said, noting that the party had emerged as the winner nationwide by a large margin.

The voting was marred by scattered election violence that killed at least four people and injured dozens of others across Turkey.

Years of economic prosperity provided Erdogan and his party with previous election victories. But the race for 30 large cities, 51 provincial capitals and hundreds of districts were held as Turkey grapples with a weakened currency, a double-digit inflation rate and soaring food prices.

The high stakes of the local contests were brought into stark display with the deaths of two members of the Islamic-oriented Felicity Party, a small rival of the president's Justice and Development Party. Felicity's leader, Temel Karamollaoglu, alleged a polling station volunteer and a party observer were shot by a relative of a ruling party candidate.

The killings weren't caused by ""simple animosity,"" but happened when the volunteers tried to enforce the law requiring ballots to be marked in private voting booths instead of out in the open, Karamollaoglu tweeted.

Two other people were killed in fighting in the southern city of Gaziantep. Fights related to local elections in several provinces also produced dozens of injuries, Anadolu reported. Election campaigning was highly polarized, with Erdogan and other officials using hostile rhetoric toward opposition candidates.

Erdogan's ruling party had renewed an alliance with the country's nationalist party to increase votes. Opposition parties also co-ordinated strategies and put forward candidates under alliances in an effort to maximize the chances of unseating members of the AKP.

Erdogan's supporters expressed dismay at losing the capital.

""We did not think that we would lose Ankara in this election,"" said Mehmet Akcam, 18. ""Ankara will see the consequences of what it did.""

The pro-Kurdish, People's Democratic Party appeared to have regained seats in several districts in Turkey's mostly-Kurdish southeast region where Erdogan's government had replaced elected mayors with government-appointed trustees, alleging that the ousted officials had links to outlawed Kurdish militants.

However, the party lost control of two key cities in the region.

The pro-Kurdish party had sat out critical mayoral races in major cities, including Istanbul and Ankara, with the aim of sending votes to a rival secular opposition party to help challenge Erdogan's party.

He was perhaps not getting full support from National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders and being a greenhorn in politics, he decided ...","In a sudden turn of events, JD-U had to change its candidate from Sitamarhi, Dr Varun Kumar, an eminent doctor of Sitamarhi, after expressed his unwillingness to contest.

The reason for sudden change of heart on part of Dr Varun is not known.

Confirming this, JD-U state president Vashishtha Narayan Singh said Sunil Kumar Pintu will be the new party candidate. Pintu had been a BJP MLA for four consecutive terms from 2003 to 2015. However, he will try his luck in Lok Sabha elections on JD-U ticket this time. The election in Sitamarhi is scheduled in the fifth phase on May 6.

“Dr Varun Kumar has expressed his unwillingness to contest. Sunil Kumar Pintu, who was also a minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet, will fight on JD-U ticket. He has been formally inducted in the party,” Singh said, without elaborating.

According to sources, Dr Varun was in a dilemma after his initial brush with the rough and tumble of electoral politics, as he was not getting the kind of response, especially from senior leaders, he had expected before deciding to contest.

“He met chief minister Nitish Kumar and expressed his desire to return the ticket, conceding it would not be possible for him to contest. He was perhaps not getting full support from National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders and being a greenhorn in politics, he decided to give up before even filing nomination,” said a senior leader.

Dr Varun Kumar could not be contacted despite repeated attempts on his mobile number.

On his part, Pintu said it was revitalizing news for him when he got a call early Wednesday morning that the CM wanted to meet me. “I had presented my candidature in my own party from Sitamarhi, but in the seat adjustment, it went to JD-U. It is a kind of divine intervention that has made me a candidate. NDA has sizeable strength in Sitamarhi and its candidate had won both in 2009 and 2014,” he said.

Pintu said it was not always easy in politics for a new comer to immediately settle, as it required one to be in constant touch with the political activists. “The rapport cannot be developed overnight. But it is good that he (Dr Kumar) realised it in the nick of time,” he said.

Sitamarhi MLA Sunil Kumar of the RJD, however, said Pintu’s candidature would make a difference. “The NDA has been forced to change its wrestler after one gave up before the bout. No matter who the wrestler is, Grand Alliance (GA) candidate Arjun Rai will romp home. Now Suri community, to which Dr Varun belongs, will also feel let down,” he said.

It was Sunil Kumar who had defeated Pintu in the 2015 assembly elections.

Arjun Rai had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on a JD-U ticket, but came a distant third. Rashtriya Lok Samata Party candidate Ram Kumar Sharma had won the seat, while RJD’s Sitaram Yadav finished second. Sharma did not get the ticket this time. Rai had won in 2009 on the JD-U ticket.

RJD leader and former MP from Sitamarhi, Sitaram Yadav, who was planning to contest as an Independent after been denied the party ticket, said he had decided not to fight this time. “For a non-political man, it was always difficult to fight election. Dr Varun is a good doctor, but in politics even his own party men were not supporting him,” he said.

BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said, “Pintu is a formidable candidate . It is an NDA seat and it will remain with us.”

Party leaders change.","EDITOR'S NOTE: As part of our ongoing election coverage, we here at the CBC, in cooperation with Janet Brown Opinion Research, have held focus groups with Albertans from across the province; sharing their views on the campaign. Stephen Carlton is a member of the Calgary group.

This is one opinion. Under the heading Opinion, we are carrying a range of different points of view on the issues facing Albertans during the current election. You can find them on our Alberta Votes 2019 page.

The Alberta election is underway.

We citizens, we voters, are being called to read, think, reflect and decide.

After early smears dominated the political agenda, we are now starting to see policy rollout. The NDP, UCP and Alberta Party are offering up something every day. There are lots of new ideas and new materials to keep up with.

Yet, Ms. Notley remains on the defensive and Mr. Kenney still hasn't cleaned his shoes from whatever he stepped in at the time of his leadership race. It's arguable whether it's just an unpleasant smell following him, or if Kenneygate has begun.

Dedicated UCP supporters just might hold their noses as they vote. At the same time, the NDP has hardly been inspirational with their personal attacks.

This is not the best moment of party politics.

What are conscientious voters to do?

We don't vote for a premier

Before we actually get to the vote, it's good to remember — we don't vote for a premier. We cast a ballot for an MLA in our riding.

Political party is one of the considerations, not the sole consideration. Political parties go to great lengths to offer a package deal: government, premier and MLA in one tidy vote!

This vote is often done not with an eye to the candidate, but to the party as a whole, or the leader. But such a vote is uninformed without adequate knowledge of the local candidate, their policies or their vision.

Political parties have benefits, I have no debate with that. However, all of us can remember slates of party candidates who in their allegiance to party, appeared to be recruited as sheep and then behaved sheepishly in the legislature. They gave up independent thought and became slaves to the whip.

This is in part due to a disturbing and growing trend to wrest influence from individual MLAs and centralize power with the party leader. While voting for a premier is a seemingly convenient simplification, for voters it is not reality.

Our job as voters is to cast a ballot for the single person who will attend the legislature and represent constituents in our riding. In reality, this is the only power the voter has at election time.

It is very simple. We must choose the best candidate for MLA.

Strategic voting?

The media and some political parties like to suggest strategic voting as an option. To vote strategically means to vote for someone who you do not want to vote for, in the hope of stopping something even worse from happening.

While this sounds savvy, the problem is the tactic is completely reliant on accurate polls, and riding polls are nowhere near as accurate as they need to be for this to be a viable strategy.

Until polls are found to be reliable at the riding level, your strategic vote simply becomes an uninformed vote.

Voting for someone you don't want to vote for doesn't even sound democratic.

The individual MLA

After elections, we have seen political platforms forgotten.

Party leaders change. Policies come and go as they are processed on the conveyor belt of government. The thing that remains most constant in a single term is the individual MLA.

Because the legislature is dynamic, our system gives authority and flexibility to MLAs to represent constituents in any way they choose and make their own decisions.

Certainly, if they are elected with a party, some parties expect the MLA to toe the party line. (The NDP and UCP are strict on this, the Alberta Party has latitude.) Yet under the rules of our parliamentary system, they are free to leave caucus or be kicked out at any time.

As circumstances change, maybe the MLA can best represent constituents by crossing the floor. Maybe sit as an independent. Possibly even create a new party once the MLAs are in the legislature. Minority government? Your MLA may be able to negotiate a majority.

Cal. Dem Party Arab American Caucus Chair Says Schumer’s “Allegiance Is To Fascist Israel Lobby”

by Jeff Dunetz , The Lid, 4/2/19

Iyad Afalqa chairman of the Arab American Caucus of the California Democratic Par ty accused fellow Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) of having a dual loyalty’ between the U.S. and Israel.

Afalqa’s exact words were both hateful and ignorant., “Shmuck Schumer, the traitor whose allegiance is for Fascist Israel lobby.”

Shmuck Schumer the traitor whose allegiance is for Fascist Israel lobby who called himself the Guardian of Israel in Congress is attacking Rep Omar who hinted at the big elephant in the room: treason of the Fascist Israel lobby that Schumer belongs to.

“For the 2015-2016 election cycle, the pro-Israel network has already dispensed $4,255,136 in contributions. The largest single amount ($259,688) went to Senator Charles Schumer of New York”

Afalqa posted the charge on Facebook on March 27th the day after the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference, where both Democratic and Republican leaders condemned Antisemitism. His post (below) linked to Schumer’s speed made that final day of the conference:

The charge of dual-loyalty is among the most hurtful and dangerous anti-Semitic canards. It is as old as the bible. The first Chapter of Exodus explains that there arose a new Pharaoh who said the Israelites were too numerous and might rise up with Egypt’s enemies against them. This dual loyalty canard was the Pharaoh’s excuse to kill the male Israelite babies and enslave the adults.

From the middle ages through WWII Jews the canard took the form of Jews being disloyal their home countries, instead to a world-wide conspiracy to rule the planet. This canard was a driving force behind anti-Semitic massacres before Christians left home to go fight in the crusades, and after pandemics such as the Bubonic Plague. It was written down in “The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion, a false antisemitic text claiming to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. It was used by the Cossacks to justify anti-Semitic pogroms, and eventually was part of Hitler’s rationale for the Holocaust. The Protocols is still being published and distributed by hate-mongers throughout the world, including ironically at the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism.

Besides the dual loyalty canard, Iyad Afalqa’s ignorance is found in two places. I don’t know where he got the $4.3 million in donations figure, but it wasn’t AIPAC. Keeping support for Israel non-partisan is a priority for AIPAC, they do not donate money to parties or candidates,

Also ridiculous was Iyad Afalqa’s claim that Chuck Schumer specifically was loyal to the Israel lobby–impossible!! I live in New York, Chuck Schumer has been one of my U.S. Senators for twenty-one years, he has never been faithful to anything except the Democratic Party. It’s why he refuses to work with the other party and has been obstructing everything President Trump has tried to do.

As of this writing, the California Democratic Party hasn’t reacted to Iyad Afalqa’s anti-Semitic attack on Chuck Schumer. But based on what they did when Rep.

Engage stakeholders adequately before decision on new electoral roll – Dr Franklin Oduro

Dr Franklin Oduro

Dr Franklin Oduro, Deputy Executive Director of the Centre for Democratic Development-Ghana (CDD-Ghana), has urged the Electoral Commission (EC) to strive to engage electoral stakeholders adequately before going ahead with its decision on a new electoral roll.



“The Electoral Commission has a constitutional mandate to produce a credible election, if in the wisdom of the election management body they feel one of the ways it can produce a credible election is to have a new voters’ register so be it,” he stressed.



Dr Oduro, who is also the Director of Programmes at CDD-Ghana, advised the EC to consult key stakeholders before going ahead with plans to compile a new electoral roll for the 2020 polls.



“But for stakeholders, the beneficiaries, the political parties, the citizenry and the observers need to be convinced, we need to be told the reasons why we need to have a credible register, until the EC provides convincing and research-based justification for its quest for a new electoral roll for the 2020 elections, it may be courting avoidable controversy,” he cautioned.



The EC announced the decision to compile a new electoral register, prompting opposition from the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the People’s National Convention (PNC).



According to the EC, the decision to compile a new voters’ register was arrived at after an Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC), although the claim has been dismissed as untrue but the NDC insists the matter of a new voters’ register was mentioned in passing and has stated it will go ahead with the decision, stating IPAC’s advice is not binding.



Bernard Mornah, National Chairman of PNC, said the EC’s posturing on the new electoral roll was against democratic tenets adding that “listen to the electoral commission and you feel like vomiting because the arguments they are adducing don’t add up, about the claim the current register was bloated with names of minors and deceased persons.



“The EC must state how it will prevent registration of minors in the new roll for the 2020 general election, this is an electoral commission that claims the voters’ register is bloated by what extent of bloating, they are not capable of saying.



“They are saying because the biometric features are not functioning properly, the register is not fit for purpose for the 2020 elections but it is fit for purpose for the district assembly elections which is an essential aspect of our democratic processes,” Mr Mornah quizzed.",Engage stakeholders adequately before decision on new electoral roll – Dr Franklin Oduro,Ghanaweb.com,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Engage-stakeholders-adequately-before-decision-on-new-electoral-roll-Dr-Franklin-Oduro-735623

Darlene Superville, The Associated Press





WASHINGTON -- Barbara Bush didn't bite her tongue in recent years when it came to Donald Trump: She just didn't like him. But a new biography of the former first lady finds that her disdain for the Republican president, who transformed the party her own family had embodied for generations into his likeness, dates as least as far back as a 1990s diary entry.

She referred to Trump in the entry as ""the real symbol of greed in the 80s.""

Mrs. Bush, who was 92 when she died last April , gave Susan Page, author of ""The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty,"" access to volumes of her diaries, which she began keeping in 1948. The former first lady recounts in a January 1990 entry about reading a news article on Trump speaking at a Los Angeles charity awards dinner for Merv Griffin. Former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, attended the gala, and Trump needled the former president over pricey speeches he had given in Japan.

Mrs. Bush later showed a friend news clips about Trump's separation from his first wife, Ivana, and noted that allies of the soon-to-be ex-Mrs. Trump were saying a $25 million settlement in the prenuptial agreement she signed wouldn't be enough.

""The Trumps are a new word, both of them,"" Mrs. Bush wrote. ""Trump now means Greed, selfishness and ugly. So sad.""

Her dislike of Trump spiked more recently over the way he belittled her son, Jeb, when the New York businessman and the former Florida governor competed for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Trump also had criticized other members of the Bush clan, including George W. Bush over starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Page, the Washington bureau chief for USA Today, also reveals that Mrs. Bush blamed Trump for causing her ""angst"" during the 2016 election - she called it a ""heart attack"" - and leading her to question whether she was still a Republican. Asked in the months before she died whether she still considered herself a Republican, Mrs. Bush answered: ""I'd probably say no today.""

The book, based also on five interviews Page conducted with Mrs. Bush, is due in bookstores Tuesday. It comes nearly a year after the passing of the second woman in U.S. history to be the wife of one president and the mother of another.

The former first lady had drafted a tongue-in-cheek letter to send after the November 2016 election welcoming former President Bill Clinton to the club of first spouses. Clinton's wife, Hillary Clinton, was the Democratic candidate, and Mrs. Bush thought, as did many voters, that she would be the next president.

The letter never saw a mailbox. She woke up the morning after the election ""and discovered, to my horror, that Trump had won.""

Weeks later, however, she wrote to Melania Trump. At the time, Mrs. Trump was the subject of intense speculation over whether she would relocate to the White House from her family's penthouse at New York's Trump Tower. Mrs. Bush encouraged the incoming first lady to do what was best for her and for the couple's young son, Barron. Mrs. Trump attended her predecessor's funeral.

Until the day she died, Mrs. Bush also kept on her bedside table a red, white and blue digital clock, given to her as a joke, that counted down to the end of Trump's term.

Mrs. Bush, who had been living in constant pain, fell and broke her back shortly before she died. In the hospital, after receiving the news that she was dying, she asked her doctor to keep it a secret. Once back at her Houston home, receiving only palliative care, she sat in the den holding hands with her husband of 73 years. They had the longest presidential marriage in U.S. history.

He gave ""Bar,"" as he called her, permission to die, and she gave her then-93-year-old husband permission to live.

Then they each had a drink: bourbon for Mrs. Bush, a vodka martini for the former president.

She died two days later.",New book says Barbara Bush saw Trump as a 'symbol of greed',CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/new-book-says-barbara-bush-saw-trump-as-a-symbol-of-greed-1.4359987

Reconsider decision to compile new register – CODEO

Logo of CODEO

The Coalition of Domestic Election Observers (CODEO) wants the Electoral Commission to reconsider its decision to compile a new voters’ register.



CODEO argues that a new electoral roll independent of the National Identification Card would be a waste of resources.



The Commission announced last week at an Inter-Party Advisory Committee Meeting that it would compile a new register for the 2020 presidential and parliamentary elections.



The move has already triggered some opposition from the National Democratic Congress (NDC) which believes that the proposal was not discussed at the IPAC meeting.



The EC, however, said it arrived at the decision in consultation with the various political parties.



It said the new register will include enhancing features, making it worthy of Ghana’s democracy.



Reacting to the EC’s announcement, the NDC demanded the withdrawal of the communique issued by the EC insisting no consensus was reached on the matter.



According to the party, no such decision was taken during the IPAC meeting.



“In fact, the compilation of a new voters’ register was only mentioned in passing by the EC during a discussion on limited registration. There certainly was no “extensive deliberations “ on this particular matter,” the party said in a statement.



The National Coordinator for CODEO, Albert Arhin, believes the country would save a lot of money if the EC stuck to the Ghana Card as the main form of identification at next year’s polls.",Reconsider decision to compile new register – CODEO,Ghanaweb.com,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Reconsider-decision-to-compile-new-register-CODEO-735624

But, the Congress’ manifesto is a reminder that the social-democratic party is always going to do better at promising welfare expansions than anyone else. It’s pledged that 3.6 percent of GDP will ...","When Narendra Modi was elected prime minister of India in 2014, one of the reasons that many welcomed him, at home and abroad, was that governance in New Delhi seemed to have ground to a halt. His predecessors in government, the Indian National Congress, had once been identified as the party of reform and competence. But, a series of political missteps and growing popular opposition meant that they instead developed a reputation for administrative paralysis.Five years on, the choice between Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, seems to have been reset. For many, Modi’s government has not lived up to expectations. While he brought a new energy to governance, a lack of familiarity with policy combined with a lack of competence in his party and cabinet to stymie his more ambitious efforts at reform.This week, when the Congress released its manifesto for the forthcoming general elections, it felt like we were back in the 2000s. Much in the manifesto was solidly reformist; it included several longstanding prescriptions from economists and public policy experts including legal reform, devolving more power to local governments and simplifying the goods-and-services tax. The BJP struggled to come up with coherent, pointed replies to these policy suggestions -- even Modi’s finance minister was reduced to declaring that the manifesto was designed to help separatists break up the country. The contrast between the two sides could not have been sharper and it wasn’t the ruling party that sounded like the party of government.For the BJP, this is a lost opportunity. It should not have ceded leadership on economics and policy back to the Congress. Modi has tried to rebrand himself, in office, as a welfare-state populist. But, the Congress’ manifesto is a reminder that the social-democratic party is always going to do better at promising welfare expansions than anyone else. It’s pledged that 3.6 percent of GDP will be redistributed, as an income supplement, to the poorest fifth of India’s population. How the hundreds of millions of Indians meant to benefit from this would be identified is unclear -- nor can anyone say for certain what the impact on prices and the labor market of such a large basic-income program would be. Even so this promise, of a minimum guaranteed income, has stolen the BJP’s thunder: It had hoped its own much smaller income-support program for farmers would be sufficient to shore up Modi’s “pro-poor” credentials.The Congress of the 1990s and 2000s sought to present itself as the only party that could credibly deliver welfare precisely because it was capable of delivering growth, fueled by economic reform. There’s something of that dual approach to the party’s 2019 manifesto as well. Sure, money has been promised to the poor, agricultural loans would be waived and the party has pledged to double public healthcare spending to three percent of GDP. At the same time, the party also has quite a few plans that, if implemented, would be good news for investment and growth.For one, the Congress promised reform of tax administration, accusing the current government of giving the taxman “extraordinary discretionary powers that have throttled industry and come to be described as ‘tax terrorism.’” There’s some justice to that accusation, especially given the behavior of Indian tax authorities over the past week. In the last few days before the end of the financial year, the amount of direct tax collected jumped by over 10 percent -- quite likely because income tax officials arm-twisted companies and individuals into paying extra advance tax in order to make the government’s figures look good.The Congress has also promised that small and medium-sized Indian companies, as well as all start-ups, would not have to file any paperwork for their first three years. Given the amount of red tape to which Indians have grown accustomed, this is quite a remarkable suggestion. If it were to be implemented, by the Congress or anyone else, it might go some way towards changing what the default attitude to regulation in India is. If smaller companies get used to a low-interference environment, it will be hard to force them to return to the current, overregulated paradigm. Economic reformers have long wondered how to make the political case for deregulation. The Congress might have partially solved that problem.It’s unfortunate that the BJP, which has traditionally been the party of small business, could not come up with a potentially transformative plan of this sort. Perhaps it’s revealing of the degree to which Modi’s statist instincts have taken over. The Congress is still unlikely to get anywhere near power once elections are done in May. But, the party has at least reminded Modi that welfarism need to be paid for by deregulation and reform.Disclaimer: Views expressed in the article are those of the author",View: Congress party reminds Modi what reform looks like,Economic Times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/view-congress-party-reminds-modi-what-reform-looks-like/articleshow/68700161.cms

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) waves at an enthusiastic crowd of hometown supporters, half of whom raised their hands when MSNBC host Chris Hayes, a fellow Bronx native, asked who was from the borough.

NEW YORK ― The nation’s best-known baseball team won big at Thursday’s opening game at Yankee Stadium, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 7-2. But it was on Friday, roughly 10 miles northeast of the Yankees’ home field in the Bronx, that New York City’s northernmost borough offered its champion a hometown hero’s welcome and pledged vehement support in the contests ahead. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) entered the auditorium at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to standing applause Friday afternoon as she arrived to tape an hour-long TV special on the Green New Deal, her signature policy proposal, with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. The show is set to air Friday at 8 p.m. Eastern. On Tuesday, four members of the Senate’s Democratic caucus joined every Republican in voting to block a resolution staking out what should be in future Green New Deal legislation. On Wednesday, conservatives’ leading voice of reason on climate change published a widely shared essay that offered talking points to oppose the Green New Deal without invoking hamburger bans, Stalinism or genocide. On Thursday night, President Donald Trump smeared the Green New Deal as “an extreme, $100 trillion government takeover” at a rally in Michigan, leading the crowd in chants of “AOC sucks.”

This is not about appealing to my colleagues. This is about appealing to you and about appealing to the American people. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)

Yet here, the audience repeatedly shouted, “We’ve got your back,” “We love you” and “Sí, se puede” as Ocasio-Cortez, 29, outlined her plans to dig in for a long-haul fight to enact sweeping reforms that would upend the electrical and automotive sectors, restore the United States to a position of moral leadership and provide millions of Americans union-wage clean energy jobs. “This is not about appealing to my colleagues,” Ocasio-Cortez said on stage. “This is about appealing to you and about appealing to the American people.” The event ― a coup unto itself, getting climate change on cable despite TV producers’ infamous aversion ― cemented Ocasio-Cortez’s place at the helm of the Green New Deal movement and made clear it was just that: a movement far bigger than any mere congressional resolution. As her allies are readying primary challenges against Democrats who refuse to join the Green New Deal’s 100 co-sponsors in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez said, “You don’t necessarily have to replace everybody.” Instead, she’s betting the increasingly visible and deadly effects of climate change will unite a popular base so vast the market fundamentalists in both parties who oppose the kind of New Deal-era, big-government policies needed to match the scope of the climate crisis will fall in line. “If the electorate prioritizes it and overwhelmingly supports it, then we create the political room to pass it,” Ocasio-Cortez said. It may be an idealists’ political naivete. But the Green New Deal’s rapid ascent suggests the freshman congresswoman is on to something.

Reuters Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's town hall forum took place in the Morris Park section of the Bronx in New York City.

For years, positions in the debate over mainstream climate policies ranged from hard-line denial of climate change on one end to moderate market tweaks on the other. Democrats regularly introduced bills to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions through a cap-and-trade scheme or a carbon tax. Tax incentives for renewable energy sources like solar and wind enjoyed bipartisan support, yet so too did subsidies for oil and gas production. Then, in October, United Nations scientists forecast average temperatures to increase at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ― a catastrophic spike, likely to cost $54 trillion in damage and countless lives ― unless world governments took unprecedented measures to halve global emissions over the next decade. A month later, a congressionally mandated report by 13 federal agencies confirmed the research. The findings made clear that market fixes alone might have worked in the 1970s, when scientists first understood the climate impacts of burning fossil fuels, but now it’s too late. “The one thing we cannot rebuke and the one thing we cannot deny is climate change is a problem of market failures,” said Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist. “Exxon Mobil knew that climate change was real and man-made starting as far back as 1970,” she added. “The entire United States government knew that climate change was real and human-caused in 1989. The initial response was, ‘Let the market handle it. They will do it.’ Forty years and free-market solutions have not changed our position.”

The one thing we cannot rebuke and the one thing we cannot deny is climate change is a problem of market failures. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)

Into that void came the Green New Deal. In November, Sunrise Movement, a grassroots group of youth activists, staged protests in then-incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s offices, demanding Democratic leaders fight for sweeping climate policy in the next Congress. Ocasio-Cortez joined the sit-in and became the movement’s champion. Before taking her oath of office, she began gathering support for a resolution to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal. Pelosi ultimately kiboshed the effort. But the campaign popularized the slogan and laid the groundwork for a movement. By December, a survey by Yale and George Mason universities found 81 percent of American voters supported the goals of a Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans. Yet the pollsters warned that support would likely wane as the policy became more closely associated with members of one party. By March, the partisan polarization took effect, but the popularity remained. Fifty-two percent of adults supported the Green New Deal, compared to 42 percent who disagreed with it, according to an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released this week. “It’s more popular than the Republican tax cuts,” Heather McGhee, a senior fellow at the progressive think tank Demos, said Friday at the town hall. “We have this idea that left ideas are moving and shaking inside the political atmosphere right now. That’s true. But they’re left in terms of Washington. But in terms of the American people, they’re centrist ideas.” That hasn’t helped tamp down opposition from powerful building trades unions that rely on the pipeline and coal train industries for lucrative jobs. Countering the fossil fuel industry’s appeal to organized labor is an uphill battle for Green New Deal advocates. Very few renewable energy jobs are unionized, and the steady march of right-to-work laws in red states over the past decade makes it difficult to envision a future in which new industries enjoy the same labor precedents as older ones. Ocasio-Cortez said that was one reason the Green New Deal movement could not abandon its class politics to secure support from avowedly pro-business conservatives. “We cannot allow for the fossil fuel jobs to be better, more dignified and higher-waged with stronger labor support behind [them] than new energy jobs,” she said. “What I’m tired of is us worrying more about the future of fossil fuels than worry about the future of fossil fuel workers.” Even as Republicans vilified the Green New Deal with increasingly absurd rhetoric ― including displaying an image on the Senate floor of former President Ronald Reagan riding a velociraptor ― the party has struggled to articulate an alternative vision. Those that have emerged suggest the Green New Deal has dramatically shifted the center of the climate debate leftward. On Monday, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) cribbed the Green New Deal’s rhetoric harkening to a World War II-level mobilization effort when he proposed a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy that he said would “double federal funding for energy research” and implement a five-year plan to “create new sources of cheap, clean energy.” That same week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a loyal Trump ally, drafted a nonbinding resolution staking out a “Green Real Deal” that would acknowledge the threat climate change poses to “human health and safety” in “communities across the United States.”

We have this idea that left ideas are moving and shaking inside the political atmosphere right now. That’s true. But they’re left in terms of Washington. But in terms of the American people, they’re centrist ideas.

Getty Images British Prime Minister Theresa May gives a press conference inside Downing Street on April 2, 2019, in London, England. Cabinet Ministers held a two-part meeting in Downing Street on Tuesday after MPs still couldn't decide an alternative to May's Brexit Deal in the latest round of indicative votes.

(CNN) - British Prime Minister Theresa May tore up her Brexit strategy on Tuesday, declaring the UK would need to seek another delay to the process of leaving the European Union and offering cross-party talks to break the political deadlock.

In a momentous statement at Downing Street, ten days before the UK is due to leave the EU with or without an agreement, May said she would implement any deal that was agreed by a majority in the UK Parliament.

""This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it requires national unity to deliver the national interest,"" she said.

The opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accepted May's offer of talks, acknowledging the Prime Minister had shifted her position.

By offering to accept a compromise, May recognized that she will never be able to win round her supposed allies in the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, nor a hard core of Brexiteers in her own Conservative Party. That decision, taken after a Cabinet meeting that lasted most of Tuesday, is certain to sow deep divisions on her own side.

Cross-party talks

In accepting May's offer of talks, Corbyn said he recognized ""my responsibility to represent the people that supported Labour in the last election and the people who didn't support Labour but nevertheless want certainty and security for their own future, and that's the basis on which we will meet her and we will have those discussions.""

After May's speech, European Council President Donald Tusk signaled that the door would be open to a further delay. ""We don't know what the end result will be, let us be patient,"" he wrote on Twitter.

But stances are hardening among other European leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron warned earlier in the day that the EU would not be ""held hostage"" to UK's spiraling political crisis, telling reporters during a press conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that Britain will not automatically be granted another extension to Brexit.

""The third rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the Commons, as well as the rejections of any alternative, pave the way for a no-deal exit,"" Macron said.

He added that the EU would be ""open"" to another Brexit plan, such as a customs union, as well as a general election and a second referendum, as potential ways forward that could help Britain secure another delay -- but insisted that it was ""up to London"" to put any such plans forward.

Signs of division

Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative Member of Parliament who favors a clean break from the EU, was quick to voice his disappointment at May's about-face.

""This is a deeply unsatisfactory approach,"" he said. ""It's not in the interests of the country, it fails to deliver on the referendum result and history doesn't bode well for it.""

Rees-Mogg said he was resolutely opposed to May's offer of talks with the opposition. ""I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instill confidence in Conservatives,"" he added, referring to Corbyn's left-wing politics.

In her statement, May suggested that if she and Corbyn could not agree a deal, the government would give Parliament a series of votes on Brexit options.

In a significant development, she promised to abide by whatever proposal for the UK's future relationship with Europe gained a majority in Parliament, so long as the opposition did the same. In doing so, she effectively ruled out the chance of Britain crashing out of Europe without a deal.

May said that the parliamentary wrangling of recent weeks had taken its toll on everyone. ""This debate, this division cannot drag on much longer. It is putting members of Parliament and everyone else under immense pressure, and it is doing damage to our politics,"" May said.

A compromise was the only way out, she said. ""This is a difficult time for everyone. Passions are running high on all sides of the argument. But we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for,"" she added.

Stalemate in Parliament

The parliamentary impasse was exacerbated on Monday when lawmakers failed to come to rally around any Brexit alternative during a vote at the House of Commons.

The stalemate prompted a cross party group of MPs, including Conservative lawmaker Oliver Letwin and Labour MP Yvette Cooper, to draw up a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

The plan is set to be debated and voted on over the next two days, and will likely take place instead of a third round of so-called indicative votes slated for Wednesday.

""We are now in a really dangerous situation with a serious and growing risk of no-deal in 10 days' time,"" Cooper said, according to the Press Association.

""The Prime Minister has a responsibility to prevent that happening. She needs to put forward a proposal, including saying how long an extension she thinks we need to sort things out.""",May: New Brexit delay will be needed to 'break logjam',channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/world/may-new-brexit-delay-will-be-needed-to-break-logjam/1065131866

The man nominated to break the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) control over Turkey’s economic heart, representing the coalition formed by the secular main opposition Republic People’s Party (CHP) and the right-wing Iyi Party, Imamoglu is a relatively new entrant to Turkey’s politics who could be on the verge of beating a former prime minister to lead Turkey’s largest city.

Turkish elections: Seven things we learnt from Sunday's vote Read More »

According to initial counting, Imamoglu has a 25,000 vote lead over the AKP’s Binali Yildirim, who was Turkey’s prime minister until the role was abolished in a referendum that switched the country to a presidential system in 2017.

A significant victory could be his in only the second electoral win in his career, but this depends on the results of a recount in seven Istanbul districts requested by the AKP. The CHP has also objected to results in two other districts.

On Thursday morning, CHP spokesman Faik Öztrak, told Fox TV that a recount was ordered in 21 out of 39 districts of Istanbul for invalid votes. In 5 districts, a total recount was ordered.

Regardless, the result has put Imamoglu on the political map, with foreign media and political analysts marking him out as someone who might be able to challenge the AKP’s 17-year mandate - though questions remain about his lack of experience and the conservative image he has cultivated.

The promise he offers, according to CHP’s Istanbul Provincial Assistant Director Ilayda Cagla Kocoglu, who worked closely with Imamoglu during his campaign, is to replicate his successful approach to being mayor of an Istanbul municipality.

“In Beylikduzu, his former district, he inspected the problems, walking street by street, and sought solutions by himself,” she said, explaining that he plans to do the same for the city as a whole.

A history with the AKP

The 49-year-old was born in a small Black Sea village in northern Turkey and lived there until he was given a chance to study in Istanbul, at the Istanbul University Business Administration School. He graduated in 1992 and settled in İstanbul’s Beylikduzu, the district he became mayor of in 2014, and started work in his families’ construction firm.

A small suburb on the western side of Istanbul, Beylikduzu experienced a population boom after the 1999 Marmara earthquake, which killed thousands and emptied existing neighbourhoods, and the construction of new public transportation lines. Its population jumped from 3,000 in the 1990s to 350,000 in 2018. He was elected head of CHP’s youth wing in 2009 and five years later won his first public election to become a district mayor.

Imamoglu poses with his mother during the campaign in Istanbul (Reuters)

“Before him, Beylikduzu was under the administration of AKP, like every other newly-founded district. His triumph versus AKP in Beylikduzu was an important factor that granted him the candidacy in the Istanbul race,” said Kocoglu. “But personally I admire his disciplined working style and the way he builds up relationships with people he interacted with.”

As an example, she said he would always ask how she would get home after long days working and offered to call a taxi.

“He never forgets details about you and reminds you that he cares,” she said.

A New Erdogan?

It was the Istanbul mayoralty that propelled President Recep Tayyip Erdogan into the spotlight in 1994, opening the door for him to later enter the country’s highest positions of power, where he has remained for almost two decades. Suggestions are already being made that Imamoglu might himself be able to challenge for the presidency.

Zeynep Balcioglu, an academic at Boston’s Northeastern University who has done field research on social services in all 39 of Istanbul’s municipalities, especially for the disadvantaged, told MEE that Imamoglu has “political stamina”.

Millions of Turkish voters take to the polls in the country's local elections Read More »

“He showed his stamina during the disputed election night by preserving his calm and during the electoral campaign he always displayed a positive attitude,” she said.

But some of the headlines in the foreign press, declaring Erdogan’s influence as on the wane and Imamoglu as a “unifying force”, have come too early, she said.

“That would be an enormous claim. One way or another, Erdogan’s name is written with major letters on Turkish political history. It is too early to say such a thing for Imamoglu,” she said, though she also said the idea of having a good record as mayor is considered by many political aspirants as a blueprint for rising through the political ranks, set by Erdogan.

“The fact that Erdogan’s career started from a municipality gives hope to a number of mayors to become an Erdogan-like figure. I can say that Erdogan’s career is seen as a ‘roadmap’.”

Waiting on the result

Imamoglu’s rise has not come without criticism, which has flowed from all sides. The secular CHP, the Kurdish-based leftist People’s Democratic Party and many from the ruling AK Party have accused Imamoglu of imitating Erdogan.

When he responded to the killing of 50 Muslim worshippers in New Zealand by recording a video, that went viral, of him reading the Quran inside the city's Eyupsultan mosque, he was accused by some of showing off or trying to appeal to conservative voters.

Ali Kirimli, one of Imamoglu’s constituents in Beylikduzu, had simpler concerns. He said he did not vote for him because he doubted Imamoglu’s ability to govern a city as large as Istanbul.

“He has a positive attitude but that is not the quality that I look for in a mayor, I can assure you that; I live in a part of Beylikduzu he totally forgot.”

The debates around Imamoglu’s future potential rest however on the result of the recounts which will decide whether or not he will become Istanbul’s mayor. The head of the Supreme Electoral Council Sadi Guven announced Wednesday that there will have to be recounting in most of Istanbul so Imamoglu’s wait may be a long one.

A senator-elect, who claimed to have turned down the PDP offer, said: “In all parliaments, be it in the presidential system or parliamentary system the world over, leadership or presiding officers emerge based on their experiences as leaders of the caucuses.

“Thus, when a party gains a majority after a general election into parliament, the leader of the caucus of such a party in the legislature transforms to be the President or Speaker of such parliament in a seamless process. It is an established practice and all stakeholders should make sure we act in conformity with the international standard in this respect.

“They also discussed with us the revival of the ‘Like Minds Group’ of 2015 and their various social media campaign of calumny, most especially their deliberate attempt to link a National Leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, to the emergence of Senator Ahmad.”

Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the APC, have been cautioned against subjecting the control of the National Assembly to certain individuals.

This was the position of the senator representing Abia South senatorial district, Enyinnaya Abaribe, who is also a member of the PDP.

Abaribe said the parliament will not sit back and allow anyone impose presiding officers, insisting that only elected senators, who are duly certified, would vote when the time comes.

Today, in the Gambia, there is a scramble for positions in the United Democratic Party, the People’s Progressive Party ...","New York Letter With Alagi Yorro Jallow: Why Gambia’s Older Politicians Reluctant To Retire?

It’s time to let the Gambia’s political dinosaurs go extinct? The old guards of the first and second republic political dinosaurs are tackling the 21st century problems with obsolete ideologies from the 19th century. Where is the future of the youth in the Gambia? What is the future of the young people in New Gambia?

Why is the Gambia so saddled with leaders who ought to be enjoying their retirement in peace and quiet, instead of in the unforgiving political corridors, be on the campaign trails and taxing political brinkmanship that challenge even the youngest leaders?

At the very least, all political parties can make more conscious efforts to improve youth participation in their organizations, develop new leadership cadres and ease people into retirement. For two generations of the Gambia, the country’s post-independence politics were also predominantly about the age-old politicians. But the nation’s political change has unleashed long-repressed voices that are reshaping how the country thinks about its past. Under a septuagenarian, the Gambia is on its way not gifting a young generation a new history.

It is true that wisdom is something that accrues with age and is indispensable to making political choices. But the Gambia must also have leaders who look more like the people they represent. After all, young people are the ones who will be dealing tomorrow with the consequences of the decisions made today.

The Gambia’s sepuagenarian politicians never leaves the political scene. They may be old, very old, even dying, but the burning zeal to serve us never leaves them. Even when the whole world knows they are as stale as yesterday’s baked bread, they would rather class themselves as vintage wine – the older, the better. They are like the creature called salamander. It holds on to whatever tree it clings to, even in death. It seeks, too, to defy nature, regenerating its dead organs.

The Yahya Jammeh government in 1994 banned old politicians from its political experiment and attempted to supplant them with a new breed of leaders. Yahya Jammeh said then that he wanted a saner political environment free from corruption and failures of the past. A brand-new generation of political faces soon sprouted in the nursery bed of the Jammeh political experiment.

As Jammeh moved forward in that experience, he routinely banned and unbanned even many of the new breed as they proved to be worthy copycats of the old order. The new breed soon became the new greed, greedier than the greedy. Today, the new breed of the 80s have become grandparents on today’s political turf, doing it the old, ugly way. Staying put forever.

Today, in the Gambia, there is a scramble for positions in the United Democratic Party, the People’s Progressive Party (I read that Halifa Sallah said that this National Assembly will be his last term as National Assembly member for Serekunda Central not sure of Sidia Jatta) by a coterie of old men and women whose goals and motives are never clear. In the Gambia, political parties have the worst reputation in parading men and women who will never know when to quit.

At a recent political gathering of one political party, at the high table, what we saw were aged men and women who took to their seats but still would sit tight and insist that they were not tired. These are men and women who are old and aged. We know that while age is in the number of years, ageing may not necessarily be so. Some are aged because they’ve been around for decades. Some get aged at noon, spent and ineffectual in everything. Now, we have a combination of these banding together and branding themselves as leading lights to a future which nature won’t allow them to be part of.

And there appears to be no difference across the viable parties. If what we operate were a monarchy, we all would surrender to the finality and consequences of our choice. After all, Japan has an Akihito, 82 years, who took over from his father, Hihorito, in 1989 as emperor. And there is Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, 86 years old, fifth emir of Kuwait who had previously been foreign minister for 40 years. And, of course, there is Elizabeth II, 90-year-old Queen of England since 1952.

The Gambia is a democracy, and democracy works best for the people only when the best is allowed to rule the rest. And, it is not as if today’s sit-tight old men and women had spent their long years in public space promoting the greatest good for the majority. They have always seen the Gambia as their company, even at their old age.

We cannot insist they are the best of us with a tired engine and a creaking chassis. Even if they have been very good to the people, they still cannot be the best forever, no matter the sweetness of their goodness. Nothing, in truth, is evergreen and that is why nature applies brakes here and there, replacing trunks with shoots.

Some will blame the young’s “unseriousness” for the tenacious resolve of the Gambia’s aged to continue to rule parties and governments. They will point at the tepid fire in the youth of today and the deficit of ideas in some who have strayed into power in recent years. We would rather insist that the forest consists of crooked and upright trees. The chaff and the grain won’t cohere for long; water will always find its level. The disappointment in some conspicuous young ones should not be seized as an excuse by the old to ventilate their lust in perpetuity in a space that is supposed to serve everyone.

A festival that alienates the young will soon be spoken of in the past tense, even lost, forgotten forever. Any system that fast-forwards to the past cannot serve the future. Anywhere there is no regeneration, decay and death set in. The Gambia’s politics and apocalyptic solution to the suffocating influence of a blundering generation of old men and women who won’t let go of a dying country should not be funny at all.

We have simply lost faith in the system, lost faith in the operators of the system and lost faith in life. Persons of their generation who silently think same as solution are many. It is what we get when a nation suffers an army of ruinous old men and women, assisted by misdirected young men and women, misgoverning and sitting tight at all levels. They kill hope and set off such suicidal possibilities in the hopeless

Let’s think and reflect on Africa’s two octogenarian leaders: Inside the minds of Robert Mugabe and Abdoulaye Wade, though, they had initially won praise for championing one of Africa’s best education systems and for holding their leadership deteriorated as they became more autocratic and pursued damaging economic policies. They oversaw corruption and patronage, broke with international creditors and eventually oversaw one of the world’s worst bouts of hyperinflation, which led to the scrapping of the Zimbabwean currency and a reliance on US dollars.

As economic conditions deteriorated, they resorted increasingly to state intimidation to stay in office. Mugabe and Wade had a history of outmaneuvering their rivals, but their refusal to groom a clear successor triggered a bitter battle within their respective political parties. As their health failed and their leadership flagged, Mugabe’s younger wife, Grace Mugabe and Abdoulaye Wade’s son Karim Wade, began openly angling to be successors, using a clique of younger generation politicians to purge the party of rivals.

One political pundit said it was a sad moment for Africa, after nearly decades of what he called a gerontocracy ruinous rule of the continent.

It certainly time to let the Gambia’s younger people- under 40s, please- have a go at running the country they will have to live in when the fat old men are long dead.

Much of the progressive world embraces the innovativeness of youth — its energy, vibrancy, adaptability, willingness to embrace change and enthusiasm to learn. In the Gambia, on the other hand, wobbles behind, unable to keep pace, thanks to its conservative aging leaders.",New York Letter With Alagi Yorro Jallow: Why Gambia’s Older Politicians Reluctant To Retire?,Jollofnews,https://jollofnews.com/2019/04/04/new-york-letter-with-alagi-yorro-jallow-why-gambias-older-politicians-reluctant-to-retire/

Q: What’s your overall stance on the U.S.-Israel relationship?

A: I am a Jewish woman and representative from Washington state, so I grew up with unquestionable love for the State of Israel and an understanding that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. Our values are shared. It is absolutely fundamental that the Jewish people have a state of their own where they are safe.

Q: You’re one of the freshmen Jewish members of the 116th Congress. Mind giving our readers a quick overview of what it was like growing up?

A: I had a pretty normal childhood. I grew up in a middle-class family with a mom who was a teacher, a dad an aerospace engineer. We attended a Reform synagogue close to our house. I had a typical Jewish upbringing: Sunday school, Hebrew school, bat mitzvah. I raised my son as well in our local synagogue. I think with that comes an understanding that it is really important to have a Jewish state, and that given the history of civilization, the Jewish people need a homeland to call their own where they are safe. The relationship between the United States and Israel is paramount: The safety and security of Israel depends on the U.S., and the safety and security of the U.S. depends, in many ways, on Israel.

Q: How many times have you been to Israel?

A: I’ve been twice.

Q: Are you going this summer?

A: That is my plan.

Both times, I went was during medical school. One of them was over a summer break, and I did a work-study hike program called Livnot U’Lehibanot, which got to immerse me in a Modern Orthodox lifestyle, so I really got to experience what it was like to observe all of the traditions. The second was a program where I studied dermatology at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel HaShomer Hospital near Tel Aviv.

Q: You mentioned going on a program where you followed Modern Orthodox traditions. What was that like coming from a Reform background?

A: I’m a person who likes to learn, and I have an open mind. For me, it was a really interesting way to go, and hear a perspective and experience a cultural immersion that was different. With every experience in our lives, we bring something back. The importance of having a break and a rest and the importance of traditions stuck with me. I continue to be a Reform Jew.

Q: What is your reaction to the president announcing that U.S. troops will withdraw from Syria?

A: That has been walked back a bit. We need to be very thoughtful about our foreign policy and not leaving power vacuums in the Middle East. It was a hasty decision and, hopefully, if that is the plan, it will be done thoughtfully and gradually to make sure there is no power vacuum and to protect the Kurds [our allies].

Q: Does the U.S. military need to combat Iranian forces in Syria, including Hezbollah? Do we need a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force?

A: I am very hesitant to give a presidential authorization for the use of military force. That should come to Congress; that’s our job. We do need to combat Iranian and Hezbollah might for a multitude of reasons, one of which is they’re a neighbor of Israel. We need to keep Israel safe and secure.

Q: What’s your reaction to some of the anti-Israel verbiage coming from fellow Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib?

A: I have mixed feelings. It is completely legitimate to call into question or disagree with the leadership of a country. I very much love my own country, the United States, but I can disagree with its leadership in the same way I can love and feel passionately about the State of Israel, but disagree with its leadership.

I do believe some of the language crossed the line from being questioning of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s administration to suggesting that there is question about Israel’s right to exist, and an anti-Semitic bent that needs to be addressed.

Q: Do you agree with the calls for Rep. Omar to be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee?

A: I believe that this is a place where you win over hearts and minds much more with a carrot than a stick. I consider it my responsibility as a Jewish woman in Congress in this freshman class to befriend my colleagues and show them a different perspective. We all grew up in our own environments. If you grow up in an environment where Israel is cast as demonic, it can be hard to see another viewpoint. I look forward to learning about each other’s histories and different perspectives.

Q: Have you reached out to Congresswoman Omar?

A: Yes.

Q: What was that like?

A: We continue to see each other frequently, and I think that this relationship will build over several years.

Q: What was your reaction to the president saying that the Democratic Party has become an “anti-Jewish” and “anti-Israel” party?

A: It’s total rhetoric and baloney. We’re absolutely supportive of the State of Israel, and I think he is setting that up for political reasons, and it is completely unfair and unfounded. We unequivocally support that State of Israel and its right to exist.

Q: What’s your stance on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal?

A: It was a mistake to withdraw from the Iran deal, however flawed it may have been in the beginning. It was working, and it was an agreement. We pulled out of that agreement at exactly the same time that our president was entering into supposed negotiations with North Korea. It sends a very big message when the United States pulls out of an agreement—that we cannot be trusted.

Q: What do you say to those who criticized the agreement and said it gave $150 billion to the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism?

A: I stand by my word. It was working. The end of the term we were talking about, it could have been renegotiated, and we were working with partners all over the world to do this. Partnerships are far more effective than isolationist strategies.

Q: What was your reaction to the United States relocating its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?

A: I think it’s generally understood that Jerusalem is the heart of Israel. I also think that it is widely understood why the embassy was not relocated to Jerusalem. The reason is that it is provocative, and that negotiations over Jerusalem and the embassy were meant to be the final resolution in a two-state solution and the end part of peace negotiations. To jump the gun was to show that the United States was not a neutral broker in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. I think it was ill-informed, abrupt and not well-thought out.

Q: What was your reaction to the U.S. recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights?

A: That was [also] provocative, but the Golan Heights are part of Israel.

Q: What’s your stance on American taxpayer funding for the Palestinian Authority?

A: We should have funding. Just like Israel provides funding for humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, I think the United States should participate in that. We need to keep our eye on the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, and the peace between a Palestinian state and Israel. If we want that outcome, we need to set up everyone for success. If we have a Palestinian population that is suffering—that cannot build up its own infrastructure, its own education and its ability to function as a state—then we are sabotaging the agreement from the beginning. I think humanitarian aid, education aid and the ability to construct infrastructure is important, as does the State of Israel. They believe that is fundamental to their own national security.

Q: Is there the concern that humanitarian funding for the P.A. could go towards rewarding terrorists and their families?

A: There’s always concern.

Q: What was your reaction to the resolution condemning anti-Semitism and other forms of hatred, as well as critics who say it was watered down?

A: I’m signing onto [Congressman] Brad Schneider’s resolution opposing the BDS movement. I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment in that resolution: That it is inappropriate; it is unfairly targeting Israel.

Q: What’s your reaction to the anti-BDS component of the Senate bill that would also strengthen the U.S. relationship with Israel and Jordan, in addition to enacting fresh sanctions against Syria?

A: I didn’t have to consider the Senate bill. In terms of the BDS part, it was somewhat convoluted. But I am opposed to BDS because it unfairly targets Israel, and it singles Israel out for special pejorative treatment that no other country is subjected to.

Q: How do you feel about the latest waves of anti-Semitism at home and abroad?

A: It’s horrifying. What we’re seeing is in the context of a general trend around the globe towards nationalism, white supremacism and anti-Semitism. It is always concerning. We’ve seen xenophobia and Islamophobia in this country. We ought to be concerned even when the hatred is not directed towards the Jewish people. We are the canary in the coal mine, and it always comes to us next, so that should inform our decisions about compassion for the stranger and our homeland.

Q: Is there anything else our readers should know about you?

A: The only other thing I would add is that a lot of the reason I’m here in Congress is because I’m a Jewish woman, and that you grow up with an ethic of tikkun olam. That when something is wrong in the world, it is your job to make it a better place. I saw some really big wrongs in our country: taking health care away from people, xenophobia, Islamophobia, racism. I decided that if I didn’t roll up my sleeves to help get our country headed in a better direction, then I couldn’t expect anyone else to.","Jewish Democrat Kim Schrier counters critics, defends party‘s ‘unequivocal‘ support for Israel",JNS,https://www.jns.org/jewish-democrat-kim-schrier-counters-critics-defends-her-partys-unequivocal-support-for-israel/

Think Progress, that neoliberal vehicle of the Democratic party leadership, is now making lists of those it claims are enablers of Russian propaganda or election interference and may even ...","Katie Halper interviews Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone and Aaron Maté of The Nation about how much of the mainstream media glommed onto the Trump-Russia collusion story, predictably called ‘Russiagate’, for so long to the exclusion of many other important stories, and left themselves wide open to the kind of blowback that they are now experiencing because of the Mueller report seemingly saying (at least as far as the released short summary goes) that there was no such collusion. The entire interview is well worth reading but here are a few excerpts. (MT refers to Taibbi, AM to Maté, and KH to Halper.)



MT: In March 2017, I wrote an article saying this story is a minefield for the Democratic Party and particularly for journalists, because Trump had made it such an important part of his message that journalists were out to get him, that they were representatives of the elite who would stop at nothing to undermine this presidency. And to me it seemed the only way we could possibly lose with the public in a contest with someone like Trump is if we completely abdicated the standards of the profession and did what he accused us of doing, which would be politicizing our jobs and using trumped-up evidence to try to make him look bad. That was the one option out of an infinite number of ways we could have pursued covering his presidency. That was the one thing that could have really helped him. And we did it. Not only did we do it, but we did it, basically, to the exclusion of everything else, for years.

KH: What were some of the important stories the public was deprived of?

AM: Literally everything. I remember watching Rachel Maddow the day that Congress had taken a huge step forward toward taking away the health insurance of millions of Americans. I think she gave it around 30 seconds and then moved onto some element of the conspiracy theory that ended up being debunked. MNSBC didn’t mention Yemen for I think about a year.

KH: Where in Russia is Yemen?

AM: At a time when the U.S. was taking part in a genocide and killing tens of thousands of people through the Saudi bombing campaign and the famine that that campaign was causing. And one of the most crucial things it ignored was the serious escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Russia that Trump was overseeing through carrying out policies that were far more hawkish than Obama, which we haven’t focused on, partly because they’re supported by the bipartisan foreign consensus in Washington, which the media generally goes along with, but also because to acknowledge those policies, to look at them seriously, would undercut this idea that everybody bought into that Trump was doing Putin’s bidding.

MT: There was a very telling story for me. Every year the Pentagon is responsible, under each year’s National Defense Authorization, to submit a memo that’s usually not made public on which countries we have active combat operations in. And I believe it was in early 2017 that they released one that said we had active operations in seven countries. So I did a little story basically saying, hey does anybody notice we’re at war in Niger and Somalia and Yemen and Syria and Afghanistan? Just the idea that we’ve started new military campaigns, and that this can fly completely under the radar with the public because of the Russiagate story, just speaks to the enormity of the story and how much oxygen it took up. It took up everything. We didn’t have time for anything else.

…

AM: [The media] imagine no endgame. This whole thing is incoherent. They were accusing Trump of doing Putin’s bidding while he consistently does the opposite: tries to overthrow Putin’s ally in Venezuela; bombs Putin’s ally in Syria twice; pulls out of the [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces] Treaty, basically setting off a whole new nuclear arms race. So basically, the actual endgame in real life is existential peril, because we are risking nuclear accidents and the threat of war based on these hawkish policies. But that doesn’t matter to those who profited off of the Russiagate narrative, like the failed neoliberal, Democratic elites, who needed an excuse to cover for the fact that they lost to Donald Trump; FBI intelligence officials who opened up this investigation on very specious grounds and who suspected Trump, in part, because he was saying nice things about Vladimir Putin. And whether you agree with that or not, to lay that as a predicate for a counterintelligence investigation is just extraordinary. Then there was the media, which, of course, got a lot of ratings and clicks by spinning this spy thriller.

MT: I think there was an element of Russiagate, and still is, that does have a logic to it. it’s a very dark logic. If you saw what happened in 2016, the political situation was that the ruling neoliberal consensus was under fire from all sides, from radical right movements both in the United States and in Europe; from leftist movements, both in the United States and Europe. The overwhelming voter sentiment everywhere had to do with the rejection of the international global consensus. You saw votes like Brexit, a complete repudiation of a number of things. But Russiagate as a political solution, as a response to that electoral phenomenon, has been extraordinarily effective. Because what it’s done is it’s completely changed the attitude of a huge portion of the population, which now sees the international security services, the global consensus, as the only saviors who are going to rescue them from the evil Trump. And therefore, we have to pursue this case and celebrate authoritarianism and celebrate the FBI and CIA and their heroism, and the European Union and NATO. This story has had some benefit from a propaganda perspective as well.

KH: So, is the idea that the intelligence community will act as the adults in the room and stop Trump from getting his finger on the button?

AM: Well, that was part of this narrative—that we’re supposed to revere and trust in these intelligence officials, forgetting their actual record, which includes giving us one of the biggest crimes in recent memory—the Iraq War. They’re the ones who spun the phony intel about [weapons of mass destruction]. And also promoting this notion that fundamentally undermines the idea of democratic government, where it’s the elected president, whether you like that person or not, who’s supposed to make the decision, not unelected intelligence bureaucrats.

…

AM: This didn’t start in 2016. Russophobia is in the bloodstream of American political culture. For decades, it’s been the Russians invading us and manipulating us and turning our young people into dupes, planting propaganda in our heads. That’s why this Russiagate thing could not have happened with any other country. There’s a reason we don’t hear about “Israelgate” or “Saudigate”. It survives on this very entrenched Cold War mindset that way predates 2016.",Russiagate and the new Red Scare,Pharyngula,https://freethoughtblogs.com/singham/2019/04/02/russiagate-and-the-new-red-scare/

Green New Deal Opponents Score 24 Times More Campaign Cash From Big Oil Companies

The average congressional opponent of the Green New Deal has received 24 times more campaign cash from the nation’s largest oil and gas companies than sponsors of the climate change resolution, according to a MapLight analysis.

The resolution, introduced on Feb. 7 by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., urges lawmakers to begin outlining the best options for reshaping the nation’s $20.7 trillion economy to mitigate climate change. Scientists believe humans have fewer than a dozen years to limit the production of greenhouse gases or to begin facing droughts, floods, extreme heat waves, and economic misery for millions of people.



The 90 House sponsors have received a total of $37,175 in campaign donations -- an average of $413 each -- from the 10 largest publicly traded U.S. oil and gas companies since 2017. Meanwhile, the 344 opponents of the resolution cumulatively received 91 times more money. The opponents, who include all 197 House Republicans and 145 Democrats, took almost $3.4 million from the energy companies, an average of $9,876 per lawmaker.

The donations highlight the existential stakes for the fossil fuel industry in the debate over the Green New Deal. One of the centerpieces of the broad measure calls upon Congress to curb the effects of climate change by creating a plan for a net carbon-neutral economy within the next decade.



The 10 companies, which have a combined market capitalization topping $900 billion, and their employees have given money to 235 current House members since 2017, with GOP members opposing the Green New Deal accounting for two-thirds of the recipients. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., received the most of any lawmaker, reporting $90,350 in contributions from the energy giants. Nine of the 10 biggest recipients of campaign money from the oil and gas companies are Republicans.

ExxonMobil, the Irving, Texas-based descendant of the Standard Oil Co. that’s become the largest publicly traded energy company in the world, gave the most donations of any oil and gas company, contributing more than $848,000 to House members since 2017. Only $8,400 -- less than 1 percent -- of the ExxonMobil contributions went to Green New Deal sponsors.



The House hasn’t voted on the resolution yet, although Republican lawmakers are pushing for a vote in hopes of embarrassing the Democratic majority by painting the resolution as a job-killing exercise in Stalinesque socialism that will make hamburgers and pickup trucks illegal. Despite the Republican attacks, a February Wall Street Journal poll found almost two-thirds of American adults believe the GOP’s position on climate change is outside the mainstream.



A similar tactic last week by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., resulted in a 57-0 vote against the resolution. Three Democrats and Sen. Angus King, I-Me., voted with the Senate’s 53 Republicans. The remaining Democrats voted “present” to avoid highlighting differences within the party over the proposal, including six current senators who are running for the Democratic nomination for president and who are cosponsoring the resolution.

172,World,2019-04-04T06:11:00.0000000Z,"On Tuesday evening, she abandoned her strategy of making Brexit a project of her Conservative Party and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists ... or silence – will be a guide as to whether her new strategy can survive. The prime minister’s appeal ...","Shortly after midday Wednesday, Theresa May will have a good idea whether her attempt to save her Brexit deal has any chance of success.

On Tuesday evening, she abandoned her strategy of making Brexit a project of her Conservative Party and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists, apparently accepting that this will never gather enough votes to get through Parliament, and asked Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, to rescue her.

At noon, the pair will face each other across the House of Commons, for her weekly Prime Minster’s Questions session. His approach, and her response, will offer a clue as to how their talks about a joint Brexit approach are going to go.

But only some of May’s enemies will be facing her. Behind her on the Conservative benches will be plenty more opponents. Their anger – or silence – will be a guide as to whether her new strategy can survive.

The prime minister’s appeal to Corbyn opens the door to the possibility of a much softer form of Brexit, potentially keeping the UK inside the EU’s customs union. It would be a massive breach of May’s own negotiating red lines, but good news for business. The pound rose.

Corbyn welcomed May’s move and said he would be “very happy” to meet her, and the first response from the EU side was positive. No schedule for discussions has been announced, but May’s office said she wanted to move fast, so it’s likely the pair will sit down in private after their public face-off.

After seven hours of talks with her cabinet ministers, the premier said the UK will need an extra delay beyond next week’s potential cliff-edge deadline of April 12 to resolve the crisis.

“This debate, this division, cannot drag on much longer,” May said in a statement to television cameras at her 10 Downing Street office. “It requires national unity to deliver the national interest.”

The prime minister’s offer to Corbyn is another sign of the desperation and disarray that has overtaken her government as it struggles to complete Britain’s acrimonious separation from the EU. Parliament has rejected the deal she negotiated with the bloc three times, with Corbyn’s Labour consistently voting against it. She has tried cross-party talks before, but they led nowhere.

The offer outraged some Tories. One member of Parliament, Henry Smith, called it a “betrayal”. Another, Marcus Fysh, accused May of “fear and vacillation”. Meanwhile, May’s coalition partners, the DUP, described May’s handling of Brexit as “lamentable”.

McAdams, the executive director of the county Democratic Party, said Noreiko offered to help him with the transition. “I told her it was never about her, it was about the city and ...","DeKALB – City Manager Bill Nicklas said he’s preparing to welcome three new faces onto the City Council as part of a wave of newcomers elected Tuesday, both in city government and the DeKalb School District 428 Board.

Although the election results will not be final until the vote is canvassed by the county clerk’s office later this month, the unofficial totals make it clear DeKalb voters wanted fresh faces, and they will get them. The newly elected officials will undergo some transitional training before they begin their four-year terms.

Three new faces for city council

Seventh Ward Alderman Tony Faivre easily won a second term in an uncontested race, but the 1st, 3rd and 5th Wards are set to be represented by Carolyn Morris, Tracy D. Smith and Scott McAdams, respectively. This will be the first office held by all three aldermen-elect.

“I’m excited to work with them,” Nicklas said. “They all were supported by their constituents, and have a lot of enthusiasm for serving their wards well, and they’re very interested in the issues of the day.”

Nicklas said the current council has two more meetings before new aldermen will be sworn at the beginning of the May 13 council meeting.

Nicklas also is planning a strategic retreat for the new council, which will likely be a daylong planning meeting to get new council members up to speed on the budget and other items.

Set to exit are longtime 1st Ward Alderman David Jacobson, 5th Ward Alderwoman Kate Noreiko, who served one term, and 3rd Ward Alderwoman Joyce Stupegia, who served the remainder of former Alderman Michael Marquardt’s term, after he resigned in December.

Morris said she already has been in contact with Jacobson, and they held a ward meeting together.

“I was very thankful this was an uncontested race, so I could focus on learning more and really researching [tax increment financing], understanding how I can be useful in this position and be a decent public servant,” Morris said.

Nicklas said he already has meetings set up with the incoming aldermen, including Scott McAdams, who said he also met with Noreiko.

“I was shocked when she dropped out,” McAdams said. “We sat down and talked, and the first question she asked me was ‘Why did you run against me?’ and I said ‘Well, you know it’s important to have opponents and not have these uncontested races, because they don’t feel very democratic.’ ”

McAdams, the executive director of the county Democratic Party, said Noreiko offered to help him with the transition.

“I told her it was never about her, it was about the city and finances,” McAdams said. “I feel really good about what’s coming up, I have a good grasp on the issues. The ward has been extraordinarily open, so that’s good, because I need to know what they want me to do.”

Tracy Smith, a retired DeKalb police officer who spent 31 years on the force, is already using his experience to his advantage.

“I’ve looked at the budget,” Smith said. “I think I have a little bit of an advantage, because I worked in that environment for 31 years.

“I think it will be a really smooth process for me, because you have to talk to people and that’s what I’ve always done. They know who I am.”

DeKalb School District 428 Board

According to the Illinois State Board of Education, newly elected school district board members will be sworn into office within 30 days of the election.

That means the group of board member-elects – all new faces holding public office for the first time – will be sworn in by April 30.

Sarah Moses, Samantha McDavid, David Seymour, and Jeromy Olson will undergo board certification before the swearing-in, District 428 Superintendent Jamie Craven said.

“The Illinois Association of School Boards has some mandated training that any school board member must go through,” Craven said. “Part of that is the Open Meetings Act training, and a four-hour professional development and leadership training course.”

Olson currently serves on the Finance Advisory Committee for the board, and the other board members-elect have talked about attending board meetings in preparation.

Craven said at the special board meeting planned for April 30, a new board president, vice president and secretary will also be chosen.

“School business is different than other municipalities and there is that transition period,” Craven said. “But myself and my staff will do our best to acclimate new board members to how we run meetings, how we present materials, and try to keep the board in an informed position.”",Transition time for seven new faces holding public office for the first time in DeKalb,Daily Chronicle,https://www.daily-chronicle.com/2019/04/03/transition-time-for-seven-new-faces-holding-public-office-for-the-first-time-in-dekalb/ajosn5q/

A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi on Wednesday said it will hear the pleas challenging the validity of the Centre's decision on issuance of electoral bonds for political funding on April 5.

It told advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for one of the petitioners, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), an NGO, that the matter would be heard by an appropriate bench on Friday.

In its affidavit, the Centre has said the electoral bonds ""attempt at bringing greater transparency, ensuring KYC compliance and keeping an audit trail in comparison to the earlier opaque system of cash donations.""

""Accordingly, the concern of the Election Commission of India that electoral bonds will enable foreign companies to influence Indian policies is without any legal or factual merit,"" it said.

The government said there was unregulated flow of black money under the old system and ""the unaccounted-for monies received by political parties were also spent without being accounted for, thus creating/enabling a parallel economy, as it were, through the use of unaccounted for cash"".

""It is submitted that contrary to the concerns raised by the Election Commission of India, the amendments in the respective legislatures have been made and the Electoral Bond Scheme has been introduced, as a pioneer step in bringing electoral reforms, to ensure that the spirit of transparency and accountability in political funding is maintained,"" it said.

The affidavit said that considering the need to impart greater accountability in funding of political parties as well as to maintain the anonymity of the donor, a mechanism of political funding by way of electoral bonds was introduced.

""Under the present system, electoral bonds can be issued only by an authorized bank, being the State Bank of India. All payments made for the issuance of the electoral bonds are accepted only by means of a demand draft, cheque or through the Electronic Clearing System or direct debit to the buyers' account. No black money can, therefore, be used for the purchase of these bonds,"" it said.

The government said under the new system, the political party must now disclose the receipt of money through electoral bonds and must account for the same.

""The Electoral Bonds is a positive step in the right direction to ensure accountability and transparency in conducting elections. The need to bring about such a change was felt as the measures that existed on the book were either not enough or were proving to be ineffective/insufficient in dealing with the menace of corruption in Elections,"" it said.","A pioneer step in poll reforms, Centre says on electoral bonds",Yahoo!

The biggest standing ovation from the Liberal caucus during Tuesday evening’s SNC-Lavalin drama came when the prime minister wrapped up his speech with a pledge to protect Canadian jobs — under any circumstances.

And it’s also short-sighted, because Canada’s global Boy Scout reputation — offering stability and solid respect for institutions — is central to the country’s ability to attract investment and, by extension, jobs.

It’s one thing to stand up for jobs and growth. It’s quite another to unapologetically push the limits of the rule of law to do so.

The context is important here. One of those former ministers, Jody Wilson-Raybould, resigned from cabinet because she felt Trudeau inappropriately interfered in the administration of justice in order to ease the way for SNC-Lavalin — an employer of 9,000 people in Canada — through charges of fraud and corruption.

Branding is everything in the global competition to lure investment, as the federal Liberals know perfectly well.

The Trudeau government created Invest in Canada to showcase the country’s strengths and smooth the way for investors. On its website, our reputation is right there on the home page as a key reason why foreign firms should make Canada a destination: “#1 Most Reputable among G7 countries,” it says.

Early in their mandate, when they sought and then implemented outside advice on how to enhance economic growth in Canada, highlighting the country’s reputation to foreign investors was front and centre.

Trudeau himself has personified the branding effort. His progressive agenda caught the world’s attention when he was first elected, and he quickly sought to turn that adulation into investment deals, often meeting CEOs face to face.

Government officials spend a great deal of time and effort negotiating foreign investment protection agreements with other countries; they want to ensure that when Canadian firms venture into their territories, they are treated with respect and the rule of law. Those countries expect the same here.

And when Canada ran into diplomatic trouble with China last December for detaining Huawei executive Meng Wangzhou, its defence — which it shopped around the world — was that Canada always respects the rule of law.

“Our independent legal system is one of the finest, if not the finest, in the world. I trust it, Canadians should trust it, and our partners around the world should trust it, too,” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in December at a Toronto discussion that focused on the Huawei conflict.

But trust is difficult to market when the former justice minister has alleged political interference in that system, and the prime minister sees nothing wrong with that.

Dan Tisch is CEO of Argyle Public Relationships, a Toronto-based firm that is involved in global studies comparing countries’ reputations — including the one featured on the Invest in Canada website. He says the world ignores most of what goes on in Canada, but is taking note now — to the detriment of Canada’s brand.

Canada has received top marks because it’s a beautiful and friendly place, but also because of its strong governance and stable economy, Tisch says. The SNC-Lavalin controversy obviously doesn’t change the beautiful and friendly part, but it does take aim at Canada’s economic and political reputation. “It’s potentially very serious for Canada because it strikes a blow in two of the three directions,” Tisch said.

So it was no accident that Export Development Canada (EDC), the government’s export financing agency responsible for promoting Canadian business overseas, quickly hired outside counsel to look into allegations in a CBC report that SNC-Lavalin may have paid bribes in a 2011 project in Angola that was partly financed by EDC.

“EDC has strict commitments for responsible business conduct and we would never, under any circumstances, knowingly participate in a transaction tainted by bribery or corruption,” the agency said in a statement. “This behaviour goes against EDC’s core values and deep-rooted culture of business integrity.”

The EDC clearly knows which side its bread is buttered on. Canada’s reputation for upholding the rule of law is primordial to good business.

Freeland seemed prescient — but perhaps went unheeded — last December when she said, “We’re seeing a lot of countries around the world that are starting to play fast and loose with democratic institutions and with rule of law. Canada is not going to be one of those countries. And it’s not always so easy to be a rule-of-law country. But in the fullness of time, we’re always going to be glad that we stick to that.”

By the time Justin Trudeau expelled the troublesome MPs who have shaken his government to its foundations, it was impossible to imagine how they could stay. Jody Wilson-Raybould had stretched her ties to the Liberal party to the limit. And the revelation that she secretly taped a crucial conversation with the Clerk of the Privy Council snapped the bonds of trust that any party, indeed any group of people, need to work together.

She was clearly wrong to do that. It was legal but unethical, especially for someone acting at the time as the government’s chief lawyer. That’s clear enough, and it does the former justice minister and attorney general no credit. Trudeau had no choice but to cauterize the wound inflicted on his party. But if the Liberals truly want to turn the page on the past seven weeks, the last thing they should do at this point is keep harping on any failings exhibited by Wilson-Raybould throughout the SNC-Lavalin saga.

Every time the Liberals have thrown mud her way, it has come back in their face. She and her ally Jane Philpott have shown they aren’t shy about pushing back against attacks. The best way for the Liberals to pump fresh oxygen into the SNC-Lavalin story would be precisely to keep going after them. Trudeau and the Liberals find themselves in a pretty deep hole at this point, and the appropriate advice is to stop digging. The SNC-Lavalin affair isn’t over; the opposition parties will certainly do all they can to keep it alive. But it’s high time for the Liberals to stop picking at the scab and for the government to do all it can to change the focus. This would have obvious short-term political advantages for the Liberals, if they can pull it off. But there are bigger stakes at play as well. We are just six months from a national election and the outcome will be decided, certainly should be decided, on many issues other than debating the fine points of the powers of the attorney general to intervene in SNC-Lavalin’s legal woes and the clashing narratives of Wilson-Raybould and government loyalists. Because there are other matters that deserve a lot more attention than they’ve been getting amidst the daily barrage of scandal news out of Ottawa.

On the day before Trudeau gave Wilson-Raybould and Philpott their walking papers, for example, federal scientists came out with a report saying temperatures across Canada are rising far faster than the world average. The next day, the environment commissioner warned we aren’t doing nearly enough to stop this alarming trend. That’s worth discussing. The Trudeau government has a plan to address it, namely the carbon pricing scheme that kicked in on Monday. It would be useful to compare that with the Conservatives’ plan — if they actually had one.

Some other issues we’d like to see get more air time: the ongoing neglect of Indigenous people; the lack of affordable child care; making sure people can pay for prescription drugs; and the crisis of affordability in our big cities. That’s the short list. In all these areas, the Liberals and Conservatives promise to take the country in fundamentally different directions. That, not Justin Trudeau’s flaws, will be the big question come the federal vote in October. Still, Trudeau’s leadership qualities will inevitably be an issue. The prime minister has done himself a lot of damage over the past seven weeks by failing to come up with a consistent response to Wilson-Raybould’s story. And he made things worse with some pointless own goals — notably his condescending dismissal of an Indigenous protester at a Liberal gathering. Now, with his meddlesome MPs finally out, Trudeau has a chance to start getting past this sorry episode. To do that he and his party will have to look forward, not try to settle scores with their one-time friends.

Imagine it’s mid-February, 2019.

The Globe and Mail has, one week earlier, broken the news that former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould faced pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Evidence and details confirming the allegation are dripping out day by day, but Ms. Wilson-Raybould has not yet appeared before the House of Commons justice committee. The Rubicon has not yet been crossed.

Imagine that, on this day in mid-February, your advisers come to you and say, Prime Minister, this situation will grow into the worst crisis our government has ever faced. We must respond. There are two paths we can follow.

Story continues below advertisement

The first path involves the PM acknowledging error and apologizing. The head of government could say that, although he and his government will always “stand up for Canadian jobs,” he now recognizes that, while claiming to have been pursuing that goal, his officials crossed the line.

Pressure was brought to bear on the attorney-general, violating rules of prosecutorial independence. That should never have happened, because in Canada the rule of law is fundamental. Mistakes were made. But steps will be taken to ensure they never happen again. The government is sorry.

Name the error. Make it right. End the story.

Call it the path of reconciliation – reconciling the Liberal Party with the whistle-blowers within its ranks, and reconciling the executive branch with the rule of law.

Or there’s the second path: Refuse to apologize, refuse to admit error, refuse to acknowledge the clearly visible and spreading spot. But, if you choose that route, within a few weeks you’ll lose two of your most important ministers, your closest adviser and the most senior member of the civil service. A lot of casualties, yet no stanching of the wound.

Which path would you choose?

There is still much that Canadians do not know about the SNC-Lavalin affair. But it is at least clear, beyond any doubt, that the Trudeau government made repeated attempts to influence the attorney-general of Canada into taking the extraordinary step of overriding the independent director of public prosecutions and offering SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement.

Story continues below advertisement

In theory, there are compelling legal arguments in favour of using DPAs to go after alleged corporate wrongdoers. That’s why the option is part of Canadian law.

But in practice, in a real-world case such as that of SNC-Lavalin, decisions regarding the prosecution must be left to prosecutors, or, exceptionally, the attorney-general. If the rule of law means anything, politicians, political staff and even the Prime Minister cannot have a hand in deciding who gets charged and who doesn’t, or who gets a plea agreement and who goes to trial.

It’s hard to overstate how important this is. It’s deeper than the Charter of Rights, and far older. It’s foundational.

The government has tried to make this all about Ms. Wilson-Raybould. All sorts of rumours have been spread about her – that she was difficult to work with; that she recommended a conservative judge for a Supreme Court vacancy; and that, worst of all, she is a politician focused on self-promotion.

Even if all of that were true, it’s not relevant to the real issue, which is how the government got all handsy with the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. It’s not about Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s personality.

The Commons justice committee could have done the government a favour by holding a full round of hearings, getting to the bottom of the matter and delivering a report. Instead, the Liberal majority quickly shut itself down. That was a mistake. It denied the legislative branch of government the opportunity to do what it is supposed to have the power to do, namely oversee the actions of the executive. Instead, government by PMO continues. But that’s doing the PM, and his government, no favours.

And the worst part of this story is that Liberal political miscalculation isn’t the worst part of this story. It’s a sideshow. Each time the government tries to obfuscate the real issue, it not only undermines its own credibility, it waters down principles established long before the Trudeau government came to power.

The PM was addressing the annual meeting of the Daughters of the Vote, a program of the group, Equal Voice. The non-partisan group seeks to encourage more women to run for elected office and on Wednesday, 338 young women, representing every riding in the country were gathered in the House of Commons.

They heard from Kim Campbell, the first woman in Canada to hold the title of prime minister. They heard from the major party leaders of today’s Parliament.

Yet when Justin Trudeau took to the podium, he faced a backlash. Almost 50 young women stood and turned their backs to him, others walked out.

True, some had walked out on Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, but he isn’t the PM. He isn’t the man that has spent years building his image as the male feminist leader.

“We knew we wanted to do something and standing up was kind of what we agreed on,” said Taylor Behn-Tsakoza from the riding of Prince George—Peace River—Northern Rockies in British Columbia.

The turning of backs came the morning after a group of young women from the same organization had recorded a video saying they stood with Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott and denounced Trudeau for his actions.

When Trudeau starts losing the support of young women, Liberals should be worried.

Women, in general, are more likely to vote Liberal; young women in particular are predisposed to the Liberal brand. If he is having young women turn their backs, he is in trouble.

Of course, all of this happened against the backdrop of Trudeau booting Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus.

He declared that trust had been broken and that it was “unconsciounable” that Wilson-Raybould recorded a conversation with the soon-to-be-retired Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick.

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould shot back.

“Trust is a two-way street. It is unconscionable to tread over the independence of the prosecutor, it is unconscionable not to uphold the rule of law,” she said.

Wilson-Raybould made the comments standing outside the House of Commons next to Philpott.

“It’s very unfortunate that it’s come to this but we have to make difficult choices in politics and we aren’t always in control of all of the things that will happen,” Philpott said.

The two women described the last few weeks as an incredibly difficult time.

If Trudeau was honest, he would do the same.

Here is the difference, though.

While Wilson-Raybould and Philpott could run as independents and win, Trudeau will have difficulty retaining power in the October election unless something changes in a major way.

Even before the SNC-Lavalin scandal broke, a scandal about the government using less-than-above-board means to get a well-connected company off of bribery and corruption charges, the Liberals were in trouble.

The Liberals had been relying heavily on support from Atlantic Canada and Quebec. They had watched their support across the prairies evaporate and British Columbia, like Ontario, was a battleground.

Now they have lost support in their safe zones.

Voters in Atlantic Canada and Quebec are looking at the less than sunny ways, the fake feminism and the bullying tactics of Trudeau and finding them wanting.

Typical of our ...","Justin Trudeau could have allowed the Liberal caucus to announce the expulsion of former Liberal cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the party, but no.

Typical of our drama-loving, selfie-adoring, photo-bombing prime minister, who always wants to preen at the centre of the spotlight — even when that spotlight is burning a hole into what’s left of his credibility — Trudeau had to make it all about himself.

Complete with his patented “sincere” looks into the camera, rising and falling voice pitch, dramatic pauses for emphasis, world-weary sighs and half-smiles, as he addressed the Liberal caucus in announcing the expulsion of the two former ministers, while posing as the guardian of Liberal ethics.

And so, in some of the most breathtaking minutes of political hypocrisy you will ever see or hear in Canadian politics, Trudeau announced Wilson-Raybould’s and Philpott’s expulsion for violating — insert laughter here — Trudeau’s ethical standards, portraying himself as the innocent, truth-telling, honest broker in the Lavscam scandal.

“Since the beginning, I have approached this situation with patience and understanding,” Trudeau said in praise of himself. “My rationale has been that real change is hard. And so it requires patience and it requires understanding. But being a member of caucus comes with both rights and responsibilities. A team has to trust each other. And with Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, that trust has been broken.”

While Trudeau never got around to specifically explaining why Philpott was expelled, he said Wilson-Raybould was being excommunicated for her “unconscionable” secret recording of her Dec. 19, 2018 phone call with former privy council clerk Michael Wernick.

“Unconscionable”, even though all that recording confirmed was the accuracy of what Wilson-Raybould testified to in public hearings into Lavscam before the justice committee, prior to the Liberals using their majority to shut it down.

This from Trudeau, who misled the Canadian people when he described as “false” the original Globe and Mail story on Feb. 7, that revealed how Wilson-Raybould, as attorney-general, had been pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to give a sweetheart prosecution deal to Quebec engineering and construction giant, SNC-Lavalin.

This from the prime minister who immediately tried, deceitfully, to muddy the waters by repeating, ad nauseam, at that first media scrum on Lavscam, that no one in the PMO “directed” Wilson-Raybould to grant SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement, so it could avoid prosecution on criminal charges of bribery and fraud.

Except the Globe story didn’t say she was directed by the PMO. It said, accurately, she was pressured.

That Trudeau announced Wilson-Raybould’s expulsion from the Liberal caucus because she did not meet his ethical standards is rich.

Coming, as it does from a prime minister who was found by then ethics commissioner Mary Dawson to have violated four sections of the Conflict of Interest Act arising from his family vacations on the private Bahamas island of the Aga Khan, whose foundation is a recipient of Canadian taxpayers’ money.

Coming as well from a prime minister who says women must be believed in sexual harassment and assault cases, except when a past allegation of groping is made against him, at which point he doesn’t recall any “negative interactions” but that women have the right to experience things differently.

A prime minister who believes “ethics” apply to others, but not him. The Liberals, of course, gave him a standing ovation.",GOLDSTEIN: Who is Trudeau to judge anyone’s ethics?,Toronto Sun,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-who-is-trudeau-to-judge-anyones-ethics

It was a rough start for Trudeau’s efforts to re-establish himself as a feminist and supporter of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

“There’s always going to be a range of opinions we need to listen to,” Trudeau told the women. “But ultimately, diversity … only works if there is trust and within a team when that trust gets broken, we have to figure out how to move forward.”

“It’s actually easy to stand in a place and cross your arms and stand in a place and say, ’I’m not budging from my position because I’m right,”’ he added later. “What is actually more difficult is to look for thoughtful compromise.”

Some of the women, delegates chosen to represent each of the country’s 338 ridings through a program called Daughters of the Vote, were unconvinced. They called him a “fake feminist” and doubted the authenticity of his commitment to reconciling with Indigenous Peoples — sentiments echoed by opposition parties.

“It was like a microcosm of the history of Canada, with a white man telling Indigenous women where they can and cannot be and exercising their power and their privilege over them,” said Riley Yesno, one of the young women brought to Parliament by Equal Voice, a group dedicated to increasing the presence of women in politics.

Yesno, an Anishnaabe University of Toronto student who grew up in Thunder Bay, Ont., called Trudeau’s treatment of Wilson-Raybould “colonial violence” and further dubbed him a “fake feminist.” While she doesn’t necessarily believe he has “malicious intent” towards women, she said the expulsions of the former ministers “extremely negatively affect women” and “impact matters more than intention.”

Many of the same women walked out of the Commons altogether when Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer addressed them. Yesno said that was done deliberately, so their protest against Trudeau couldn’t be used as ammunition by the official Opposition.

However, Trudeau got some unexpected support from Philpott, who spoke a short time later, alongside Wilson-Raybould, outside the Commons.

Asked about the prime minister’s feminist credentials, Philpott said: “I wish him the best. I wish him the opportunity to continue his good work.”

Trudeau informed the two former ministers Tuesday that he won’t allow them to seek re-election as Liberal candidates this fall. Both said Wednesday it’s too soon to say whether their careers in politics are finished or whether they might run as independents or for another party.

“I would like to think that there may be steps, that I could continue in a political role somehow but I don’t know what that will be,” said Philpott, speaking alongside Wilson-Raybould. “It’s too early to say.”

“I need to take some time to reflect,” said Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould believes she was moved out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. She has testified that she faced relentless pressure last fall from Trudeau, his office, the top public servant and others to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided not to invite the Montreal engineering giant to negotiate a remediation agreement, a kind of plea bargain.

Wilson-Raybould quit the cabinet in mid-February and Philpott followed a few weeks later, saying she had lost confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

The revelation last week that Wilson-Raybould had surreptitiously recorded a phone conversation with Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council, to bolster her contention of undue pressure was the last straw for Liberal MPs, who openly called on Trudeau to expel the former ministers. On Tuesday, Trudeau called the secret recording “unconscionable,” proof that the ex-minister could no longer be trusted.

“Trust is a two-way street,” Wilson-Raybould shot back Wednesday. “It is unconscionable not to uphold the rule of law.”

Neither Philpott nor Wilson-Raybould expressed regret for standing up for what they believed was right.

“You have to be able to hold your head high and look at yourself in the mirror at the end of the day and say that the choices you made were the best ones under the circumstances,” said Philpott.

In the Commons during question period, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the whole episode demonstrates that “speaking truth to power” disqualifies strong women from inclusion in the Liberal party.

Trudeau said he’ll take no lessons from the Conservatives on feminism, noting that he still has “18 strong women members of cabinet who lead every day on the big issues that matter to Canadians.”

Trudeau ended the day at a meeting with Natan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and several other Inuit leaders and federal cabinet ministers, for a meeting of the Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee, formed two years ago to improve the relationship. He promised to continue a path towards reconciliation on issues such as education, suicide prevention, and climate change.",Young would-be MPs turn backs on Trudeau over SNC-Lavalin scandal,Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/national/young-would-be-mps-turn-backs-on-trudeau-over-snc-lavalin-scandal

One by one, more than 40 of them rose from their seats to turn their backs on him.

The silent protest just after noon on Wednesday came during Trudeau’s first public appearance after expelling former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould, who accused him of trying to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of Montreal construction firm SNC-Lavalin, and Jane Philpott, who resigned in solidarity with her, from his Liberal caucus on Tuesday evening.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, locked out of the regular weekly caucus meeting Wednesday morning, visited the House of Commons gallery and sat to listen statements by some of the Daughters of the Vote delegates — 338 women, aged 18 to 23, chosen by the Equal Voice organization to represent all of Canada’s ridings for a day on Parliament Hill.

The two sat with Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who quit the Liberal caucus in the wake of reporting on SNC-Lavalin. She snapped her fingers sometimes in agreement with the young women’s pronouncements. All three gave standing ovations for statements on issues including climate change, Indigenous suicide, accessibility and religious freedom, along with the rest of the room, which brimmed with loud enthusiasm for each speaker.

Ducking out to speak with reporters, neither Wilson-Raybould nor Philpott would address the elephant in the room — that here were young women being encouraged to speak up when Wilson-Raybould’s whistle-blowing is what ultimately led to their excommunication from caucus. Caesar-Chavannes told the National Post “we needed that little boost today,” though. “We are in the gallery watching, having, we hope, made a mark on the 42nd Parliament. And here are young women in those seats saying, ‘yeah, we are going to continue this,’” she said.

When he finally arrived, Trudeau, the self-proclaimed feminist and “minister of youth,” would face more than one rebuke from the young women in front of him. And he was not alone — dozens of them walked out on Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer while he spoke, because of a distaste for his policies. Upon their return, the women, including a majority of those who wore a hijab, got as much applause as Scheer had for his short speech.

During a question-and-answer session with Trudeau, Indigenous Nova Scotia delegate Hannah Martin, facing him, declared the Liberal government was perpetrating violence with its inaction on Indigenous issues. “You cannot be a feminist if you are allowing corporations to rape the land, because as Indigenous peoples, that is our mother,” she said. He thanked her for her “strong voice.”

Other delegates, talking in a buzz outside the Commons after the event, accused Trudeau of failing Indigenous people and women both by expelling Wilson-Raybould, who was the first Indigenous attorney general. “It was like a microcosm of the history of Canada, white men telling Indigenous women where they can or cannot be and exercising power,” said Riley Yesno, from Toronto.

“I don’t believe Justin Trudeau is a feminist,” said Brit Sippola, from Saskatchewan, recalling a section of his opening statement when he said nobody in the room would want to have to “pick who to believe between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Chrystia Freeland” or “know that one person has to be right and one person has to be wrong between Jane Philpott or Maryam Monsef.” The prime minister was deflecting attention away from his own mistakes by saying it was “Jane’s word versus Maryam’s,” Sippola said. “He’s the one who’s pitting women against women here.”

Other cabinet ministers were marching out in the early afternoon to say that the decision to remove Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had had nothing to do with feminism. Politicians had breached the trust of their colleagues. They hadn’t been team players. Loyalty wasn’t a gender issue, full stop.

But Trudeau’s long day of defending himself was nowhere near over.

During question period, he stood up again and again to answer all of the opposition’s questions, accusing him of fake feminism, calling him a coward and demanding his resignation over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He was interrogated on details in the testimony and evidence that Wilson-Raybould had provided to the House justice committee’s perfunctory study of the affair. For the first time, after weeks of being grilled day in and day out, Trudeau admitted that yes, Wilson-Raybould had asked him, during a September meeting, if he was trying to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution. He said he told her no.

But that wasn’t good enough for Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who would go on later Wednesday to continue a multi-day, marathon filibuster over the issue. He pointed out that in Trudeau’s earlier statements nobody had raised any concerns with him about interference.

“Now the prime minister has caught himself in a trap of his own making,” he said.

“The member opposite is twisting himself into rhetorical knots to try to make a point that is simply not there,” Trudeau responded.

New Democrats seized upon the Daughters of the Vote protest as a symbolic repudiation of Trudeau’s credentials as a feminist prime minister. “What have they seen this week? They have seen women speak truth to power and then get shown the door,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said.

Trudeau told an emergency meeting of legislators on Tuesday that former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott had undermined the party and betrayed its trust.

The almost two-month old scandal centered on Wilson-Raybould, who in February said officials had inappropriately pressured her while she was justice minister to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc would escape a corruption trial.

In recent weeks, senior party figures and lawmakers had grown frustrated with Trudeau’s handling of the crisis, especially since both former ministers remained in the caucus despite their open hostility.

A long list of ministers and Liberal parliamentarians echoed Trudeau’s emphasis on party unity on Wednesday, but the opposition reiterated that the expulsions were proof of a cover up.

It is too soon to say whether Trudeau’s problems are over, political analysts said.

“This scandal has blotted out the sun. Now the question is, did he kill it?” said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker. Last week Ipsos put the Conservative Party 10 points ahead of the Liberals, thanks to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

“This issue has taken Trudeau into a territory where he could really lose,” Bricker said, adding that while the prime minister had now shored up his standing as party leader, he still must win back public opinion.

But another pollster, Frank Graves at Ekos, said there were signs the damage had been limited and that there was fatigue over the issue among the general public. Ekos polls showed the Liberals had lost 3-4 percentage points during the scandal.

“But the numbers we are seeing now are same as they were before,” Graves said.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, who quit as minister because she disagreed with how the SNC Lavalin affair was being managed, stood side-by-side while speaking to reporters on Wednesday.

They said they had defended the independence of the judiciary and had no regrets, but they stopped short of attacking Trudeau head on or threatening legal recourse.

The affair has hurt the prime minister’s image as a self-avowed feminist and a leader who has taken to heart the cause of Canada’s indigenous population.

He recruited candidates such as Wilson-Raybould, who was named as the first indigenous justice minister, and Philpott in part because they were new to politics.

During a special event in parliament aimed at encouraging more women to get involved in politics, some of the attendees turned their backs on Trudeau as he spoke, prompting several of his Cabinet ministers to come to his defense.

“We have a strong prime minister that is a feminist,” Tourism Minister Melanie Joly told reporters.

“I would argue that loyalty and feminism are two different things. There’s no male or female definition of loyalty. Either you want to work in a team, or you don’t.”","Embattled Trudeau buoyed by party, could still face wrath of Canadian voters",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1RF2GL-OCADN

Dozens of the 338 delegates, representing every riding in Canada, turned their backs on Trudeau as he delivered his opening remarks — just hours after he expelled two women from his Liberal caucus.

Trudeau raised the matter right off the top, insisting there will always be disagreements in politics.

""There was never going to be an absolute one side or another. There are always going to be multiple voices we have to listen to,"" he said.

Trudeau was grilled on a range of topics, from halting the spread of white nationalism to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.

The young women are in town for the annual Daughters of the Vote summit, an event organized by Equal Voice Canada which works to get more women elected to all levels of political office across Canada.

A number of participants also walked out during a speech by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.

This year's Daughters of the Vote day lands less than 24 hours after Trudeau expelled Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus, saying that trust with the two former cabinet ministers has been irreparably broken.

This political drama has been unfolding since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould had faced inappropriate political pressure on the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution decision. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott both later resigned from cabinet to protest the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

Trudeau said Tuesday he approached the issue with ""patience and understanding"" but eventually concluded the two MPs could not remain in the caucus.

A number of participants in today's event already have tweeted their support for the two women.

""We are here in Ottawa as young women participating in a conference and we wholeheartedly condemn you ejecting Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from caucus,"" tweeted Deanna Allain, representing the riding of Hamilton Mountain.

""Respect the integrity of women and indigenous leaders in politics. Do better.""

Without mentioning Philpott or Wilson-Raybould by name, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh gave a nod to the scandal in his speech to the crowd.

""If anyone ever suggests that you're being difficult by speaking truth to power, you're not being difficult, you're being courageous,"" he said to thunderous applause.

""Being a team player doesn't mean following the team, it means being willing to lose it all, because of your principles and your values and having the courage to do that.""

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were spotted in the House of Commons's gallery for the start of the Daughters of the Vote speeches, which included an address by former prime minister Kim Campbell.

""It was an extraordinary experience to be in there and to hear these women speak,"" said Philpott.

""I want to salute all of the leaders who are in the room today who spoke and the Daughters of the Vote organization for choosing just such an incredible array of bright women who are speaking on some of the most important topics of our country. I was deeply moved by their passion, their enthusiasm and the wisdom that was displayed.""","Trudeau takes tough questions from young women in House after expelling Wilson-Raybould, Philpott",Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trudeau-takes-tough-questions-young-144422155.html

In private meetings Tuesday afternoon, Trudeau told the two they would be removed. The prime minister then invited media into what would normally have been a closed caucus meeting to announce the move publicly in front of a crowd of cheering Liberal MPs.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told the room. “Whether it’s taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.”

I have just been informed by the Prime Minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election. More to come… — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

Trudeau reserved particular scorn for Wilson-Raybould’s act of covertly recording a phone call with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, calling it “unconscionable.” Wilson-Raybould has said she made the extraordinary decision to record the call because she had been subjected to a lengthy campaign of political pressure to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, and wanted an “exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She submitted the recording to the Commons justice committee last week.

In his speech, Trudeau said he had tried to show “patience and understanding” with the complaints of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, but had to eject them because being in caucus comes with “rights and responsibilities.”

He pointed to the history of Liberal Party infighting, and said he had made a commitment to change that. “Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them,” he said. “Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided. We can’t afford to make that mistake. Canadians are counting on us.”

In the latter half of the speech, Trudeau pivoted to themes he plans to campaign on — such as attacking the Conservative Party over its stance on carbon pricing and climate change.

Following Trudeau’s speech, Wilson-Raybould posted on Twitter that she has no regrets, and “spoke the truth as I will continue to do.”

“What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party,” she said. She said she will take some time and talk to her supporters about what comes next.

In her own statement, Philpott lamented that she had been ejected without having a chance to address caucus, and said it is “profoundly disheartening for me, my staff and my family.”

She said the attacks on her and Wilson-Raybould have been based on “inaccuracies and falsehoods.”

“Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould’s credibility and attempt to blame her,” Philpott’s statement said.

“This isn’t about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty — in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence — but to no avail.”

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called the ejection of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott a “betrayal of justice.”

“The message they have sent today is clear: If you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party of Canada,” he said. “Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them.”

Liberals who spoke to the media after the caucus meeting said they supported Trudeau’s move. “I think that what was revealed on Friday in terms of the tape really crossed a line with most of us,” said Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett. She said smaller groups of Liberals had already discussed the matter. “I think last night at women’s caucus, today in Ontario caucus, there was a consensus that there was no trust, there was a breakdown of trust.”

Nate Erskine-Smith, a Liberal MP who has often argued for keeping diverse views in caucus, declined to speak to media after the meeting.

Earlier on Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould had sent a scathing letter to her Liberal caucus colleagues that said their choice on whether to remove her would reveal the values of the party.

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated,” said her letter, dated Apr. 2. “And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to.”

Wilson-Raybould said she acted as she did on the SNC-Lavalin file because she was trying to “protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

She has given evidence to the Commons justice committee that there was a sustained campaign by senior government officials during the fall of 2018 to pressure her into ordering a deferred prosecution for SNC-Lavalin — pressure that she resisted, warning it violated the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened,” her letter to caucus said.

Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of

In one section of her letter, Wilson-Raybould appeared to be addressing recent comments from some Liberal MPs that have attacked her motives. Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, for example, has suggested she was trying to “entrap” Wernick when she recorded their conversation.

“Growing up as an Indigenous person in this country, I learned long ago the lesson that people believing what they wish about you does not, and cannot ever, make it the truth — rather than letting authority be the truth, let the truth be the authority,” the letter said. “Indeed, if I had succumbed to interpreting the beliefs of other to be the truth, I never would have been able to push forward in the face of racism and misogyny that far too many Indigenous women, and others, still experience every day.”

Wilson-Raybould said in the letter she still intended to stand as the Liberal candidate in the 2019 election. But in acknowledgement of the movement to eject her, she laid out a challenge.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up,” her letter said.

Tuesday also saw the release of additional evidence tabled at the Commons justice committee consisting of text messages between Wilson-Raybould and Gerald Butts, the former top aide to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Butts resigned over the controversy on Feb. 18.

Among the messages are exchanges between Wilson-Raybould and Butts after she was told on Jan. 7 she would be removed as justice minister and attorney general. The texts show an argument that evolved and grew increasingly hostile as the announcement of the cabinet shuffle drew near.

At first, Wilson-Raybould — who was on vacation in Bali at the time — protested the move over what it signalled for Indigenous Canadians.

“Timing of ‘pushing’ me out (which will be the perception — whether true or not) is terrible,” she wrote on Jan 8. “It will be confounding and perplexing to people. This is not about me — believe me when I say this — but this is about an approach to Indigenous Peoples…This situation is only going to deepen and I am very worried about it. I am getting texts/emails from indig leaders and B.C. etc.”

“Nobody is ‘pushing you out,’” Butts responded. “In fact, the PM has taken the extraordinary (in my experience unique) step of offering an alternative cabinet post to you.” The reference is to Wilson-Raybould turning down Trudeau’s first offer of the Indigenous services portfolio, saying she couldn’t take it given she’d spent her life opposing the Indian Act. She was made veterans affairs minister instead.

By Jan. 12, Wilson-Raybould was strongly implying she was being moved because of the SNC-Lavalin issue, though the texts don’t explicitly say so.

“For what it is worth, I feel compelled to say — one last time — that what is being proposed is a mistake — irrespective of where I am going. There is no way to fully explain this…My eyes are wide open on this shift,” she texted.

“What I know — as you must — is that there is a robust and proud record of what our government has done — through my work and that of the (Department of Justice)…I stand behind this hard work and all of my decisions and legal advice.”

Butts again defended the move. “I know this is tough but we have very good ideas to make it all work from a comms perspective,” he texted. “There’s an opportunity here for you to show people a side of yourself and your talent that you did not get as (minister of justice and attorney general).”

But Wilson-Raybould was unmoved, and accused Butts of wanting to staff the justice minister’s office with PMO aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques — both of whom had been pushing Wilson-Raybould’s office to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution. (Both Bouchard and Marques have remained in the PMO.)

“As to the ‘very good ideas’ you guys might want to consider sharing them with me,” she said. “But know I will be prepared for tomorrow. And I know why this is happening.”

The cabinet shuffle was announced on Jan. 14.

Typical of our drama-loving, selfie-adoring, photo-bombing prime minister, who always wants to preen at the centre of the spotlight — even when that spotlight is burning a hole into what’s left of his credibility — Trudeau had to make it all about himself.

Complete with his patented “sincere” looks into the camera, rising and falling voice pitch, dramatic pauses for emphasis, world-weary sighs and half-smiles, as he addressed the Liberal caucus in announcing the expulsion of the two former ministers, while posing as the guardian of Liberal ethics.

And so, in some of the most breathtaking minutes of political hypocrisy you will ever see or hear in Canadian politics, Trudeau announced Wilson-Raybould’s and Philpott’s expulsion for violating — insert laughter here — Trudeau’s ethical standards, portraying himself as the innocent, truth-telling, honest broker in the Lavscam scandal.

“Since the beginning, I have approached this situation with patience and understanding,” Trudeau said in praise of himself. “My rationale has been that real change is hard. And so it requires patience and it requires understanding. But being a member of caucus comes with both rights and responsibilities. A team has to trust each other. And with Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, that trust has been broken.”

While Trudeau never got around to specifically explaining why Philpott was expelled, he said Wilson-Raybould was being excommunicated for her “unconscionable” secret recording of her Dec. 19, 2018 phone call with former privy council clerk Michael Wernick.

“Unconscionable”, even though all that recording confirmed was the accuracy of what Wilson-Raybould testified to in public hearings into Lavscam before the justice committee, prior to the Liberals using their majority to shut it down.

This from Trudeau, who misled the Canadian people when he described as “false” the original Globe and Mail story on Feb. 7, that revealed how Wilson-Raybould, as attorney-general, had been pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to give a sweetheart prosecution deal to Quebec engineering and construction giant, SNC-Lavalin.

This from the prime minister who immediately tried, deceitfully, to muddy the waters by repeating, ad nauseam, at that first media scrum on Lavscam, that no one in the PMO “directed” Wilson-Raybould to grant SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement, so it could avoid prosecution on criminal charges of bribery and fraud.

Except the Globe story didn’t say she was directed by the PMO. It said, accurately, she was pressured.

That Trudeau announced Wilson-Raybould’s expulsion from the Liberal caucus because she did not meet his ethical standards is rich.

Coming, as it does from a prime minister who was found by then ethics commissioner Mary Dawson to have violated four sections of the Conflict of Interest Act arising from his family vacations on the private Bahamas island of the Aga Khan, whose foundation is a recipient of Canadian taxpayers’ money.

Coming as well from a prime minister who says women must be believed in sexual harassment and assault cases, except when a past allegation of groping is made against him, at which point he doesn’t recall any “negative interactions” but that women have the right to experience things differently.

A prime minister who believes “ethics” apply to others, but not him. The Liberals, of course, gave him a standing ovation.

Speaking from his home in Campbell River on Vancouver Island, Bill Wilson suggested the prime minister could have put a stop to this story months ago and made it through with his cabinet and caucus intact.

“It’s hard for me to believe that Trudeau didn’t take the high road when all of this scandal started to break and simply say that a mistake was made,” said Wilson.

Back in 1983, when Trudeau’s own father was running the country, Wilson told him his daughter wanted to be prime minister one day.

“I guess he doesn’t have the kind of intellectual depth that his father had,” said Wilson about the younger Trudeau. “He got his mother’s looks and sadly he didn’t get the kind of moral fibre that I think is necessary to be a prime minister.”

Wilson encouraged Wilson-Raybould to defend her seat in Vancouver-Granville as an independent in the upcoming federal election, suggesting if she wins, she may one day be allowed back into the Liberal Party.

“Four years from now, or five years from now, the Liberals will have gotten rid of the young Trudeau, who didn’t seem to learn anything from his father,” said Wilson. “And maybe Jody Wilson will be the prime minister.”","Trudeau should have taken 'high road,' Jody Wilson-Raybould's father says",BC CTV News,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/trudeau-should-have-taken-high-road-jody-wilson-raybould-s-father-says-1.4364834

I woke with a start from a lurid dream. It was just my vivid Liberal imagination running away with me once again.

In that REM state of suspended disbelief, I had conjured up those grisly video images of Muammar Gaddafi’s final moments on Earth.

I replayed the graphic cellphone images of the late Libyan dictator’s bloodied and battered body being hauled out of his hidey hole—a dirty drainage pipe that I somehow imagined had been engineered by SNC-Lavalin.

In my dream I was transfixed by the shocking footage of his torment and humiliation—of his brutal capture and rough justice at the hands of the crazed crowd and his angry abusers.

Only in my distorted “version of events” it was all somehow happening in Ottawa, by some culvert flowing out of the Rideau Canal.

And worst of all, somehow, in place of the face of the real-life madman that was, I had inserted Justin Trudeau’s tortured image, bewildered by the bleak reality of what was transpiring.

Which in my dream, ended with him baffling the onlookers with a few yoga moves that made them all clap with approval and hoist him up on a pedestal. Whereupon, he invited his party faithful to celebrate his renewal and cleansing with so many selfies.

Terrifying, I know.

And not remotely fair to Canada’s prime minister, whose own dictatorial tendencies, as shown by his heavy-handed treatment of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, are not at all analogous to, or evocative of, Gaddafi’s truly heinous reign of terror.

Trudeau may be authoritarian, but he is certainly no Muammar, in any sense. And he’s mostly a gentle soul whose greatest danger is to himself.

Indeed, he is still undeniably a rock star in the eyes of most people in the Western world. Especially compared to Donald Trump.

But nightmares are like that.

They often piece together bits of reality with absurdist imagery grounded in detached events, to suggest a story so horrific and so shocking it is enough to drench us in cold sweat.

Relief comes when we awake to realize that none of it ever happened; that it was all a ridiculous figment of fantasy grounded only in our latent fears and apprehension.

Still, the dream haunted me, even in my waking hours.

I just couldn’t shake the thought of how the entire LavScam scandal has produced Trudeau’s ignoble fall from grace and how a leader who once seemed so right, to so many, could go so horribly wrong. For real.

All for the sake of saving one company from its living nightmare. Namely, of having to face its day in court on bribery and fraud charges for its alleged activities in securing contracts from Gaddafi’s government, back in the 2000s.

Gaddafi demonstrated that he didn't behave like other world leaders during a memorable speech to the UN General Assembly in 2009. UN video screen shots

Gaddafi nationalized oil industry

It was enough to make me consult Wikipedia about Gaddafi’s rise and fall.

It is easy to forget that the “Colonel” was once also a handsome rake. He came to power during the era of Trudeaumania in a revolutionary coup that promised an end to the Senussi monarchy’s oppressive rule and corruption.

Who knew that he was once lauded in his homeland as a progressive force for women’s rights?

Who knew that he was once the author of his own Green Book—a champion for a new Third International Theory of quasi-socialism?

Who remembers that he nationalized the Libyan oil industry before he landed in so much goo attempting to privatize it?

Although I seriously doubt that he inspired Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s penchant for nationalization with Petro-Can, let alone his son’s nationalization of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which he claims he only did to ultimately privatize.

Anyway, absolute power, as they say, corrupts absolutely. And Gadaffi got his just desserts in the Arab Spring of 2011 that effectively marked the beginning of SNC-Lavalin’s current legal issues in respect of its conduct in Libya.

Hence my subconscious connection of those two distinct events and actors, no doubt.

Two years before SNC was charged in Canada for the crimes that the director of public prosecutions alleges it committed in 2000s—which Jody Wilson-Raybould was also convinced should be pursued in court—the “old” SNC-Lavalin was also brought to rough justice by the World Bank.

As we all know, SNC-Lavalin Inc. and over 100 affiliates were debarred for up to 10 years from bidding on any World Bank–financed projects for its misconduct in relation to the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project in Bangladesh and another Bank-financed project.

As it turned out, that was just the tip of the dirty iceberg that the company’s current president and CEO now assures us is all now so much dirty water long-passed under the bridge.

New allegations surface against company

I won’t cite chapter and verse about those other incidents or the massive ethical clean-up efforts that SNC-Lavalin took to address its past wrongs since 2013.

But suffice it to say, Trudeau is dreaming in Technicolour if he thinks booting JWR and Philpott out of caucus will end his LavScam troubles.

It won’t, as should be obvious from CBC’s new report today (April 3) involving allegations from an anonymous ""insider"". (None of these new allegations have been proven in court.)

“The insider alleges that, prior to 2012—when the head of SNC-Lavalin's construction division was arrested in Switzerland for bribery in Libya—EDC was funding numerous projects that featured ‘slush funds’,"" CBC News reported. “In 2013, CBC News and the Globe and Mail exposed a similar scheme inside SNC-Lavalin. Some budgets included items called ‘project consultancy costs’ or ‘PCCs.’ The code was used to mask secret payments for projects in Africa, India, Cambodia and Kazakhstan.

“SNC-Lavalin admitted to CBC News those PCC payments were ‘improper,’ and in 2015, paid a $1.5-million penalty to resolve allegations it bribed public officials to win road projects in Uganda and Mozambique that were funded by the African Development Bank.”

The reporter, Dave Seglins, noted that Export Development Canada ""has hired outside legal counsel to review some of its dealings with SNC-Lavalin”, in particular financing for so-callled ""technical fees"" paid in connection with a project in Angola.

Imagine that.

This is the company that Trudeau felt so strongly should be spared from a criminal trial that he saw fit to strong-arm Jody Wilson-Raybould with the full power of his office.

This is the company that Trudeau determined to save at all cost. As JWR testified, using no end of veiled threats and inappropriate political overtures to pressure her into granting it a deal. One that might prove to be worth billions in future federal government contracts, by guaranteeing its eligibility to bid on federal projects.

How far Justin Trudeau has slipped from his holier-than-thou moral pedestal.

How wrong his social revolution has gone.

As Bob Dylan once sang, “Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass, but sometimes you just find yourself over the line.”

Such is the self-rationalization of any good tin-pot dictator with too much power in his ethically compromised hands.

Sadly, Trudeau hasn’t quite reached the point of being able to admit to himself that he ever crossed any lines in his handling of this sorry affair.

In his distorted assessment, he did nothing that even warrants an apology. All that he did, directed, commissioned and covered up was done in the name of his higher authority.

From trying to bully Puglaas into wrongly politically intervening in a criminal prosecution, to firing her as attorney general after she refused to bow to his will.

From denouncing the Globe & Mail’s story as “completely false”, to his false propaganda aimed at masking his deeds and at justifying his wrongdoings.

From his minions disparaging JWR and Philpott with fabrications, smears, and innuendo, to banishing them into exile for having the temerity to speak truth to power.

His shell game is not hard to crack.

He hopes to distract us from the inappropriate if not illegal overtures that prompted JWR to tape his top lieutenant, by trying to denigrate her “unconscionable act” as the real unpardonable sin, instead of all that astounding recording revealed.

In her media interviews the day after their ejection from caucus, Wilson-Raybould masterfully flipped Trudeau’s flop-assault on its own silly head.

What was really unconscionable, she rightly said, was his unforgivable attempts to interfere with the independent administration of justice. A sin that he only hopes to hide by lashing out at those who only hope to fully expose it and urge his apology.

Regardless, this sad chapter in Canadian history is still being written.

We haven’t yet scratched the surface of its broader truth.

What other issues may have caused JWR and DPP Kathleen Roussel such consternation about granting SNC-Lavalin its desired deal?

Perhaps it is that truth that Trudeau either knows of or suspects that wakes him at 3 a.m.

We may never know what was in that “Section 13” report from the latter to the former. Which JWR told Trudeau’s privy council clerk Michael Wernick was also given to the prime minister’s office back in September.

Did it address any of the issues raised in today’s (April 3) CBC report?

Did it or any other advice rendered specifically address any other concerns or ongoing investigations into SNC-Lavalin’s past shady dealings?

Mum’s the word.

Ousted Liberal MPs defend their actions

Trudeau won’t release JWR and Philpott from their legal impediments to share their whole truth. His lead actors in the drama have all clammed up as instructed, aided and abetted by the PM’s loyal and frightened army.

Supreme rulers don’t like hearing what they don’t want to know.

Especially if it challenges their authority when they are “in that kind of mood” and when they are “gonna find a way to get it done one way or another”.

No, Canada, our LavScam nightmare is not over. Not by a long shot.

It won’t be, in my judgement, until the RCMP finally steps in—as I again predict it will, if it hasn’t already unbenownst to us all.

Until then, we can all sleep so much easier knowing that there are incredibly honourable public servants like JWR and Philpott who are willing to put everything on the line to separate Canada from places like Libya, where democracy doesn’t come so cheap.

“What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party”, Puglaas wrote.

“I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do.”

“Indeed, the need has never been greater for a measured re-evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue. What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth,” Philpott said in her statement.

Hear, hear.

Their truth will not be silenced, as the young ""Daughters of the Vote"" so powerfully demonstrated today in their visit to parliament in cheering Puglaas and Philpott.

Many of them also turned their back on Trudeau to protest his despotic and anti-feminist treatment of his former female caucus colleagues.

The whole sordid truth about LavScam won’t be contained in its sewer pipe for much longer.

It exists to be found.

Despite the terror now in Justin Trudeau’s eyes, that tells me his time is done.

A guy can dream, can’t he?

Let us all be grateful that we live in a country and democracy where we decide our own collective destiny with ballots and not bullets.

Well, we now know – with dismaying clarity – which sort of values, vision and people “animate” the Liberal party, or at least which are preferred by its elected members. And this revelation is, to use the vocabulary of Jane Philpott, the other MP ejected from caucus, “disheartening.”

In rejecting an honest, complete discussion of the facts around the SNC-Lavalin mess, then exiling two respected, once-senior cabinet ministers over their defence of prosecutorial independence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his caucus have shown that political expediency trumps principle, loyalty trumps independent thought, and prevarication trumps transparency. As with any tinpot government, ends justify means, the leader is supreme, and thoughtful reflection belongs – well, anywhere but among elected members.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his caucus have shown that political expediency trumps principle, loyalty trumps independent thought, and prevarication trumps transparency.

Does this seem harsh? Then let’s review the basics: Former attorney general Wilson-Raybould, who had been shuffled out of the job, revealed during committee testimony that for months she had felt inappropriate political pressure to overrule the decision of an independent prosecutor who wouldn’t cut a remediation deal with SNC-Lavalin on charges of corruption and bribery. Painstakingly, Wilson-Raybould documented what had led her to deem the pressure inappropriate. Officials who attempted to rebut her were broadly unable to do so. Perhaps there were better counter-arguments to be had, or facts the public does not yet understand, but the Liberal-majority committee refused to hear them. Meanwhile, the government’s version of the saga evolved from vague denial to the message that if it indeed had tried to interfere with an independent prosecution, well, there were jobs at stake. Ends justify means.

Next came a cynical barrage of character assassination and insinuation, leaks about judges, and faux outrage at Wilson-Raybould for offering up a (legal) tape of a phone call.

It all leads to the conclusion that the Liberal caucus, and its leader, have rejected the first role of MPs: to hold government to account. Under our system of responsible government, elected houses supposedly control the executive branch, not the other way around. Governments are supposed to answer to democratically elected members. The principle applies not merely to the opposition but to governing party MPs. They are not supposed to be puppets.

This seemingly straightforward job requirement has been trampled over the decades, of course. Government MPs on committees are often mere mouthpieces for the boss. Backbench queries during Question Period are regularly cheerleader sessions for the PM. It’s not that the Liberal party under Trudeau is any worse than predecessor governments, including Conservative ones; it’s simply that these are the Liberals who, in 2015, promised to take the taint and cynicism out of politics. Apparently only two Grit MPs took this pledge seriously.

Alongside hypocrisy and cowardice, the Liberals’ current position oozes irony. For example, having spent three years releasing members of the Senate from the shackles of party discipline, on the premise that this would strengthen thoughtful debate in the red chamber, Trudeau is clearly having none of it with his elected caucus. Only two felt that truth, accountability and transparency were essential parts of their job.

The party has indeed chosen how it wants to operate. Shame.

Since the announcement Tuesday evening, which included the removal of Jane Philpott from caucus as well, supporters in Wilson-Raybould’s Vancouver Granville riding have said they would support her if she ran as an independent in the next election.

""All that is going on with her is a disappointment, and we support her fully,"" Tracy Beshara, executive director of Marpole Oakridge Family Place in south Vancouver told The Canadian Press. ""She's honest. She's real and she can tell you both sides. She won't tell you what you want to hear. She'll tell you the way it is. Most politicians don't do that.""

In a Globe and Mail column, Andrew MacDougall, a former director of communications to Stephen Harper, called Trudeau’s decision “a little bit Trump-like.”

“Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal caucus have been channelling Donald Trump and the Republican Party, with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott jointly playing the role of former FBI director James Comey, ejected from the President’s orbit for refusing to play ball on the Russia investigation,” MacDougall stated in the article.

Canadians and political commentators also took to Twitter share their thoughts on the prime minister’s decision:

In a letter to her Liberal colleagues on Tuesday, the former attorney general defended her actions in the SNC-Lavalin case, while acknowledging that many in the caucus do not support her actions.

“I am angry, hurt and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” Wilson-Raybould wrote. “In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess.""

Her letter came on the same day Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, released text messages with Wilson-Raybould prior to the Jan. 14 cabinet shuffle. They do not mention SNC-Lavalin but they do suggest that she tried to prevent her move from the Justice portfolio by arguing it would send the wrong message to Indigenous Peoples.

""Timing of 'pushing' me out (which will be the perception – whether true or not) is terrible,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

""It will be confounding and perplexing to people. This is not about me — believe me when I say this — but this is about an approach to Indigenous Peoples … This situation is only going to deepen and I am very worried about it. I am getting texts/emails from indig leaders and B.C. etc. Just felt I had to text,” the message to Butts from Jan. 8 stated.

Wilson-Raybould provided a 17-minute audio recording with Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, to the House of Commons justice committee last week to further prove that she was pressured to intervene in the prosecution of the engineering company.

The backlash to Trudeau's sarcastic response was swift from every source: from activists, from conservative voices on social media (who surprise, surprise, suddenly seem to have a vested interest in environmental protections), and from regular people of all stripes.

On Thursday, the PM apologized before the press. In his own words:

""As I think you all know from time to time I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way. That's how I believe a democracy should function and I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.""

Trudeau said he'd reimburse the protesters for the donation they made that granted them access to the fundraiser and he announced plans to revisit the Grassy Narrows crisis with his staff.

It seems like the least he can do but hopefully it produces some positive change (in this lifetime) for the protesters who told him off.

None of this, however, is positive for Justin Trudeau, a man heading into an election, whose approval rating, according to a new Ipsos poll conducted for Global News, has dipped below U.S. president Donald Trump's. After this week's events I won't be surprised if we see another dip.

Laureen Harper's response (""That's a great cause but that's another night ... tonight we're here for homeless cats"") to a protester who wanted to know why she appeared to care more about felines than she did about missing and murdered Indigenous women was inappropriate. But it wasn't smug.

On Wednesday night Trudeau was smug. To be precise, he was as smug as they come.

And it's hard to recover from smug. In fact, much like a cat, once ""smug"" is out of the bag — you can't stuff it back in. Once people see it on your face and hear it in your voice, they have a hard time seeing and hearing anything else when they look at you. And unlike SNC-Lavalin — a scandal that is complicated — ""Smug PM"" is very simple.

This could be Justin Trudeau's Mitt Romney moment.

In 2012 in advance of the US presidential election, American magazine Mother Jones released surreptitiously recorded footage of Romney talking about Democratic voters in disparaging terms.

Romney says in the recording: ""There are 47 per cent who are with him [Obama], who are dependent upon government…My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""

Romney never recovered from this incident, not only because it obliterated his nice guy disguise, but because his opponents ensured that everywhere you looked, there it was: that recording, online, on TV, and in your head.

From now until October, prepare to watch Justin Trudeau being smug again and again and again. Christmas has come early for Andrew Scheer. Meanwhile, the people of Grassy Narrows wait.

He went on to discuss the decision to oust Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from caucus, stating that trust had been broken.

“I know nobody in here wants to have to pick who to believe between Jody-Wilson Raybould and Chrystia Freeland. Nobody wants to know that one person has to be right between Jane Philpott or Maryam Monsef. There are always going to be a range of perspectives that we need to listen to. But ultimately diversity … only works if there is trust. And within a team, when that trust gets broken we have to figure out a way to move forward.”

SNC-Lavalin controversy

Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott both announced they were resigning from Justin Trudeau’s cabinet in February and March, respectively.

Their resignations were regarding the SNC-Lavalin case and whether Wilson-Raybould –the former attorney general — was pressured to drop a criminal prosecution against the multi-billion dollar Quebec engineering firm.

An investigation into the matter was launched in February after Canada’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, Mario Dion, agreed to the investigation request from the federal NDP.

Last week, Wilson-Raybould released a secret recording of a conversation she had with Michael Wernick, the former Clerk of the Privy Council of Canada. She said the recording further backed her claims that she had faced pressure from top officials and Trudeau regarding the SNC-Lavalin case.

The now Independent MPs spoke to reporters today and responded to their expulsion.

“We’ve been through obviously some very difficult weeks in the past and speaking for myself I can say that the decisions that I have made, I have made on the basis of what I believe is the best for Canadians to stand up for the truth and to stand up for the independence of the justice system,” said Philpott.

“First of all trust is a two-way street… I think it is… it’s unconscionable to tread over the independence of the prosecutor. It is unconscionable not to uphold the rule of law and I have always maintained that stance. I think it is very alarming that people are focusing on the actual recording of a tape as opposed to the contents of the tape,” said Wilson-Raybould.

“The contents of the tape in my view and in the view of many people who have reached out speak for itself…I recorded that tape. There is nothing illegal about it and I said that in any other circumstance it would be inappropriate. I was protecting myself and I knew that something very dangerous and wrong was going to happen and that my job was at risk.”","Women turn backs to Trudeau in response to Wilson-Raybould, Philpott decision",Daily Hive,https://dailyhive.com/toronto/women-backs-trudeau-wilson-raybould-philpott-april-2019

Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

201,,2019-04-04T07:03:00.0000000Z,"That is where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals find themselves today, as LavScam passed through its last, masochistic agony — the expulsion of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the ...","They got Jody Wilson-Raybould, and Jane Philpott too, but this is just the beginning.

You know you are in trouble in politics when your damage control is more damaging than what made it necessary.

That is where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals find themselves today, as LavScam passed through its last, masochistic agony — the expulsion of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus.

The former attorney general made it official in a tweet. Trudeau informed Wilson-Raybould that she is out of the Liberal caucus and not a Liberal candidate in the next election. The same for Philpott.

Wilson-Raybould’s PR value long gone as Canada’s first female, Indigenous justice minister, she and her lone supporter in cabinet are no longer wanted on the voyage.

But as Wilson-Raybould’s April 2 letter to the members of the national Liberal caucus affirming her commitment to the Liberal Party of Canada made clear: “I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

The Grits can expect to reap the full political consequences of this intemperate, unjust, and craven decision. So much for the big tent, the feminism, the much ballyhooed reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and doing politics a new way. At least the PM didn’t say, “Thank you for your contribution.”

None of this needed to happen.

The PM could have admitted to a terrible judgement call two months ago when the story of his interference in a criminal case broke in the Globe and Mail. He could have apologized to the former attorney general and let justice run its course.

Instead, the prime minister and his PMO have staggered from one communications disaster to the next as their story kept changing. Along the way, four very senior public figures, two Liberal cabinet ministers, the clerk of the privy council, and the PM’s principal secretary have bitten the dust. Now Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are tossed off the stern of the party’s boat.

Today’s ethical ineptitude was preceded by another — the PMO and Privy Council Office’s reaction to the “secret” tape that the former attorney general made of a call with the clerk of the privy council. It was the death march of absurdity.

The clerk, Michael Wernick, would have Canadians believe that he never briefed the prime minister on what was arguably the hottest file on the government’s radar — the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for bribery and corruption in Libya. If true, Wernick makes Rip Van Winkle look hyperactive.

Wernick’s explanation for this comic narrative is that it was Dec. 19, 2018, and “everyone went on holidays.” As every clerk of the privy council knows, the PMO never sleeps. And as Wernick may or may not know, Trudeau remained in Ottawa until he visited the troops in Mali on Dec. 22. The PM did not go on holiday until Dec. 23 that year.

Besides, there are Wernick’s own words on the Raybould tape: “Well, I am going to have to report back before he leaves.” Nowhere did he say “after the holidays.”

Wernick’s account was adopted with slight modifications by the PMO. The office claimed that Trudeau had not been fully aware of what had been said in the conversation between the clerk and Wilson-Raybould. You might call that implausible deniability. The weasel word here is “fully.”

Now that the Wernick tape is public, it is obvious that it would have taken a five-second briefing to convey to the PM Wilson-Raybould’s bottom line: She was not happy about the perceived pressure, and she was not going to change her mind.

The tape, and the supporting documents that also went to the justice committee last week, back up Wilson-Raybould’s earlier testimony:

That she tried to protect the PM from appearing to violate the principle of prosecutorial independence; that she felt that the pressure to change the decision on the SNC-Lavalin matter was inappropriate, including the telephone conversation with Wernick; that the Liberals were going to a “dangerous place” when they kept on intruding into an active criminal case that had already left the legal station.

The plain words on the tape explode the heart of the PM’s defence in this story. Trudeau had maintained that if his ex-minister had had a problem with how the government was handling the SNC-Lavalin case, she should have come to him. The “if only I’d known” gambit.

The tape makes crystal clear that Wilson-Raybould did exactly that with the clerk. In fact, Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould on the tape that he would be reporting their conversation to the PM.

The crowning irony of the Wernick tape? On it, the clerk says that the prime minister still thinks there are lawful things Raybould can do to square away the SNC-Lavalin case without a criminal trial.

Think about that. The PM giving legal advice to the very person who, as chief-law-officer of the Crown, is supposed to be giving advice to him. She, the attorney general and lawyer who had already decided the matter; he, the prime minister and former teacher, who wanted that changed.

Besides, Trudeau didn’t have to wait for the briefing that Wernick claims he never gave to know where Wilson-Raybould stood on the SNC-Lavalin case.

Five days before she “took the extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step” of recording what she believed would be an “inappropriate conversation” with the clerk of the privy council, the attorney general wrote a letter to the prime minister himself. It was a reply to an earlier letter from the PM written on Dec. 6, and received at the Justice Department on Dec. 7.

Trudeau’s letter to his then-attorney general included a copy of a letter that Neil Bruce, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO, had sent to the PM. In that letter, Bruce complained that his company had not been granted negotiations for remediation under Canada’s new Deferred Prosecution Agreement law. He asked for a meeting with the PM at his “earliest convenience.”

It is easy to understand why the CEO would write such a letter. If the company were convicted in the current court case, it could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal contracts in Canada.

So SNC-Lavalin’s interest in appealing to the PM is obvious. But with a criminal case before the courts, why would Trudeau forward that letter to the attorney general? Did he really think it was okay to personally lean in with the full weight of his office on due process?

After “closely” reading the PM’s letter, Wilson-Raybould replied to him on Dec. 14, 2018. It was an attempt to save a puppy running loose on the Trans Canada.

In part, she wrote “the matters raised in Mr. Bruce’s letter are currently before the courts... the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC), which is solely responsible for making decisions with respect to remediation agreements and their applicability in a given case, operates at arms-length and is independent of my Department and my office.”

It was a nice way of telling an interfering PM to buzz off, to let the proper judicial officers do their jobs under the law. Trudeau richly deserved the rebuke.

As hills to die on go, Trudeau could have picked a better one than SNC-Lavalin. Although he may think of it as a “signature” Canadian company, that signature has often been corruption.

Abroad, corruption charges in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and a 10-year ban on working on projects financed by the World Bank, the longest debarment period ever agreed to in a World Bank settlement.

Here in Canada, the Libya corruption and bribery charges have already cost the company $88 million. That money was part of the $110 million paid to settle shareholder class action suits arising over allegations of SNC-Lavalin executives misleading investors about the company’s activities in Libya that affected share price.

Judge Claude Leblond is the judge in the matter, the same judge who presided over the corruption case involving SNC-Lavalin and the McGill University Hospital Complex. The preliminary hearing that began Oct. 29, 2018, on the Libya criminal charges ended on April 1. Judge Leblond is expected to decide whether there is enough evidence to go to trial by May 29. The PMO was intruding into the case while it was actually before the courts.

On top of that, there was a recent guilty plea on charges of violations of Canada’s election financing laws involving SNC-Lavalin.

In the latter case, Normand Morin, one of the company’s VPs, pleaded guilty to illegally funneling cash to federal political parties in this country. Morin, who is no longer with the company, had employees make the political “donations.” The company would then reimburse them with phony expenses refunds or bogus bonuses.

As reported by the CBC, during a seven-year period from 2004 to 2011, SNC-Lavalin made illegal political donations of $117,803. The Liberals got all but $8,000 of the money, the balance going to the Conservatives.

Because the case was settled with a plea deal, the evidence was never entered into the public record and the public never found out which leadership candidates, politicians, and riding organizations got the cash.

SNC-Lavalin’s most recent legal problem in Canada arises out of the decision by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, backed by then attorney general Wilson-Raybould, to proceed with a criminal trial against the company because of its activities in Libya.

As reported by the Canadian Press last month, a new proposed class action lawsuit was filed in Ontario Superior Court against the company. The proposed suit claims that SNC-Lavalin failed to disclose in a timely fashion that federal prosecutors had declined to invite the company to negotiate.

The legal action points out that more than a month elapsed from Sept. 4, 2018, the date the company first learned of the prosecutor’s decision not to negotiate a DPA, to Oct. 10, 2018, the date it informed shareholders.

At that time, the share price dropped 14 per cent on the bad legal news. The lawsuit seeks $75 million in damages for investors who acquired SNC-Lavalin stock between Sept. 4 and Oct. 10.

But there is a much graver problem for the Trudeau government than cheerleading for this single, dubious corporate player. Corruption, the exercise of official powers without regard for the public good, exacts a monstrous cost on multiple levels. If the prime minister knows that, he has never mentioned it.

According to data from the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the economic costs of paying bribes to “get a business advantage” are enormous. Every year worldwide, over $1 trillion is paid in bribes.

That means that one dollar out of every $30 of Gross Domestic Product in the world is corruptly paid out in bribes. These bribes add up to 25 per cent to the costs of procurement in developing countries — an inflated bill they can ill afford.

According to the OECD, the social and human costs of corruption greatly exacerbate the economic costs. Greasing palms to get business breaks environmental laws, prevents sustainable development, increases the use of poor construction materials, and leads to the theft and or depletion of natural resources in poor countries. Bottom line? It causes real damage to people, communities, and in the end, to businesses as well.

Presumably, that’s why Canada signed on to the Anti-Corruption Convention in 1998 — that and the fact that Canada has the most entries on the World Bank’s blacklist of corrupt companies, thanks to SNC-Lavalin and the string of other companies they hold.

What should bother Canadians about the PM’s take on this matter is that his stand on SNC-Lavalin is not just a one-off. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was the first federal leader to argue that Trudeau is not the champion of the middle class he claims to be, but rather a consistent corporate cheerleader. He talks the talk for the environment, Indigenous rights, and human rights; but for Big Business, he walks the walk.

Canadians saw Trudeau the corporate cheerleader in Houston, where he told a group of Texas oilmen that no country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave it there.

They saw the same thing when the PM dismissed the solid opposition of coastal British Columbians to Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline, and instead paid the Texas oil company $4.3 billion for this leaky relic and vowed to get the expansion to tidewater.

They saw it again on Canada’s East Coast, where Trudeau denied that Ottawa had environmental jurisdiction over a project that plans to dump toxic pollutants from a kraft pulp mill owned by Northern Pulp into prime fishing grounds in the Northumberland Strait.

And now, they see it once more with the PM and his minions interfering in an active criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin. That violates the heart of the judicial system: the complete independence of the prosecution service under the law.

If, as Singh has argued, the SNC-Lavalin scandal outs the prime minister as a corporate enabler, and not the champion of the middle class he claims to be, it has also sunk the Liberal caucus to a new low.

In their lust to protect their own myopic, political self-interest, the caucus put the wrong end of the telescope to its collective eye. As a result, they have identified the wrong culprit.

It was the former attorney-general, Wilson-Raybould, who protected the government from the potentially deadly charge of interfering in a criminal case the way potentates do in corrupt Third-World countries. It was the PM and his over-zealous operatives who put the government in jeopardy by trying to violate the independence of the prosecution service, and arguably obstructing justice.

Yet not a peep out of the Liberal lemmings about the PM tampering with the criminal justice process. Instead, general apoplexy about the former attorney general having recorded a conversation with the clerk of the privy council without his knowledge. That is like screeching about a leaky faucet while the house is on fire.

There is only one more mistake Trudeau can make on this file — reverse the decision of the prosecution service and offer SNC-Lavalin a Deferred Prosecution Agreement under the very law the company lobbied so hard to get.

Donald Trump got his way in the rollout of the Mueller Report by finding the right attorney general for the job. Equipped with a brand new attorney general, Trudeau can do the same thing if he chooses.

The implications were too damaging for too many Canadians.

No politician – no matter how wily or photogenic – could avoid the repercussions.

article continues below

Or so we thought.

The real scandal, with all due respect to the intrigue of SNV-Lavalin, is Canada’s inaction on climate change – something that impacts all of us.

Shortly after a federal report illustrated that Canada could see 10 times as many deadly heat waves, twice as many extreme rainstorms, and the loss of our permafrost due to climate change, we heard even more alarming noise from Canada’s Environment Commissioner Julie Gelfand.

In short, Gelfand pointed out that while the climate is changing, we aren’t.

We aren’t on track to reach our 2030 greenhouse gas emission targets. We aren’t doing all we can to promote investment in clean energy. And, according to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, Canada is still offering more than $1.2 billion in subsidies to fossil fuel companies.

On top of that is the $4.5 billion the federal government paid for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project that terminates in Burnaby. That’s just a minimum figure as analysts say the true costs will be billions of dollars more.

We’re like a condemned man offering to help pay for the cost of the rope.

And so we waited for an ambitious politician to use that scandal to further their own political ambitions.

Instead, we were treated to a succession of ridiculous selfies of politicians at gas pumps, advising Canadians to fill their tanks before the carbon tax came into effect. That tax – which puts a price on pollution - was previously assailed for not altering behaviour enough.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer vowed to scrap what he dubbed an unfair tax. What he failed to offer was any sort of real solution. Instead, he stooped low to actually hold a press conference in front of a gas station.

As for federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, he is opposed to the Trans Mountain project and has an ambitious plan to fight climate change. Then again, he also supports a massive LNG project that even his party’s own candidate, Svend Robinson, thinks is a climate disaster so we’re not giving him too much praise right now.

It was supposed to be a celebratory day in Ottawa as representatives of Daughters of the Vote took their seats in the House of Commons.

These delegates, all between the ages of 18 and 23, represent each of the 338 ridings in Canada.

Once they're selected, they are given an opportunity to make statements and attend Question Period.

They also get to hear from prominent politicians, like former prime minister Kim Campbell, who received a warm welcome this morning.

But some in this year's group did something different.

For instance, when Justin Trudeau started speaking about the importance of teamwork in caucus, several of these delegates stood up and turned their backs to him. It was seen as a show of support for recently ousted caucus members Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Some delegates also walked out of the chamber after Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer started speaking.

Here are some of the messages being passed around on social media.

One of the most compelling moments came when a Mi'kmaq delegate, Hannah Martin, delivered a fiery speech condemning Trudeau for his approach to environmental issues.

And, for doing what? For refusing to break the law? Surely it was not for the lame reason that she “secretly” taped the clerk of the Privy Council.

This apparently makes her devious beyond redemption, and no longer to be trusted, Again, for what? For blowing the whistle or for taping that call?

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it “unconscionable” that she would do such a thing, considering she was then the highest lawyer in Canada.

Also tossed to the wayside was former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, her sin being her solidarity with Wilson-Raybould and being vocally unhappy with the PM’s way of expressing “sunny ways” and falling dismally in his promise of a more transparent government.

But, let’s not get too cute. There is likely not a single Canadian journalist who has not taped a phone call regarding a story — not generally, perhaps, but certainly when the person on the line is a cause for concern.

If the person is known to sue, for example, or is in possession of power that trembles the knees, then hit the record button.

It’s called covering one’s ass from the certainty of pushback.

If the person is known to express threats or dire consequences, even if the threats are veiled, then likewise — roll that tape.

The tone of voice can be a determining factor.

It is not against the law, of course, to tape a telephone call in Canada as long as one person involved knows it’s happening, and nor is it as “unconscionable” as the PM was trying to convince feeble brains.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau can therefore come down from his high and mighty morality perch for castigating Wilson-Raybould for taping her Dec. 18 telephone call with Michael Wernick, the now exited clerk of the Privy Council, and most senior of civil servants, who recently exposed himself during his justice committee testimony to being little more than Trudeau’s errand boy.

And Garneau hardly stood alone. There were Liberal cabinet members and backbench caucus seat-holders lowering themselves to Garneau’s level of pretentious sanctimony to accuse Wilson-Raybould of relinquishing her ethics and smashing her moral compass with that taping.

But she did it for self-preservation, and to offset the oft-used defence by Trudeau and others, including his former principal secretary Gerald Butts, that “her recollections differ from my recollections.”

It is more commonly known among the great unwashed as Trudeau’s Kokanee Grope Defence.

If the taping proved anything, and it did so beyond any reasonable doubt that mere notes would not prove, it was that Wernick was persistent to the point of inappropriateness in trying to get Wilson-Raybould to put politics above the law and give Quebec-based SNC-Lavalin a cushy deal that would have it dodge a nasty criminal trial on bribery and corruption charges.

In order to bandage his self-inflicted wound, Trudeau decided on a double execution — tossing both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from his caucus on Tuesday and from being Liberal candidates in the coming October election.

But, make no mistake, he hadn’t suddenly grown a leader’s spine.

He was pushing the panic button and grasping at straws.

The vice-president of a federal Liberal riding association has quit in support of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott after the two were ousted from caucus as fallout continues in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Louis De Jaeger of the Chilliwack-Hope riding announced his decision on social media on Wednesday morning, saying it was “with great disappointment” that he learned the two former cabinet ministers were ejected by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the scandal.

He said after speaking to people in the community over the last several weeks, he has found his values, and theirs, “do not align” with the current direction of the prime minister and those within his office.

“One of the most valuable assets we have in life is to be trustworthy,” De Jaeger said. “It is this erosion of trust that the Prime Minister mentions when speaking of blame for the current SNC fiasco… the breakdown of the relationships between himself, the PMO, the former Attorney General and the former Treasury Board President.”

The Liberals have taken beating after beating following allegations that Wilson-Raybould was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin – the latest development being a key phone conversation Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded between her and former Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick.

De Jaeger said he also cancelled his financial contributions to the party, and will be withdrawing his bid to run as the Liberal candidate in the upcoming federal election.

He first ran for the Liberals in 2015.

Gas prices jumped 4.42 cents a litre, plus HST, the highest increase in Atlantic Canada, because New Brunswick did not come up with an acceptable carbon tax plan of its own.

Conservatives both federally and provincially have criticized the federal Liberals' ""tax on pollution"" as ineffective, and say the rebates the federal government is giving New Brunswickers won't cover the real cost of the carbon tax.

Scheer said the rebates don't take into account secondary costs, such as higher prices for food and goods that have to be shipped, or heating.

At a rally in Letang, in the St. George area, Scheer reiterated his commitment that if he's elected in October, his first act as prime minister will be to repeal the carbon tax.

But Scheer refused to divulge any specifics of his plan to replace the tax being implemented by the Trudeau government or reveal when it will be released other than to say ""well before the election.""

""We do have a comprehensive plan, it will speak to a number of factors,"" Scheer said.

He said the federal plan disproportionately hurts middle-class Canadians, and his plan will be a multi-pronged approach that does not involve a carbon tax or rebates.

He criticized the federal plan for allowing the largest polluters to get a 90 per cent exemption but would not say if his plan would include making sure New Brunswick polluters, such as the Irving Oil refinery, in New Brunswick, would pay more.

""What our plan will do is ensure that the country's largest polluters are part of the framework,"" Scheer said.

He said his plan would ""focus on investments in technology and innovation"" and encourage production but he did not say how.

Premier Blaine Higgs said the federal government wouldn't look at the province's plan, which doesn't include a carbon price at the pump. (CBC)

Premier Blaine Higgs said his Progressive Conservative government does have a carbon plan but was told by Ottawa that it was too late to submit it.

Higgs said the province's plan doesn't include a price at the pump either.

When asked why New Brunswick didn't propose a plan like P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador did, where the provincial governments reduced their own gas taxes in January to prepare for the federal tax, Higgs said New Brunswick won't play that game.

""That says what a farce that whole program is.""

He said New Brunswick will continue to fight the carbon tax in court with Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.","Andrew Scheer holds rally against carbon tax, but won't reveal his own plan",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/andrew-scheer-new-brunswick-carbon-tax-1.5080157

In his remarks to the Manning Centre networking conference on Saturday, Scheer said he ""unequivocally"" condemns hateful ideologies.

""The criticisms are completely baseless.""

Those criticisms have been plentiful in the past few weeks.

Says he misheard conspiracy question

Scheer has come under fire for speaking at the recent United We Roll rally on Parliament Hill, which had picked up participants who were making racist and anti-immigrant comments. The Prime Minister's Office also condemned Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" with Faith Goldy, a commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

Scheer was also chastised for not shutting down a question at a recent town hall about a widely debunked conspiracy theory connecting former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring.

In that particular instance, Scheer insisted he hadn't heard the question properly.

Whether racism or disinformation, Scheer says he and the Conservatives oppose such rhetoric.

""People know that the Conservative Party is open and welcoming,"" he said.

""We denounce any elements of society that would promote hate speech.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

'Cheap political points'

His comments at the Manning Conference were the first time he's fully addressed the accusations against him, though he's taken questions on the matters at news events in the past few weeks.

Scheer was also heavily criticized for tweeting out his condolences to the victims of the New Zealand mosque attacks without mentioning the words 'Muslim' or 'mosque'.

In another statement later that day, Scheer did use both.

On Saturday, he accused the Liberals of targeting his post to ""score cheap political points in a disgusting manner,"" adding that Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Gov. Gen. Julie Payette released statements omitting both terms as well.

The Tory leader said it's important to speak out against those who put one group of people over another.

SNC-Lavalin still top of mind for the Tories

Scheer turned to the SNC-Lavalin affair as well, calling on Canadians to put pressure on Trudeau to allow all sides of the story to be heard.

The Liberal majority on the justice committee shut down an investigation into the matter, and now the ethics committee will begin its own.

Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott are free to speak, the prime minister has said, but so far neither of them have taken that full opportunity.

Scheer said the crux of his issue with the conduct of top government officials is that politicians should not involve themselves in deciding what legal tools are available in prosecutions.

In what was clearly a speech with an eye toward the upcoming election, Scheer told the audience that being an Opposition leader isn't always easy, because you're not as high-profile as the prime minister.

However, now that the SNC-Lavalin affair is casting doubt onto Trudeau's character, it's easier for people to see ""the real Andrew Scheer,"" he said.

Scheer also shredded the new federal Liberal budget, calling it a multi-billion dollar attempt to distract from the ethical questions about the government.","'The criticisms are completely baseless,' Scheer says of claims he's too soft on hate groups",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-pizzagate-united-we-roll-new-zealand-extremism-1.5069197

This is a ...,"This spring Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have singularly focused their attacks on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals over the issue of SNC-Lavalin.

This is a massive strategic political mistake. Scheer has missed an opportunity to use the tabling of the budget to attack Trudeau on economic issues relevant to middle-class Canadians. Instead, they continue to be obsessed with a scandal that is complicated and frankly irrelevant to the struggles of people to get by day-to-day.

The SNC-Lavalin mess is a political scandal, not an economic scandal. It is an example of how dysfunctional Ottawa is and continues to become. People grow tired of all politicians when they are simply too political.

SNC-Lavalin is more of the same. Same old politics played by both sides of the house.

The allegations of backroom pressure is more of the same. The opposition filibustering is more of the same. The all-night voting against things the Conservatives support is more of the same.

More of the same is not relevant to the lives of Canadians. It does nothing to improve their lives. It does nothing to inform them of new information or save them time in their very busy lives. It doesn’t create a connection.

The more the opposition harps on this issue the more people lose confidence in all politicians and the institutions of government.

Just two weeks ago I had a real-life illustration – in a very small way – of what politicians in government and in opposition should be doing.

I’m active on social media to promote my columns, TV appearances and regular radio. I am for the most part a social media failure. My Twitter account @jimwarren416 has less than a thousand followers and my comments or stories get less than a dozen likes or retweets.

That is until last week. I spent a few days in the United States during March break. I tweeted the following. “If you are a Canadian on vacation/work trip in the USA and the gas pump asks you for your 5-digit zip code to use your credit card- it the three digits in your home postal code followed by two zeros. IE M2R 6A3 – enter 26300.”

The tweet blew up. 277,962 people saw the tweet on Twitter. 3,124 people liked it. 1,148 retweeted it and more than 300 people commented on the tweet. Some people went so far to suggest I should get the Order of Canada.

It created a connection with people. Anyone who tries to buy gas in the states knows the inconvenience and hassle you face.

The info was new to many people, it was useful info and it was helpful to people.

It is a minor and trivial tweet. But it reminded me of what politicians should be doing — finding ways to improve peoples’ lives. If you have something to offer that does that, people pay attention.

Liberals typically get elected by promising to deliver better social services that will improve someone’s quality of life. For example, improved education or better health care.

Conservatives typically get elected by promising to be better mangers of the economy and of running government. Conservatives should be using the most recent budget to tell a story of why the Liberals failed to balance the budget and how they are failing to improve the lives of Canadians.

They need to paint a picture of how they would be better economic managers — and as a result how that will be useful and helpful to Canadians.

The SNC-Lavalin issue is salacious. But it is a story that feeds itself and shouldn’t be the focus of the opposition.

“It’s the economy, stupid” is as true today as it ever was.

Make that swamps.

Yes, the Conservative leader needs to rid the capital of the considerable Liberal murk surrounding SNC, but he also needs to use Trudeau’s troubles as a pretext to rid his movement of its more dubious elements so that disillusioned Liberal voters have more than one new home to pick from should they abandon ship.

And while its axiomatic that you never interrupt an opponent while he’s beating himself up, it’s also true that you should never let a good crisis go to waste. Scheer needs to use Trudeau’s crisis as an opportunity to let Canadians know where he stands on values.

This is not to accept that Scheer currently has a values problem; it’s only an acceptance of the fact Liberals — having no good answer on SNC — will use the perception of a CPC values problem — and any spiky tone — to their advantage every chance they get, as evidenced by the recent kerfuffle over the “United We Roll” protests on Parliament Hill. With each bad news cycle, the Liberals will shift further from “sunny” to “smeary” ways.

To be clear, this was always going to be the Liberal re-election strategy. Sunny ways was just the smokescreen for what promised to be a very negative campaign.

The Liberals are certainly busy smashing the Project Fear button now in the hopes of stalling more defections over SNC, with MPs and online surrogates arguing against a further airing of the SNC drama lest it — and let me see if I can follow their logic here — help ease the path of the Nazis to power in Canada. Yes, some people are that irrational about the baby-faced dad-bodded former Speaker of the House now living in Stornoway.

And if you think the Nazi bit is a stretch, you haven’t been touring the green shamrocked quarters of Twitter, which now piles into every critical mention of Trudeau with a fury like what they must imagine the alt-right are capable of mustering. Forget potential interference in the justice system, this shamrock brigade thinks Trudeau could shoot someone on Sparks Street and still deserve to be prime minister. Because Scheer is a monster. Or something.

Even the wise owls are now beclowning themselves. Former justice minister Anne McLellan has now been drafted in to run interference for Trudeau’s office. Meanwhile, Liberal MP Judy Sgro, herself no stranger to (multiple) scandals, has told Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to “put up or shut up”. And let’s not forget Sheila Copps, whose tweets on SNC are only a few irregular capitalizations away from MAGA-ville.

Of course, these hysterics hardly ever convince anyone. But that doesn’t mean their tactic is wrong. A more credible voice could land the blow and the Liberals will be asking their surrogates to land it. That’s why Scheer needs to nip it in the bud, no matter how bad SNC gets. Just as Republicans held their nose over Trump because they hated Clinton more, Trudeau is counting on a similar dynamic to see him through on SNC-Lavalin.

An animal backed into a corner also comes out fighting.

Trudeau will absolutely play politics on hot button files such as white nationalism, using tragic events such as the Christchurch mosque shooting as a hook. He will paint opposition to his carbon tax plan as proof of utter indifference to the world and future generations. He will rail against alt-right attitudes toward immigration. What SNC now gives Scheer is a chance to paint it all as Liberal desperation.

To do that, however, Scheer first needs to set out his stall on all of these questions. He’s said things in bits and bobs before and in response to various events over the past year but he now needs to bash it out in one go in a highly visible setting.

On the culture war, Scheer must condemn the Trumpy-types who see a “globalist” or “mooslim” plot everywhere they look. Being uncomfortable with the unfamiliar shouldn’t be disqualifying but Scheer should lead the conversation in steering conservatives toward safer harbours when it comes to Islam. A good start would be to embrace the Muslim community in unequivocal terms when it is targeted.

And on the environment, Scheer should finally announce his long-delayed plan, and buttress it with a clear statement of his belief in the science about climate change.

On both fronts, Scheer needs to leave centrist voters feeling their vote is safe with him. He needs to build immunity against the attacks he knows are coming.

And if that sends a few votes Maxime Bernier’s way, then so be it. It’s a price worth paying for the centre ground.

In a statement, Scheer said, “Today, Liberal MPs have let Canadians know where they stand. They have chosen to condemn colleagues who spoke truth to power and to prop up a prime minister who is drowning in scandal.

article continues below

“The message they have sent today is clear: If you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party of Canada.

He went on to say, “Canadians will view the removal of Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal caucus for exactly what it is: A betrayal of justice. Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them. However, in expelling Ms. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould from their caucus, they have done exactly that.”

Neither former minister will be able to seek re-election under the Liberal Party.

“For Ms. Wilson-Raybould, it is the second time she has been fired for standing up for the rule of law. The first time by Justin Trudeau. The second time by her own colleagues. This should tell Canadians everything they need to know about how things work in the Liberal Party of Canada. They look the other way on corruption and punish those won’t do the same.

Wilson-Raybould tweeted about her removal just prior to Prime Minister Trudeau’s announcement of her ejection.

“I have just been informed by the Prime Minister of Canada that I am removed from the Liberal caucus and as the confirmed Vancouver Granville candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2019 federal election. More to come...” her tweet read.

Scheer says, “Liberal MPs are upset about the wrong thing. They are upset about how the truth came out, not what the truth is. Only the Liberal Party of Canada would kick people out of caucus for telling the truth.

Still, Canadians aren’t so much embracing the Conservatives but instead deserting the Liberal party in droves, according to a new Angus Reid Institute poll.

Andrew Scheer and his Conservatives are picking up some votes from disenchanted Justin Trudeau Liberal supporters, according to a new poll. ( Sean Kilpatrick )

That’s a benefit to other parties — including the New Democrats, Green Party and the newly-minted People’s Party of Canada — who are seeing their fortunes rise as the governing party falls out of public favour. “The Liberals are just seeing quicksand. The floor is no longer stable,” said Shachi Kurl, Angus Reid executive director. “Trudeaumania was very, very real but Canadian voters are no longer feeling very manic.” In 2015, “Trudeaumania” convinced first-time voters, youth and non-regular voters to come out and cast a ballot. But it’s unclear whether the party will be able to retain that youth base this time around.

Article Continued Below

Kurl pointed to Pierre Trudeau’s rise to power in the late 1960s noting he enjoyed “Trudeaumania” before ending his last term as prime minister in 1984 as a polarizing politician. And if an election were held tomorrow, it is unlikely the Liberals would hold onto a majority: Fewer than 60 per cent of 2015 Liberals would vote for the party again. In contrast, the Conservatives are holding 90 per cent of their 2015 base. Levels of Conservative support remain essentially unchanged from last month — where they captured 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote. Noting the Liberal Party’s relatively low retention of 2015 supporters, Kurl said it’s interesting to see where those voters are going. As the party bleeds votes, one in eight 2015 Liberals say they would support the Conservatives; one in 10 say the same of the NDP. Kurl added a handful have drifted to the Greens, while a significant portion remain undecided. Demographics are a huge driver of partisanship: Men and older Canadians slant Conservative, while women and younger voters stick with the Liberals or other left-of-centre parties.

Meanwhile, nearly half of all Canadians said they “strongly disapprove” of Trudeau in comparison to less than 10 per cent who “strongly approve.” “We’ve seen those stratospheric approval numbers that were in the 60s come down to the 30s over the last three years,” Kurl said. “Trudeau’s personal star is dimming. Not just the campaign, the party, the government, an entire international brand is built around a single person.”

That’s where the Liberals are running into “massive” trouble across the country, she added. Now, Canadians have a more favourable view of Scheer (44 per cent) and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh (39 per cent) than Trudeau (36 per cent). And while the Liberals lead by a wide margin in the city of Toronto, they are neck-and-neck with the NDP in the city of Vancouver, and trailing in the rest of B.C. and Ontario. In B.C. — where the NDP and Greens support is strongest — Scheer’s Conservatives hold a wide lead over the Liberals. The survey noted this likely helped to split left-of-centre respondents. Meanwhile, the Conservative party is leading by wide margins in Prairie provinces and by smaller four-point margins in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Quebec, the one outlier, is seeing a four-way split in support between the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and Greens. Still, a lot can change during election campaigns. For instance, in 2015, each of the three main parties held the lead in Angus Reid Institute polling between the time the writ dropped and election day. Kurl said there is enough time and space for the Liberals to bounce back and coalesce the left-of-centre vote. And it doesn’t mean that Trudeau should step down, she argued. Instead, it would require a pivot to focus less on the man and instead, more on the party, its policies and mission. “We’ve seen leaders do this in the past,” Kurl said, pointing to Jean Chretien’s 1993 campaign which was fraught with leadership critiques. “So what did the Liberal party do? They effectively built a team. It wasn’t Team Chrétien, it was Team Liberal.” Kurl said Trudeau can do the same thing. But, there isn’t evidence of that — yet. “The vote bleed, where it is going, and just how devastating it is for the Liberals today as people abandon the party based on a visceral reaction to Justin Trudeau says to me that the Liberals maybe need to take the weekend and go have a very deep think about what’s next,” Kurl said. Poll results were based on an online survey conducted from March 11-25 among a randomized sample of 5,807 Canadian adults who are members of the Angus Reid Forum. It carried a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

At the Conservative Party’s annual think-fest this weekend, Scheer spoke passionately about quickly reining in spending and balancing the federal books, were he to become prime minister.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, shown at the Manning Networking Conference in Ottawa on Saturday, has his sights set on some central pieces of Liberal fiscal policy, Heather Scoffield writes. ( Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Contrary to Liberal spin, he did not propose chopping social programs. But he does have his sights on some central — and vulnerable — pieces of Liberal fiscal policy: the Canada Infrastructure Bank, and multimillion-dollar contributions to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Neither one of those initiatives have panned out as the Liberals have billed, at least not yet. But nixing those initiatives comes with consequences. And they wouldn’t get the Conservatives anywhere near eliminating the deficits of $20 billion expected for this coming fiscal year and next.

Article Continued Below

The Canada Infrastructure Bank was rolled out with much fanfare in late 2016, making good on a Liberal election commitment. The $35-billion, loaves-and-fishes dream was that the government would provide some capital and expertise, attract the attention of big private-sector funds, and then leverage the federal money many times over. There would be jobs aplenty, new roads, bridges and upgraded ports everywhere, and a stronger economy in the end — all at a relatively low cost to taxpayers because the private sector would provide the bulk of the financing. But if success is in the offing, it’s hard to discern. The Conservatives say the bank is a risky boondoggle, and the NDP says it’s privatization by stealth. So far, the infrastructure bank has only approved a single project, one that was well underway before the federal financing facility got involved. In August, the infrastructure bank provided a $1.28-billion low-interest loan for the light-rail network around Montreal. Since then, nothing but a lot of vague talk about projects that are almost, but not quite, ready. That includes two new budget initiatives announced just last week. Finance Minister Bill Morneau earmarked $750 million to build a rural broadband network that would bring high-speed internet access to every community in Canada — a fraction of the $6-billion price tag the budget sets on the initiative. The rest would come from the private sector, with the help of — you guessed it — the Canada Infrastructure Bank. It would put in $1 billion over 10 years, and attract an additional $2 billion from the private sector.

Similarly, the budget leans heavily on the infrastructure bank to finance cheaper and more efficient electricity, through hydro. The bank has said it would put $5 billion towards green infrastructure, and some of that could eventually go toward connecting hydro grids between provinces. So, would Scheer forego plans for rural broadband and a more efficient east-west electricity grid? Would he propose another way to pay for similar goals? We don’t know that yet.

Article Continued Below

But even if Scheer cancelled it outright, because of the way the infrastructure bank is accounted for, the federal books would not zoom to balance right away. The bank is set to receive a total of $2.8-billion in federal spending by March 2022, according to the 2017 budget. As for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a cancellation of Canada’s commitment of $256 million over five years would be a baby step in eliminating the deficit. But the cost would be to Canada’s relationship with China at a delicate time — when China is furious with Canada for detaining a Huawei executive, and is retaliating by blocking Canadian canola and imprisoning Canadians in China. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in 2016 that Canada wanted to join the controversial bank, parting ways with the United States and Japan who fear the Beijing-based institution was an instrument of Chinese hegemony. The goal was twofold: brownie points with China for adding G7 heft to its financial strategy, and opening the door for Canadian companies to the huge and growing Asian market. Scheer says he would rather Canada take a more straightforward and principled approach to China, and save money at the same time. His larger point this weekend is that he would lead a government that would get out of the way, enabling individuals and companies alike to take full advantage of market opportunities. Ironically, the Liberals see both the infrastructure bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as ways of doing just that. We await the details.

Scheer said in a statement: “Today, Liberal MPs have let Canadians know where they stand. They have chosen to condemn colleagues who spoke truth to power and to prop up a prime minister who is drowning in scandal.

“The message they have sent today is clear: If you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party of Canada.

“Canadians will view the removal of Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal caucus for exactly what it is: A betrayal of justice. Elected officials are supposed to protect individuals who blow the whistle on government misconduct and corruption, not punish them. However, in expelling Ms. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould from their caucus, they have done exactly that.

“For Ms. Wilson-Raybould, it is the second time she has been fired for standing up for the rule of law. The first time by Justin Trudeau. The second time by her own colleagues. This should tell Canadians everything they need to know about how things work in the Liberal Party of Canada. They look the other way on corruption and punish those won’t do the same.

“Liberal MPs are upset about the wrong thing. They are upset about how the truth came out, not what the truth is. Only the Liberal Party of Canada would kick people out of caucus for telling the truth.

Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer told a crowd at the Manning Centre Conference on Saturday that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget, but wouldn’t say by when.

“Yes, we will balance the budget,” Scheer said to applause at the conservative networking event, during a Q&A with Global News’ Mercedes Stephenson.

Scheer said balancing the budget would be done through “a combination of big ticket items with controlling the rate of growth.”

“There’s been such rapid increases in the rate of growth of government spending that we can get a lot of the way there just by restricting the growth of government spending back to closer to inflation and population growth,” Scheer said.

Scheer said a Conservative government would cut funding of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which was established under the current Liberal government, as well as to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Scheer offered little specifics about when a Conservative government would deliver a balanced budget however, only saying it would be “over a shorter period of time,” if elected in the October general election.

The Trudeau government presented their final budget of this mandate, which projects a $19.7 billion deficit for 2019-20. In 2015, the Liberals ran on a campaign promise of returning to a balanced budget by the upcoming year. They have yet to post a surplus or an annual deficit less than $14 billion since assuming office that year. In this year’s budget, the Liberals are projecting the deficit to fall slightly next year, before declining to $9.8 billion in 2023-24.

Presenting a smart climate policy could be the key to victory.

The Chinese written character for “crisis” perfectly frames the art of politics. It consists of two characters: danger and opportunity. In politics, danger to your opponent is opportunity for you.

So stands the Conservative Party of Canada in the wake of a weakened Liberal government struggling to overcome the SNC-Lavalin affair. As voters cast a jaundiced eye at re-electing Justin Trudeau’s Liberals, they will also take a second look at Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives. Scheer’s party needs to ensure it is not wanting when it comes to giving voters what they want.

Poll after poll, including one last month by Abacus Data, suggests that climate change is one of the top three issues for Canadians. Ignoring it or, worse, demonizing it, will hinder, not help, Conservatives gain votes. Happily, politics, principle, and policy can align nicely for a 2019 Conservative climate opportunity.

Politics

If Conservatives believe they will gallop to a healthy majority government based on the SNC-Lavalin scandal alone, they are wrong. The party needs to develop policies that attract new voters rather than relying on old coalitions of traditional voters or just hoping Liberals stay home.

Those new CPC voters are first-time and younger voters, disenchanted Liberals, women and unmotivated progressive conservatives. Each would respond to a stronger and more principled climate message than the party has dared issue so far. Simply put: carbon tax opposition is not actually a climate policy.

First-time and younger voters particularly believe climate change is real and needs to be addressed (84 percent of voters 18-34 in a recent Angus Reid poll). Women are nine points more likely to say climate change is a problem, according to Abacus Data, helping contribute to the CPC’s current gender gap.

Writing off those voters by ignoring or downplaying the threat of climate change will create a brand crisis for the CPC that will rear itself not just in this election but in elections to come. It will place a ceiling on their support. Meanwhile, Liberals disenchanted over their government’s ethics problems, or progressive conservatives worried about Liberal mismanagement and conservative nativism, can be stirred by a new, forward-looking climate policy.

How much does this add up to? According to Abacus Data research from November 2017, half of Canadians won’t contemplate voting for a party that doesn’t have a climate change plan and only 6 percent prefer a party or candidate that ignores the issue.

In the 2015 federal election, only 7.4 percentage points separated the Liberals from the Conservatives. A 4-point shift to the CPC would have them even with either one winning in the end. With current polls showing Conservatives in front, a 3-4 percent “climate gain” would cement a CPC majority victory.

Principles

To build an effective climate policy for Canada different from the Liberal government, the CPC should revert to conservative principles as its guide. Many are relevant:

Responsibility – to current and future generations, as well as the world, for climate action.

– to current and future generations, as well as the world, for climate action. Conservation – of our natural environment and heritage as a legacy for all by reducing climate impacts.

– of our natural environment and heritage as a legacy for all by reducing climate impacts. Subsidiarity – recognizing that environmental and climate policy decisions reside best within the level of jurisdiction constitutionally responsible and best positioned to deal with them.

– recognizing that environmental and climate policy decisions reside best within the level of jurisdiction constitutionally responsible and best positioned to deal with them. Enterprise – a belief that finding practical business and technological solutions can build prosperity in the inevitable low-carbon economy.

– a belief that finding practical business and technological solutions can build prosperity in the inevitable low-carbon economy. Individualism – respecting the primacy of the individual over the state and corporation and crafting climate policy that reflects smart government intervention and industry responsibility.

These evergreen principles of traditional conservatism as a basis for climate policy can, in turn, be reinforced by today’s populist conservatism. “Polluter pays” is a populist conservative refrain that actually recognizes the responsibility of corporate polluters to mitigate the environmental damage they cause.

Policy

Choosing the right policy tool is a function of achieving your climate goals and target. The best goal for any climate policy is this: The most emissions reductions at the least economic cost.

While carbon pricing is seen as the most effective tool of all for many experts, it is clearly a non-starter with the CPC. Even if it weren’t, there are limits to the effectiveness of carbon pricing in terms of securing cost-effective emissions reductions equally across the country and across sectors.

So, what is the Conservative path forward?

Avoid the Target Trap

The GHG reduction target is the “original sin” of every climate policy in Canada. Virtually every climate target set in Canada – federally and provincially – has been missed. Establishing overly ambitious, non-viable, politically unachievable targets is bad public policy, bad economic policy, and bad environmental policy. What Canada is missing is a realistic and viable climate target that can actually be achieved.

The Liberal government picked the Harper government’s proposed Paris target, made it its own, and presumed it would inoculate it against Conservative attacks on climate policy. What the CPC must do is re-frame Canada’s climate ambition so it is realistic, principled and achievable. As a first step, CPC should resist setting another “top-down” target for its own climate policy, as was done for Kyoto, Copenhagen and Paris.

New Climate Governance Mechanisms

GHG targets and climate actions must be taken out of the political sphere when it comes to data, analysis and advice. Instead, a Conservative government should develop a “ground-up” series of goals based on actual measurement and application of viable, timely policy measures that result in tangible emissions reductions.

It would do this by creating an independent Climate Advisory Commission with a mandate to review and advise Parliament on a series of five-year, made-in-Canada GHG reduction goals.

These goals should be based on: (a) best scientific evidence and the expected climate impacts on Canada; (b) reduced carbon emissions over defined five-year periods; (c) meeting the jurisdictional responsibilities of all governments; (d) fostering a low-carbon economic future for jobs and competitiveness; and (e) international factors and obligations. The commission would monitor progress and advise on adjustments regularly to Parliament.

Instead of a static, long-term national target that is divorced from short-term political and governmental accountability, the Climate Advisory Commission would advise on building a five-year “carbon budget” that specifies an amount of GHGs that can be emitted; or “carbon savings account goals” (as being set in Manitoba) that set the amount of carbon that must be reduced. This type of approach focuses on actual emissions reductions in manageable, incremental improvements. Each five-year period would contain a series of specific measurable actions aimed at achieving the fixed reduction goal and ensuring progress towards longer term reductions. Shortfalls from any one five-year emission reduction goal would be added to the next five-year carbon reduction goal.

Momentum is crucial to progress. Looking at reductions in shorter and closer time increments focuses on what’s achievable while illuminating the additional steps needed in the next five-year period. Progress spurs more progress.

This form of governance would be original and groundbreaking. It would be a first for Canada at the national level (Manitoba is developing this provincially), and only the second, internationally (the UK has had carbon budgets since 2008). It would liberate us from the party politicization and polarization on the issue, which hinders progress and frustrates and alienates Canadians by de-politicizing the data, evidence and advice. The political debate would shift to means, not ends.

Unified Climate Federalism

A unified climate approach nationally does not require a uniform climate policy approach. Unified means charting a common course, not all necessarily using the same means. This aligns squarely with Conservative federalism principles.

At the same time, Conservatives should embrace a new form of coordinative climate federalism that constitutionally fits within this new governance approach of shared federal/provincial environmental responsibility. The Liberal government’s core mistake on climate change was to shoehorn a new intergovernmental infrastructure into existing provincial plans assuming they would stand fast. It sought a one-size-fits-all approach that does not meet the overriding realities of Canada’s geographic energy economy, sclerotic federalism and clashing electoral cycles.

Even the UN agreements on climate change refer to “common but differentiated responsibilities” between countries as the basis for climate action. As a federation, Canada should subscribe to this same approach. A Conservative federal government would state its jurisdictional competence on climate action and act accordingly, thereby clarifying the field for provinces, territories and municipalities.

A Conservative Climate Tool Box

Having ruled out explicit carbon pricing, Conservatives must now choose from a range of tools that don’t involve direct carbon pricing. These fall into three broad categories: regulations and mandates, financial incentives or voluntary actions. None is perfect alone, but together they can have an impact.

The operating framework needs to be one Conservatives can politically accept. They should dust off the Harper government’s 2007 Turning the Corner plan and update its core elements for today’s reality. Here’s a 10-point Conservative climate plan that is realistic, reasonable and responsible:

A Clean Fuel Standard to reduce Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through the increased use of lower carbon fuels, energy sources and technologies. A Pan-Canadian Industrial Carbon Emission Performance Standard System that aligns current and forthcoming provincial systems. Making sure the provinces have compatible performance standards systems will help business avoid duplication, overlap, and ensure level competitive playing fields. A Pan-Canadian Carbon Offsets Market to support industrial compliance with the performance standard system and engage the largely Conservative-supporting agriculture sector into offering financially appealing carbon sequestration credits. A Canadian Five-Year “Social Cost of Carbon” Price (the measure of economic harm from carbon emissions expressed as a cost per tonne of carbon) fixed by the independent Climate Advisory Commission rather than an arbitrary rising carbon price schedule. Carbon Savings Account Trust paid into by industrial polluters based on the independently set social price of carbon, leveraged by the private sector into direct technology improvements, matched by federal investments. Responsible Oilsands Growth (yes, words from Turning the Corner) that maintains the current industrial cap on overall emissions or applies equivalent stringent performance standards. A National Home and Commercial Buildings Retrofit Program that (a) reduces emissions and (b) stimulates economic return for small business and suburban homeowners. Accelerated National Building Codes and Standards for new residential and commercial houses and buildings. International Emissions Reduction Credits via ITMOs (International Trading Mitigation Options), under the Paris climate agreement. Canada could gain carbon credits from this with our established carbon capture and storage and small modular nuclear reactor technologies knowledge. A Provincial Climate Incentive Transfer from Ottawa that provides a compensatory incentive to provinces that establish plans to reduce emissions from major economic sectors defined as comprising a high percentage of provincial emissions and share of the provincial economy.

A reasonable, realistic policy alternative that is grounded in conservative principles is not as much a stretch as current Conservatives might think. Right now, Liberals are framing Conservatives as anti-climate due to their singular opposition to a carbon tax and unwillingness to put a real climate policy alternative before Canadians. Climate change action can represent a real electoral opportunity for the Conservatives should they choose to seize the opportunity.

""Andrew Scheer here.""

If you live in the four provinces where the federal carbon tax is being introduced, you might get a text message from the Conservative Party leader telling you to fill your gas tank this weekend.

The mass-texting campaign against the carbon pricing policy that will take effect April 1 in New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan will direct voters to the Conservatives’ petition against the carbon tax. And the texts might pop up on your phone even if you’ve never given your phone number to the Conservative Party of Canada.

In addition to pulling phone numbers from its own databases, the party will use software that auto-generates numbers with specific area codes in order to blast out the text messages.

One of those texts might look like this:

""Andrew Scheer here.

Trudeau’s carbon tax will raise gas prices on Monday.

So fill your tank!""

The party is also running radio ads against the carbon tax in Saint John, Ottawa, Toronto and Winnipeg, among other markets.

“This effort will be about informing Canadians about the cost of this Liberal tax on everyday items, including the price of gas, and how for wealthy Liberals like Justin Trudeau, an extra $100 a month on bills might not be a big deal, but it matters a lot to a family trying to make their household budget last to the end of the month,” Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said in an email to CTV News.

Hann said there will also be co-ordinated social media campaigns and door-to-door canvassing efforts in the affected provinces over the weekend.

The Liberal government is requiring provinces to impose a price on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per tonne this year and rising by $10 per tonne annually until it hits $50 in 2022. Since Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick have refused to introduce their own carbon pricing plans, Ottawa is imposing its own tax on them.

The Liberals have said the carbon tax is necessary to combat the effects of climate change, and pointed out that rebates will be available to the residents of the four provinces through the tax system.

Speaking at the annual Manning Networking Conference, the Tory leader was asked by someone in the audience why he was unwilling to condemn Islamophobia.

WATCH: Scheer tackles Islamophobia, vows to balance federal budget at Manning Conference.

""I don't believe that's true,"" Scheer responded, noting that the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion earlier this week condemning the terrorist attacks against two mosques in New Zealand and the need to ""confront hatred, Islamophobia, and white supremacy, in all their forms.""

""I reject anyone who would, you know, who would speak out based on Islamaphobic principles whether or not, you know, that's somebody who is trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith in together, or whether it is people who are trying to antagonise elements of the society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith,"" Scheer told the crowd of Conservatives, peppering his comments with uncharacteristic ""ums"" and ""ahs.""

To me the important thing is to speak out against those who would in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer

""To me the important thing is to speak out against those who would in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other,"" he said.

Scheer was criticized this week for failing to do just that.



The president of the Canadian Labour Congress, Hassan Yussuff, told reporters Thursday that Scheer should be held responsible for failing to condemn yellow-vest protesters who showed up in Ottawa in February to demonstrate against pipeline delays while spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric.

""For the leader of the Opposition not able to condemn them ... and stand on a stage with someone who is associated with hate and racism and somehow to not acknowledge that? ... That is a fundamental, I think, failing on his part, and I condemn his behaviour,"" Yussuff said at an event outlining efforts by the union movement to combat Islamophobia and the steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslims.

""I don't think he should be excused for it, because he should know better, and if he doesn't, something is fundamentally wrong with his leadership, in my view,"" Hassan said.

Scheer spoke to the crowd of protesters, many of whom had lost their jobs in the energy sector and driven from Alberta and Scheer's home province of Saskatchewan to make their point to the government. The protesters also heard from Faith Goldy, the social media personality with white nationalist ties.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said he was concerned that not calling out behaviour against Muslims would give licence to others to act on their hatred and their ideologies.

""We are looking to our leaders for leadership, and being naively ignorant or wilfully blind, neither is acceptable and Canadians should demand better,"" he said.

Earlier during Scheer's chat with Global television's Mercedes Stephenson, the Tory leader was asked how he deals with accusations that he is ""not being tough enough"" with groups advocating violence.

""I deal with [it] by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,"" Scheer responded.

Last week, the Conservative leader was criticized for issuing a statement in response to the massacre in New Zealand without mentioning that the attacks had taken place in mosques, against Muslims gathered for Friday prayers.

There are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred. I am praying for peace for the families of those lost and recovery for those injured. 2/2 — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) March 15, 2019

He said his statement condemned hateful ideology by anyone who promotes any type of superiority of one race or religion over others. ""I condemn that unequivocally.""

The Liberals, Scheer said, had tried to ""score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner"" by politicizing his original statement and the attacks. The Liberals, he noted, did not levy the same criticism against Governor General Julie Payette's comments, which also did not mention the victims were Muslims.

The Tories, he said, are an open, inclusive and welcoming party for people of all faiths and backgrounds.

In a speech in the House of Commons on Monday, the prime minister said events such as the carnage in Christchurch were precisely the right time to talk about politics.

""The best way to support people is to acknowledge that there is a problem and take concrete steps to fix it,"" he said. ""As a global community, we have a choice to make. Will we denounce our leaders who turn a blind eye to those who incite violence?



WATCH: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks out after the Christchurch shooting.



""Will we denounce our colleagues who tell racist or misogynist jokes without anyone saying anything? Will we denounce Internet trolls, these cowards who spread hate and hurl insults under the cover of anonymity?

""Ultimately, will we do the right thing? Will we bury our heads in the sand today only to bury them in our hands later?""

Will we bury our heads in the sand today only to bury them in our hands later? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

On Friday, during a town hall meeting in Thunder Bay, a foreign student from Pakistan took the opportunity to thank the prime minister for his words.

""When I heard your speech, being a Muslim and a resident of Canada, it was the most proud moment for me. That prime minister of Canada, Mr. Justin Trudeau, has addressed Muslims. Undoubtedly, your words matter. They affect and they impact. Mr. Prime Minister, I thank you very much,"" she said. ""Undoubtedly, I feel more secure, among all the countries, in Canada right now,"" she said as Trudeau smiled, his head bowed. She received a standing ovation from the crowd.

The Liberals have sought to differentiate themselves from the Tories vis-à-vis their relationship with Muslim Canadians.

Scheer, in some ways, has helped them. He voted, for example, against a motion two years ago condemning Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination. The motion called for a study on Islamophobia, data collection on hate crimes and a government strategy to deal with religious discrimination.

Scheer argued that the motion, by singling out one faith, was not inclusive. He raised concerns that by not exactly defining Islamophobia, it could lead to stifling of free speech for those who criticize the religion.",Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer Rejects Accusations He's Soft On Islamophobia,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/23/conservative-leader-andrew-scheer-rejects-accusations-hes-soft-on-islamophobia_a_23699178/

Andrew Scheer says criticism over his initial failure to mention that Muslims were targeted in the recent mass murder in New Zealand is “completely baseless” and driven by “disgusting” Liberal efforts to score political points from the tragedy.

But in answering a question Saturday about how he deals with that criticism, the federal Conservative leader once again initially made no reference to Muslims.

“I deal with it by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,” Scheer told the Manning Networking Conference, an annual gathering of this country’s conservative thinkers, strategists and politicians.

“When you look at statements I’ve made condemning hateful ideologies, those who would promote any type of superiority of one race or religion over the others, I condemn that unequivocally.”

Scheer noted that the second statement he issued on the day of the New Zealand shootings “absolutely did include the reference to the faith community that was attacked,” although he did not at first identify that faith community.

On March 15, an avowed white supremacist shot and killed 50 Muslim worshippers at two New Zealand mosques. In a statement posted that day on Twitter, Scheer condemned the attacks as “a despicable act of evil” against “peaceful worshippers,” without specifically mentioning where they occurred or who was targeted.

A few hours later – after the initial statement drew criticism even from top aides of former prime minister Stephen Harper – Scheer issued a second statement, which he referred to Saturday as his “official statement.” It specifically referred to the horrific “terror attack on two New Zealand mosques” and voiced his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community.”

On Saturday, Scheer blamed the Liberals for stirring up the controversy, accusing them of attempting “to score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner.” Moreover, he argued that initial tweets by Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Governor General Julie Payette also didn’t specifically mention mosques or Muslims.

Later, as he took questions from members of the audience, Scheer was asked why he’s never said the word “Islamophobia.”

“I don’t believe that’s true,” he responded, noting that all parties supported a motion last week in the House of Commons. That motion, which he didn’t describe, condemned the mosque attacks and affirmed the need to “confront hatred, Islamophobia, and white supremacy, in all their forms.”

“I reject anyone who would speak out based on Islamophobic principles, whether or not that’s somebody who is trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith in together or whether it’s people who are trying to antagonize elements of society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith,” Scheer added.

“To me the important thing is to speak out against those who in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other.”

Scheer also used his appearance at the Manning conference to promise that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget — but he didn’t say when.

He said the Liberals have made such increases to government spending that a Conservative government could get most of the way to balance simply by holding annual spending increases to the rate of inflation and population growth. As well, he said billions could be saved by scrapping “some big-ticket items” introduced by the Liberals such as the federal infrastructure bank.

The longer Prime Minister Justin Trudeau goes racking up large annual deficits, the harder it will be return to balance, Scheer suggested. But he said Canadians have “a window” in this fall’s federal election to “limit the damage and get back to balanced budgets over a shorter period of time.”

Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s latest budget forecasts deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years, declining to just under $10 billion in five years. It makes no attempt to forecast when the budget might be balanced.","Despite criticism, Andrew Scheer again declines to say victims of New Zealand massacre were Muslims",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-despite-criticism-andrew-scheer-again-declines-to-say-victims-of-new/

At a press conference this morning, Scheer demanded that the standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics agree to hold a study of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The standing committee on justice and human rights ended a study of the matter last week, prompting accusations by opposition members of a Liberal coverup.

Conservative members will put forward a motion at tomorrow’s committee meeting, which will ask Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to waive all constraints currently preventing Wilson-Raybould from speaking fully.

In recent days, there has been public debate over whether Wilson-Raybould can speak freely without penalty in the House of Commons under parliamentary privilege or if another waiver from Trudeau is needed.

Scheer said the concern about parliamentary immunity is it doesn’t “absolve” the former ministers from the oaths they had taken, referring to the cabinet pledge to the Privy Council Office to “keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council.”

“That is what Justin Trudeau waived for Ms. Wilson-Raybould but only for a narrow period of time,” Scheer said, adding that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should be allowed to speak about events occurring after the former justice minister resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“Clearly there were events that happened after her time as attorney general.”

Last month, Trudeau waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences about the SNC-Lavalin affair, but the order-in-council only applies to Wilson-Raybould’s time as attorney general and excludes discussions between her and the director of public prosecutions.

Asked about the potential repercussions of Wilson-Raybould speaking in the House, Scheer said there are “clearly consequences to people’s reputations when they’ve taken oaths.”

“We’re saying don’t put them in that position if you’ve really got nothing to hide,” he said.

Scheer added that after a number of Liberal MPs recently said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should speak their mind in order to settle the affair, there is now “consensus” on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely.

The committee motion will also ask Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott to testify before April 5 and to allow the committee to table its findings in Parliament. Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4 over the Liberal government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

There are nine voting members of the ethics committee, including six Liberals, two Conservatives, and one NDP. The chair, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, does not have a vote.

The SNC-Lavalin controversy began on Feb. 7 when the Globe and Mail reported allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to reverse a decision made by the director of public prosecutions to move forward with a criminal case involving the Montreal-based engineering giant.

Since then, Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerry Butts, Wilson-Raybould, and Philpott have resigned from their jobs. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick has also announced his retirement.

A recording that Wilson-Raybould had secretly made of a call between herself and the Privy Council Clerk as well as emails, texts and her written statement were tabled to the committee.

In a statement, Scheer said: “These documents and recordings are concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution. He personally gave the orders and when the former Attorney General refused to follow them and break the law, she was fired.

“Ms. Wilson-Raybould repeatedly told the Prime Minister and his top officials that their actions were ‘entirely inappropriate’ and amounted to ‘political interference’. Despite her objections, the Clerk of the Privy Council pressured her and made it clear that her job was on the line.

“Justin Trudeau also told Canadians what he knew to be false. He knew that his Attorney General had serious concerns about his plan to get SNC-Lavalin off of serious criminal charges. But he looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him. This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation.

“The entire SNC-Lavalin scandal is corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.

At a press conference in Ottawa Monday, Andrew Scheer again called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fully waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence for Wilson-Raybould ahead of an ethics committee meeting Tuesday on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Scheer also said Trudeau must waive cabinet confidentiality for Philpott, who told Maclean's magazine last week that there is more to the controversy that must come out.

Watch:

The Tory leader noted how some Liberal MPs have, in recent days, publicly challenged Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to speak freely about the matter in the House of Commons, where parliamentary privilege protects members from facing legal action for their words.

Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould upped the ante in an interview with Global's ""The West Block"" that aired Sunday, saying that if both ex-ministers feel more needs to be said, they should ""put that on the record.""

""This is clearly a coordinated communications attempt over the last few days,"" Scheer told reporters.

There is ""now consensus on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely about their involvement in the SNC-Lavalin affair,"" he said.

If Liberals want to hear more from Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — who resigned as Treasury Board president over the government's handling of the controversy — then the prime minister should ""make it official"" and absolve them of constraints, the Tory leader said.

'When I take oaths, it's serious'

But Scheer, a former House Speaker, poured cold water on the idea that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott can easily stand up in the House and air things out.

While parliamentary privilege protects MPs from ""recourse about what they say,"" Scheer offered, it does not absolve them of the ethical and reputational consequences of breaking oaths without a greenlight from the prime minister.

""When I take oaths, it's serious. It's a matter of conscience for me,"" Scheer said. ""It's not something that I would break. There are clearly consequences to people's reputations when they've taken an oath. We're saying, don't put them in that position.""

Current and former cabinet ministers are part of the Privy Council, a body appointed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the prime minister to ""advise the Queen on issues of importance to the country."" Membership in the exclusive club comes with the title of ""Honourable"" and lasts for life, unless the appointment is withdrawn by the Governor General.

As a condition for joining cabinet, both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott swore they would:

""... be a true and faithful servant to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, as a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council for Canada. I will in all things to be treated, debated and resolved in Privy Council, faithfully, honestly and truly declare my mind and my opinion. I shall keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council. Generally, in all things I shall do as a faithful and true servant ought to do for Her Majesty. So help me God.""

Scheer took the same oath when he was sworn into the Privy Council in 2017. The Tory leader thanked Trudeau at the time for the honour.

Trudeau partially waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences for Wilson-Raybould ahead of her explosive testimony to the House justice committee last month.

The waiver allowed the former attorney general to speak about the issues surrounding SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution when she served in the role, but not about the events that transpired after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14.

Over four hours, Wilson-Raybould told MPs that she faced sustained and inappropriate pressure from Trudeau and other government officials, when she was attorney general, to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial on fraud and bribery charges.

Though her words sparked immediate calls from Tories for Trudeau to resign, the prime minister denied Wilson-Raybould's version of events. His former principal secretary later testified that Wilson-Raybould did not raise concerns about inappropriate pressure until she was shuffled from her powerful role.

Speaking about the issue with reporters in Maple Ridge, B.C. Monday, Trudeau said his government issued an ""unprecedented waiver"" which allowed Wilson-Raybould to speak about the specific issue of whether or not she faced undue pressure over SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general.

Trudeau also said he had a ""cordial conversation"" with Wilson-Raybould last week. The Vancouver-Granville MP has said she will seek re-election as a Liberal MP this fall, as will Philpott in the Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville.

""I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward,"" he said. ""They have both indicated that they look forward to running again as Liberals in the next election and I look forward to continuing to have their strong and thoughtful voices as part of our team.""

Wilson-Raybould promises more 'evidence'

Asked if he agreed with the growing number of Liberal MPs encouraging Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to speak out in the House, Trudeau said those are decisions to be made by the ex-ministers.

""What we have done as a government is grant an unprecedented waiver so that a full airing could happen at the justice committee of everything in regards to the SNC-Lavalin file and the time that is in question, when the former minister of justice was minister of justice,"" he said.

Last week, Liberal MPs on the justice committee ended the group's investigation into the matter. On Friday, Wilson-Raybould wrote to the committee to says she will make a written submission to the group and provide copies of emails and text messages she referenced during her testimony.

""I also have relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my committee appearance,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

NDP Deputy Leader and Environment Critic Alexandre Boulerice made the following statement :

“Canadians are already feeling the impacts of climate change – the past year has seen extreme temperatures, rising floods, and raging wild fires threaten communities across the country. The IPCC and the world’s scientists have stated clearly and firmly that we must take bold and immediate action to ensure a safe and sustainable world.

But while thousands of young people across Canada are striking for the action needed to ensure their future, the Liberals and Conservatives are failing to show the climate leadership these young people and all Canadians deserve.

Today, Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have made clear once again that they have no plan to tackle climate change. Their previous failed policies and weak emissions targets only made the problem worse and tarnished Canada’s reputation. And despite promising their climate plan months ago, Canadians are still waiting for the details. Instead, all the Conservatives have to offer is a commitment to undo work that is underway. When asked if he would transfer the burden from consumers to the biggest polluters, Scheer refused to answer.

Tackling climate change means we all have to work together and throw everything we have at the problem. Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have failed to bring the provinces together in support of a federal carbon tax. At the same time, they are asking everyday Canadians to do more, while practically eliminating the carbon tax for some of our biggest polluters. And where true leaders would focus on bringing people together to meet the serious challenge posed by climate change, the Liberals and Conservatives are dividing Canadians further – pitting families, workers, businesses, communities and even provinces and regions against each other.

The futures of our children and grandchildren depend upon the actions we take now to tackle global climate change. Canadians are up to the challenge, but it will take all of us, doing our part and working together, to achieve this goal.

New Democrats have a bold plan with practical solutions to move us towards a greener, fairer and more sustainable economy. We will bring Canadians together to set ambitious targets with measures to hold the government accountable, take concrete action to reduce emissions, invest in building the low-carbon economy we need now, and support workers and communities so that no one is left behind.”",NDP Statement on Trudeau and Scheer’s Failed Climate Leadership,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-statement-trudeau-and-scheers-failed-climate-leadership

By one count, 600 dogs have leapt into the gorge below.

Some 50 of them have jumped to their deaths. There is no obvious reason for this canine suicide.

“Some say there are rational explanations involving the terrain and the scents of mammals in the animals that may drive the dogs into a frenzy,” reports The New York Times. “Other explanations take on a more paranormal tone.”

This crazed, mysterious behaviour now has a copy-cat effect. Those looking for a similarly baffling human parallel should look to events in Ottawa this spring.

To foreigners, our current melodrama is madness, a kind of derangement syndrome. “Are you nuts?” asks a visiting friend from London. The poor man – a leading international lawyer – is staggered by the circus in Canada’s Parliament. He sees us as a country of stability, sobriety and moderation.

To him it seems much ado about nothing: no money, no sex, no criminality. Expecting John Profumo – the sex-and-spy scandal that unseated the British Conservatives in 1964 – he finds the laments of Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould. On the Richter scale of impropriety, this one is a tremor.

Forgive him; he’s British. Brexit is sad, self-inflicted and making Britain irrelevant in the world. But that debate goes to the heart of national character. A bumper sticker casts the result of the 2016 referendum in terms of Jane Austen: “Pride and Prejudice 52%; Sense and Sensibility 48%.”

To the rest of the world, Canada’s “crisis” is not existential. To our allies, our debate is parochial and petty. Worse, in a world of unrest where Canada’s progressiveness matters, it is self-indulgent.

In France, Emmanuel Macron battles the yellow vests. Anarchists and nihilists smash things up on Saturdays before breaking for brunch.

In Germany, Angela Merkel struggles to hold together a grand coalition while her country faces a succession question. The right rises, exploiting the refugee influx.

In the United States, Donald Trump declares an unprecedented national emergency, threatens to close the southern border and denies obstructing justice, which is yet to be shown. Meanwhile, he struts and swears on public platforms.

In Turkey and Hungary, authoritarianism reigns. In Israel, the indicted prime minister makes alliances with racists. In Italy, the right rises.

In Canada, though, we’re lost in our sordid little scream. Saint Jane denies “a power play” as she gives interviews, there to slip in the stiletto once again; Saint Jody records a conversation with an unknowing public servant. With every move, they weaken their government and strengthen the Conservatives, unmoved by women’s rights and Indigenous affairs.

Commentators have lost a sense of balance, seeing evil in ineptitude. The Conservatives, who denounced Wilson-Raybould last fall, now trumpet her virtue. Her loyalists ignore her lethargy as justice minister who left Stephen Harper’s policies in place and who wanted an outsider as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The obvious choice was Rosalie Abella – a woman, an immigrant, a Jew, the senior member of the high court and one of the great jurists of her generation.

My, my, we are on hard on ourselves. To critics, we cannot do anything right at home, where we have full employment, social peace and national unity unseen in a generation. A recent report card by an esteemed professor of international affairs and three graduate students at Carleton University gives the government’s gestural foreign policy a “C-” but overlooks two signal achievements: The successful re-negotiation of NAFTA and the admission of 58,000 Syrian refugees. In Canada, what good are laurels if you can’t recognize them?

Meanwhile, Andrew Scheer, the prime minister-in-waiting, shows his peculiar ignorance. He ignores Muslims in his first statement after the mass shootings in New Zealand and continues to support Brexit, which could have catastrophic consequences for Canada.

The chorus of harpies cares little about Scheer or Brexit or the grave dangers to Canada from climate change, as a shocking new report shows. Or that democracy is fading. Or that racism is rising.

In Canada, we are the dogs of Dumbarton, leaping into the abyss.

That is, if the province’s new secularism legislation, Bill 21, becomes law.

That’s what Quebec MNA Christopher Skeete, who serves as the parliamentary assistant to Quebec’s Premier Francois Legault, told Evan Solomon during an episode of CTV Question Period, airing Sunday.

“While [Singh] is working, if he chooses to be a police officer, we would ask him to remove his turban while at work, yes,” Skeete told Solomon.

Singh would be just one of many people impacted by the secularism bill, which was introduced in Quebec’s National Assembly Thursday. The proposed legislation would prevent certain public sector employees from wearing overt religious symbols at work. The bill specifically mentions teachers, police and court clerks, among other people in positions of authority in public sector workplaces.

“We’re saying that when you come to work, when you exercise the power of the state, that you leave your religion at the door, and I don’t think that’s too much to ask in a secular society,” Skeete said.

“Of course, they can always wear their religious symbols when they’re finished work.”

The bill has come under fire from civil rights groups and groups representing religious minorities. While the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedoms of conscience, religious expression and the right to equality, the bill invokes the notwithstanding clause to override those charter rights.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who represents a Quebec riding in the House of Commons, also criticized the proposed legislation.

“I don't think a lot of people feel that in a free society we should be legitimizing discrimination of our citizens based on religion,"" he said, speaking with reporters in New Brunswick on Thursday.

Singh has addressed Bill 21 as well. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he said “it’s something that’s going to hurt people.”

“I remember what it’s like to grow up and not feel like I belong, and I think about all the young people in Quebec right now that won’t be able to pursue, maybe, their dream job that won’t be able to become a police officer or a judge or a teacher -- and that, to me, is sad,” Singh said.

The Quebec government, however, has been defending its proposed legislation. They say they’re addressing something that has been a conversation in Quebec for 12 years -- and Skeete said Quebecers support the proposed law, even if advocacy groups warn it could tread on minority rights.

“Well we do live in a democracy, so you know, the majority often does determine the orientation that we take, but we always have to be careful when we make laws like this to make sure that we do respect minority rights,” he said.

Skeete emphasized that the legislation is all about balance.

“I think it’s just a question of how do we balance individual rights from collective rights and I realize that we’re on that line… but I do believe that ultimately it’s more important to have a truly secular state,” he said.

Skeete said the bill will undergo a consultation period where it will seek support from other parties and hear the concerns of affected groups. While he said the government is open to changing the bill, he said the changes would only take place “where we think it’s acceptable,” and “where it’s in line with what the population wants.”",Proposed secularism bill would force Singh to remove turban in public sector gig: Quebec MNA,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/proposed-secularism-bill-would-force-singh-to-remove-turban-in-public-sector-gig-quebec-mna-1.4358767

The title comes from a viral moment during Singh’s campaign for NDP leader, in which Singh responded to a heckler by saying Canadians must respond to hate with “love and courage.”

""This book is the story of my family and my personal experiences growing up – sometimes difficult ones. I often felt alone, unworthy, ashamed,” Singh said in a release from publisher Simon and Schuster Canada. “I hope this book helps some people feel less alone and know that they deserve love and happiness, no matter what they've gone through.”

While Singh is hardly the first politician to release a book during an election year, the publisher claims Love & Courage is “not a political memoir.”

“In this personal and heartfelt memoir, readers are invited to walk with Jagmeet through childhood to adulthood as he learns powerful, moving and sometimes traumatic lessons about overcoming adversity and the impact of not belonging,” the release says.

“It's a story of family, love, and courage, and how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.”

Singh intends to announce the policy proposal Friday during his keynote speech at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit, an annual gathering of progressive thinkers and New Democrats near Parliament Hill.

In an interview with the Star on Thursday, Singh said he wants to increase the proportion of capital gains profits that are taxed by the federal government. This “inclusion rate” is currently set at 50 per cent — meaning only half the profits people make by selling property or securities investments is subject to income tax. The NDP wants to increase that rate to 75 per cent, which Singh said party researchers predict would bring an additional $2.7 billion in tax revenue to the federal government each year. Capital gains are profits made from selling real estate — other than your primary residence — and from the sale of other investments, like stocks or certain businesses, that aren’t held in registered retirement or tax-free savings accounts. “The vast, vast majority of people that use this benefit are the wealthiest, the richest people in Canada,” Singh said, contrasting the capital gains inclusion rate with how most people’s salaries are taxed.

“We want a fairer system.” Capital gains taxes have been around for decades, and the inclusion rate Singh wants to increase has been changed as well — most recently in 2000, when the Liberal government led by Jean Chrétien slashed it from 75 to 50 per cent. Singh would reverse that change.

There were several media reports ahead of the 2017 budget that saw business analysts warn that increasing the proportion of capital gains that gets taxed would deter investment and innovation in Canada. Singh dismissed such concerns on Thursday, arguing a 75 per cent rate still gives capital gains better tax treatment than employee income. He added that the change would bring in more money that an NDP government would use to extend public health care to cover prescription medicine, dental and eye care, as well to build affordable housing units and fund a transition to cleaner energy. “There’s got to be some fairness to pay for the things that people need,” he said. “This is one of the ways we can do it.” The proposal to increase the tax on capital gains follows an announcement last fall, when Singh touted a trio of policy changes to crack down on tax dodgers and prevent the wealthy from hiding their money. He said the NDP would make changes to prevent companies from moving money overseas to avoid corporate taxes, and ban special types of company shares — called bearer bonds — that don’t require disclosure of who owns them. Singh also called on the Liberal government to close the so-called stock option “loophole,” which allows corporate executives to avoid income taxes by receiving compensation in company shares instead of through regular paycheques. The Liberals banned the issuance of new bearer bonds in legislation last year, and the Trudeau government announced in the recent federal budget that it intends to cap stock compensation at $200,000 per year so high income earners no longer benefit disproportionately from the option. But Singh said he does not believe the Liberals will follow through on the stock option limit, contending Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demonstrated he is beholden to business interests through the SNC-Lavalin controversy and by not moving faster to create a government pharmacare program for all Canadians. “The track record of this government now makes it clear that they’re not going to make changes that will help out everyday families,” Singh said. Friday’s policy announcement is part of a series that Singh and the NDP plan to make in the coming weeks. The party has said its entire 2019 election platform will be public before the end of spring.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh sees the opening. His challenge, before summer, is to climb through it and make it a three-way race.

The Trudeau Liberals dragged out the Burnaby South byelection, pinning the seatless NDP leader on the west coast as long as possible — at 164 days from seat vacancy to byelection vote, the longest a Prime Minister has ever blocked an opposition leader. Singh’s support eroded, dropping the NDP to about 13 per cent.

But Singh made opportunity from necessity, building Vancouver-area networks. Coming out of the byelection, his NDP has continuing BC support. Premier John Horgan’s popular NDP government helps.

With the byelection done, Singh quickly pivoted to Quebec. He appointed MP Alexandre Boulerice as his new deputy, boosted new Montreal candidate Nima Machouf (who holds a strong Quebec Solidaire connection), and met Premier François Legault.

And since winning, three recent polls — IPSOS, Angus Reid and Nanos — show a significant rebound. A Quebec recovery may be underway — while IPSOS still puts NDP’s Quebec support at 12 per cent, both Angus Reid and Nanos put it at 18. Angus Reid shows Singh’s NDP leading in the city of Vancouver. And nationally, NDP support is pegged at 21, 17 and 20 per cent, respectively.

Written off only weeks ago, Singh’s NDP is back in business. But no cork-popping: before summer Singh needs to hit the next level — 25 per cent — to say it’s a three-way race.

He has opportunities. The SNC-Lavalin scandal has set the Liberal house afire — and the burnline couldn’t be better for him. The scandal shows Trudeau Liberals doing just about anything to aid powerful corporate friends. And it exposes the pretense of Liberal identity politics — a clever play to use appropriated identities as cloaks over same-old Liberal politics.

Quebec political realignment may help. The Parti Quebecois, which took the Quebec left in a cultural-nationalist direction, is being edged out by Quebec Solidaire, which has helpful NDP policy overlaps. The QS, in a policy switch last weekend, will oppose the CAQ bill on religious symbols, arguing secularism is for institutions, not individuals. Now, on this sensitive issue, the federal NDP position is backed by a party inside the Quebec National Assembly — no longer a foreign intervention from outside Quebec’s cultural debates.

Climate change voters are an opportunity. Doing a bit more than climate do-nothings isn’t working. Canada, at the end of 2018, was further from carbon targets than in 2017. Canada needs a bold federal Green New Deal that partners with provinces to decarbonize. To make buildings more efficient. To shift to electricity-powered vehicles. To expand and operate transit. To end coal burning — still a mainstay in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia — and build clean energy production.

But Singh also faces challenges — particularly to gain ground on nominations and get supporters to open their wallets. First quarter fundraising results come soon. The past can’t be changed, but the second quarter needs to show bounce.

He needs more signature policies. He’s announced a plan to build 500,000 affordable housing units. He pledged to reverse a Liberal tax cut that lets the ultra-wealthy pay tax on only half their capital gains income — even from the largest fortunes. Monday he returned to pharmacare. Singh needs a full suite of actions focused on affordability.

He needs the key that unlocks Liberal Fortress Toronto. He knows what it looks like — trace the seats the Ontario NDP took last year in while winning the popular vote in Toronto and Brampton. To some, Toronto is a notoriously self-centred city of affluence. But in the 31 seats of Brampton and Toronto, all Liberal held, are millions of voters frustrated with low wages, high costs, bad transit and provincial cuts.

And Singh needs to prevent Trudeau and Scheer from polarizing a culture war. Singh has developed a double-skewering narrative, calling Liberal indifference about economic anxiety a fuel for Conservative exclusion. He can’t let up on it.

Singh’s got the opening. If by summer his NDP can climb to 25 per cent, then the game really is on.

The federal NDP leader pitched the plan Friday during a keynote speech to the annual Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, which brings together progressives and New Democrats from across the country.

It is expected to form a key plank in the NDP's election platform this fall alongside other policy proposals the party says will target the rich, pay for more services for Canadians and cool the housing market.

""A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, child care, affordable housing and post-secondary education,"" Singh said in a statement.

Watch: Singh calls out Quebec's secularism bill

While the government currently taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, known as capital gains, the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the ""inclusion rate"" — to 75 per cent.

The party estimates the move, which would also apply to the sale of most real estate but not primary residences, tax-free savings accounts or registered retirement plans, would generate nearly $3 billion in additional revenue for the federal treasury.

""When you go to work, you're taxed on almost all of your income,"" Singh said. ""It doesn't make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half.""

The inclusion rate for capital gains has fluctuated since it was introduced in 1972, when it was 50 per cent. It was raised several times in the intervening years to a high of 75 per cent, before Jean Chretien's government cut it to its current rate in 2000.

A hotly debated topic

The question of raising the inclusion rate on capital gains has been hotly debated for years, with some suggesting it would address inequality and others arguing it would hurt Canadians' savings and make the country less attractive for investors.

New Democrats have also previously talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens they say help the rich hide their wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

The government in its most recent budget moved to address the stock-option loophole by putting a $200,000-limit on the tax-deductible amount on employee stock options.

The stock-option deduction works by taxing only 50 per cent of the earnings an employee receives when they cash in any stock options received as part of their compensation packages, if certain conditions are met.

The new limit appears aimed at tightening the loophole while acknowledging concerns that closing it entirely would make it more difficult for companies to attract talent and discourage start-ups.",Singh: New Democrats Will Tax The Rich To Pay For Pharmacare,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/29/jagmeet-singh-pharmacare_a_23702695/

Dean Stoltz reports.,"WATCH: Well-known First Nations leader Bob Chamberlin was selected Saturday as the NDP candidate to run in the May 6th by-election for Nanaimo-Ladysmith. On Sunday he began campaigning with NDP leader Jagmeet Singh at his side. Dean Stoltz reports.

Bob Chamberlin is well-known locally, but it didn’t hurt to have NDP leader Jagmeet Singh at his side for day one of his campaign in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith by-election.

“Now we have Bob Chamberlin as our next candidate who will be the next MP in this riding, that’s a hugely exciting thing,” Singh told supporters Sunday outside Chamberlin’s new Nanaimo campaign office.

Chamberlin has a long history of First Nations leadership in B.C. as chief councilor of the Kwikwasut’inuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation based on Gilford Island, and Vice-President of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs.

But eight weeks ago Chamberlin decided now is the right time to enter federal politics.

“The work that I’ve done on this coast to protect this beautiful coastline that we all enjoy is hand and glove with the issues that I’ve heard so far here in Nanaimo,” Chamberlin said.

Chamberlin was nominated Saturday as the NDP candidate, and Singh today, sang his praises.

“What Bob brings is an incredible wealth of leadership experience,” said Singh.

“He’s got the ability to be a strong advocate, someone who’s willing to stand up for the community with what the community needs and someone who’s an effective communicator.”

The NDP has 13 federal seats in BC and badly wants to re-capture Nanaimo-Ladysmith after Sheila Malcolmson resigned to run provincially in February.

It’s been NDP since 2004, (Nanaimo-Cowichan) and the party will try to capitalize on the Trudeau Liberal’s infighting over the SNC Lavalin affair.

“What we have now is an opportunity to ensure that a strong party, the NDP party is represented by as many Members of Parliament as possible to ensure that the average Canadian’s needs are spoken to so we don’t see governments that have the ease and think that it’s ok to mix politics with justice and cut political favours or legal favours for political friends,” added Chamberlin.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced details of the pharmacare plan today with health critic Don Davies at an event in Coquitlam.

The party says the plan would see every Canadian covered for a list of prescription drugs determined by an arms-length group of experts that it says would be protected from industry and political pressure.

The party says the plan would save families who don't currently have private drug coverage an average $550 per year and it would save employers about $600 per employee with extended health benefits.

The legislation would be modeled on the Canada Health Act and provide an annual pharmacare transfer to the provinces and territories, with provinces paying about 60 per cent of the total cost and the federal government providing the remaining 40 per cent.

Davies, who represents Vancouver Kingsway, says the cost to provinces will be about the same as they are paying now.

An analysis from the parliamentary budget officer says the total cost of a national pharmacare program would be $23.7 billion in 2020, representing a $4.2 billion savings each year over the current amount being spent on drugs in Canada.

Last week, Singh said an NDP government would expand the tax on investment profits as part of a package of measures aimed to pay for pharmacare, affordable child care and housing.

""Those measures would free up billions that would be available for this as well. The rest of financing would be a matter of discussion between the federal government and provinces and territories,"" Davies said.

The federal government taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, also known as capital gains, but the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the inclusion rate — to 75 per cent. It says that would raise about $3 billion in revenue.

The New Democrats have also talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens, which they say help the rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes to society.

In its budget last month, the Liberal government said Canada's patchwork of drug coverage, which comprises more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.

He is the first person of colour to lead a federal party.

In a speech after he was sworn in, Singh thanked the people of Burnaby South for allowing him to be their voice in Ottawa, as well as his friends, family and supporters.

""Any time you achieve anything, there are so many people that made it possible. You never do it alone.""

Singh said, as a young boy he could have never imagined he would run for prime minister one day, but he wants all children now to have a more diverse image of what a prime minister can be.

""That image is now going to be more and more clear for young people in this country,"" he said.

""I'm only here today because other people broke barriers for me.""

Singh won a byelection in Burnaby South at the end of February.

He will enter the Commons on a busy week that includes a federal budget and continuing drama around the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He also spoke about the mosque attacks in New Zealand that left 50 people dead, saying it's time to tear down the root causes of hate, not just denounce the actions. He called for an end to policies and language that treat people as less than human.

Being a leader means serving: Singh

Singh says his strategy in the House is to push for more affordable housing, an environmentally responsible economy, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and better healthcare.

He says he'll treat his role as rooted in the Punjabi translation of the word 'leader,' which translates roughly into English as ""the one who serves.""

""We're going to have a tough road ahead of us,"" he said, acknowledging the party only has a few months to convince Canadians that the NDP is a viable option.

OTTAWA – While the richest use loopholes to evade their taxes, regular people are paying the price. In a keynote speech at Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made an announcement that unlike Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, the NDP will have the courage to address our unfair tax system that is preventing Canadians from getting the public services they need.

“For far too long, people have been working hard to make ends meet, and they just want things to be a little easier. When you go to work, you’re taxed on almost all of your income. It doesn’t make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half,” said Singh. “Trudeau’s Liberals have refused to limit the capital gains tax benefit for the wealthiest. This is hurting hard-working Canadians who are forced to pay the price.”

To make our tax system fairer, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will increase the capital gains inclusion rate from the current 50 to 75%. This plan will bring in almost $3 billion more in government revenue every year to fund the services Canadians need, like childcare, education, and housing. New Democrats are committed to a fairer and more progressive tax system and will get rid of tax loopholes for the wealthiest, by increasing taxes on investment profits and by getting tough on tax evasion.

As it stands, 88% of the capital gains tax benefit goes to the 1%. Under the Liberal tax plan, people earning less than $45,000 get nothing – and that’s the majority of Canadians. Meanwhile, those earning over three times that salary receive much higher tax cuts. This is unfair for people who are trying to build a better future for their families.

“A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, childcare, affordable housing and post-secondary education,” added Singh. “Everybody wins when we deliver better services that Canadians can rely on.

Though he is now leader of a political party with significant representation in Quebec, Singh soon wouldn’t be allowed to guard prisoners, police the streets, serve as a judge — or even teach schoolchildren in the province. That’s because the provincial government plans on banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain civil servants, teachers included, in the name of secularism.

And were Singh to show up at the National Assembly to protest the forthcoming legislation, he wouldn’t be allowed in. Unlike Canadian Parliament, the National Assembly still considers the kirpan, the ceremonial dagger worn by many practising Sikh men, to be a dangerous weapon. He wouldn’t make it past the X-ray machines.

I bring all of this up not to relive the long and often tiresome debate about the place and space allowed religious minorities in Quebec, but rather to illustrate the uniquely challenging political context Singh now finds himself in the very province that helped launch the NDP’s rebirth eight years ago.

In a few months’ time, Singh will be tasked with campaigning in a province that overwhelmingly supports the above-mentioned legislation. It has the potential to be a jarring spectacle. Policy-wise, the NDP under Singh, an unabashedly progressive counterpoint to Thomas Mulcair’s Liberalesque leadership, is the stuff of dreams to the province’s centre-left electorate. Yet it is tough not to see the party’s sudden and inherent disadvantage: its leader happens to be a brown guy in a turban.

Quebec’s political class is obsessed with identity issues like immigration, which took up an outsized proportion of the oxygen during the last provincial election, according to Influence Communication, a Quebec-based media analysis firm. For this you can at once point to history (francophone Quebecers’ collective and existential worry about the survival of their language and culture) and blame politicians for exploiting this worry for political gain.

This tinder is regularly turned to flame by way of certain columnists — almost all of whom are from the Journal de Montréal — who tend to portray Quebec’s religious minorities as an invading horde bent on undermining Quebec’s proudly secular society.

The end result is a zealous rejection of conspicuous religiosity. Consider how some 61 per cent of Quebecers, far and away the largest percentage of respondents in the country, say the wearing of the turban or other religious symbol by teachers is “unacceptable,” according to a national Léger Marketing poll published last December. Never mind that at least three teachers’ unions have said the government’s proposed ban is patently unworkable. The decade-long politicization of the issue has ensured gut feeling, not cold logic, rules the day.

Singh is about to step into this politically perilous breach, his religion conspicuously displayed. To be fair, he has a lot going for him. He’s good on TV and great on the stage — a necessity in the Trudeau age of campaigning. Most important, his French is excellent. And on the island of Montreal, at least, he has a multicultural beachhead where his appearance is an advantage, or at least less of a disadvantage.

But beyond our fair city? I worry we aren’t yet ready for a leader like Jagmeet Singh. I can only hope I’m proven wrong.

Check out Jagmeet’s first question and what Canadians are saying about this exciting and historic day!

Jagmeet Singh was sworn in to the House of Commons as Burnaby South’s newest MP on Sunday, March 17! Surrounded by family, friends, and our NDP Team, Jagmeet became the first racialized leader of a Canadian political party to be sworn in to the House.

People across the country watched as Jagmeet took his seat in the House and aksed his first question on Monday, March 18. He talked about the people he’s met who are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of housing – worried about how they’ll be able to make rent, pay their mortgage, or whether their kids and grandkids will ever be able to own a home.

He pressed Trudeau on refusing to address the housing crisis – and asked him to commit to half a million new units of affordable housing.

Jagmeet is in the House to fight for us. While Trudeau’s Liberal government keeps siding with their rich friends, Jagmeet and our NDP team are pushing for the solutions everyday people need now.

People across the country supported Jagmeet online, using #JagmeetintheHouse to share their excitement and hopes for the future. Here’s what people had to say:

The question now for the NDP is what it will stand for. Until Monday, it was not clear that Singh would remain at the head of his party. Under his leadership, fundraising stagnated and the NDP’s popularity sagged.

To most Canadians, Singh remained invisible. When he did emerge into the spotlight, he too often appeared defensive and ill-prepared. At times he seemed at odds with the party’s federal caucus. He also managed to engage in a feud with virtually the entire Saskatchewan wing of the NDP over an issue — the social awkwardness shown by Regina MP Erin Weir toward women — that was essentially trivial. If Singh had not won the Burnaby South byelection, he would have found it near-impossible to stay on as leader.

At a time when socialism is no longer a dirty word, it also gives the NDP a chance to define itself as a serious left-wing alternative to the Liberals and Conservatives. The NDP’s roots lie in the prairie populism and Fabian socialism of the old Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. But the party has never been entirely comfortable with its socialist antecedents. Nor has it always been at ease with its ties to organized labour.

Article Continued Below

That has made language important. The party tends to avoid terms like “working class” as too Red. It prefers instead to speak of “working families” or “ordinary Canadians” or “everyday families.” For years, the party warred internally over whether to keep the word “socialism” in its constitution. In the end, it settled on a compromise that talked of the party’s “social democratic and democratic socialist traditions.” Under the leadership of Jack Layton and later Thomas Mulcair, the NDP focused on replacing the Liberals as Canada’s centre-left party — and almost succeeded. But the 2015 election, which saw the Liberals under Justin Trudeau successfully feint to the left, demonstrated the key limitation of this strategy: It’s hard to out-Liberal the Liberals. Oddly enough, as the NDP continues to try and avoid sounding too left-wing, socialism has become fashionable again in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., seven contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination — including avowed socialist Bernie Sanders — have signed onto something called the Green New Deal. Among other things, it calls for the federal government to provide a good-paying job to whoever wants one. In Britain, much to the dismay of the right-wing press, young people are attracted to unions, government intervention and old-style democratic socialists like Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. When the LEAP Manifesto, a Canadian precursor of the Green New Deal, came out in 2015, its call for moving immediately to a zero carbon-emission economy was dismissed as utopian. It now seems prescient. Where is Singh in all of this? In his successful 2017 bid for the party leadership, he produced policy papers on standard issues, such as the old age pension. But when speaking, he preferred to focus on broad rhetorical themes like love and courage. During the Burnaby South byelection campaign, he talked of the need for affordable housing, an important issue in Greater Vancouver. Speaking on CBC the day after his victory, he spoke of a policy trifecta: affordable housing, fighting climate change and universal pharmacare. Perhaps this is where the NDP is going in the upcoming election campaign. If so, it will have to square some circles. In particular, it will need to show how it would reinvent Alberta’s entire carbon-based economy in a zero-emission world. It will also, however, have to be bold. The NDP can only get so far by calling Trudeau’s Liberals untrustworthy. It will have to sketch out a compelling but plausible vision of its own. That is the reaffirmed leader’s main task.

The NDP says Singh becomes the first racialized party leader to sit in the House of Commons.

He won a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South in February, taking roughly 39 per cent of the vote.

The win means Singh can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the party reins from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

In a statement, Singh says he will use his new position to pressure the Liberal government to take action on affordable housing and bringing down prescription drug costs.

He says as a kid, he never would have imagined being in this position.

""I would've never imagined that someone who looks like me could ever run to be prime minister,'' Singh said in a statement issued by the party on Sunday.

The NDP’s standard bearer in the riding will be selected on Saturday.

The byelection already features an interesting cast of characters, including a jilted Conservative who lost a bid for her party’s candidacy and jumped to Maxime Bernier’s Peoples Party of Canada (PPC); a Green candidate who had a falling out with the NDP ahead of the last federal election; and a Liberal Indigenous candidate with as big a profile as Jody Wilson-Raybould when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited her for the Liberals in 2015.

Singh, who took a seat in the House of Commons for the first time last week after winning his own byelection in the greater Vancouver riding of Burnaby South last month, will greet the NDP candidate in Nanaimo on Sunday, his office told iPolitics.

A roster of four NDP candidates suggests the New Democrat’s confidence in the riding, despite a late entry into the race and a hike in Green Party support in the past years. Prime Minister Trudeau announced the byelection on March 24.

A day after Trudeau set the byelection date, he surfaced in Nanaimo to circulate and draw attention to a star Liberal candidate, who the party had announced only a week earlier. That candidate, Michelle Corfield, is a prominent and highly successful Indigenous leader who holds a doctorate from Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business.

Corfield is also chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of Ucluelet First Nation and a founding member of a settlement trust at Ucluelet First Nation on the western coast of Vancouver Island. Corfield is an executive resident at the Beedie School’s Indigenous Business and Economic Development Knowledge Exchange.

Despite the credentials of his party’s candidate, or perhaps to ensure Corfield was the one in the limelight during an ongoing confrontation between Trudeau and one of his star 2015 candidates, Vancouver Liberal MP and former justice minister Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau declined to take questions from local news media.

Even with as prominent a candidate as Corfield, the Liberal party faces an uphill battle toward May 6.

Vancouver Island resisted the Liberal wave of 2015, voting in New Democrats in six of the island’s seven federal electoral districts. The seventh, Saanich—Gulf Islands, was won by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for her second term in the House of Commons.

The contests were close and Angus Reid Institute’s polling analyst Shachi Kurl notes that Vancouver Island has been a tug-of-war between New Democrats and Conservatives over the past years.

“The island has a tendency to swing orange or blue,” Kurl said in a phone interview from her Vancouver office.

Nanaimo News Bulletin reporter Nicholas Pescod says he expects the NDP will continue to hold Nanaimo—Ladysmith. “I suspect the NDP will do well,” he said in a telephone interview from the News Bulletin newsroom.

Kurl noted low-turnout byelections can hinge on local organization, for which the NDP is famous in B.C.

Nanaimo—Ladysmith was left vacant after popular former NDP MP Sheila Malcolmson, announced last fall that she was making the jump to provincial politics. She resigned her Commons seat on Jan. 2 to contest and win a byelection in the provincial electoral district of Nanaimo. That Jan. 30 byelection was crucial for the survival of the province’s NDP coalition government.

For the May 6 federal byelection, the NDP field of four candidates also includes a prominent Indigenous candidate, Bob Chamberlin, who is vice-president of the long-established Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and chief councillor with the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation at the north end of Vancouver Island.

The other three NDP hopefuls include Lauren Sample, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson, a past president of Nanaimo Pride, and a women’s rights advocate; Maeve O’Byrne, a founder of the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation who coaches volunteers working in refugee camps; and Fred Statham, whose electoral experience includes two attempts at election to Nanaimo city council.

The nominated field for other parties is just as unique.

The Green Party and Conservative candidates launched their nomination bids last fall, after Malcolmson announced she would not seek re-election federally.

Green candidate Paul Manly, who came third against Malcolmson in 2015, was acclaimed as the Green candidate on Feb. 3, after launching his nomination campaign last Oct. 25. According to commenters on a Reddit forum and other media, Manly tried to contest the NDP riding’s general election nomination in 2015, but claimed later his candidacy was rejected because he protested Israel’s treatment of his father, former NDP MP Jim Manley, who was arrested after taking part in an attempt to breach Israel’s 2012 sea blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The nominated Conservative candidate for the byelection, Sun Life office manager John Hirst, won his nomination on Nov. 17 last year. His opponent for the Tory nomination, Jennifer Clarke, was picked up to run for the PPC.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month’s byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection — made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart — ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

“The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,” Singh said. “I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?”

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh’s presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.","NDP's Jagmeet Singh steps into the House of Commons, making history",The Vancouver Sun,https://vancouversun.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/ndps-jagmeet-singh-steps-into-the-house-of-commons-making-history/wcm/ae71cb43-3ca4-4541-bdc1-1227c89320ca

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced details of the pharmacare plan Monday with health critic Don Davies at an event in Coquitlam, B.C.

article continues below

""This is a bold plan, it's going to take some courage. It's going to take us standing up to pharmaceutical industries and insurance companies who don't want us to bring this plan in, but we know this plan will work,"" Singh said.

The plan would see every Canadian covered for a list of prescription drugs determined by an arm's-length group of experts that it said would be protected from industry and political pressure. The agency would evaluate drugs for coverage based on what is scientifically proven to be safe and effective, and on the best value for money, the party said.

It would save families who don't currently have private drug coverage an average $550 per year and it would save employers about $600 per employee with extended health benefits, the party said.

Medications covered under the formulary would always have at least one option involving no upfront cost, in a move intended to nearly eliminate the co-payment system that the party said is a barrier to access. If there is a generic drug available but an individual chooses a brand name instead, there would be a $5 co-payment with exemptions for vulnerable populations.

It's time to make medication available to all Canadians who need it, Singh said.

""We can't afford not to do this at this point, given how difficult it is for so many people to get the medication they need,"" he said.

The legislation would be modeled on the Canada Health Act and provide an annual pharmacare transfer to the provinces and territories, with provinces paying about 60 per cent of the total cost and the federal government providing the remaining 40 per cent.

Davies, who represents Vancouver Kingsway, said the cost to provinces will be about the same as they are paying now.

It would cost the federal government an additional $10 billion annually on top of what the provinces already pay but Singh said it's worth it, pointing to overall cost saving identified in an analysis by the parliamentary budget officer.

The report says the total cost of a national pharmacare program would be $23.7 billion in 2020, representing a $4.2 billion savings each year over the current amount being spent on drugs in Canada.

Last week, Singh said an NDP government would expand the tax on investment profits as part of a package of measures aimed to pay for pharmacare, affordable child care and housing.

""Those measures would free up billions that would be available for this as well. The rest of financing would be a matter of discussion between the federal government and provinces and territories,"" Davies said.

The federal government taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, or capital gains, but the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the inclusion rate — to 75 per cent. It said that would raise about $3 billion in revenue.

The New Democrats have also talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens, which they say help the rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes to society.

Singh took aim at the Liberal government's pharmacare plan, saying it puts pharmaceutical and insurance companies ""in the driver's seat.""

""The Liberal government is proposing to bring in a U.S.-style patchwork system that's only going to increase the premiums families pay,"" he said.

In its budget last month, the Liberal government said Canada's pastiche of drug coverage, which comprises more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.

Drug spending in Canada is expected to surpass $50 billion by 2028, an expert panel has found.

In the budget, the Liberals promised a new agency to negotiate prescription drug prices for Canadians to try and drive down costs, a move it billed as an ""important step"" on the path to an eventual national pharmacare plan. It also promised to build a national formulary and promised to spend $500 million a year, starting in 2022, to subsidize drugs that treat rare diseases.","NDP unveils universal pharmacare plan, aims program delivery by the end of 2020",Times Colonist,https://www.timescolonist.com/sports/hockey/ndp-unveils-universal-pharmacare-plan-aims-program-delivery-by-the-end-of-2020-1.23776850

Meanwhile, his party colleagues ...","1 of 3 2 of 3

March 25 will go down as another dreadful day in the history of the world’s so-called largest democracy.

After all, an Indian court refused to give bail to a well-known human rights defender—Delhi University Professor G.N. Saibaba—who is being incarcerated under inhuman conditions despite being 90 percent disabled below the waist.

Saibaba was convicted and sentenced to life in prison after being accused of being a sympathizer of Maoist insurgents who are fighting a class war in the tribal areas of India.

He had been raising his voice against the repression of Indigenous peoples who are being forcibly evicted by big mining companies. These corporations are eyeing these people's traditional lands to extract rich minerals without their informed consent, yet with the backing of the Indian state.

The police have become a ready tool in the hands of these companies and frequently target any voice of resistance. Often, state repression forces Indigenous peoples to join the Maoist ranks to escape police brutality.

Since Saibaba was instrumental in mobilizing public opinion against the exploitation of tribal communities, he was arrested in 2014 after being branded as a Maoist sympathizer. He was given his life sentence in March, 2017 under the country's draconian laws.

Recently, his family applied for bail plea on medical grounds for the wheelchair-dependent Saibaba, who has suffered from 19 ailments.

Because he's paralyzed from the waist down, Prof. Saibaba relies on a wheelchair for his mobility. Gurpreet Singh

However, a court in Nagpur not only rejected his bail application, but refused to show any leniency, stating that he is ""mentally fit"" and is working as a ""think tank for Maoists"".

This is nothing but defiance to international bodies, such as the United Nations, whose experts have called for his immediate release on compassionate grounds. Last year, UN rights experts urged the New Delhi government to let him of jail in the light of his deteriorating health.

Now, contrast this with the Indian Supreme Court’s decision to grant freedom to a mass murderer on medical grounds.

About two weeks before Saibaba’s bail plea was rejected, the apex court in India granted bail to Babu Bajrangi—a Hindu extremist who convicted of being involved in the anti-Muslim pogrom of 2002 in Gujarat.

Thousands of Muslims were slaughtered in the state following the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims.

More than 50 people died in the initial incident, which was blamed on Muslims by the ruling right-wing Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

Back in 2002, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chief minister of Gujarat when the violence broke out. Though he was never charged, human rights activists and survivors of the violence believe he was complicit in the crime—an allegation he has consistently denied.

It is pertinent to mention that ever since Modi became prime minister in 2014, attacks on religious minorities and political dissidents have grown. Saibaba has also been critical of Hindu chauvinism.

Babu Bajrangi was a foot soldier of the Hindu right. He confessed his involvement in a media sting operation and was given life sentence for the crime. And yet, on March 7, the Indian Supreme Court granted him bail, citing his major bypass surgery and other medical conditions.

Video of The Truth: Gujarat 2002: Babu Bajrangi In 2007, the Indian magazine Tehelka used a hidden camera to capture Babu Bajrangi talking about the killing of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002.

The Saibaba case is not only a national shame for India where mass murderers like Babu Bajrangi continue to enjoy state patronage under the BJP government. It is also a matter of shame for countries like Canada that remain indifferent to such an important issue.

This is despite the fact that more than 1,000 people signed a petition concerning Saibaba, which was drafted by lawyer and human rights activist Amandeep Singh on behalf of Radical Desi Publications Ltd.

Singh is the former New Democratic Party candidate in Richmond-Queensborough.

The petition, which asks the Canadian government to intervene, was submitted to the Canadian House of Commons by two MPs, Sukh Dhaliwal and Peter Julian. But the Canadian government has refused to step in.

New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh issued a statement on social media in the past expressing his concern over the deteriorating health condition of Saibaba.

Meanwhile, his party colleagues, including former MP and strong human rights advocate Svend Robinson, have also spoken out for Saibaba in light of recent decision of Nagpur High Court.

Other groups that have come forward to raise their voice for Saibaba in Canada include the International League of People's Struggles, South Asian Network for Secularism and Democracy, East Indian Defence Committee, and the B.C. Federation of Labour. In addition, members of Alliance Against Displacement, the residents of seniors' home run by Progressive Inter Cultural Community Services in Surrey, Sikh Nation, and the World Sikh Organization have spoken out.

The Sikh community supported the cause by enthusiastically signing the petition at two Vaisakhi parades in Greater Vancouver in 2017. Members of Gurdwara Dashmesh Darbar and Sukh Sagar Sikh temple in New Westminster have also vehemently come out in favour of Saibaba's release.

On April 3, University of British Columbia students are going to organize “A Night of Awareness for G.N. Saibaba” at 6 p.m. at the Institute of Asian Research (1855 West Mall, Point Grey campus). It's an open event and anyone can attend.

Considering the sentiments of people who are concerned with the situation of Saibaba, the Canadian government that claims to be a human rights leader in the world needs to break its silence over growing repression in India.

It must stand up for Saibaba and others like him who are being punished for merely fighting for a just society.","Gurpreet Singh: Shame on Indian state for persecuting disabled, harmless scholar while patronizing mass killers",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1221616/gurpreet-singh-shame-indian-state-persecuting-disabled-harmless-scholar-while

Singh won his new Burnaby South seat in a February byelection sparked by the departure of former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who ran for mayor of Vancouver.

Provincial New Democrat leader and leader of the official opposition, Andrea Horwath, will be joined by local NDP MPPs Teresa Armstrong, Peggy Sattler, and Terence Kernaghan to host the conversation at the Goodwill Centre Community Hall at 255 Horton Street East.

“When we have our public health secured dollars siphoned off to go to private profits or corporations instead of stay in our health care system delivering front line services, then a system that is already broken is only going to get worse,” Horwath told 980 CFPL’s Mike Stubbs on London Live on Wednesday afternoon.

Horwath also raised concerns over what she described as a lack of consultation over the proposed changes.

“The government literally shut down the debate and the discussion. There were 1,594 applied to come to committee and give their opinion to the government and only 30 people got a chance to do that. That’s less than two per cent,” she said.

“That’s not a democracy, that is a dictatorship, and that is what this government is doing by ramming through this legislation.”

According to the Financial Accountability Officer, in 2017, Ontario spent the lowest amount per person on health care. Horwath said that if elected, the NDP would create a pharmacare plan and make sure everyone has access to dental care.

“These things are not impossible — they can be achieved. In fact, what our experts were able to show us is that, in fact, it could save us significant dollars in health care going forward, because the access of pharmaceuticals, to prescription drugs, for everyone would help people stay well because they would be able to afford their drugs.”

The newsletter from the First Alliance Church, whom the NDP alleges Roger Reid was the director of communications for at the time, includes a book review for The Homosexual Agenda.

“The homosexual agenda has as its primary aim to ‘trump’ the rights of all other groups, especially those of people of faith,” the review reads. “The authors provide well-documented proof that America is not only becoming more tolerant of homosexual behaviour, it is becoming less tolerant of those who disagree with the lifestyle.”

The newsletter, published in December 2003, includes a holiday greeting from Reid on its first page.

In a statement the UCP issued to Global News, Reid said “Albertans are tired of revisiting old, divisive debates from many years prior.”

“Our leader and party have been clear: It doesn’t matter who you love or how you worship, all are welcome in our party, and I am fully supportive of that.”

The NDP also raised concerns about a 2012 sermon of Reid’s, delivered at a church in Claresholm. In it, the NDP says he promotes a book called Being the Body by Charles Colson, which the NDP says it interprets as anti-Muslim.

“This spring I pulled out a book I read years ago when Chuck Colson passed away,” Reid can be heard saying in an audio recording of the sermon. “[It’s] one of my favourite books and a transforming book for me, called The Body. He updated it after 9/11 and called it Being the Body.

“One of the reasons it was such a great story for me was it told the stories of the persecuted church.”

In his statement on Wednesday, Reid said he was not referring to the post 9/11 version of the book when he delivered his sermon.

“In the sermon, I referenced a book from 1993 by Charles Colson,” the statement reads. “The book was later updated with a revised title and additional content, but I was referencing the original 1993 version specifically.”

In a news release, the NDP said there “is clearly a pattern with [UCP Leader Jason] Kenney’s candidates of promoting hate and extreme views.”

“Mr. Kenney cannot continue to deny that he has a problem in his own ranks. He must show leadership and address the racist and homophobic views of his candidate.”

Hours before the UCP provided Global News with Reid’s statement, another UCP candidate issued a statement to apologize for anti-gay and anti-abortion comments in a separate case.

Mark Smith, who is running for re-election in Drayton Valley-Devon, issued an apology after an audio recording of him surfaced on social media from a sermon he delivered in 2013.

In the audio recording, Smith can be heard asking how anyone who has an abortion could say it’s done out of love and suggesting TV shows try to convince people that love among homosexuals is “good love.”

Late Tuesday afternoon, Kenney issued a statement in response to the criticism of Smith’s comments.

“I have been clear that ours is a party that respects human dignity of all people regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, people’s faith, or their background,” the statement reads. “The United Conservative Party supports the human dignity of all, and the protection of everyone’s rights.

“The comments in question were made before Mr. Smith was a legislator. In Mr. Smith’s time as an MLA over the past four years, he has not, to my knowledge, made similarly offensive comments.

Support for the Progressive Conservatives dropped three percentage points to 32 per cent of decided and leaning voters in Manitoba's capital from last December ...","Winnipeggers should expect some hotly contested races in the next provincial election, new polling numbers suggests.

Support for the Progressive Conservatives dropped three percentage points to 32 per cent of decided and leaning voters in Manitoba's capital from last December, according to a Probe Research poll.

The Tories' support in the city is now below that of the surging NDP, whose support rose to 36 per cent, up from 30 per cent in December polling.

Premier Brian Pallister's team won 17 of Winnipeg's 31 seats in the last provincial election in 2016.

It seems the NDP's rise comes at the expense of the Manitoba Liberals, which slipped four percentage points to be the preferred party of 23 per cent of voters surveyed in the poll.

No bump after PST cut

Outside Winnipeg, the Tories remain way ahead with 58 per cent of deciding and leaning voters on their side. The NDP have the backing of two of 10 voters, while the Liberals take 12 per cent, the poll said.

The Progressive Conservatives didn't see a jump in support after trumpeting a one percentage point cut to the provincial sales tax, noted Mary Agnes Welch, a partner at Probe Research.

""The single biggest takeaway from that latest provincial poll is that the bump in the polls that you might have expected the premier to get for cutting the PST, he didn't quite see,"" Welch told CBC Manitoba's Information Radio.

""In fact, he dropped a couple points,"" she said.

""He's perfectly positioned to go into the next election, whenever that may come, but this notion of a PST cut that's going to win … some extra support didn't quite materialize,"" which she speculated was because the cut was widely expected by Manitobans.

The latest quarterly poll from Probe Research shows the Tories and Liberals have slipped in popularity provincewide, while NDP support has risen. (Probe Research)

The new quarterly poll surveyed 1,000 adults in Manitoba from Mar. 12-24, who were selected through random dialling to include both landline and wireless phone numbers. A randomized sample of this size would yield a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 per cent.

If a provincial election were held tomorrow, the poll suggests Tories would be well on their way to a second majority government.

Provincewide, they are supported by 42 per cent of decided and leaning voters surveyed (down two per cent from December), whereas the NDP have 30 per cent (up three per cent), the Liberals have 18 per cent (down three per cent) and the Greens would take seven per cent (up five per cent) of voter support, the poll said.

Fifteen per cent of voters are undecided, according to the poll.

The PCs have historically had the backing of men, rural residents and those with a high school education or less, and that remains the case, while the Opposition NDP have higher levels of support among women, post-secondary graduates and Indigenous Peoples.

""It's that classic split that we see all the time in Manitoba,"" Welch said.

The poll's findings aren't earth-shattering by any means, said Christopher Adams, a political scientist based at the University of Manitoba's St. Paul's College. A shift of a few percentage points here and there is mainly within the statistical margin of error, he said.

But he argued the Liberals should be concerned they're losing ground. He wonders if the provincial party has been hurt by public reaction to the federal party's handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont said it's up to him and his party to convince Manitoba voters they're different.

""Ultimately, our challenge is always to say how we're going to be different — not just from the federal Liberals, but how are we different from the NDP and PCs as well.""

Tories in majority territory

The big winner in this poll is the Tories, even if their popularity has slipped, said Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba.

""You would never expect to hold the level of support you had back in 2016 when you won a record victory and you promised to make some tough decisions on budgetary matters and health changes,"" he said.

Considering that, the party's showing in this poll is ""pretty good,"" said Thomas.

He said the findings may entice Pallister to call an early election — though he also said it's possible Pallister's recent suggestions of an early call are simply a matter of playing mind games with the opposition.","Support for NDP rising in Winnipeg, while Tories' popularity dips: poll",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ndp-support-rising-winnipeg-tories-dipping-1.5082720

Over the weekend, both NDP Leader Rachel Notley and UCP Leader Jason Kenney released their plans for the province. Even physically, the documents veered in opposite directions.

In Calgary, Kenney released a 117-page tome dubbed “Getting Alberta back to work,” broken up with scenic photos of Alberta and a handful of images showing the leader himself. By contrast, Notley’s 44-page platform under the NDP slogan “Fighting for you,” released in Edmonton, put Notley front and centre with pictures of her at a plethora of events across Alberta.

The NDP reiterated commitments to billion-dollar investments outlined in the province’s third-quarter financials and five-year $30-billion capital plan. The UCP revealed $700 million in new spending over four years, with no unexpected big-ticket items, and promised to retain the NDP capital plan.

The two parties did make some similar promises — to no one’s surprise, that included building new pipelines. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project has been a main point of contention between the leaders as approvals, delays and re-approvals have slogged along.

“We will fight without relent to build pipelines,” Kenney wrote in his platform introduction.

Notley also noted the issue in her platform message, telling fellow Albertans, “We’ve been through a lot over these last four years. A tough recession, a pipeline fight for the ages, and a lot in between.”

Notley has repeatedly said her strategy as premier was to build a national consensus on the Trans Mountain pipeline project to move it forward. Her platform outlined past work on the file, including the ban on B.C. wine in a battle with that NDP government, and legislation that gave her government the power to turn off the taps if necessary.

The UCP platform accused her of forming an alliance with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying the relationship hindered the project. Together, they gave the B.C. NDP “a blank cheque to delay and block” the pipeline, Kenney said.

There are a slew of other promises the parties have both made, though Kenney and Notley have different ideas on how to get there. That includes growing the economy, creating jobs, investing in innovation, improving the prosperity of Indigenous communities, reducing rural crime and helping Albertans upgrade their skills.

As expected, the platforms also highlight different priorities. The NDP outlined an expansion of its $25-a-day child care program, while the UCP platform doesn’t mention child care. Kenney promised red tape reduction to speed up regulatory approvals while the NDP platform tended towards strengthening regulations.

As the NDP and UCP continue to trumpet their complete platforms, here’s a look at how each party approaches major issues.

Health care and mental health

The NDP is campaigning on protecting public health care, building on past announcements. The platform plans to add 2,000 more long-term-care beds at a cost of $170 million, and $90 million per year to reduce surgical wait times and increase emergency care. The NDP also wants to create two storefront mental health clinics in Edmonton and Calgary to help people experiencing a mental health crisis. If re-elected, the NDP would increase the health budget by three per cent per year to account for population growth.

The UCP wants to freeze the health care budget, but Kenney said he believes the party will find administrative efficiencies. He plans to kill the NDP’s planned superlab project in Edmonton, vows to lift the cap on midwifery services in Alberta, and touts a controversial Saskatchewan initiative for reducing surgical wait times. Kenney pegged $100 million over four years to create a mental health and addictions strategy. His platform also promises $20 million over four years in palliative care funding.

Job creation

Job creation is the pillar of Kenney’s platform, with a number of initiatives he believes will reduce the unemployment rate. Most significantly, he plans to reduce the corporate tax rate to eight per cent from 12 per cent over four years. He also wants to introduce a $13-per-hour youth minimum wage, change how holiday hours are counted, recruit more newcomer entrepreneurs to rural areas, and would create a Fairness for Newcomers Office with a $2.5-million budget.

Energy diversification remains the foundation of Notley’s job creation plan. She promises to double incentives for petrochemical and upgrading projects to $7 billion from $3.6 billion over the next decade, arguing it would unlock investment and create 70,000 jobs by 2030. She also boasts that the NDP child care program will help more mothers return to work.



Education

Kenney vows to replace Alberta’s School Act with the former Progressive Conservative government’s Education Act. It would eliminate changes the NDP introduced with Bill 24, including some protections for students who form a gay-straight alliance, and return the law to how it read in 2015 under the PC’s Bill 10. The UCP would essentially freeze education funding as opposed to bumping the budget for increasing enrolment numbers.

The NDP committed to fully funding enrolment growth, which is pegged to increase the education budget by 2.5 per cent ($72 million annually). Notley said an NDP government would invest $1.3 billion over five years to upgrade and build 70 schools across the province.

Infrastructure

The NDP has promised $1.35 billion over six years to expand the Alberta high-load corridor. Notley also told Fort McMurray residents that an NDP government would build a second exit out of the city in the wake of the 2016 wildfires. Her platform also includes a program dubbed Hometown Alberta, which would help smaller communities renovate aging hockey arenas, swimming pools and recreation centres.

The UCP plans to retain the NDP government’s capital plan from 2019-20 to 2022-23, and bring back public-private partnerships similar to schemes under the PCs. The UCP also wants to create a 20-year strategic capital plan for the province and pass an Alberta Infrastructure Act to provide transparency around capital project funding.

Environment

The UCP plans to scrap the carbon tax and the NDP government’s entire climate leadership plan, which put a price on greenhouse gas emissions and pledged to end coal-generated electricity by 2030. It also outlined a 100-megatonne oilsands emissions cap, which the UCP would eliminate. The UCP wants to replace the current large emitter tax with a new Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) program. The first $100 million of TIER would fund new technologies to reduce carbon emissions, such as oilsands extraction technology.

The NDP is standing by its flagship climate leadership plan, with the platform reiterating targets of phasing out coal-powered electricity by 2030. The NDP promises to achieve a 45 per cent reduction in methane emissions by 2025. Notley has doubled down on the oilsands emissions cap and touted a clean lakes strategy to improve lake watershed management to reduce blue-green algae blooms.

Child care

An NDP government would extend the party’s flagship child-care program to all spaces in the province, costing about $1.5 billion over five years. Currently there are 122 centres in Alberta, including 7,300 spaces, that cap daily fees at $25 per child. The plan would apply to 75,000 spaces, including 13,000 new ones, and save parents an average of $300 each month.

The UCP platform doesn’t mention child care.

Opioid crisis

The UCP promises $40 million over four years to launch an opioid response strategy, expanding support for treatment centres and adding detox beds. The party also wants to establish a dedicated opioid enforcement team with the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Team (ALERT) to focus on disrupting the illegal opioid trade. Kenney plans to appoint an associate minister of mental health and addictions.

A re-elected NDP government would pursue legal action against opioid manufacturers to recoup the costs of tackling the opioid addiction crisis. Notley also promises to expand access to treatment programs.

MLAs were in committee phase, debating details of the NDP’s LNG Income Tax Amendment Act, which offers more than $6 billion in tax breaks to the $40-billion LNG Canada project in Kitimat.

The Liberals proposed an amendment to one of the bill’s sections.

Green leader Andrew Weaver, who has opposed the NDP’s pursuit of an LNG industry because of pollution it will cause to the environment, walked out of the chamber and his three-person caucus abstained from the vote.

“I walked out of the room on the amendment because we had no intention of supporting the amendment either for or against,” Weaver said. “This is the B.C. NDP and Liberals fighting over who can be the biggest sellout for future generations.”

Without the Green support, the Liberals and NDP deadlocked in a 41-vote tie.

Joan Isaacs, the Liberal MLA chairing the committee session, broke the tie to side with her Liberal colleagues. The Liberals won with 42 votes.

The victory meant the Liberals have forcibly amended the minority NDP government’s legislation.

The amendment didn’t substantially change the NDP’s LNG tax regime nor is it likely to derail the LNG Canada project.

However, it did give the Liberals a symbolic victory because it preserved a law — the Liquefied Natural Gas Projects Agreements Act — that former premier Christy Clark’s government had passed on project development agreements with LNG companies that requires those agreements and key information contained within them to be made public. The NDP bill had proposed to repeal that law.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the B.C. Green Party’s effective and harsh criticism of the new NDP legislation on LNG, the questions left unanswered after a new report on ride-hailing and the politics being played with big changes and caps to auto insurance.

After the amendment passed, the bill led to a further series of dramatic and bizarre events in the chamber.

The amended section of the bill went to a vote on whether it should pass as amended. Despite the NDP just voting against the amendment, the governing NDP MLAs were forced to vote in favour of the amended section or else their entire bill would collapse.

So the Liberals and NDP partnered to cast 82 votes in favour.

The three Greens then reappeared in the chamber to symbolically vote against the section.

The section passed 82 to three.

Liberal MLA Mike de Jong said the Greens have “a new campaign slogan: When the going gets tough, the Greens get lost.” The Liberals accused Weaver of calling division — a recorded vote — on the amendment and then fleeing the chamber.

A third and final reading will occur tomorrow at the legislature.

Weaver said the Greens have voted against every section of the LNG legislation, at every stage of debate. The Greens proposed three amendments last week, including a motion to delay the bill six months, but they have been consistently defeated by the NDP and Liberals.

“The NDP and Liberals are quibbling about where the deck chairs should be positioned on the Titanic as it is sinking,” said Weaver. “We don’t want to have any part of voting for or against amendments on this legislation. We think the bill is a generational sellout.”

Weaver said he does not care whether he embarrassed his NDP power-sharing colleagues.

“It should not be a surprise for anyone,” he said.

“Obviously the B.C. Liberals wanted us to support their amendment, and obviously the BC NDP wanted us to not support the amendment. We were not interested in entertaining an intensive discussion.”

Fourth federal byelection of 2019

The Nanaimo-Ladysmith vote, scheduled May 6, will be the fourth federal byelection of the year, after three were decided in February.

In the Feb. 25 byelection, voters preserved the Conservatives' long string of wins in Ontario's York-Simcoe electing Scot Davidson. The Liberals, with candidate Rachel Bendayan, regained Montreal's Outremont riding, held by former NDP leader Tom Mulcair before he resigned as an MP last August.

Current NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh earned a seat in the House of Commons with a win in Burnaby South, vacated last September by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart, now Vancouver's mayor.

Singh said he is thrilled to have Chamberlin onboard.

""Bob is a tireless worker with an unparalleled dedication and determination to stand up for the common good, protect our environment, and make life easier and more affordable for those who have been left behind by decades of Liberal and Conservatives governments,"" Singh said in a written release.

B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver delighted in taking a couple of hours to read into the record many of the statements made by a number of NDP MLAs on the possibility of an LNG industry taking root in this province.

article continues below

Before forming government, many New Democrats either were vocal opponents of LNG or at the very least subjected the idea of that industry to ridicule.

Weaver compiled about 20 pages worth of quotes from NDP MLAs taken from Hansard in a remarkable version of the tried and true “that-was-then-but-this-is-now” political game. It was all part of his unsuccessful attempt to derail the NDP legislation that will sweeten the tax deal for LNG companies setting up shop in B.C.

“This is the big sellout of British Columbia,” was how Energy Minister Michelle Mungall characterized the former B.C. Liberal government legislation designed to woo the LNG industry back in 2015. Her government (which, admittedly, has come up with a more aggressive plan to fight climate change associated with LNG projects) has essentially adopted that legislative framework.

Premier John Horgan, whose government has a 40 year deal with LNG Canada, decried the B.C. Liberals’ own plan to have a 25-year contract and during debate on the 2016 Throne Speech said “we had a project development agreement tabled in this place that saw the ability for companies coming here to have a 25-year tax holiday. Where’s the benefit to British Columbia?”

Meanwhile, in 2016 the current environment minister expressed outright horror at the prospect of an LNG project rearing its ugly head in B.C.

“We are creating significant environmental catastrophe, significant health issues and we are going to cost the economy of this province, this nation and the world billions of unnecessary dollars,” was Environment Minister George Heyman’s view of the impact an LNG industry would have on climate change.

Back in 2015 when she was the finance critic and not yet the finance minister, Carole James’ view of the B.C. Liberals’ LNG plan (which was even less generous to the industry than her government’s plan is) was decidedly negative, as she branded it as “the wrong direction for our province to go. It’s the wrong direction for a government to go.”

You get the picture.

Some may call all this a rampant case of hypocrisy, but I beg to differ.

Instead, I think it is yet another example how the positions a party takes in Opposition are often irrelevant and subject to change and even reversal once it forms government.

An Opposition that is in constant agreement with a government is likely not going to be a very effective counterweight to the power in the legislature. But it has to change its mindset once it takes on the more difficult task of governing.

Once passionate critics of the former government’s LNG framework, the NDP is now a strong champion of the very industry it mocked for so long. The realities of governing – needing to grow the economy, find revenue streams, create jobs – are foreign concepts to the often make-believe world of Opposition.

So I don’t fault the NDP for switching gears here, but that does not make the government immune to accusations of hypocrisy in other areas.

Take the recent airing of partisan radio ads that promote the NDP and attack the B.C. Liberals. They are paid for out of the taxpayer-funded budget for the NDP government caucus.

This is a blatant, crass move directly tied to self-centered political interests and unlike wooing an LNG project, has nothing to do with public policy or the economy.

The NDP rightly condemned the former B.C. Liberal government for spending money on advertising that promoted government policies and promised to never spend tax dollars on partisan political ads. So much for that promise.

No, these ads definitely meet the hypocrisy sniff test.

Switching positions on LNG? Not so much.

On Tuesday, the NDP said they will delay the bill until the fall and filed a notice in the Legislature guaranteeing it wouldn’t pass before the current session ends in June.

Bill 10 consolidates health-care services and establishes a provincial health authority called Shared Health.

The Manitoba Nurses Union says Bill 10 will make it easier for the Pallister government to make changes to the health-care system without consulting front-line experts or the diverse communities they serve, by centralizing decision-making power within Shared Health and the Minister of Health’s office. MNU notes it will have a significant impact on nurses in rural and northern communities because of reduced local decision-making ability.

NDP leader Wab Kinew urged the Pallister government to abandon their plan and work with nurses and other front line health care workers.

The Tories say the health system they inherited from the NDP was broken and will take time to fix.

“When the NDP were in power, they oversaw what experts have called an overly complex and increasingly dysfunctional health-care system that delivered substandard results for patients. Now the NDP is delaying implementation of legislation that supports our plan to improve outcomes for patients by building a more sustainable and better organized health system,” said Minister of Health, Seniors and Active Living Cameron Friesen.

“We are not surprised by the NDP’s short-sighted efforts to hang onto an antiquated system that for 17 years failed to get the results Manitobans expect. The NDP can procedurally try to delay this legislation, but we remain committed to continuing to transform the system, bringing down wait times and improving patient outcomes for all Manitobans.”",NDP delay Tory health care bill,Winnipeg Sun,https://winnipegsun.com/news/provincial/ndp-delay-tory-health-care-bill

The Canadian Press





EDMONTON -- Alberta's NDP is calling on United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney to fire former education critic Mark Smith for offensive remarks -- an accusation Smith disputes.

NDP candidate Sarah Hoffman says Kenney must cancel Smith's candidacy in the April 16 provincial election.

""Mark Smith's comments are offensive, homophobic and completely neglect women's rights,"" Hoffman said in a statement issued Tuesday.

""Jason Kenney must fire him immediately.""

Smith, a former high school teacher who is running for re-election in Drayton Valley-Devon, had served as the caucus education critic.

Earlier Tuesday, a snippet of audio surfaced on social media from a sermon he delivered in 2013 that was posted on the website of the Calvary Baptist Church in Drayton Valley.

On the recording, Smith is heard questioning how anyone who has an abortion could say it's done out of love.

He also discusses how TV programs try to convince people that love among homosexuals is ""good love.""

""Heck, there are even people out there, I could take you, I could take to you places on the website I'm sure, where you could find out that there's, where pedophilia is love,"" he said in the recording.

Smith issued a statement on social media later Tuesday.

In it, he said he doesn't recall making the remarks, but said, ""I did not say that love between same-sex couples was not love. I merely remarked on media commentary.

""That said, I regret how my commentary was framed at the time,"" wrote Smith.

""Of course I do not believe that homosexuality is akin to pedophilia. I unequivocally apologize if anyone was offended or hurt. Obviously that would never be my intention.

""Our leader and party have been clear. It doesn't matter who you love or how you worship. All are welcome in our party and I am fully supportive of that.""

The recording was posted Tuesday on Twitter by Gaywire, a show that airs on Edmonton radio station CJSR.

The UCP has already seen two of its Calgary candidates -- Caylan Ford and Eva Kiryakos -- resign over intolerant remarks on social media.

The issue of LGBTQ rights and protections for minorities have become an issue in the Alberta election, with critics of Kenney saying he cannot be trusted to enforce them.

But Kenney, a Catholic, has promised that if he becomes premier he would not legislate on divisive social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage that have already been settled by courts and lawmakers.

However he has been criticized for promising to roll back some legislated protections for children who join gay-straight alliance clubs at schools.",Alberta NDP calls for Kenney to fire UCP candidate over recording of remarks,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/alberta-ndp-calls-for-kenney-to-fire-ucp-candidate-over-recording-of-remarks-1.4363796

Last month, the Progressive Conservative government introduced a motion to eliminate the rebate. Funded by tax dollars, it reimburses half the campaign expenses for political parties and candidates who receive at least 10% of the popular vote.

Critics have since argued that the rebate’s elimination could prevent low-income candidates from competing for legislative seats, since they’d no longer be able to afford the cost.

An Opposition bill introduced Wednesday aims to instead expand the rebate to cover those who obtain 2% of the vote or more.

“It just broadens the gateway to democracy for more people to run for office, perhaps people who have been traditionally under-represented,” said NDP leader Wab Kinew.

NDP MLA Nahanni Fontaine (St. Johns), said the change would ensure Manitobans of all backgrounds and income levels can more easily participate in politics.

“Political representation in this house is so important because it acts as a catalyst for other Manitobans and other groups to put their names forward to run in a provincial election,” said Fontaine.

After the 2016 election, the current subsidy provided the Tories and NDP about $1 million each, while the Liberals received about $250,000.

The NDP bill also proposes to ban partisan government ads within 90 days of any general election, except one called through a non-confidence vote. Currently, that ban applies only to fixed elections. The NDP also call for the individual political contribution limit to be reduced from $5,000 per year to $3,000.

Kinew said the last clause is meant to ensure the wealthiest Manitobans don’t have too much political influence.

“No one’s postal code should determine how much they’re able to participate in a democracy,” he said.

Premier Brian Pallister said he hasn’t fully reviewed the private member’s bill yet. But he stressed that donors, not taxpayers, should fund political campaigns.

“Don’t run if the only reason you’re running is you’re going to get 50% back from the taxpayer,” said Pallister.

The premier noted the 10% vote minimum excludes those who receive a small portion of the vote, such as the Green Party. That’s why his party moved to get rid of the subsidy altogether, which would actually level the political playing field, he argued.

“Right now it’s excessively generous to big political parties. So the idea would be to give the smaller parties and independent candidates a fairer shot,” said Pallister.

Ferries and its independent commissioner to consider the “public interest” and not just the bottom line when setting service levels to coastal communities.

Transportation Minister Claire Trevena introduced legislation Wednesday that would make it mandatory for the province’s ferries commissioner to consider the public interest of ferries users while deliberating on whether to approve ferry routes, sailings and rates.

The bill does not explicitly define what the “public interest” is, though Trevena said it will broadly involve “placing greater emphasis on that interest and less on the commercial interest of the company” as well as taking into consideration government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets.

“The amendments to the Coastal Ferry Act are not intended to interfere with the financial decision making at B.C. Ferries,” Trevena told reporters. “They are intended to improve accountability and allow for the public interest to be considered in the regulation and oversight of B.C. Ferries.”

The existing law already mandates the commissioner to balance the interests of ferry users, taxpayers and the financial sustainability of B.C. Ferries. The commissioner issued a preliminary decision Monday to allow B.C. Ferries to raise rates 2.3 per cent annually from April 2020 to 2024.

The NDP has long argued that coastal communities were badly hurt by the previous Liberal government’s decision to curtail routes when B.C. Ferries was losing money several years ago. The corporation has since returned to profitability and Trevena last week restored those routes to full service. The NDP has also frozen ferry rates for two years, and returned a discount for seniors.

However, Trevena has stopped short of returning B.C. Ferries to direct government control, which would require government to absorb the ferry corporation’s debts. Trevena instead reiterated Wednesday she considers ferries part of “our marine highway.”

The legislation also proposes to eliminate parts of the law that would allow the commissioner to consider alternative private operators instead of B.C. Ferries in some circumstances. Trevena said those clauses were never used.

“It was put in when the B.C. Liberals tried to remove ferries and tried to privatize them,” said Trevena. “But nobody ever bid on the routes. It’s been redundant.”

The bill, if passed, would set term limits of four to eight years on the B.C. Ferries Services board, as well as place vice-presidents under the cap on executive compensation for B.C. Ferries.

To an outsider, this may seem like an election fought over the narcissism of small differences; both parties share similar goals, especially on the economy.

This was highlighted in the weekend release of the NDP and UCP’s platforms, which focus heavily on getting oil out of the ground and to market.

“They are campaigning on the broad needs of Albertans,” said Lethbridge College professor Faron Ellis. “The rhetoric would make it appear … there are much greater divisions.”

Alberta’s politicians operate within a relatively narrow range of acceptable ideas, at least when it comes to the economy. The Alberta New Democrats are pro-resource development; so are the United Conservatives. Contrast the Alberta NDP with the federal NDP — or the B.C. New Democrats — who are avowedly anti-oil and gas, and Notley’s party has more in common with Kenney’s.

When the oil and gas industry makes up about one-quarter of GDP, there’s simply no room to disagree.

“A government cannot represent the interests of Albertans without taking a pro-resource development stance, much to the chagrin to many of the hardcore NDPers,” Ellis said. “No Alberta government, no matter what, can shut down or … tar the industry.”

This means that both parties are pro-pipeline and pro-oilsands.

“We will fight without relent to build pipelines,” said Kenney’s opening note in his party’s platform.

At her platform announcement at an Edmonton community centre on Sunday, Notley promised to keep fighting for those same pipelines.

Both parties also have concerns over Bill C-69, new legislation overhauling the energy project regulatory process, though Kenney’s more full-throated in his condemnation. The NDP platform says Notley has “called for significant changes” to the bill.

Even the oil curtailment imposed by the NDP government last year — limiting production to clear out a backlog and bring oil prices back up — was first publicly proposed by Kenney’s party.

While the two parties share similar goals — more workers, more money, more oil moving to market — they have different ideas about how to accomplish them, showing a classic conservative-social democrat divide on how to actually grow the economy, bring the unemployment rate down from seven per cent and bring household incomes back up.

Kenney’s party plans to increase investment by cutting corporate taxes from 12 per cent down to eight per cent over four years. The UCP says this is going to create 55,000 full-time jobs and add $12.7 billion to the provincial GDP.

The New Democrats are pledging subsidies. Notley has promised to spend $7 billion to lure petrochemical and energy upgrading projects over the next decade, which, she said, would lead to 70,000 new jobs and $75 billion in private investment by 2030.

“Kenney’s going to say, ‘We’re going to create jobs indirectly,’” said Ted Morton, a University of Calgary political scientist. “Notley’s campaigning basically on: ‘We’ll send out more government cheques — or things that are free.’ And Albertans will have to choose.”

The most politically heated difference between the two parties is probably their approach to the carbon tax. Kenney has promised to repeal it as soon as he’s elected. He’s also vowed to fight the federal government in court and help campaign against Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government in the upcoming election.

While the New Democrats naturally support their own carbon tax, they do actually share some common ground with the UCP. Last year, Notley threatened to withdraw from the federal carbon tax — as prices per tonne of carbon increase, the Alberta plan will be subsumed by the federal one in the early 2020s — if pipelines don’t get built.

The are clear differences between party platforms when it comes to social policy, although both parties agree on some broad priorities: Education and health care are important.

The New Democrats have pledged a bill to protect public health care and they have promised to reduce wait times and pilot “storefront” mental health clinics. The UCP nods to some privatization, promising a replicate of a Saskatchewan private surgical centre program to reduce surgery wait times. The UCP also promises an opioid strategy and funding for mental-health care.

When it comes to education, the United Conservatives plan to replace discovery learning — where students problem-solve their way through lessons — with “essential knowledge,” and they promise to review and reform the curriculum to remove “political bias.” A UCP government would also expand the use of charter schools — they’re non-religious schools funded by the government that operate outside the public system.

In their platform, the New Democrats point to numerous programs during their time in government, and promise to expand learning to different languages and maintain funding to upgrade classrooms across the province.

On other social goals, the two parties are miles apart. The New Democrats, for example, have vowed to ban pseudoscientific conversion therapy, which claims to change a person’s sexuality to heterosexual. They’ve also promised to implement $25-per-day daycare — an avowedly left-wing proposition — that receives no mention in the UCP platform.

Kenney’s party has its own social priorities, such as speeding up the recognition of foreign credentials, and a section on treating opioid addiction. While the platform does not rule out supervised-injection sites, Kenney delivered an impassioned speech on Saturday about the horrors of safe injection sites that, he said, have left seniors afraid to go out at night.

Still, for many voters, this election is about the economy and jobs and little else.

Kenney has said that anyone who argues otherwise is “out of touch with reality.”

Conducted for the Global Petroleum Show by Janet Brown Opinion Research, the poll suggests the UCP have 53 per cent support, followed by the NDP at 34 per cent, the Alberta Party at eight per cent and the Liberals at four per cent.

Support for the two leading parties is split between the province’s two major cities, with the UCP leading the NDP by 21 points in Calgary and the NDP leading the UCP by seven points in Edmonton.

The UCP’s strongest support is in rural areas, where they have a 43 point lead over the NDP with 66 per cent support compared to 23 per cent.

The poll suggests the economy and energy industry are the two major issues for voters, followed by jobs, health care, education and government spending.

Using a sample of 900 Albertans ages 18 and over, the poll was done between March 25 and March 30.

The margin of error is 3.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

Speaking at a campaign event in Calgary on Wednesday, NDP Leader Rachel Notley said she “profoundly” disagrees with UCP Leader Jason Kenney on economic policy.

“His plan will hurt people. It will do nothing to diversify the economy and it will mean big cuts to education and healthcare. It will leave Alberta behind,” she said.

“Mr. Kenney wants to give a $4.5 billion tax cut to shareholders and big profitable companies and at the same time he wants to cut overtime pay for regular, working people.

“A carrot for those at the very top and a stick for workers.”

Speaking in Edmonton on Wednesday, Kenney announced that if elected, he will create an Aboriginal Opportunities Corporation to help First Nations in Alberta benefit from major resource projects.

“First Nations people have a long tradition of trading and of economic development, but sadly, in the last 150 years that entrepreneurial spirit was stifled by the Indian Act and government regulation,” he said.

“We need to work with First Nations communities to ensure they have the resources they need to unleash that entrepreneurial spirit. And we also need to recognize that reconciliation needs to be about more than words and symbols, it needs to be about substance.”

Notley also took aim at Kenney for his support of Drayton Valley-Devon UCP candidate and former education critic Mark Smith, who has received intense criticism for remarks made during a 2013 sermon.

On Tuesday, a snippet of audio surfaced on social media that was posted on the website of the Calvary Baptist Church in Drayton Valley.

In it, Smith is heard questioning how anyone who has an abortion could say it's done out of love.

He also discusses how TV programs try to convince people that love among homosexuals is ""good love.""

""Heck, there are even people out there, I could take you, I could take to you places on the website I'm sure, where you could find out that there's, where pedophilia is love,"" he said in the recording.

Smith issued a statement on social media Tuesday saying he doesn't recall making the remarks, but said, ""I did not say that love between same-sex couples was not love. I merely remarked on media commentary.

""Our leader and party have been clear. It doesn't matter who you love or how you worship. All are welcome in our party and I am fully supportive of that.""

Kenney was asked Wednesday how his party will make amends with the LGBTQ community.

“They’re right to feel those comments were hurtful, I think they were hurtful, they were offensive and I condemn those remarks that [Smith] made before his election to the Legislature,” he said.

“Mr. Smith has apologized for those remarks … and I hope that Mark will reach out to members of the LGBTQ community to get into a dialogue.”

A leaders debate is set for Thursday from 5:30 to 7 p.m., which will be moderated by CTV Calgary's Tara Nelson.

Over the weekend, both NDP Leader Rachel Notley and UCP Leader Jason Kenney released their plans for the province. Even physically, the documents veered in opposite directions.

In Calgary, Kenney released a 117-page tome dubbed “Getting Alberta back to work,” broken up with scenic photos of Alberta and a handful of images showing the leader himself. By contrast, Notley’s 44-page platform under the NDP slogan “Fighting for you,” released in Edmonton, put Notley front and centre with pictures of her at a plethora of events across Alberta.

The NDP reiterated commitments to billion-dollar investments outlined in the province’s third-quarter financials and five-year $30-billion capital plan. The UCP revealed $700 million in new spending over four years, with no unexpected big-ticket items, and promised to retain the NDP capital plan.

The two parties did make some similar promises — to no one’s surprise, that included building new pipelines. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project has been a main point of contention between the leaders as approvals, delays and re-approvals have slogged along.

“We will fight without relent to build pipelines,” Kenney wrote in his platform introduction.

Notley also noted the issue in her platform message, telling fellow Albertans, “We’ve been through a lot over these last four years. A tough recession, a pipeline fight for the ages, and a lot in between.”

Notley has repeatedly said her strategy as premier was to build a national consensus on the Trans Mountain pipeline project to move it forward. Her platform outlined past work on the file, including the ban on B.C. wine in a battle with that NDP government, and legislation that gave her government the power to turn off the taps if necessary.

The UCP platform accused her of forming an alliance with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying the relationship hindered the project. Together, they gave the B.C. NDP “a blank cheque to delay and block” the pipeline, Kenney said.

There are a slew of other promises the parties have both made, though Kenney and Notley have different ideas on how to get there. That includes growing the economy, creating jobs, investing in innovation, improving the prosperity of Indigenous communities, reducing rural crime and helping Albertans upgrade their skills.

As expected, the platforms also highlight different priorities. The NDP outlined an expansion of its $25-a-day child care program, while the UCP platform doesn’t mention child care. Kenney promised red tape reduction to speed up regulatory approvals while the NDP platform tended towards strengthening regulations.

As the NDP and UCP continue to trumpet their complete platforms, here’s a look at how each party approaches major issues.

Health care and mental health

The NDP is campaigning on protecting public health care, building on past announcements. The platform plans to add 2,000 more long-term-care beds at a cost of $170 million, and $90 million per year to reduce surgical wait times and increase emergency care. The NDP also wants to create two storefront mental health clinics in Edmonton and Calgary to help people experiencing a mental health crisis. If re-elected, the NDP would increase the health budget by three per cent per year to account for population growth.

The UCP wants to freeze the health care budget, but Kenney said he believes the party will find administrative efficiencies. He plans to kill the NDP’s planned superlab project in Edmonton, vows to lift the cap on midwifery services in Alberta, and touts a controversial Saskatchewan initiative for reducing surgical wait times. Kenney pegged $100 million over four years to create a mental health and addictions strategy. His platform also promises $20 million over four years in palliative care funding.

Job creation

Job creation is the pillar of Kenney’s platform, with a number of initiatives he believes will reduce the unemployment rate. Most significantly, he plans to reduce the corporate tax rate to eight per cent from 12 per cent over four years. He also wants to introduce a $13-per-hour youth minimum wage, change how holiday hours are counted, recruit more newcomer entrepreneurs to rural areas, and would create a Fairness for Newcomers Office with a $2.5-million budget.

Energy diversification remains the foundation of Notley’s job creation plan. She promises to double incentives for petrochemical and upgrading projects to $7 billion from $3.6 billion over the next decade, arguing it would unlock investment and create 70,000 jobs by 2030. She also boasts that the NDP child care program will help more mothers return to work.

Education

Kenney vows to replace Alberta’s School Act with the former Progressive Conservative government’s Education Act. It would eliminate changes the NDP introduced with Bill 24, including some protections for students who form a gay-straight alliance, and return the law to how it read in 2015 under the PC’s Bill 10. The UCP would essentially freeze education funding as opposed to bumping the budget for increasing enrolment numbers.

The NDP committed to fully funding enrolment growth, which is pegged to increase the education budget by 2.5 per cent ($72 million annually). Notley said an NDP government would invest $1.3 billion over five years to upgrade and build 70 schools across the province.

Infrastructure

The NDP has promised $1.35 billion over six years to expand the Alberta high-load corridor. Notley also told Fort McMurray residents that an NDP government would build a second exit out of the city in the wake of the 2016 wildfires. Her platform also includes a program dubbed Hometown Alberta, which would help smaller communities renovate aging hockey arenas, swimming pools and recreation centres.

The UCP plans to retain the NDP government’s capital plan from 2019-20 to 2022-23, and bring back public-private partnerships similar to schemes under the PCs. The UCP also wants to create a 20-year strategic capital plan for the province and pass an Alberta Infrastructure Act to provide transparency around capital project funding.

Environment

The UCP plans to scrap the carbon tax and the NDP government’s entire climate leadership plan, which put a price on greenhouse gas emissions and pledged to end coal-generated electricity by 2030. It also outlined a 100-megatonne oilsands emissions cap, which the UCP would eliminate. The UCP wants to replace the current large emitter tax with a new Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) program. The first $100 million of TIER would fund new technologies to reduce carbon emissions, such as oilsands extraction technology.

The NDP is standing by its flagship climate leadership plan, with the platform reiterating targets of phasing out coal-powered electricity by 2030. The NDP promises to achieve a 45 per cent reduction in methane emissions by 2025. Notley has doubled down on the oilsands emissions cap and touted a clean lakes strategy to improve lake watershed management to reduce blue-green algae blooms.

Child care

An NDP government would extend the party’s flagship child-care program to all spaces in the province, costing about $1.5 billion over five years. Currently there are 122 centres in Alberta, including 7,300 spaces, that cap daily fees at $25 per child. The plan would apply to 75,000 spaces, including 13,000 new ones, and save parents an average of $300 each month.

The UCP platform doesn’t mention child care.

Opioid crisis

The UCP promises $40 million over four years to launch an opioid response strategy, expanding support for treatment centres and adding detox beds. The party also wants to establish a dedicated opioid enforcement team with the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Team (ALERT) to focus on disrupting the illegal opioid trade. Kenney plans to appoint an associate minister of mental health and addictions.

A re-elected NDP government would pursue legal action against opioid manufacturers to recoup the costs of tackling the opioid addiction crisis. Notley also promises to expand access to treatment programs.

It gets more serious from here until voting day.

So just where does the campaign stand?

Up until now, I sense the momentum has been with the NDP. The UCP have run a passion-less campaign. Their brains are in, but their hearts are not apparent.

And, of course, they have permitted themselves to be distracted by social issues and ethics complaints.

Yet I still do not see where Premier Rachel Notley and her party can get enough seats to win re-election.

The NDP have very likely won back Edmonton. This is due mostly to the UCP insisting on re-raising the subject of GSAs (and a little bit from the allegations of a “kamikaze” campaign during the UCP leadership back in 2017).

Bringing up the subject of gay-straight alliances in schools was unnecessary. The UCP wasn’t going to win a single vote it didn’t already have by promising to reopen the debate if elected. However, for moderate voters who don’t really care about GSAs specifically, the subject is a barometer of broader social sophistication: Are you part of the 21st century or not?

The UCP has simply reinforced for some voters that it isn’t modern enough. It might be too socially conservative.

But I think the damage from GSAs and the kamikaze campaign tactics is mostly contained within Edmonton city limits.

Will the NDP win all 25 seats in the capital region? That seems highly unlikely. But 15 or 20? Possible.

Yet that would still leave the Notley campaign 24 to 29 seats short of a majority win. And it is really, really hard to see where it would get the rest of the seats it needs.

There are 24 seats in Calgary and 38 in the ROTP (rest of the province).

I don’t see the NDP winning more than two or three (if that) in the ROTP. One private poll I saw recently that was sponsored by no party had the UCP at 66 per cent to the NDP’s 23 per cent outside Alberta’s two largest cities.

That would mean that in order to be re-elected the NDP would have to win more seats in Calgary this time than last, when they won 15.

I just can’t imagine that happening.

Premier Notley has recently been pushing hard to convince Calgarians she is their champion. But that seems more like a death-bed conversion than a sincere commitment.

Calgary has about half as many public-sector employees as Edmonton, who form the core of NDP support. And the city has been devastated by NDP environmental, tax and energy policy.

When you hear that Calgary has the highest unemployment rate of any major city in the country and millions of square feet of empty office space, the NDP and their buddies in the Liberal government in Ottawa are the reason. That’s not lost on Calgary voters.

So despite having done better than the UCP in the first two weeks, I still can’t see the NDP winning.

Two things might change that: Evidence from either elections commissioner Lorne Gibson or the RCMP of illegal financial support from Kenney to the kamikaze leadership candidate, Jeff Callaway, back in 2017. (To this point the allegations have been smarmy, but not illegal.)

Arrogant or disrespectful behaviour by Kenney towards Notley in Thursday’s debate might do it, too.

But assuming neither of those happen, it truly is hard to see where the NDP get enough seats from to pull off a second victory.

Still, it would be really satisfying in the final two weeks to hear positive, passionate, for-the-love-of-Alberta reasons from the UCP as to why voters should make them the government.",GUNTER: NDP faces uphill battle outside of Edmonton,Edmonton Sun,https://edmontonsun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-ndp-faces-uphill-battle-outside-of-edmonton
277,Business,2019-04-02T17:25:00.0000000Z,"COQUITLAM, B.C. — The NDP is promising to bring in a universal and comprehensive national pharmacare program targeted to begin in 2020 if the party wins the next federal election. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced details of the pharmacare plan Monday ...","It would cost the federal government an additional $10 billion annually on top of what the provinces already pay but Singh said it's worth it, pointing to overall cost saving identified in an analysis by the parliamentary budget officer.

The report says the total cost of a national pharmacare program would be $23.7 billion in 2020, representing a $4.2 billion savings each year over the current amount being spent on drugs in Canada.

Last week, Singh said an NDP government would expand the tax on investment profits as part of a package of measures aimed to pay for pharmacare, affordable child care and housing.

""Those measures would free up billions that would be available for this as well. The rest of financing would be a matter of discussion between the federal government and provinces and territories,"" Davies said.

The federal government taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, or capital gains, but the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the inclusion rate — to 75 per cent. It said that would raise about $3 billion in revenue.

The New Democrats have also talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens, which they say help the rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes to society.

Singh took aim at the Liberal government's pharmacare plan, saying it puts pharmaceutical and insurance companies ""in the driver's seat.""

""The Liberal government is proposing to bring in a U.S.-style patchwork system that's only going to increase the premiums families pay,"" he said.

In its budget last month, the Liberal government said Canada's pastiche of drug coverage, which comprises more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.

Drug spending in Canada is expected to surpass $50 billion by 2028, an expert panel has found.

In the budget, the Liberals promised a new agency to negotiate prescription drug prices for Canadians to try and drive down costs, a move it billed as an ""important step"" on the path to an eventual national pharmacare plan. It also promised to build a national formulary and promised to spend $500 million a year, starting in 2022, to subsidize drugs that treat rare diseases.","NDP unveils universal pharmacare plan, aims program delivery by the end of 2020",Waterloo Region Record,https://www.therecord.com/news-story/9261758-ndp-unveils-universal-pharmacare-plan-aims-program-delivery-by-the-end-of-2020/

Green Party leader Andrew Weaver stepped up his symbolic protest against the NDP government’s tax breaks for natural gas exports, walking out of the legislature with his fellow MLAs to let the opposition win a vote.

“This is the B.C. NDP and B.C. Liberals’ legislation,” Weaver wrote on Twitter after the three Green MLAs intentionally skipped the vote Tuesday evening. “They now walk hand in hand in giving handouts to a fossil fuel project that will be Canada’s largest source of emissions.”

The vote on an amendment was a tie, 41 to 41, after Weaver and the Greens left the chamber. B.C. Liberal MLA Joan Isaacs, the assistant deputy speaker who was presiding over debate, cast the deciding vote with the opposition. The result was to force the NDP government to keep a provision to make its project agreement with LNG Canada public.

While the outcome doesn’t change the province’s deal to support LNG Canada’s $40 billion investment in a pipeline and gas export facilities at Kitimat, it demonstrates the tension in the minority government as the B.C. Greens continue to keep the NDP in power.

B.C. Liberal MLA Ellis Ross, a former Haisla Nation chief and long-time backer of LNG projects for the Kitimat area, was scornful of the Green protest.

“Man this is shameful,” Ross tweeted after the vote. “The Green Party left the house so they wouldn’t have to vote against the NDP on accountability. Then they come back in after the vote is over to vote no on LNG.”

The votes came after a long debate on the LNG tax breaks, which repeal the Christy Clark government’s LNG income tax, extend the commercial rate for electricity to LNG Canada, and defer provincial sales tax payment until the project begins shipping liquefied gas to Asia.

B.C. Liberal MLA Mike de Jong spent much of the day Tuesday pressing Finance Minister Carole James on making the project agreement public, and on the lack of a formal agreement on how many temporary foreign workers would be used in construction.

The Thompson Teachers’ Association (TTA) president recently got the green light from the party to seek the NDP nomination, which means she could be gunning for current MLA Kelly Bindle’s seat in the Manitoba legislature.

article continues below

Pellizzaro has been an increasingly vocal critic of Bindle and Premier Brian Pallister over the last couple years, and said she decided to run for office after her concerns about education funding were consistently being dismissed.

“It’s the frustration of not being felt that you’re heard,” Pellizzaro says. “We’ve been commenting about the lack of education funding for two years, and those are falling on deaf ears. And health care as well. I see it in the hospital when I’m volunteering, the long waiting lines and the overworked nurses and understaffing.”

If she does clinch the nomination, Pellizzaro said she would serve as a “voice for the north” by putting these and other concerns front and centre during her campaign.

“The north’s been neglected for the last three years, and we need a voice so we can have economic development, improved healthcare, improved education, education funding and make childcare more accessible for younger families.”

Outside of serving as a kindergarten to Grade 3 teacher in the School District of Mystery Lake, Pellizzaro does have political experience at the local and provincial level.

Not only has she been involved with the TTA since 1993, but Pellizzaro was a member of the 2017-18 provincial executive for the Manitoba Teachers’ Society, where she represented the interests of over 15,000 educators.

Pellizzaro also volunteered her time helping federal and provincial NDP candidates run in Northern Manitoba elections throughout the last 20 years, which should give her some insight into mounting an effective campaign.

Otherwise, the local union president said she wants to use her status as an active member of the community to bring about meaningful change.

“I listen to people, I hear concerns and I act on them,” said Pellizzaro. “I always find an answer and I always look to improve things.”

Bindle has been Thompson’s MLA since April 2016, when he beat long-time NDP MLA Steve Ashton by 185 votes.

Even though the next provincial election is officially set for October 2020, Pallister recently hinted that Manitobans could be going to the polls sometime this year instead.

P.E.I. NDP Leader Joe Byrne announced Tuesday that his party is committed to ensuring quality, accessible and affordable housing throughout the Island.

A public-sector-led strategy of investment is the cornerstone of the NDP’s plan to prioritize building new homes, increasing public ownership and management, as well as incentives, taxation and regulations to encourage building affordable housing.

“Twenty years of switching between the Liberals and Conservatives has only made life less affordable for too many Islanders,” said Byrne. “Government housing policies of pushing private development and subsidies of the past 20 years have failed. It is time for innovative plans and bold ideas to solve this crisis.”

The NDP will invest in affordable housing by applying a hotel tax on short-term rentals, for example Airbnb units. The party says this kind of tax has been successfully applied in British Columbia, some European countries, Mexico, and the U.S., and is similar to the lodging tax in Quebec.

Other NDP platform promises include publicly owned and operated housing that uses geared-to-income rental rates, and a housing bank to acquire and protect land and buildings which can be used for public housing.

The NDP is also promising to apply the provincial portion of HST (eight or 10 per cent of charges) to short-term rentals, apply the commercial rate of tax to any operation (private home, small building) which gets used for short-term rental and develop more efficient regulations (under the Rental of Residential Property Act) to assure quality construction and upkeep of rental properties and enforce the rules through robust inspection.

Now he’s challenging Moe for planning to attend ...,"NDP Leader Ryan Meili has been pushing for weeks to get Premier Scott Moe to condemn the yellow vest movement and bar his caucus from its rallies.

Now he’s challenging Moe for planning to attend a rally that has banned yellow vests.

Meili called the Regina Rally Against the Carbon Tax, set to roll into the Queensbury Convention Centre on Thursday, “a yellow vest rally without the yellow vests.”

“It’s not really about what people are wearing, it’s about what they’re saying and who is organizing,” he said, pointing to a Tweet threaded through with climate change denial and an organizer who warned the carbon tax was a step toward “one-world government.”

“Far out there conspiracy theories,” said Meili. “Climate change denial, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic sentiment. This is what the yellow vest movement has become, Mr. Speaker and I do not understand, but I’d like the Premier to explain why he wants to be associated with that group.”

But Moe said he will still attend on Thursday, and accused Meili of painting him and those attending the rally as racists.

“This is the worst form of identity politics that I have seen in my elected life, and maybe in my life,” said Moe.

The Canadian yellow vest movement has mixed a pro-resource message with conspiracy theories and opposition to what some members call “mass immigration.” Its Facebook pages have become havens for expressions of overt racism, including apparent apologia for the white-supremacist terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Posters for the Rally Against the Carbon Tax carry the words “yellow vests prohibited.” It says the event is meant to oppose Ottawa’s carbon backstop, and federal bills that some view as anti-pipeline.

Meili argued that organizers nonetheless have connections to the yellow vest movement, as well as climate change skepticism.

He read a post on the rally’s Twitter account, which calls climate change a “made-up catastrophe used by globalists & socialists to instil fear and guilt to tax, regulate and remove our freedoms while pretending to be saving the planet.”

The reality of human-induced climate change is supported by the overwhelming majority of scientists with expertise in the field. Moe has not taken issue with the scientific consensus, though he has challenged whether the carbon tax is an appropriate way of dealing with the threat.

Moe said much the same thing when challenged on Monday.

“Climate change is real,” he said. “It is a global challenge.”

Meili brought up Jason LeBlanc, a spokesman for Thursday’s rally who became known for questioning Justin Trudeau at a town hall in Regina. Though the Estevan-based farmer has distanced himself from the yellow vest movement, Meili noted that Leblanc attended the United We Roll convoy to Ottawa.

Many of those in the convoy sported yellow vests during their journey. It was widely viewed as a rebranding of an earlier yellow vest convoy.

LeBlanc spoke at a rally on Parliament Hill once the convoy reached Ottawa. He referred to himself as a “man-made climate change doomsday denier,” according to a transcript of the speech posted to Pipeline News.

Though Meili used LeBlanc to draw a link between the yellow vest rallies and Thursday’s carbon tax protest, he took issue with any insinuation that he was calling those who plan to attend racists.

“The people who are going there deserve better,” he said. “They deserve better than to have to attend a rally that’s associated with the wrong movement.”

LeBlanc responded to Meili’s criticism on a Twitter video posted right after question period.

“I hear today you’re smearing me in the Leg. I’m just a farmer and we invited you to come to the rally on April 4 and now you treat me like this? What’s the matter?” he said.

Meili said he was not invited to the rally, nor would he attend if asked.

Meili has called on Moe several times this month to distance himself from the yellow vest movement, notably after news that two government ministers had attended rallies in their constituencies.

On March 18, Meili said their attendance normalizes hate and warned the movement could one day break out in violence. He was speaking just days after the massacre in Christchurch.

He raised the matter again on March 19, 25 and 27.

On each of those occasions, Moe declined to condemn the movement as a whole. He has stated that many of its members are focused on resource issues and protecting their jobs. He has instead condemned Islamophobia and “all racist thoughts, actions, deeds.”

However, the polls were divided when it came to just how many points the UCP led the NDP heading into the Alberta provincial election on April 16.

Jason Kenney’s conservatives were looking much better in the Global Petroleum Show’s Provincial Election Survey, which was prepared by Janet Brown Opinion Research, as it marked the UCP at a 19 point lead over the NDP, 53% to 34%.

The Janet Brown Opinion Research poll was conducted between March 25 to 30 with a sample of 900 Albertans 18-year-old and over. The survey was administered through telephone interviews with random Albertans, conducted 50% over landlines and 50% through cellphones.

In comparison, a Research Co. poll released on April 2 shows the NDP just 5 points back from the UCP, sitting at 40% to 45%, respectively.

That poll was conducted slightly after the Janet Brown poll on March 29 to April 1 with a sample size of 600 adult Albertans. The study was conducted online.

While the two polls different by around 14 points on the lead that the UCP may have, they both agreed that Notley’s approval rating had improved, with Research Co. putting her neck-and-neck with Kenney at 32% each, and the Janet Brown poll actually seeing her with a 47% approval rating, compared to Kenney’s 44%.

However, the same poll showed that Notley’s disproval rating was still slightly above Kenney’s with 48% of respondents stating that they either somewhat disapprove (17%) or strongly disapprove (31%).

Kenney, meanwhile, saw just a 42% disapproval rating, mostly due to the 14% of respondents who simply answered that they didn’t know when asked if they approved of the UCP leader.

When looking at the other political parties in Alberta, both polls show that the Alberta Party has a slight lead over the Alberta Liberals, though neither reached even 10% of the respondents’ support in either poll.

Albertans officially head to the polls on April 16 and advance voting starts on April 9.

Back in 2016, Jason hired me to do a photo and video project documenting a year on his family farm. Having grown up on a farm myself, I was amazed at the scale and complexity of his operation, 15,000 acres in size. But more significantly, I got to see a work ethic that is next to impossible to match. If he sleeps, I don’t know when. The video series just rolled over half a million views on YouTube for the primary video, and 800,000 views for another one. In it, you can see for yourself just how hard he and his family work. This is one serious farmer.

article continues below

Since that time we’ve become friends. We agree on most things, but not everything, and I’m not afraid to tell him that, and he’s not afraid to tell me the same. This is what is called a relationship built on mutual respect.

So imagine my surprise when I watched NDP Leader Ryan Meili take a run at Jason for 13 minutes during question period on April 1, fittingly, April Fool’s Day. Conveniently he did this where he had parliamentary privilege, and can say whatever he wants without reprisal. I say that because his allusions bordered on slanderous.

Jason is not a politician, nor does he intend to be. He will be the first to tell you that he’s a farmer, first and foremost, but I will expand on that and note he is a damned good one, and a successful auctioneer, to boot.

The last three months have been rather remarkable for him. Being an ardent opponent of our current prime minister, he made sure he was right at the front of the line to get into the very-short notice town hall session Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held in Regina on Jan. 10. Doing so placed him front row, centre, opposite the TV cameras so that he was in almost ever shot. And being there, he was fortunate enough to be handpicked by Trudeau to ask a question. Jason let him have it on the carbon tax. Trudeau promptly turned that around to talk about “putting a price on pollution.”

This led to Jason being invited to take part in a convoy to Ottawa to protest that very thing, among others, on Feb. 19. This became known as the United We Roll! convoy to Ottawa. It very specifically dropped any association with the yellow vest movement, but did not tell people who wore yellow vests to stay home.

Jason never once wore a yellow vest, nor did he carry a sign with some of the yellow vests more questionable issues, like the United Nations and immigration. When I wrote a column regarding how the yellow vest moniker had become tainted (which Meili, himself, quoted last week), it was precisely with this in mind.

Jason delivered the longest speech on Parliament Hill when that convoy made it to Ottawa, saying, “In my hometown of Estevan, Saskatchewan, we are known as the Energy City. We are proud of that claim and proud of our city, but Prime Minister Trudeau’s policies have had profound impacts on our community. The state of uncertainty has clouded investments, killed jobs, eroded community support for programs, made it difficult for businesses to obtain and retain qualified employees, decreased property values and turned people’s dreams and hopes of an amazing life into a nightmare.”

Pretty radical stuff, huh? He spoke in particular about climate change, clean coal, and the carbon tax, and I watched all of it on live feeds on Facebook.

Coming back from that convoy, several of the participants, including Jason, soon started planning one of their own, to Regina. Their message would be four points, and four points only – fight the carbon tax, build pipelines, kill Bill C-69 and kill Bill C-48. And that’s it. No talk of anything that would take away from that energy and carbon tax message.

I wasn’t there on Day 1, but I was there on Day 2, and pretty much every other day, covering this planned convoy and rally in Regina from the get-go.

And I was there when Jason LeBlanc, at the very beginning of that first key organization meeting, stood up and said they needed to be clear, in no uncertain terms, “yellow vests prohibited.”

And it was at his insistence, with the concurrence of the rest of the organizers, that those very words appeared on the poster, drafted that morning. That was a group decision, but one led by him. And a lot of people who had been die-hard yellow vesters slagged him mercilessly as a result.

At the time, I expected that if any of the key organizers of the United We Roll convoy with former ties with the yellow vest movement became involved with this new rally, they would be tarred and feathered by those in favour of the carbon tax. I had expected it from the CBC. I did not expect it from the leader of the opposition.

Meili led off question period by quoting a post online questioning climate change, goading the premier into identifying how might have said it. Premier Scott Moe did not take the bait.

Then Meili smeared Jason by saying the following, “And one of the main organizers and the spokesperson for this rally — the spokesperson for the group that the premier has accepted to address — is a fellow by the name of Jason LeBlanc.

“And Jason attended the rebranded yellow vest convoy event in Ottawa, the event that featured Faith Goldy among other great luminaries, Mr. Speaker. And he gave a speech at that rally, and in his speech he described himself as a ‘man-made climate change doomsday denier.’ And he said that the Prime Minister is someone who ‘. . . manipulates society through basic human needs and wants to make the globe a one-world government,’ Mr. Speaker.

“Far-out-there conspiracy theories, climate change denial, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic sentiment — this is what the yellow vest movement has become, Mr. Speaker. And I do not understand, but I’d like the Premier to explain why he wants to be associated with that group,” Meili asked of Moe.

Let me point out some the glaring issues with that statement. First, having followed the United We Roll! convoy intently through the lead up and the event, at no point did Faith Goldy come into the consideration. To the best of my knowledge, she just showed up and started talking, making a scene right in the centre of the counter protest. I don’t think Jason had ever even heard of her before that day, and yet Meili tried to draw some sort of association to one of the most politically blackballed people in the nation.

Regarding being a doomsday denier, yes, Jason did say that. And I have said similar things, many times, questioning the argument for anthropogenic climate change. I have pointed out in this column numerous times that no one, including climate change scientists I have spoke to, have been able to give me an adequate answer on how is it Canada was almost entirely covered with ice for 80,000 of the last 100,000 years, and yet it melted, and it wasn’t my gas guzzling SUV or the two coal-fired power plants six miles from my house that caused it to melt, either.

But you see, Meili used the strategy of calling anyone who does not conform to current orthodoxy, the religion of anthropogenic (man-made) climate change, for all intents and purposes, a heretic. They should be totally discredited in all that they say and do! Burn them at the stake!

That is what Meili implied in his line of questioning. If Jason LeBlanc had the audacity to question climate change, then how could Premier Moe dare associate himself with anything related to Jason, including the rally he has been working to organize.

I am just waiting for the day when I am given the same treatment. Heretic! Burn him!

And let’s not forget the biggest slur of the all – in the same breadth, Meili seemed to associate “anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic sentiment” with Jason. Those were precisely the things that Jason stood up against when I saw him vehemently argue for “yellow vests prohibited.” And there wasn’t any real argument, because the organizers were all on the same page.

But don’t let reality get in the way of a good smear job, Mr. Meili.

What Jason has been fighting against is this carbon tax. By one estimate he’s seen, it may cost his family of five $6 per acre, each year. Now this is my argument: His farm, at 15,000 acres, equates to $18,000 in carbon tax impact for each member of his family. Should his 12-year old daughter who, goes to school with my son, be responsible for $18,000 in carbon tax, and going up every year?

Are those numbers accurate? We don’t know. And one of the motivating factors here is the fear of the unknown. We don’t know for sure what the impact will be. But we do know it will double in two years, and keep going up beyond that.

That is the reality Jason LeBlanc will soon have to contend with. That is the reality farmers across this province will contend with. That is why he’s went toe-to-toe with Trudeau in Regina. That’s why his grain truck was parked at the gates of Parliament. That’s why he gave a speech in a snowbank. And that’s why he’s been working so hard to get this Regina Rally Against the Carbon Tax on April 4.

Maybe more people should be following his example.

OTTAWA – Alexandre Boulerice, NDP Deputy Leader, and Brigitte Sansoucy, NDP Quebec Caucus Chair, announced a universal pharmacare plan to help Quebec improve its groundbreaking drug coverage program, to fill in the gaps, and ensure that all Quebecers pay less for their prescriptions.

“Quebec society has always been progressive—and that was emphasized when Quebec implemented its hybrid drug coverage program back in 1997. However, a lack of political will and inaction by the federal government means that Quebecers are still paying too much for their medication,” stated Sansoucy. “Justin Trudeau’s preferred approach, once again, benefits large pharmaceutical and insurance companies. New Democrats, on the other hand, want to help people.”

No one should have to use their credit card to access the medication they need. And unlike the Liberals, the NDP wants to be an ally for Quebec. With Ottawa paying its fair share, everyone will benefit from a quality universal pharmacare program.

“Today, the NDP is proposing a comprehensive, universal and public pharmacare program,” added Boulerice. “Under the NDP’s plan, people will no longer go into debt to access the medication they need. Families will save more than $500 per year, while companies and small businesses will save $600 annually. This plan will also ensure that Quebec saves between 1 and 3 billion dollars. It’s high time for a government that works for real people, not for big pharmaceutical and insurance companies.”",An Ally for Quebec: the NDP Unveils its Plan to Ensure that all Quebecers Pay Lower Prices for Medication,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ally-quebec-ndp-unveils-its-plan-ensure-all-quebecers-pay-lower-prices-medication

The most recent Probe poll, which surveyed 1,000 Manitobans between March 12 and March 24, found a one-point provincial sales tax cut promised by the PCs in the 2019 budget didn't appear to increase the party's popularity.

While the New Democrats inch ahead in Winnipeg (up six per cent in support since December), the Liberals' backing is wavering across the province, down three per cent over the same time period, according to polls commissioned by the Free Press.

The Progressive Conservatives still hold a commanding lead in rural Manitoba, but continue to slide in Winnipeg, where they are now trailing the NDP by four percentage points — 36 per cent to 32, according to the latest Probe Research poll.

While the New Democrats inch ahead in Winnipeg (up six per cent in support since December), the Liberals' backing is wavering across the province, down three per cent over the same time period, according to polls commissioned by the Free Press.

The most recent Probe poll, which surveyed 1,000 Manitobans between March 12 and March 24, found a one-point provincial sales tax cut promised by the PCs in the 2019 budget didn't appear to increase the party's popularity.

PC support actually dwindled by two per cent overall since December. This time around, 42 per cent of decided or leaning voters said they would back a Tory candidate if an election were held tomorrow.

Meanwhile, 30 per cent of those surveyed would support the NDP (up three per cent from December), and 18 per cent would vote for the Liberals (down three per cent).

Probe president Scott MacKay said he didn't expect a large upswing in Tory support after the PST cut (scheduled for July 1), mostly because those voting for the party already believed the move was coming. He expected any ""horse-trading"" to happen between the NDP and Liberals, parties which traditionally battle for left-leaning votes.

MIKE DEAL / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Premier Brian Pallister

If Pallister were to call an election before the fixed date of Oct. 6, 2020, the new poll results show his party could win a second majority mandate.

""The thing about (dropping the writ) is you usually do need a reason to go early. It can’t just be totally crass opportunism,"" MacKay said.

Pallister floated a reason last week at a Manitoba 150 launch party. He noted some Manitobans have told him they don't want politicking interfering with the sesquicentennial celebrations scheduled for 2020.

The Manitoba government legally has to call the election on a Tuesday. If it sticks to the fixed election date, it must hold a blackout period of 90 days before the election. That would forbid government announcements or advertising during a year bound to be full of public events.

Chris Adams, a political scientist with St. Paul's College, said the 150th anniversary could cramp the Tories' style because ""it does carve out a piece of the year where the government can’t be proclaiming things.""

Adams said the Manitoba Liberals' ""brand halo"" seems to be wearing off as their federal counterparts are plagued by the SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. affair, which cost them two more caucus members (Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott) Tuesday.

He wondered whether the provincial party has enough organizational clout and capacity to get its ""electoral machine"" up and running for an early election.

Paul Thomas, a political scientist at the University of Manitoba, also believed SNC-Lavalin is affecting local Liberals.

MIKAELA MACKENZIE / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS NDP leader Wab Kinew

""Many voters who pay limited attention to public affairs and are ill formed about basic features of the political system, are prone to confuse and conflate events on the national and the provincial level,"" he said.

Thomas said the Tories will likely be happy with the latest Probe results, which are positive for them just past the midway point in their first mandate. He believed the PCs would also like to see the Liberals poll higher.

""If the Liberals do well, it comes at the expense of the NDP and the PCs come out the winner, I guess.""

Notley says United Conservative Jason Kenney’s constant suggestions that she is Trudeau’s willing accomplice are nothing more than political game-playing.

“Random grandstanding for the sake of short-term political gains at the expense of actual real goals is politically irresponsible. It’s not good leadership,” Notley said in response to questions Tuesday.

Story continues below advertisement

“My job is, as the premier of the province, to work with people in all levels of government — regardless of how much I do or do not disagree with them — in order to achieve the goals we need.”

The campaign for the April 16 provincial election reached its halfway point Tuesday and Kenney has increasingly focused on Notley’s relationship with Trudeau.

He says Trudeau’s policies are gutting Alberta’s core oil and gas industry and that Notley has been a willing participant in what Kenney refers to repeatedly as the “Trudeau-Notley alliance.”

On Monday, Kenney promised to do whatever he could to see Trudeau defeated in the fall federal vote.

Notley said she has publicly voiced concerns with Trudeau over various issues, including proposed legislation that would change approval rules for major energy projects.

She added her working relationship with Trudeau helped keep the multibillion-dollar Trans Mountain pipeline expansion alive last year when it was faltering.

“We pushed the federal government to buy it. And if we hadn’t done that, it, too, would not be in play. Instead it is,” said Notley.

“That’s not about friendship or not friendship. That’s simply about standing up for Alberta with determination and strength and conviction — and doing it in a way that is focused on achieving the goal ... not short-term political points, which is what Mr. Kenney seems to be more interested in.”

Kenney, speaking in Turner Valley, Alta., said Trudeau’s actions, and Notley’s failure to stand up to him, have left the province with just the one Trans Mountain pipeline option to get oil to the B.C. coast and from there to more lucrative markets in Asia.

He said Trudeau has hamstrung Alberta’s industry with a bill to expand, and possibly delay, approvals of future pipeline projects, along with a tanker ban on B.C.’s northern coast and a federal carbon tax that Kenney promises to fight in court.

Kenney said he realizes provinces must work with Ottawa but: “Let’s be clear. The re-election of Justin Trudeau will be a huge blow to Alberta’s prosperity and our economy.

“This premier ... sold us down the river to Justin Trudeau and all we got for it is a jobs crisis, a carbon tax and no pipelines.”

Kenney said if he wins the election, and Trudeau’s Liberals win the federal vote in October, they will come to some kind of working relationship.

TORONTO - Ontario Premier Doug Ford says it's ""disgusting"" that NDP Leader Andrea Horwath would raise his brother's struggles as she spoke about overdose prevention sites.

Ford's late brother, Rob Ford, entered rehab while he was the mayor of Toronto after months of revelations about drug and alcohol use.

Horwath was criticizing the province's decision to shut down several overdose-prevention sites and said ""shame"" on Ford, considering he had a family member with drug addiction issues.

Ford says it was disturbing and disgusting that the Opposition leader would bring his family into the discussion.

Horwath says the entire world felt a lot of sympathy for Ford and his family, and that's what she meant.

OTTAWA – Today, NDP Health Critic Don Davies (Vancouver – Kingsway) criticized Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government for agreeing to concessions in the Canada – United States – Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) that will increase drug prices for Canadians by at least $169 million once it has fully taken effect, increasing every year thereafter.

“Today’s PBO report reveals the Liberals are deliberately making Canadians pay more for medicine to appease the Trump administration and help their friends in rich pharmaceutical companies,” said Davies. “Canadians already pay the third highest prices for patented medication in the world, and millions of Canadians already can’t afford to fill their prescriptions. This will make it so much worse.”

In a report released today, the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) found the CUSMA will increase drug prices because it extends data protection for innovative biologic drugs from eight years to 10 years. This measure will delay competition from lower-cost generic alternatives, thereby raising prices by at least $169 million by 2029 – the year in which additional expenditure will first occur if ratification and implementation are completed by 2020.

“This concession will cost Canadians over a billion dollars in the first six years it takes effect,” said NDP International Trade Critic Tracey Ramsey (Essex). “Why do the Trudeau Liberals keep signing trade deals that raise the cost of prescription drugs for all Canadians?”

“In addition to these price hikes, the Trudeau Liberals have also abandoned long-overdue changes to Canada’s patented medicines regulations that would have saved Canadians billions on drug prices,” added Davies.

Two years ago, the Liberal government promised to overhaul the Patented Medicines Price Review Board to lower Canadian drug prices. Budget 2018 estimated that these reforms would lower drug prices for Canadians by $12.6 billion over 10 years. The plan was set to kick in on January 1, 2019, but was postponed indefinitely after the Trump administration put Canada on a “Priority Watch List” on patent protection.

“Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government prefers to let Canadians pay sky-high drug prices, even when millions can’t afford their medication already, rather than upset Donald Trump,” concluded Davies. “Canadians deserve a Prime Minister who will stand up for them when it matters most. They deserve a government that has the courage to make medication more affordable for everyone.”",NDP Slams Trudeau’s Drug Price Concessions to Trump Administration,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-slams-trudeaus-drug-price-concessions-trump-administration

Creating a legislated duty to document within FIPPA was called for by an all-party Special Legislative Committee that reviewed the Act in 2016, and by Information and Privacy Commissioners David Loukidelis and Elizabeth Denham.

These “new” legislative changes that NDP minister Jinny Sims is promoting were actually initiated by the Liberal party in 2017. At that time, FIPA issued a press release that called the Liberal bill “a sad excuse for action on creating a duty to document government decisions” in the wake of the ‘Triple Delete’ scandal that revealed an organized campaign to destroy government records.

FIPA said that, in fact, the NDP put forward a private member’s bill at that time that proposed an actual duty to document in comparison to the Liberal’s ineffective bill.

In a statement issued by the Ministry of Finance in 2017, Liberal Minister Michael de Jong had claimed that their ineffective bill would “formalize this good practice in legislation while ensuring that British Columbia remains at the forefront of information management with strong oversight and consistent practice across government.”

Now, two years later, NDP Minister Jinny Sims is claiming that the same ineffective legislative change also “formalizes government’s obligation to document decisions and helps ensure records of decisions are available and accessible.” FIPA said the statements from the NDP and Liberal MLAs, made two years apart, are remarkably similar and entirely misleading.

FIPA said it wants to see the creation of a meaningful duty to document–more in line with what the NDP was proposing two years ago–which would include:

– The creation of mandatory documentation procedures. A discretionary duty to document is not sufficient.

– Clear oversight from the Information and Privacy Commissioner.

– The legislative change should be to the FIPPA, which affects over 2,900 public bodies, not the Information Management Act, which merely affects 41.",FIPA wants creation of mandatory documentation procedures; criticizes both NDP and BC Liberals,Voice Online,https://www.voiceonline.com/fipa-wants-creation-of-mandatory-documentation-procedures-criticizes-both-ndp-and-bc-liberals/

Horwath suggested that the premier consider his younger brother’s public substance abuse battle when drafting policies to handle the opioid crisis and the number of provincially-funded overdose prevention sites.

""For this premier, particularly, who we know had a family member that had serious drug addiction problems, to turn his back on all those families who are worried about their loved ones... is horrifying,"" Horwath told reporters at Queen's Park on Monday.

Doug Ford called Horwath’s comment “disturbing” and admonished the opposition leader for getting “personal” and bringing his family into the overdose prevention discussions.

“That was pretty disgusting,” Doug Ford told MPPs during Tuesday’s Question Period. “Rob, my brother, had an issue in front of the whole world. He dealt with it. I just found it disgusting that you bring family members into the chamber.”

Horwath offered a soft-spoken explanation in the Legislature, suggesting her comments should only be taken at face value.

“I have to say that I think the entire world felt a lot of deep sympathy with Mr. Ford and his family as he went through that crisis, and that’s what I was referring to,” Horwath said.

Horwath later added she raised Rob Ford’s substance abuse battle “in the spirit of compassion,” but didn’t offer an apology to the Premier.

Nor was it that, prior to flying west, the prime minister spent part of the weekend in Montreal, his home base but also the place where the NDP is determined to make its last stand in Quebec this fall.

The SNC-Lavalin affair has cost Trudeau’s Liberals their pre-election lead in voting intentions, but it has not altered their long-held assumption that their path to a second term in government goes through vulnerable NDP territory.

If anything, the events of the past six weeks have only reinforced that assumption.

If there is one silver lining for the Liberals after falling behind in the polls, it is that the more real the prospect of a return to power of the Conservatives, the more likely progressive voters may be inclined to look for the option on offer – as imperfect as it may be – most liable to keep them at bay.

More than ever, the Liberals are hoping to make up for foreseeable losses to the Conservatives with gains at the NDP’s expense, and are poised to campaign more aggressively for NDP-held seats than they have in decades.

In Ontario, that will mean targeting seats in the Windsor area, where autoworkers have a significant influence on the vote outcome, and where the Trudeau team believes its defence of the industry at the NAFTA renegotiation table could pay off.

In his time as prime minister, Trudeau has assiduously courted the unions. On that score, the Liberal watch in office stands in sharp contrast with the Harper decade, which the labour movement spent on the outside looking in.

If the choice comes down to backing the NDP or keeping Andrew Scheer out of office by aligning with the Liberals, many in the labour movement see supporting Trudeau as the only viable option.

At the same time, for more than a few nonconservative voters in Ontario, the damage to Trudeau’s brand as a result of the SNC-Lavalin affair pales in comparison to the prospect of a federal government aligned with Premier Doug Ford’s agenda.

Meanwhile, it is an open secret in Quebec that the Liberals have been courting Steven Guilbeault – one of the province’s leading environmentalists – to run under Trudeau’s banner in Laurier-Sainte-Marie.

The Montreal riding has not elected a Liberal since the demise of the Meech Lake constitutional accord almost 30 year ago, and was held by Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe until the 2011 orange wave.

But with NDP incumbent Hélène Laverdière retiring, the riding may be winnable for the Liberals – or, at least, winnable for a star candidate such as Guilbeault.

The majority of Quebecers spent the bulk of the Stephen Harper decade wishing him out of office, and particularly disliked his government’s approach to the environment. In Trudeau’s home province, the Conservatives’ pro-pipeline, anti-carbon-pricing agenda will loom large in the Liberal re-election narrative.

On Sunday night, Trudeau was on hand for his party’s nomination meeting in Vancouver Kingsway, where broadcaster Tamara Taggart was acclaimed as the Liberal candidate. Like Laurier-Sainte-Marie, this is a riding where the Liberals would normally run a sacrificial lamb, not a well-known candidate such as Taggart. This fall’s election will be the fourth campaign for New Democrat MP Don Davies, who was re-elected in 2015 with 46 per cent of the vote – just about double the Liberal score.

On the weekend, Trudeau also called a byelection for May 6 in the B.C. riding of Nanaimo-Ladysmith, which has been vacant since New Democrat MP Sheila Malcolmson switched to the provincial arena. It will be the last byelection before the general election and all parties will be following the campaign closely.

Léger Marketing polled voters after the last week’s federal budget and found the Liberals and the Conservatives running neck-and-neck in B.C. It is also the province where both the NDP and the Green Party are the most competitive.

Elizabeth May’s party did not run a candidate against NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in Burnaby South earlier this month. But the Greens did well in the Outremont byelection, where their candidate Daniel Green came in third behind the Liberals and the NDP.

If the Green Party is to improve its lot in this fall’s election, the movement could start on Vancouver Island, where May holds her own seat and where the May 6 byelection will be held. The Liberals are not the only ones hoping to benefit from the slump in NDP support.

“British Columbians deserve a ferry-service model that puts people first,” Transportation Minister Claire Trevena said Wednesday.

article continues below

“People living in coastal communities depend on the vital service provided by B.C. Ferries, but for many years they experienced service cuts and climbing fares. Our amendments to the Coastal Ferry Act will put people at the heart of decision making.”

Existing law requires B.C. Ferries’ independent commissioner to balance the interests of ferry users, taxpayers and financial sustainability.

Public interest will be built into decision making at various levels within B.C. Ferries under amendments to the act, Trevena said.

She pointed to the previous government’s decision to scrap the Port Hardy-Bella Coola route as an example of a lack of concern for the public interest.

“It was very clear that the public interest was not at the heart of any of that decision making,” Trevena said. “It was political decision making which hurt coastal communities. It hurt Indigenous communities. It hurt the tourism sector.”

After tourism operators complained of losing millions of dollars in revenue, B.C. Ferries bought a Greek ferry, now called the Northern Sea Wolf, to serve that route, but ship upgrades have dragged on and bills have mounted. Final costs are not known.

The Northern Sea Wolf was supposed to start running last summer, but that was delayed. The vessel, now undergoing upgrades at the Richmond refit facility, is expected to be in service on the Port Hardy-Bella Coola route in June.

The proposed Coastal Ferry Act amendments are based on recommendations from consultant Blair Redlin’s Coastal Ferry Services Review, released in February by the province.

The requirement to make public interest a priority when the B.C. Ferries commissioner makes decisions about ferry services includes taking B.C.’s greenhouse gas emission targets into consideration.

B.C. Ferries’ Spirit of Vancouver Island and Spirit of British Columbia have been converted to run on a dual-fuel system that is expected to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 12,500 tonnes annually. The vessels, which serve the busy Swartz Bay-Tsawwassen route, now operate on liquefied natural gas with diesel as an option, instead of solely on diesel fuel.

Spirit of Vancouver Island returned to B.C. Wednesday after making the 10,000-nautical-mile journey from a shipyard in Poland where it was converted. When the ferry left B.C. last fall, it used 996 tonnes of diesel fuel to reach Poland.

On the way home, it used 824 tonnes of diesel and 108 cubic metres of LNG. LNG was not available at the ferry’s two refuelling stops, in the Canary Islands and at the Panama Canal, a B.C. Ferries official said in a statement. Spirit of British Columbia was converted to the dual-fuel system a year earlier.

In other planned changes, the number of B.C. Ferry Authority directors appointed by government will rise to four, from two, and the definition of “executive” will be expanded to include vice-presidents, who will come under a cap on executive compensation.

Asked about ferries being built in B.C., Trevena noted that shipbuilding is not part of the Coastal Ferry Act. Discussions on the subject will continue with B.C. Ferries, she said.

The NDP has long argued that coastal communities were hurt by the previous Liberal government’s decision to curtail routes when B.C. Ferries was losing money several years ago. The corporation has since returned to profitability and Trevena last week restored those routes to full service. The NDP has also frozen ferry rates for two years, and brought back a discount for seniors.

However, Trevena stopped short of returning B.C. Ferries to direct government control, which would require the government to absorb the ferry corporation’s debts. Trevena instead reiterated that she considers ferries part of “our marine highway.”

The legislation also proposes to eliminate parts of the law that would allow the commissioner to consider alternative private operators instead of B.C. Ferries in some circumstances. Trevena said those clauses were never used.

“It was put in when the B.C. Liberals tried to remove ferries and tried to privatize them,” said Trevena. “But nobody ever bid on the routes. It’s been redundant.”

B.C. Ferries’ commissioner issued a preliminary decision Monday to allow B.C. Ferries to raise fares by a maximum of 2.3 per cent annually from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2024.

Just weeks after winning a seat in Burnaby South, the politician will be here to announce a new health care approach at a special event for the media.

Singh, a former lawyer who had served as a provincial politician in Ontario, won the NDP leadership in 2017, but a successful byelection race in Burnaby gave him his first seat in the House of Commons.

At his side for the announcement will be NDP Health Critic Don Davies.

The event comes as Coquitlam councillor Bonita Zarrillo and Sean Lee vie for the nomination of the NDP candidate for the riding of Port Moody-Coquitlam.

The two are seeking the nomination because Fin Donnelly, the current NDP MP, is retiring.

The Liberal opponent is Sara Badiei, who was recently acclaimed, while a Conservative candidate has not been finalized.

Currently, Nelly Shin and Matthew Sebastiani are seeking the nomination for the Conservative candidacy in Port Moody-Coquitlam.

Zarrillo, meanwhile, has yet to step away from her job as Coquitlam councillor, but already has a website up and running.",NDP leader in Coquitlam for announcement,Tri-City News,https://www.tricitynews.com/news/ndp-leader-in-coquitlam-for-announcement-1.23775260

NDP cabinet ministers avoided questions Tuesday about what opposition MLAs called a “forced unionization” strategy across the province’s community social services contractors.

The NDP government negotiated a $40 million “low wage redress” fund for employees in community social services last year, in addition to the standard two-per-cent pay increase offered to most provincial unions in each of the next three years. That money is expected to fund an additional four per cent pay increase for qualifying workers, but only those represented by unions.

B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson tabled letters to Finance Minister Carole James from two organizations representing hundreds of social services agencies. Tanya Behardien, president of the Federation of Community Social Services of B.C., wrote that member agencies are already struggling and “the widened gap in wages will continue to create employment barriers that many will not be able to overcome.”

Wilkinson read from a letter sent March 15 by Brenda Gillette of the of the B.C. CEO Social Services Leadership Network, predicting that “non-union agencies will be unable to recruit or retain skilled employees” to provide services for children, families, people with intellectual disabilities and Indigenous communities.

James replied in question period by saying the B.C. Liberals provided no budget increase for community social services in 2010 or 2011. Social Development Minister Shane Simpson said: “We’re working with that sector. We’re rebuilding that system. It’s working. We’re proud of that.”

B.C. Liberal mental health critic Jane Thornthwaite said half of the social services providers in B.C. are non-union.

“This discrimination is a blatant attempt at forced unionization,” Thornthwaite said.

In the sermon, Mark Smith, who is seeking reelection in Drayton Valley-Devon, said: “You don’t have to watch any TV for any length of time today where you don't see on the TV programs them trying to tell you that homosexuality and homosexual love is good love. Heck, there are even people out there—I could take you to places on the website, I'm sure, where you could find out that there’s, uh, where pedophilia is love.”

Smith apologized on Twitter Tuesday.

“I regret how my commentary was framed at the time,” Smith said. “Of course I do not believe that homosexuality is akin to pedophilia.”

Sarah Hoffman, NDP candidate in Edmonton-Glenora, called for Jason Kenney to fire Smith.

“I think he needs to. He’s told Albertans that he’s rooting these views out of his party, and instead he’s letting them run for office.

“Anyone who’s running for office should not be carrying hateful views in their heart, and not only do I hear those, (Smith) actually espoused them very clearly. There was no mistake in what he was saying, and I think that’s very troubling.”

In a statement, Kenney said he finds Smith's comments ""offensive,"" but did not say whether the MLA would be fired.

""The comments in question were made before Mr. Smith was a legislator. In Mr. Smith’s time as an MLA over the past four years, he has not, to my knowledge, made similarly offensive comments.""

Nominations for candidates ahead of the April 16 election closed last Friday, so if Smith was fired or resigned, the UCP would not have a candidate in Drayton Valley-Devon.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson

CALGARY – Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley says it’s short-sighted and irresponsible for her UCP opponent to keep attacking her relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Notley says United Conservative Jason Kenney’s constant suggestions that she is Trudeau’s willing accomplice are nothing more than political game-playing.

“Random grandstanding for the sake of short-term political gains at the expense of actual real goals is politically irresponsible. It’s not good leadership,” Notley said in response to questions Tuesday.

“My job is, as the premier of the province, to work with people in all levels of government – regardless of how much I do or do not disagree with them – in order to achieve the goals we need.”

The campaign for the April 16 provincial election reached its halfway point Tuesday and Kenney has increasingly focused on Notley’s relationship with Trudeau.

He says Trudeau’s policies are gutting Alberta’s core oil and gas industry and that Notley has been a willing participant in what Kenney refers to repeatedly as the “Trudeau-Notley alliance.”

On Monday, Kenney promised to do whatever he could to see Trudeau defeated in the fall federal vote.

Notley said she has publicly voiced concerns with Trudeau over various issues, including proposed legislation that would change approval rules for major energy projects.

She added her working relationship with Trudeau helped keep the multibillion-dollar Trans Mountain pipeline expansion alive last year when it was faltering.

“We pushed the federal government to buy it. And if we hadn’t done that, it, too, would not be in play. Instead it is,” said Notley.

“That’s not about friendship or not friendship. That’s simply about standing up for Alberta with determination and strength and conviction – and doing it in a way that is focused on achieving the goal … not short-term political points, which is what Mr. Kenney seems to be more interested in.”

Kenney, speaking in Turner Valley, Alta., said Trudeau’s actions, and Notley’s failure to stand up to him, have left the province with just the one Trans Mountain pipeline option to get oil to the B.C. coast and from there to more lucrative markets in Asia.

He said Trudeau has hamstrung Alberta’s industry with a bill to expand, and possibly delay, approvals of future pipeline projects, along with a tanker ban on B.C.’s northern coast and a federal carbon tax that Kenney promises to fight in court.

Kenney said he realizes provinces must work with Ottawa but: “Let’s be clear. The re-election of Justin Trudeau will be a huge blow to Alberta’s prosperity and our economy.

“This premier … sold us down the river to Justin Trudeau and all we got for it is a jobs crisis, a carbon tax and no pipelines.”

Kenney said if he wins the election, and Trudeau’s Liberals win the federal vote in October, they will come to some kind of working relationship.

“We can sit down and have a civil conversation. It doesn’t have to be a bun fight. But I will be firm and clear in asserting Alberta’s vital economic interests in that relationship.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday moved to end the worst crisis of his tenure, expelling two former cabinet members whom he said had undermined the ruling Liberal Party.

Trudeau announced that former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former treasury board minister Jane Philpott would no longer be allowed to sit as Liberal legislators.

The Liberals have been in turmoil since Wilson-Raybould said in February that officials had inappropriately pressured her to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a corruption trial when she was justice minister last year.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus.

""Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided. We can't afford to make that mistake – Canadians are counting on us,"" said Trudeau, who came into office in November 2015 and faces a re-election contest this year.

Wilson-Raybould was demoted in January and resigned the next month. Philpott quit shortly afterwards, saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau was handling the matter.

The move represents a retreat by Trudeau who as recently as last week had said the Liberals needed strong legislators with differing points of view.

But increasingly angry parliamentarians had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity.

Polls show the crisis has cut public support for the Liberals to such an extent that they could lose an October election to the official opposition Conservatives.

Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing. The scandal is starting to hit his fortunes in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in October to remain in power.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau's decision to expel the two politicians from the Liberal Party sent a message that ""if you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party"".

Wilson-Raybould said on Twitter that Trudeau had also told her she could not run for the Liberals in the October election.

Philpott said on Facebook that she ""did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister"".

""Whether it's taping conversations without consent or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced late Tuesday at a hastily called caucus meeting that he had informed the two former cabinet ministers he was kicking them out of the Liberal caucus and will not allow them to run as Liberal candidates in this fall's election.

OTTAWA - Liberals are hoping to cauterize the SNC-Lavalin affair with the expulsions of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the governing party's fold.

OTTAWA - Liberals are hoping to cauterize the SNC-Lavalin affair with the expulsions of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the governing party's fold.

""Whether it's taping conversations without consent or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.""

The SNC-Lavalin affair has engulfed the government for nearly two months and cost Trudeau his lead in public opinion polls; his most trusted adviser, Gerald Butts; and the country's top public servant, Michael Wernick — in addition to the two former ministers who had symbolized his commitment to gender equality and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

Liberals are now hoping the worst is over and they can finally move on to the agenda they hope will get them re-elected.

Liberal MP Jody Wilson-Raybould leaves Parliament Hill after a short visit in Ottawa on Tuesday, April 2, 2019. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

Trudeau said the Liberals won the 2015 election ""because we stood together as a team,"" whereas ""the old Liberal party was notorious for infighting.""

""Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than about them. That's why I made the difficult decision to remove Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott from the Liberal caucus.""

""I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess."" -Jody Wilson-Raybould

Trudeau's announcement followed a day of meetings with the chairs of the various Liberal regional caucuses and discussions with MPs. The party's largest group, the Ontario caucus, met for 90 minutes earlier in the day to discuss the fates of the two former ministers.

Philpott, who represents a Toronto-area riding, showed up for that meeting but left after less than 10 minutes. Wilson-Raybould, meanwhile, sent a letter to all Liberal MPs making an 11th-hour pitch for staying in caucus but making no apologies for going public with her contention that she was improperly pressured last fall to stop the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The company faces criminal charges over allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya. Wilson-Raybould had the authority as attorney general to divert the proceedings with a remediation agreement, a sort of plea-bargain that could spare the company the worst consequences of a conviction; that authority is new in Canadian law, it has never been used, and Wilson-Raybould has said she saw no reason to overrule a decision by the director of public prosecutions against seeking such an agreement.

""There was a tone of the letter that had an exclusivity to it, that she had a monopoly on truth and that there was not a conversation to be had,"" said Toronto MP Rob Oliphant. ""It was a strong first-person letter and politics is not about first person ... it's about 'we,' not about 'I.' ""

National caucus chair Francis Scarpaleggia, from Quebec, said there was ""an overwhelming consensus"" that the two had to go.

Not all Liberals were happy with the decision. Toronto MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and New Brunswick MP Wayne Long, who had hoped for a way to accommodate the former ministers, said they were disappointed but respected the consensus view of caucus and the prime minister's decision.

In a Facebook post, Philpott said her decision to resign from cabinet in early March, citing a lack of confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file, was not about ""a lack of loyalty."" Rather, she insisted both she and Wilson-Raybould were attempting to ""protect"" Trudeau from the consequences of ""attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence.""

Philpott said she will continue to serve her constituents in Markham-Stouffville ""for the remainder of this term"" — which suggests she does not intend to run for re-election as an independent or candidate for another party.

Wilson-Raybould tweeted that she will take time to reflect on her next steps.

""Growing up as an Indigenous person in this country I learned long ago the lesson that people believing what they wish about you does not, and cannot ever, make it the truth — rather than letting authority be the truth, let the truth be the authority."" -Jody Wilson-Raybould

""What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party. I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do,"" she said.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time issuing what amounted to an invitation to the two former ministers and their supporters to join his party.

""If you believe that speaking truth to power should be rewarded, not punished, there is a place for you in the Conservative Party of Canada,"" he said in a statement. ""The message (the Liberals) have sent today is clear: If you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party of Canada.""

Trudeau said he'd tried to be patient and understanding but nothing would satisfy the two ex-ministers.

""We've taken every effort to address their concerns, and ultimately, if they can't honestly say that they have confidence in this team ... then they cannot be part of this team,"" Trudeau said. ""Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided. We can't afford to make that mistake — Canadians are counting on us.""

He concluded his speech with a campaign-style recitation of his government's accomplishments, including the assertion that: ""We have always, always fought to create and protect jobs. We will never apologize for doing so.""

Trudeau and his staff have maintained throughout the SNC-Lavalin affair that they never improperly pressured Wilson-Raybould; they only wanted to ensure she had considered every lawful tool to avoid a criminal conviction that could cripple the company and potentially put thousands of employees out of work.

Wilson-Raybould maintains she was moved out of the justice portfolio in a mid-January cabinet shuffle as punishment for refusing to comply.

Last week, she released a surreptitiously recorded audio of a phone conversation with Privy Council clerk Wernick, the country's top bureaucrat, as part of additional evidence to bolster her claim of improper pressure. But that too seemed to backfire, galvanizing Liberal MPs in the belief that she could no longer be trusted.

""If a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone, it's wrong,"" Trudeau said in explaining Wilson-Raybould's expulsion. ""When that politician is a cabinet minister secretly recording a public servant, it's wrong. And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general of Canada, secretly recording the clerk of the Privy Council, it's unconscionable.""

In the call, Wernick repeatedly asked Wilson-Raybould why she was not using all the tools at her disposal on the SNC-Lavalin case. She pushed back, saying she would not override the decision of the director of public prosecutions.

Wernick told her Trudeau was ""quite determined"" on the matter and would likely ""find a way to get it done one way or another.""

NDP MP Jenny Kwan said Trudeau's move Tuesday was an extension of that attitude — he'd decided he was going to get his way and threw two unco-operative women under the bus, she said.

In her appeal to her caucusmates, Wilson-Raybould did not mention the secret recording. She argued that she rejected the prime minister's pressure on SNC-Lavalin because she was standing up for Liberal values.

""I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote. ""I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess.

""I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said.""

Liberal MPs dismissed the letter as ""too little, too late,"" as Toronto MP Judy Sgro put it.

Oliphant acknowledged that ejecting two prominent former cabinet ministers — both women, one a prominent Indigenous leader before she ran for Parliament — will mean the party has to work on public perceptions of its commitments to equality and reconciliation.

Trudeau will have to begin that immediately. His schedule Wednesday includes a speech before Daughters of the Vote, which takes 338 young women to Ottawa to promote their involvement in politics. It's followed by an appearance at a meeting of a committee of leaders working on Inuit-Crown relations.","Trudeau says Wilson-Raybould, Philpott no longer Liberal caucus members",Winnipeg Free Press,https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/cabinet-members-openly-debate-jody-wilson-rayboulds-future-in-liberal-caucus-507997932.html

Federal Liberals have traditionally been more malleable and more politically nimble than their Conservative and NDP opponents.

It's often said that Liberals will campaign from the left and then steer to the right after elections.

They'll shift and shimmy, depending on the political circumstances.

On the one hand, former leader Pierre Trudeau said the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation, making him appear like a great civil libertarian.

Then he released a white paper proposing the full assimilation of Indigenous people. A year later, he dispatched the army into the streets of Montreal and allowed police to round up hundreds of people following two kidnappings.

Then, in another twist, Pierre Trudeau introduced the Canadian Charter of Rights, radically transforming the rights of individuals vis-a-vis the state. That ushered in new liberties, preserving his reputation in history. But he had to be pushed like hell by First Nations leaders and the NDP to recognize and affirm Aboriginal and treaty rights in the constitution.

The same pattern occurred through the years of Jean Chrétien's rule. He campaigned against the GST but embraced it after the election. He eliminated national standards for social assistance, but then kept Canada out of the U.S.-led war against Iraq.

Liberals tend to be far less xenophobic than Conservatives, which is a major reason for their political successes since the Second World War.

It's a similar story with Justin Trudeau, who also can't be accused of being xenophobic. He cancelled the Enbridge pipeline to the West Coast but has been gung-ho to proceed with three other pipelines.

He talks a good game on the climate, but retained the Harper government's greenhouse-gas emission targets and is failing to meet them.

Justin Trudeau claims to place the government's relationship with Indigenous peoples above all others. Yet he continued granting federal permits for the Site C dam while it was before the courts, benefiting engineering companies like SNC-Lavalin, and he mocked a protester worried about mercury contamination on a reserve.

Justin Trudeau purports to hold the justice portfolio in high regard. Yet he's the first prime minister who's been exposed as trying to derail a criminal prosecution.

His eagerness to do this appears to be the reason he fired his justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, notwithstanding denials by him and his close friend Gerald Butts.

Indigenous intellectual Russ Diabo tweeted this image out last year to reflect his feelings about Trudeau family values.

Even though the federal Liberals are closer, ideologically speaking, to most voters (as opposed to those who don't vote) than their chief competitors, they always seem to get derailed over issues of principle and ethics.

To many Canadians, it was unethical for Trudeau to try to interfere in a criminal prosecution. End of story.

Canadians feel this way even without fully understanding the niceties of the constitutional concept of prosecutorial independence.

In a nutshell, it states that prosecutors, just like police and the judiciary, should act independently to protect against elected officials meddling in areas where they're not supposed to tread. The rule of law protects the country from politicians deciding who should be prosecuted.

Because Liberals tend to be more slippery than many of their counterparts in the NDP and the Conservatives, they don't, for the most part, have a big problem with their prime minister crossing this line.

All you have to do is listen to the comments of people like Transport Minister Marc Garneau, Toronto-area MP Judy Sgro, or Fisheries Minister Jonathan Wilkinson. Witness the ovations the prime minister received from veteran members of his caucus yesterday.

In the same manner, federal Liberals weren't too bothered by the elimination of national standards for social assistance in 1995. This had been a hallmark of our social-welfare system since the days of Lester B. Pearson.

It didn't bug them, even though this led to a race to the bottom among provinces when it came to providing social assistance. That, in turn, set the stage for the current homelessness crisis gripping the nation.

Now, federal Liberals could be on the verge of breaking the dam of prosecutorial independence. And they're using the fig leaf of a taped phone conversation, which Justin Trudeau called ""unconscionable"", as their justification to banish two whistle-blowers who felt that this was wrong.

While the meddling in the SNC-Lavalin criminal prosecution may persuade Canadians to throw the federal Liberals out of power, this action must be seen for what it is—yet another symptom of the rot within the federal Liberals.

It's a party that too often seems to lack a moral or ideological compass. That's why it's had a tendency to attract those who will shift their positions, often quite eagerly, depending on the circumstances. They're Liberals of convenience.

So even if Justin Trudeau is pushed out, he'll likely only be replaced by another politician who will behave in a similar manner.

Blockbuster Canadian job gains this year have helped bolster investor sentiment for the loonie, offsetting other data showing a slowdown in Canada’s economy.

The domestic job numbers have been volatile in recent months so now investors are bracing for disappointing data that could put “downward pressure” on the currency, said Alfonso Esparza, a senior currency analyst at OANDA.

The Bank of Canada is unlikely to cut interest rates to support a flagging economy as long as job growth continues at a robust pace, an analysis of the central bank’s response to past divergences in economic data suggests.

The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, dipped on Wednesday after U.S. government data showed a surprise build in crude inventories.

U.S. crude oil futures settled 0.2 percent lower at $62.46 a barrel, while the U.S. dollar declined against a basket of major currencies as encouraging Chinese data and hopes of a trade deal between the U.S. and China boosted risk appetite globally.

At 3:50 p.m. (1950 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3338 to the greenback, or 74.97 U.S. cents. The currency’s strongest level of the session was 1.3297, matching Monday’s 11-day high, while its weakest was 1.3353.

The only other G10 currencies not to advance against the U.S. dollar were the yen and the Swiss franc.

Lack of progress for the loonie came one day after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought to quell a crisis that threatens his chances of re-election, expelling from party ranks two former Cabinet members he said had undermined the ruling Liberals.

Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year fell 5 Canadian cents to yield 1.588% and the 10-year was down 30 Canadian cents to yield 1.702%.

Canada’s 10-year yield rose 3.5 basis points further above the yield on the 3-month T-bill to reach a spread of 3.7 basis points, which could temper the recession concerns of some investors.

OTTAWA -- A third Canadian canola exporter has received a non-compliance notice from China over quality concerns, the federal agriculture minister said Tuesday, the latest development in an escalating feud with the Asian country.

Marie-Claude Bibeau confirmed the Chinese government's complaint to a third, unnamed company as she testified before a parliamentary committee studying a trade dispute that has seen China suspend the canola-seed sale permits of two other Canadian firms.

""We've been informed that there's a third company that received a non-compliance notification,"" Bibeau said, though she wouldn't name it. ""It doesn't mean that they're suspended, either, at this time. So, we will obviously keep working with them and see how it goes.""

In recent weeks, citing concerns about pests, China has sent non-compliance notifications to Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc., two major Canadian exporters of canola seed. Chinese officials also suspended their licences.

China's moves to choke off Canadian canola-seed imports have been widely viewed as the superpower applying economic pressure on Canada after the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Late Tuesday, a spokesman for Bibeau said the third, unnamed company received its non-compliance complaint from China in early March, around the same time as Richardson was issued its notice. Oliver Anderson said it was important to make the distinction to show that it was not a more recent escalation by China.

Curt Vossen, the CEO of Richardson, told another House of Commons committee Tuesday that canola products alone were just over 15 per cent of all of Canada's exports to China and, last year, were worth more than $4 billion.

China imported $2.7 billion worth of Canadian canola seed last year, which ensures any prolonged feud would be felt by farmers, the industry and the broader economy. The seeds are the raw material for canola oil, which is widely used for cooking and in some industries.

Vossen, whose Winnipeg-based company has been doing business in China for more than a century, said he cannot emphasize enough the importance of finding a solution to the feud -- and quickly.

As the federal government searches for that solution, it's been trying to find new markets and cabinet ministers have been touting Canada's recently ratified trade deals with the Asia-Pacific region and the European Union.

""If the current disruption continues over the longer term, we will have no choice but to find other markets for Canadian canola seed, however doing so will be no easy task,"" said Vossen. ""While we are confident that we can eventually find other markets, it will not be a painless exercise.""

He urged the federal government to be ""more aggressive"" in defending the interests of Canada's agriculture exporters in China and around the world, where they're facing trade barriers in several jurisdictions.

""To say that canola is important to Canada's trading relationship with China would be a gross understatement -- canola and, indeed, the entire grains and oilseeds complex is the foundation of Canada's trading relationship with China,"" he said, noting the disruption comes at a critical time right before seeding season, when farmers are deciding how much to grow.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the dispute and Bibeau has said she sent a letter to her Chinese counterpart with a request to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. Officials are examining options to support farmers through the possible expansion of existing programs, Bibeau said.

The federal Liberals have also established a working group that includes officials from Richardson and Viterra and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

On March 1, the same day China suspended Richardson's licence, Canada's Justice Department gave the go-ahead for the extradition case against Meng.

It marked the formal start of the high-profile process that has thrust Canada into a highly uncomfortable position between China and the United States.

OTTAWA – Federal Liberal MPs are gathering for an emergency meeting tonight to discuss whether to expel former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from caucus.

The final call rests with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is expected to make a decision in consultation with Liberal MPs.

The two quit Trudeau’s cabinet over his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, though both say they want to remain in caucus and to run again as Liberals in this fall’s election.

But other Liberal MPs have begun openly questioning their trustworthiness, especially after Wilson-Raybould revealed that she secretly recorded a contentious phone call with Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick last year.

The call was part of what Wilson-Raybould has described as a long campaign of pressure from Trudeau, his aides and staff members to get her to help the Montreal engineering firm avert criminal prosecution on corruption and fraud charges related to its dealings in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was removed from her role as attorney general and justice minister because she wouldn’t comply.

Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus, saying that trust with the two former cabinet ministers has been irreparably broken.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it’s taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,” he said.

“It’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer remain part of our Liberal team.”

Earlier in the day Trudeau’s former right hand man released a series of documents designed to poke holes in Wilson-Raybould’s claims that she was moved to a less prestigious cabinet position because she stood up to pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in a criminal case against Canadian engineering and construction giant SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet in February following an explosive report by The Globe and Mail newspaper.

It alleged that she was moved to the less prestigious veterans affairs portfolio in January because she refused to bend to PMO pressure to override the director of public prosecutions and offer SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement instead of a criminal trial on corruption charges tied to Libya contracts.

‘I’m not the one who tried to interfere’

In her testimony to the House of Commons Justice Committee last month Wilson-Raybould, the first Indigenous Canadian to hold the position of justice minister and attorney general, said she felt inappropriate pressure from the PMO and other officials to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

She also reiterated her belief that her demotion to veterans affairs minister was retribution for her principled stance in protecting the independence of the office of the public prosecutor.

Last week she also released a recording of her conversation with the former Clerk of the Privy Council about the SNC-Lavalin affair as another proof of the pressure she faced.

The seemingly unending political scandal has seriously undermined Liberal chances of re-election in the upcoming federal elections later this fall.

In her letter to her Liberal colleagues, Wilson-Raybould wrote that she understands their anger and frustration.

“I am angry, hurt and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” she wrote. “In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

She also defended her actions on the SNC-Lavalin file.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened,” she says in the statement.

Contradictory statements

At the same time Gerry Butts, the prime minister’s former principal secretary, tabled with the parliamentary justice committee dozens of pages of text messages and a transcript of a conversation between himself, Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould that took place one week before the Jan. 14 cabinet shuffle.

The transcript of that call, which took place while Wilson-Raybould was vacationing in Bali, confirms that the B.C. MP told the prime minister she believed she was being shifted out of justice “for other reasons.”

Trudeau told her the shuffle would not be happening if Scott Brison hadn’t resigned as Treasury Board president.

In a short interview with CBC News Tuesday Wilson-Raybould said she sees no contradiction in her assertions that she was shuffled to veterans affairs because of SNC-Lavalin and her statement that she believed Trudeau when he assured her that she was being shifted out of justice for other reasons.

“I don’t know how those versions are inconsistent,” Wilson-Raybould told CBC News.

She, however, refused to answer a question about why she recorded the conversation with former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick without informing him about that.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled two prominent women from the caucus to prevent what he called “civil war” in the party.

The ongoing controversy has been bringing the party down in the polls leading up to a general election.in October, and according to Duane Bratt, has also been tarnishing the Prime Minister’s reputation internationally. Duane Bratt (PhD) is a political science professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta.

The scandal is about allegations of political interference of the highest members of government into a legal case against Montreal-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. That company is charged with fraud and bribery in connection with contracts in Libya.

In the latest chapter of the ongoing controversy the issue of “trust” within the party seemed to be the main issue. The former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould is alleged to have broken that trust when she recorded a phone call with a high-ranking bureaucrat and released it publicly to support her version of events.

Another high ranking female member of the Liberal caucus, Jane Philpott also expressed deep concern over the prime minister’s handling of the affair. Although both women had expressed their confidence in the prime minister and wanted to remain as members of the caucus, Justin Trudeau ruled they could not remain as trust had been broken.

Analysts say while the move may have been made to firm up party ranks, the two ejected members may now be free of any legal “confidentiality” constraints they had as caucus members and as such could reveal more about the “SNC-Lavalin affair” which could potentially further hurt the Liberal party, already sliding in opinion polls.",Explosive event in Canadian politics,rcinet,http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2019/04/03/explosive-event-in-canadian-politics/

OTTAWA – In her Spring Reports on tax and non-tax fossil fuel subsidies, the Environment Commissioner confirmed that Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government is failing to identify and assess a complete list of fossil fuel subsidies – and is only doing weak assessments on the measures they examine. The government only looked at 23% of government departments to identify non-tax subsidies and didn’t even consider the expansion and purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline as a potential subsidy.

New Democrats know that to effectively fight climate change, we have to throw everything we have at the problem – that means working together to set ambitious targets with measures to hold the government accountable, taking concrete action to reduce emissions and investing in building the clean energy economy we need, now.

“Fossil fuel subsidies have given an unfair advantage to the fossil fuel industry while the renewable energy industry creates jobs that are sustainable to last for decades to come. Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have promised repeatedly to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, but today the Environment Commissioner confirmed that this is just another broken promise,” said NDP Environment Critic Alexandre Boulerice (Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie). “The Liberals say they want to eliminate inefficient subsidies, but their failure to define what ‘inefficient’ means is leaving Canadians on the hook for billions of dollars every year. Canadians want a government that will show strong climate leadership, but the Liberals are failing to step up.”

The Environment Commissioner also identified serious gaps in the Liberal government’s ability to protect Canadian waters from aquatic invasive species. The Commissioner found that the government has failed to take the necessary steps to prevent invasive species from becoming established in Canada’s waterways. The federal government has also failed to clearly define jurisdictional responsibilities with the provinces, creating uncertainty about who should respond when an invasive species is detected.

“Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government likes to tout its record on protecting our water, but today’s report has confirmed that the Liberal government has no plan to keep invasive species from harming our aquatic ecosystems,” said NDP Fisheries Critic Gord Johns (Courtenay–Alberni). “And their failure to coordinate with the provinces is leaving our freshwater at an even greater risk. Canadians deserve better.”

Yesterday, a report released by Environment and Climate Change Canada found that Canada is warming at a faster rate than the rest of the world. Canadians want a government that will invest in renewable energy and ensure a sustainable future.

Earlier this week, someone ...","Since the SNC-Lavalin affair began in early February, Canadian politics has been consumed by a dispute that is, fundamentally, about the rule of law. The debate has been ugly at times, and dispiriting — such is the nature of dynamic partisan politics. But the core issue remains essential. Canada can be a true democracy only if the courts are independent. This is one of the rock-bottom bare essentials of a functioning liberal-democratic state.

Earlier this week, someone — the identify of the person or persons responsible is unknown — leaked to the media that the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, had recommended the appointment of Judge Glenn Joyal to the Supreme Court. The details of the deliberations, in which Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau disagreed, were released by someone within the government. Only the leaker knows their motive, but given the recent political controversy and ongoing dispute between Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau, it’s certainly fair to speculate that the purpose of the leak was to provide the prime minister with cover. An earlier dispute would, in theory, give the prime minister more of a reason to eventually remove Wilson-Raybould from her duties as justice minister and attorney general (the disagreement over Joyal has the added advantage of being unrelated to the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin).

As cover goes, it’s pretty sparse — the dispute over Joyal dates back to the summer of 2017, long before Wilson-Raybould’s demotion. Besides, the prime minister himself has repeatedly said that only Scott Brison’s decision to exit political life was responsible for Wilson-Raybould leaving justice, a consequence of the ensuing cabinet shuffle. Establishing previous disagreements between the two does Trudeau no favours now.

But there is a more fundamental issue here — Joyal, the chief justice of Manitoba, has had his personal life dragged into a political controversy. That’s wildly inappropriate, and again, speaks to a fundamental lack of respect for the complicated and fragile norms that underpin this country’s commitment to the rule of law.

Canada can be a true democracy only if the courts are independent

Joyal applied to a senior judicial job, was considered, and someone else was chosen. He declared this week, after his name surfaced in media reports, that he ultimately chose to withdraw from consideration anyway, as his wife was battling cancer. This is obviously a violation of his personal rights to privacy, but also further politicizes our justice. The fact that the deliberations and debates over Joyal have been aired is not only an insult to him, but an incredibly chilling message to anyone else who might apply for senior judicial or government jobs. Are they assured of privacy even if leaking their personal details might aid a political party’s partisan cause — or even, possibly, merely a faction within a political party at war with itself? Are conclusions about their strengths and weaknesses, reached by politicians for political purposes, now to be aired for all to see, even if those conclusions are unfair or even inaccurate?

The SNC-Lavalin affair has done more than reveal bitter divisions within Liberal ranks. It has now offered Canadians two clear warnings that the Liberal commitment to the rule of law may be, at best, conditional. The seriousness of this cannot be overstated.",NP View: Leak yet another Liberal assault on the rule of law,National Post,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-leak-yet-another-assault-on-the-rule-of-law

As the SNC Lavalin scandal tore through Canadian politics over the last two months, Beech remained largely silent. He did not speak to media on the topic, including after the NOW asked him to respond to harsh criticism from his NDP opponent, Svend Robinson.

But the Burnaby parliamentarian told the NOW on Tuesday that he had spent the last several weeks acting as an intermediary between Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott on one side and the Prime Minister’s Office on the other.

Those efforts ultimately failed to mend fences between the two camps, as Wilson-Raybould, the Vancouver Granville MP and former attorney general, and Jane Philpott, an Ontario MP who left cabinet in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould, were expelled from Liberal caucus by the prime minister Tuesday.

Neither MP will be allowed to stand as Liberal candidates in the Oct. 21 election as they had planned.

Beech said Tuesday’s news made for a “sad day.”

“I tried everything that I could working with Jody and Jane to try to find a resolution that brought the team together, and I appreciated that the prime minister also tried every possible route, but at the end of the day, Canadians are counting on us to deliver for them,” Beech said.

The first-term MP said he could not go into detail about the effort he made to mediate between the two sides because conversations between caucus members should be kept confidential.

“I made every effort over the last five weeks to try to come to (a) resolution and I'm sad that this is the eventual outcome,” Beech said.

The Burnaby MP described Wilson-Raybould as “a close personal friend” and said he had “unbelievable respect” for Philpott.

It was Trudeau’s decision to kick the two former members of cabinet off the Liberal team, Beech said.

Beech would not say how he would voted had the fates of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott come to a caucus vote.

Asked why he wouldn’t answer the question, he said “because I would have to think about it really hard,” adding “there's nothing easy about this.”

But Beech said he thought Trudeau ultimately made the right call.

“When it comes to caucus politics and governing the country, you have to have a team that trusts each other and it was obvious over the last number of weeks – and certainly more obvious over the last couple days – that that trust had been eroded and you need trust in order to have a well functioning caucus,” he said.

Asked whether he had personally lost trust in Philpott and Wilson-Raybould, Beech paused, saying “let me think about that for a second.”

“I think more than most, I'd hoped that there was a way forward, because I've just had such a productive relationship with both of them and I've learned so much from both of them and I know that on 99 per cent of issues, our vision and values are the same,” Beech said.

“And that's why this is such a sad day and I hope that there will be an opportunity to be able to work with them in some capacity in the future, but the prime minister made the right decision.”

Beech said he will host an open house at his constituency office (3906 Hastings St.) on Monday from 1 to 5 p.m. It will be open to any constituent who wants to talk about the SNC Lavalin case and the subsequent fallout, he said.

Beech also turned 38 on Tuesday, calling it “a birthday I’ll never forget.”

5:55 p.m.

Canada’s former attorney general says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has told her she’s been removed from the Liberal party caucus amid a scandal that has rocked Trudeau’s government in an election year.

Jody Wilson-Raybould tweeted Tuesday that Trudeau removed her and will not be a Liberal candidate in the fall election.

Truderau and Liberal lawmakers were meeting Tuesday evening to discuss Wilson-Raybould after she publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant.

Wilson-Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to minister of veterans’ affairs because she didn’t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company so that it would avoid a potentially crippling criminal prosecution.

The scandal has led to multiple resignations and damaged the party for eight weeks.

4 p.m.

Canada’s former attorney general pleaded with her colleagues Tuesday to let her remain in the Liberal party caucus amid a scandal that has rocked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government in an election year.

Liberal lawmakers are expected to vote as soon as Tuesday evening to oust Jody Wilson-Raybould after she publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant.

Trudeau is meeting with Liberal lawmakers and will make remarks to the media after.

Wilson-Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to minister of veterans’ affairs because she didn’t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company so that it would avoid a potentially crippling criminal prosecution.

The scandal has led to multiple resignations and damaged the party for eight weeks.

In a letter, Wilson-Raybould acknowledged her colleagues are enraged but said she was “trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” Wilson-Raybould wrote to colleagues.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.”

Trudeau has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 via sources that Trudeau’s staff put pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She denied she was the source of the story, writing “I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened.”

The secret recording Wilson-Raybould made public shows Wernick telling Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau “is determined, quite firm” in finding a way to avoid a prosecution that could put 9,000 jobs at risk.

It also reveals Wilson-Raybould saying she regards the pressure as “inappropriate.”

Wilson-Raybould has refused to express support for Trudeau, a demand many Liberal lawmakers say is necessary if she is to remain in Parliament as part of the party caucus.

Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said he expected Wilson-Raybould to be expelled.

“Her letter, I believe, sets the stage for her run at the Liberal leadership if the Liberals lose in October and Justin Trudeau steps down,” Wiseman said.

“She is a victim of the parliamentary system which in Canada imposes sturdier party discipline than in any of the other Westminster parliamentary systems. The letter reveals her naiveté, as a rookie Member of Parliament, about how the system works.”

The Liberal caucus could also vote to remove Jane Philpott, a former Cabinet minister who stepped from her role after she said she lost confidence in how the government has handled the affair.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang

OTTAWA – As federal Liberal MPs prepared to debate whether former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former health minister Jane Philpott should stay in their caucus, Wilson-Raybould wrote to them to explain her actions in the SNC-Lavalin affair and why she still wants to be a Liberal MP:

I am writing to all of you, members of the Liberal Caucus, to share some of my thoughts and observations about recent events and what they mean for us as a Party. I hope they are helpful to you.

There were many reasons I ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in 2015, including commitments on addressing climate change, the challenges of our criminal justice system, Indigenous reconciliation, and building an economy that supported all Canadians. For me, and I believe for our Party, all of these progressive policy commitments had underlying them a firm belief in the need for a transformation in our political culture, and the pursuit of a more responsive, representative, and less partisan approach to the governing of the country.

This commitment to a changed politics was not just about specific policies, such as proportional representation, but about every aspect of how we organize ourselves to govern, and the responsibilities that each of us carry. We committed to break old and cynical patterns of centralizing power in the hands of a few unelected staffers, the marginalization of hundreds of Members of Parliament with expertise and insights to offer, and the practice of governing in the shadows, out of sight of Canadians. I believed we were going to uphold the highest standards that support the public interest, and not simply make choices to create partisan advantage.

As part of committing to this transformative and progressive path, we were also committing to a government and caucus that represented all Canadians. Diverse and inclusive, our Caucus was to be a microcosm of Canada – not just geographically, but demographically. Indeed, I believe we understood that to build a stronger Canada, we needed to reflect that Canada. This includes the challenges, opportunities, tensions, and insights that arise when seeking to forge a common path and understanding in a context of real diversity and difference. This is a vision that reflects the future. Young people identify in dozens of different ways before they identify with a political party – and they privilege diversity of experience, background, and belief and upholding the experiences of all, over simply following the paths laid out with those who claim to hold power.

I still believe all of these things as I know all of you do, too. I believe it is what the country needs, and I believe our collective future well-being as a country demands action on such a vision. And indeed, one of the main reasons I had no hesitation to stand up for what I believed to be right and necessary for the country since September 2018 regarding SNC-Lavalin was because of my belief in that vision.

In 2015, I believed the Liberal Party held such a vision, and I still believe the Liberals can and must advance such a vision. I do believe fundamentally that the Prime Minister also still shares this vision.

Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess. I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said.

Growing up as an Indigenous person in this country I learned long ago the lesson that people believing what they wish about you does not, and cannot ever, make it the truth – rather than letting authority be the truth, let the truth be the authority. Indeed, if I had succumbed to interpreting the beliefs of others to be the truth, I never would have been able to push forward in the face of the racism and misogyny that far too many Indigenous women, and others, still experience every day.

Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.

If indeed our caucus is to be a microcosm of the country it is about whether we are a caucus of inclusion or exclusion; of dialogue and searching for understanding or shutting out challenging views and perspectives; and ultimately of the old ways of doing business, or new ones that look to the future.

As I have stated recently to the constituents of Vancouver Granville, it has been my great privilege to serve as their Member of Parliament over the past three and a half years and to continue to have their confidence. With the support, guidance, and participation of Canadians our government has accomplished much – and, of course, there is important work yet to be done. My nomination has been confirmed and it is my intention to stand for re-election as the Liberal candidate for the 2019 federal election and to continue with this work.

Respectfully,

Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould, P.C., Q.C., M.P.

Member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville

318,Politics,2019-04-03T17:07:00.0000000Z,"The controversy prompted the Liberal party to make its own public release of fundraising ... Conrad Black, the former Canadian media tycoon who gave up his citizenship to become a British Lord and was subsequently convicted of fraud in the United States ...","This story has been updated to reflect that Laurier Club donor appreciation events did not require attendees to pay for tickets, instead they were invited based on previous or ongoing donations. The changes include Liberal party clarification that a breakfast reception at the Royal York in Toronto actually garnered $55,000. Actual numbers by date will be available in quarterly financing reports.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet raised $464,600 in contributions to the Liberal party for exclusive fundraisers held between the beginning of the year and March 14, according to the first report from Elections Canada’s new regulations.

While Trudeau and several of his top ministers appeared at fundraising events that donors paid anywhere from $200 to the maximum contribution of $1,600 to attend, a breakfast reception with the Prime Minister at Toronto’s Fairmount Royal York Hotel garnered $55,000.

Trudeau hosted the 7:15 a.m. event on Feb. 1, one week before the Globe and Mail first reported on the SNC-Lavalin affair, a story that has dragged the Liberal government into its worst crisis since Trudeau became prime minister in 2015.

On Feb. 7, when the Globe published its report, an evening fundraiser in Toronto featuring Trudeau raised $64,000 from 40 donors.

Total donations for several of the Liberal events had to be tabulated using a mean because individual donations varied, ranging upward from $200.

The Elections Canada report on regulated fundraising stems from legislation the Trudeau government introduced in May 2017, in the wake of a Globe report about “cash for access” fundraisers featuring Trudeau that were attended by influential business leaders with an interest in federal economic policy.

The controversy prompted the Liberal party to make its own public release of fundraising events the same year. The party also opened events to news media.

The Canada Elections Act amendments received Royal Assent on June 21, 2018, and took effect on Dec. 21. The new sections of the Act require any political party with at least one seat in the House of Commons to report details of all fundraising events attended by the party leader, interim leader, leadership contestant or federal cabinet minister where at least one person had to pay or contribute more than $200 to attend, or to have another person attend.

A previous version of this story included contributions for four large receptions the party describes as Laurier Club Donor Appreciation Events, where no specific contributions were required. Those who attended had already qualified to become members of the party’s elite Laurier Club of supporters by contributing the current requirement of a contribution of $1,500 for a year or by instalments, with a lower minimum for those under 30.

Contributions raised beforehand to qualify as Laurier Club members with access to those four receptions totaled $263,750.

The Elections Canada regulated fundfraising regime remains in place through federal election periods.

The Elections Canada report lists only two fundraising events attended by Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer, from which the party secured a total of $267,000.

One of the fundraisers, on Feb. 4 in Toronto, raised a total of $156,000 from 104 donors who each paid $1,500 to attend. The event organizers included Conservative Senators Linda Frum and Nicole Eaton.

The Conservative party did not respond to two emails from iPolitics.

Conrad Black, the former Canadian media tycoon who gave up his citizenship to become a British Lord and was subsequently convicted of fraud in the United States, is named on the list of supporters who attended Scheer’s Toronto event, but it is unclear whether he paid to attend, since only Canadian citizens can legally donate to Canadian political parties.

The other fundraiser Scheer attended, in Saskatoon, raised a total of $111,600, with donors paying $1,200 to attend.

The NDP has no entries in the report.

A party spokesman, Guillaume Francoeur, said no report was required because New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not attended any fundraisers where at least one person had to pay or contribute over $200 to attend, at least not since Dec. 21. The one event that Singh did attend, in London—Fanshawe, had a ticket price of $25.

“To date, we have not had any event that would satisfy these (thresholds),” said Francoeur.

The fledgling People’s Party of Canada, led by former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier, reported a total of $7,950 in contributions from B.C. donors — seven of whom contributed $250 each to attend a “Cocktail With Maxime Bernier” at Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier in North Vancouver, and 31 donors who contributed $200 each for a “Brunch with Maxime Bernier” in Chilliwack, B.C.

Top draws for Liberal contributions included Global Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair, and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who attended only one fundraiser during the reporting period, in Conservative MP Lisa Raitt’s electoral district of Milton.

Despite the SNC-Lavalin furor that has gripped the Liberals over the past months, two appearances by Trudeau — Feb. 20 in Halifax and Feb. 22 in St. John’s — raised a total of $119,000.

Braeden Caley, a spokesman for the Liberal party, told iPolitics that Liberal online fundraising in March 2019 was 167 per cent higher than in March 2018.

The Lead

Former attorney general Jody Wilson Raybould says she has been removed from the Liberal caucus and will not be permitted to stand as a party candidate in this fall’s election.

In a post on Twitter Tuesday evening, Wilson-Raybould said she had just been informed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the decision to remove her from caucus and as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Granville.

UPDATE: Jane Philpott has also been removed from caucus.

Marco Vigliotti has the latest.

CTV reported earlier today that the Liberal caucus is holding a previously unscheduled meeting Tuesday evening to discuss whether Wilson-Raybould or Jane Philpott can remain party MPs. Both of them resigned earlier this year from cabinet in protest of the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.

Also earlier today, CBC News reported that Wilson-Raybould had written to the caucus, in an effort to keep them from kicking her out of the Liberal Party.

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed too,” she said, according to the letter tweeted by CBC News.

And keeping on the same topic, a new submission to the House justice committee suggests Wilson-Raybould never mentioned SNC-Lavalin in any text messages she sent to the prime minister’s former top advisor before being removed as attorney general and justice minister.

The claim comes from the 41-page submission of Trudeau’s former top aide, Gerry Butts, to the Parliamentary body that’s been studying the SNC-Lavalin controversy. The submission was publicly released on Tuesday. Butts resigned in February amid allegations that officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, including himself, attempted to pressure Wilson-Raybould to provide SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement, instead of allowing its criminal prosecution to proceed.

In a tweet, Butts said he submitted the additional evidence after reviewing the submission that Wilson-Raybould made to the committee last week. Charlie Pinkerton has the latest.

In Canada

Canada’s international trade minister says the Trudeau government does not want to “escalate” an ongoing trade dispute with China over Canadian canola exports.

In testimony before the House international trade committee Tuesday, Jim Carr said Canada had not drafted a list of potential items that could be hit with retaliatory tariffs.

“We don’t think it’s in Canada’s best interest to escalate the tension,” he said. Kelsey Johnson has the full story.

The committee appearance came only hours after the Liberals blocked a Conservative MP from asking the House of Commons to consider holding an emergency debate on the canola dispute.

This morning Winnipeg-North MP Kevin Lamoureux stood up in the Commons on a point of order and asked that the House of Commons skip over its daily list of tasks, including the time allocated to make requests for emergency debate, so that it could proceed immediately to Orders of the Day. The request was initially denied by MPs in the Commons, which triggered a recorded vote. The Liberals won that vote since they have a majority in the House of Commons. Johnson also this story.

And keeping on the topic, a third Canadian grain company has been issued a single notice of non-compliance by the Chinese government because of alleged pest concerns in its canola exports, a senior Agriculture Canada official says.

“(The Chinese) have given company names,” Fred Gorrell, the assistant deputy minister for international affairs for Agriculture Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) told reporters following an emergency meeting of the House agriculture committee on Tuesday.

Gorrell declined to name the Canadian grain company “because it’s (about) non-compliance for another company.” Johnson has this one as well.

Staying on the committee circuit, the fisheries and oceans committee voted Tuesday to send a bill that would ban dolphin and whale captivity in Canada back to the House without any amendments. Bill S-203 passed through the Senate last year.

iPolitics will have a full story on the committee meeting later tonight.

Parliament’s spending watchdog is warning that Canadians will pay more for prescription drugs under the new North American trade deal.

In a report released Tuesday, the Parliamentary Budget Office said a provision in the trade pact extending the period of data protection for biological drugs would delay the introduction of lower cost generic alternatives known as “biosimilars” by two years, leading to increased costs for “Canadians and their drugs plan.” Marco Vigliotti reports.

Canada’s environmental commissioner is slamming the federal government for failing to clearly determine what constitutes “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies, something the Liberal government has promised to phase out by 2025.

In her spring reports released this morning, Julie Gelfand found that the definition of “inefficient” by Environment and Climate Change Canada and Finance Canada was so broad or incomplete it couldn’t guide their assessments on which oil and gas subsidies could potentially be phased out. Jolson Lim has more.

Former Conservative MP Tony Clement on Tuesday announced he will not seek re-election in this fall’s general election. Clement, who left the Tory caucus amid a sexting scandal last year, made the announcement on his MP website, saying it was “actually not a difficult decision” that he had the support of his family. Vigliotti has more.

The sponsor of a bill that would ban the import and export of shark fins in Canada says he’s disappointed the federal government is looking to make amendments at the eleventh hour when it’s had two years to bring them forward.

During second reading debate on Bill S-238, the Ban on Shark Fin Importation and Exportation Act, on Monday night, Sean Casey, parliamentary secretary to the minister of fisheries and oceans, told the House of Commons that while the government supports the bill, it may need amendments to avoid violating international trade agreements.

He said under the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act, prohibiting the import and export of shark fins into Canada “may be problematic.” Holly Lake has the latest.

An Alberta judge is to decide tomorrow whether to grant an injunction postponing the probe into the United Conservative Party’s leadership race until after the April 16 provincial election, reports The Canadian Press.

While a lawyer for several people involved in the campaign for failed candidate Jeff Callaway slammed the investigation by Alberta’s election commissioner as inappropriate, the counsel for the commissioner said suspending the investigation because of a complaint from those being investigated may give rise to “reasonable apprehension of bias in the other direction.”

Documents that were leaked last month suggest Jason Kenney’s campaign team directed Callaway to criticize Kenney’s main rival Brian Jean in the leadership race for the party, created by a merger of the Progressive Conservatives and the Wildrose Party. Kenney won the leadership race.

Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Anne Kirker said she would make her ruling Wednesday afternoon.

Opposition to Premier François Legault’s bill, aimed at settling once and for all Quebec’s debate over religious signs, is growing, with a new twist. Québec Solidaire, the party whose membership has grown younger with the arrival of Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois as co-spokesperson, effectively co-leader, voted overwhelmingly at a weekend convention to put aside the whole issue of religious signs.

Instead, Québec Solidaire proposes a shift in focus to climate change, judging greenhouse gas emissions a real threat and the “problem” of religious signs Legault has pledged to resolve, as a non-issue.

“This debate divides people. It creates tension,” explained Nadeau-Dubois, who was a leading figure of Quebec’s boisterous 2012 tuition strike. “We don’t need to exclude people to be free.” Kevin Dougherty has the latest.

Internationally:

U.S. President Donald Trump is once again threatening the close his country’s southern border unless something is done to slow the flow of illegal migrants, namely a deal with Congress strengthening restrictions on immigration. On Tuesday, he told reporters that “if we don’t make a deal with Congress, the border is gonna be closed — 100 per cent.”

But as CNN reports, citing internal sources, Trump’s own officials have repeatedly warned him that shutting down the border with Mexico could result in billions of dollars in “economic losses, destabilize border towns and cities, and do little to stem the flow of migrants across the southern border.”

CNN also reported that after Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the president would follow through on his threat “unless something dramatic” happened, aides in the West Wing met to discuss ways to prevent Trump from doing just that and if that wasn’t possible, to figure out logistical issues.

Keeping with Washington, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is vowing to not permit a vote on the revised North American trade deal until Mexico agrees to change its labour laws, reports Politico. In an interview, Pelosi said Mexico must first pass and implement the labour law reforms required under the so-called new NAFTA deal before the House considers any support for the pact, which is a major legislative priority of the Trump administration.

“Unless you do this, we can’t even consider it. … We have to see that [Mexico passes] the legislation, that they have the factors in place that will make sure it’s implemented and they demonstrate some commitments in sincerity, because it’s a big issue how workers are treated in Mexico,” she said.

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday said she will ask for another extension of the country’s deadline to leave the European Union after a marathon meeting of her cabinet that remains largely divided on the issue.

As the Associated Press reports, May said in a statement after the meeting that she would request a delay of Britain’s exit — currently set for April 12 — to forge a deal with the opposition parties to break the impasse over Brexit that has emerged as the country’s largest political crisis in decades.

The comments come after the EU’s chief negotiator warned about the costly chaos that would be sowed should the U.K. leave the transnational union without any agreement.

It also comes after a cross-partisan section of MPs in the British House announced they would advance a bill that would require May to ask for another extension of the country’s deadline to leave the European Union.

The bill is being presented by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and its supporters hope they can pass it through the House in one day, reports the BBC.

Algeria’s embattled President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is resigning before the end of his fourth term on April 28, his office said Tuesday in a statement.

Coming into office in 2015 after 10 years of Conservative governance, the Liberal Party immediately got to work tackling LGBTQ2 issues. Over the past four years, Prime Minister Justin ...","The last Canadian federal election in 2015 saw renewed promises for LGBTQ2 issues — from commitments to pass trans-rights legislation to ending the blood ban. But this time around, there’s a brand new People’s Party of Canada all too willing to rail against diversity, while the Conservative Party is being led by Andrew Scheer and his anti-trans, anti-marriage equality, anti-abortion voting record. It’s bound to be an especially tumultuous election for queer and trans Canadians.

To keep voters informed about our political parties’ commitments — and transgressions — we’ve noted each party’s policies on LGBTQ2 issues. And because these policies and promises will be changing throughout the election campaign, we’ll keep this story updated. Be sure to revisit it as campaign season begins.

The Liberal Party

Coming into office in 2015 after 10 years of Conservative governance, the Liberal Party immediately got to work tackling LGBTQ2 issues. Over the past four years, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s party has taken a ton of action on those issues, which they’ll definitely be relying on to earn our votes come election day on Oct 21.

Here’s what the party has accomplished since 2015:

– After more than a decade of trans activism, and in large part due to historic and ongoing efforts of New Democrat Members of Parliament (MPs), the Liberal government successfully passed a trans-rights bill — Bill C-16 into law in 2017 — enshrining gender identity and gender expression as protected grounds in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code of Canada.

– On Nov 29, 2017, Trudeau issued an apology on behalf of the federal government to the thousands of public servants, members of the military and police and intelligence employees discriminated against, fired, criminally prosecuted and sometimes imprisoned for their sexual orientation from the 1950s to the 1990s.

– The party appointed Randy Boissonnault, the openly gay MP for Edmonton Centre, as Special Advisor on LGBTQ2 Issues. Trudeau’s government also created the LGBTQ2 Secretariat within the Privy Council to help inform the government on issues and potential solutions of importance to our communities.

– In 2017, the Canadian government became co-chair of the Equal Rights Coalition, the first-ever international, intergovernmental coalition committed to protecting the rights of LGBTQ2 communities around the world.

– This February, the federal government made a commitment to advance human rights and socio-economic outcomes for LGBTQ2 people in developing countries, with $30 million in funding over the next five years, followed by $10 million a year after that.

– In their 2019 budget, the Liberals committed $20 million to LGBTQ2 service organizations to support capacity building and community-level work.

For some, their actions have rung hollow. While many applauded the 2017 apology to LGBTQ2 Canadians, others, like Michael Motala, one of the authors of the Egale report The Just Society Report: Gross Indecency, which was commissioned by the Department of Justice, said, “It feels like the government is just using these issues as a bit of a PR stunt and they’re really not tackling things substantively.”

And despite some significant victories, the Liberals haven’t made good on all of their promises to LGBTQ2 communities. The party campaigned in 2015 on a commitment to end the blood ban — which prevents men who have sex with men and trans people from donating blood unless they’ve remained abstinent for a period of time — but have failed to do so thus far. In 2016, the Liberals reduced that time period from five years to one, but the ban still exists despite outcry from LGBTQ2 communities and experts who say it unnecessarily targets queer and trans folks.

The New Democratic Party

While the New Democrats have never been the federal party in power, they’ve had a strong influence on LGBTQ2 issues. They were the first party to formally announce its support for the gay movement in 1976 and were home to Canada’s first openly gay MP Svend Robinson, who came out in 1998.

When the House of Commons voted on marriage equality in 2005, the NDP was the only party that required its MPs to vote in favour. And while Bill C-16 passed under a Liberal government, the NDP championed four separate legislative efforts since 2005 to enact federal trans-rights protections, re-introducing new legislation to keep the issue up for discussion, and building support across political parties.

The NDP hasn’t yet announced its 2019 election platform or any specific commitments on LGBTQ2 issues. But during his run for leadership two years ago, Jagmeet Singh made three key commitments:

– A total review of government policies and practices to ensure full compliance with trans-rights Bill C-16.

– A complete end to the blood ban.

– An LGBTQ2 lens on housing and homelessness reduction, with an emphasis on addressing the unique needs of homeless LGBTQ2 youth, though the commitments remain vague.

The NDP made a number of commitments of its own in the previous election, backed up by statements in their policy book, which include:

– Contributing to the repeal of the anti-sex work legislation Bill C-36, passed in 2014 under the Conservative government.

– Improving federal data collection on issues specific to the LGBTQ2 community, including health care needs and experiences, to improve availability of data to inform policies on a federal, provincial and local level.

– Investing in programs to promote equity for LGBTQ2 people, particularly LGBTQ2 young people. (No specific programs, however, were referenced.)

– Supporting international struggles against discrimination directed at LGBTQ2 communities.

The Conservative Party

Heading into the upcoming federal election, the Conservative Party of Canada is stuck in an uncomfortable position: facing a challenge on one side from Maxime Bernier’s right-wing People’s Party, which has the potential to split the conservative vote, and, on the other side, competing with an incumbent Liberal majority government for the centrist votes crucial to either party’s electoral success. With Andrew Scheer — a staunch social conservative who has voted against marriage equality, trans rights and pro-choice legislation — as its leader, the party seems likely to continue leaning into social conservatism. Scheer claims he’ll keep divisive social issues out of his government’s policies, but whether that’s true is debatable.

While the Conservative platform hasn’t yet been released, the party’s policy book is devoid of any references to LGBTQ2 communities. It’s worth mentioning that this is the party that only struck its definition of marriage as between a man and a woman from its policy book in 2016, more than a decade after Canada legalized same-sex marriage. Some members of the party, like Michelle Rempel and Michael Chong, have broken ranks from their peers in an effort to advance LGBTQ2 issues, with some success. When Bill C-16 came to a vote in the House of Commons, for instance, 38 Conservative MPs voted for it.

But whether or not the party will stay true to Stephen Harper’s legacy and sneak its way to electoral success without any discussion of LGBTQ2 identities remains to be seen.

The Green Party

Like the NDP, the Green Party has a strong history of tackling LGBTQ2 issues. In 1996, it became the first federal political party to officially support same-sex marriage, and was the first — and only — major federal political party to have an openly gay leader in Chris Lea.

While the Greens have yet to announce particular policies or commitments for LGBTQ2 communities for the upcoming election, the party articulated some vague commitments in the 2015 election that will likely shape their approach to LGBTQ2 issues this election. These commitments included:

– Investing in HIV/AIDS education and prevention services to ensure that those living with the virus are receiving comprehensive and effective treatments.

– Advocating for increased federal funding, coordination and support for strategies on mental health, addictions, sexual education, sexualized and gender-based violence and housing for all Canadians, with specific measures to address the needs of LGBTQ2 Canadians.

– Supporting public education to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

– Ending the targeting of LGBTQ2 bookstores and other LGBTQ2 businesses by Customs Canada.

– Improved protections for trans people and raised awareness of policies for inclusion.

– Advocating internationally to protect the human rights of LGBTQ2 communities.

The People’s Party of Canada

The People’s Party has been around less than a year, and it’s already collected a slate of candidates with ties to anti-abortion organizations, white supremacist groups and committed transphobes. One of the most infamous: Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, the Burnaby-South candidate — who earned more than 10 percent of the vote in a recent by-election — is on the record stating that gender fluidity is “the greatest and most insidious assault against our children that this nation has ever seen.”

Meanwhile, Maxime Bernier, founder and leader of the party, went on a Twitter rant in August 2018, claiming that diversity was threatening to “destroy what has made us such a great country.” Bernier has also spoken out against Bill C-16 in 2017, and previously voted to re-open the marriage equality debate in 2006, though he claims abortion and gender identity won’t be part of his platform.

While the People’s Party hasn’t yet announced its platform, the rhetoric of its leader and the politics of its candidates speak volumes about what we can expect.",Where do Canadian political parties rank on LGBTQ2 issues?,Daily Xtra,https://www.dailyxtra.com/where-do-canadian-political-parties-rank-on-lgbtq2-issues-150439

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown ...","On Friday, Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen offered some advice to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he is likely to ignore. Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

Attempts to whitewash Trudeau’s relationship with SNC as just “looking after Jobs in Quebec” beg the question: Why is Trudeau so devoted to obtaining a deferred prosecution agreement for a corrupt company?

SNC has been barred from bidding on Asian Development Bank projects for fabricating qualifications and documents (2004); settled corruption allegations with the African Development Bank over bribes in Mozambique (2008) and Uganda (2010); bribed Canadian officials with $22.5 million in relation to a McGill hospital contract (2009); bribed Canadian officials with $2.3 million on the repairs to the Jacque Cartier bridge in Montreal, an official is in jail (2017); been credibly found by the World Bank as participating in high-level corruption in Bangladesh in 2009-2010, and entered into a voluntary debarment from World Bank-financed projects; entered into a voluntary agreement to compensate seven Quebec municipalities for obtaining contracts through questionable means (1996-2011); made illegal federal election campaign donations (2004-2011), and is entering into a voluntary compliance agreement with the federal elections commissioner

There have been three Quebec DPAs entered into by SNC-Lavalin, and still the company continues to bribe and use false, deceptive or corrupt business and political tactics to obtain major contracts with millions of unethical profits accruing to them. What about the jobs lost by companies that do not use bribes and million-dollar gifts to get business?

Trudeau doesn't care – but we should!

Why is Trudeau shutting down every attempt to get to the truth?

Heads have rolled for no wrong doing? In all cases, there is a suggestion of political interference with a matter before the courts.

I would like to sell you some oceanfront property in Alberta caused by rising ocean levels due to global warming.

The report breathlessly warns Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.

But that’s hardly surprising since Canada is a big, northern country and it’s long been known warming is occurring faster at the North Pole and in the Arctic than anywhere else on Earth.

The report says the adverse impacts on Canada are “effectively irreversible” and will be felt for hundreds of years, even if Canada and the rest of the world succeeds in lowering industrial greenhouse gas emissions to avoid even worse warming.

Trudeau and Co. obviously wanted the release of this report on the same day (Monday) it imposed their new federal carbon tax on Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, in order to portray everyone who opposes the tax as “climate deniers.”

Except that effort was inadvertently bushwhacked on Tuesday when federal environment commissioner Julie Gelfand, in her final report, said the Trudeau government isn’t doing enough to combat climate change and isn’t on track to meet Trudeau’s 2030 target of reducing Canada’s industrial greenhouse gas emissions to 30% below 2005 levels.

This consistent with decades of failures by Liberal and Conservative governments to meet every emission target they’ve ever set.

Last year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted humanity had just 12 years to avert catastrophic warming, while UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pegged it at two years to avert “runaway climate change.”

This is nothing new.

It’s called “climate porn”, a phrase coined in 2006 by the United Kingdom’s Institute for Public Policy and Research, a progressive think tank, to describe the alarmist rhetoric that permeates public discussion of climate change, following an extensive review of government and environmental websites and media coverage.

In their paper, “Warm Words: How are we telling the climate change story and can we tell it better?” authors Gill Ereaut and Nat Segnit concluded:

“Climate change is most commonly constructed through the alarmist repertoire – as awesome, terrible, immense and beyond human control … It is typified by an inflated or extreme lexicon, incorporating an urgent tone and cinematic codes.

“It employs a quasi-religious register of death and doom, and it uses language of acceleration and irreversibility.

“The difficulty with it is that the scale of the problem as it is shown excludes the possibility of real action … by the reader or viewer. It contains an implicit counsel of despair – ‘the problem is just too big for us to take on’.”

It’s also counter-productive because people simply don’t believe Trudeau government rhetoric that while climate change poses an imminent, existential threat to humanity, it can be solved by a carbon tax that will make 80% of us richer.

4 p.m.

Canada’s former attorney general pleaded with her colleagues Tuesday to let her remain in the Liberal party caucus amid a scandal that has rocked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government in an election year.

Liberal lawmakers are expected to vote as soon as Tuesday evening to oust Jody Wilson-Raybould after she publicized a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant.

Trudeau is meeting with Liberal lawmakers and will make remarks to the media after.

Wilson-Raybould believes she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to minister of veterans’ affairs because she didn’t give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company so that it would avoid a potentially crippling criminal prosecution.

The scandal has led to multiple resignations and damaged the party for eight weeks.

In a letter, Wilson-Raybould acknowledged her colleagues are enraged but said she was “trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess.”

“Now I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to,” Wilson-Raybould wrote to colleagues.

“Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.”

Trudeau has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 via sources that Trudeau’s staff put pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She denied she was the source of the story, writing “I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened.”

The secret recording Wilson-Raybould made public shows Wernick telling Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau “is determined, quite firm” in finding a way to avoid a prosecution that could put 9,000 jobs at risk.

It also reveals Wilson-Raybould saying she regards the pressure as “inappropriate.”

Wilson-Raybould has refused to express support for Trudeau, a demand many Liberal lawmakers say is necessary if she is to remain in Parliament as part of the party caucus.

Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said he expected Wilson-Raybould to be expelled.

“Her letter, I believe, sets the stage for her run at the Liberal leadership if the Liberals lose in October and Justin Trudeau steps down,” Wiseman said.

“She is a victim of the parliamentary system which in Canada imposes sturdier party discipline than in any of the other Westminster parliamentary systems. The letter reveals her naivete, as a rookie Member of Parliament, about how the system works.”

The Liberal caucus could also vote to remove Jane Philpott, a former Cabinet minister who stepped from her role after she said she lost confidence in how the government has handled the affair.

Maybe there have been other politicians who turned a cabinet demotion into a three-month-long crisis for their governments, though none spring to mind. Perhaps there are other ministers who have spent days warning their bosses not to move them out of their jobs.

But no one in Canada, until Wilson-Raybould, appears to have done this so publicly and with such bridge-burning tenacity — up to and including Tuesday's fiery warning to fellow Liberals against ejecting her from caucus.

None of the warnings worked. In the space of three months, Wilson-Raybould has become the former justice minister, the former veterans affairs minister and, as of Tuesday night, a former Liberal MP and no-longer candidate for Vancouver Granville in the next election.

""More to come,"" Wilson-Raybould said in the tweet announcing her ejection from Trudeau's caucus. No doubt that's true — for a minister who was notoriously media-shy while in cabinet, she's been a magnet for controversy and attention since leaving it.

Regardless of what one thinks of Wilson-Raybould — and her story has polarized politics, even friends and families — her long-running exit from Trudeau's fold is unprecedented in terms of the damage it's done to all sides.

Why Trudeau let it go on so long is one mystery of this saga — the prime minister is well-versed in ejecting troublesome colleagues, be they appointed Liberal senators or errant MPs. His speech to Liberal caucus on Tuesday night, his fans and critics will say, is one he might well have delivered weeks ago.

The ""how"" of it going on so long, however, is less of a mystery. If we've learned nothing else in the latest wave of revelations about the behind-the-scenes conversations leading to her demotion, Wilson-Raybould's fierce streak of self-preservation has shone through.

She secretly taped a conversation in December with Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council — a move that Trudeau described as ""unconscionable"" in his Tuesday night speech.

Speaking to the entire national Liberal caucus at an emergency meeting on Parliament Hill, Trudeau cited the “will of caucus,” and said that while it was his decision, the trust that more than 170 Liberal members had with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had been “broken,” and it was clear they had to be removed.

“Whether it’s taping conversations without consent or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government and in me personally as leader, it’s become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer be part of our Liberal team,” Trudeau said.

The prime minister said that he spoke with caucus leadership earlier on Tuesday and also met with Philpott and Wilson-Raybould to inform them of his decision.

“We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns but ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team, despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team,” Trudeau said.

Minutes before Trudeau announced this, Wilson-Raybould tweeted that she had been informed by Trudeau that she was no longer in the caucus and had been dropped as the candidate for Vancouver Granville, B.C.

She was seen leaving West Block in the minutes before her tweet. In follow up posts, she said she is reflecting on “what PM has done,” and said her thoughts are with all who “believed in a new way of doing politics.”

“I hold my head high… I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do,” she said.

In a post on Facebook, Philpott said she was “profoundly” disheartened that the decision was made without her being given the opportunity to speak directly to the national caucus. She denied that she was disloyal or that her involvement in the affair had anything to do with political advantage.

“I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the Prime Minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” Philpott said. “These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.”

Philpott said that “it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences to the party and to the country,” and is vowing to remain the representative for her Markham Stouffville riding “for the remainder of this term.”

This decision comes nearly two months after the SNC-Lavalin scandal first broke.

The controversy centres on allegations from Wilson-Raybould that she faced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" for months by nearly a dozen government officials pressuring her to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, out of concern for jobs and Quebec political prospects.

The scandal began unfolding after Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were both shuffled into new cabinet positions in January. Days after the initial story broke about her being pressured, Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet, and Philpott followed suit a few weeks later, citing a loss in confidence in the way the government was handling the entire SNC-Lavalin affair. Since then both have offered additional information or commentary on the matter that Liberal MPs now appear to have been unable to reconcile with.

The pair’s removal from caucus follows a series of regional caucus meetings in which Liberal MPs discussed whether they should be allowed to remain with the Liberal team.

“This has been a difficult few weeks for our government and for our Liberal team. On the issues surrounding SNC-Lavalin we’ve seen allegations made, and different versions of events, details. Amid the confusing and competing narratives, Canadians rightly have had questions,” Trudeau said, adding that the government has too grappled with these questions about the role of government in protecting jobs, and respecting Canadian democratic institutions.

He said that the Liberals came to power pledging to do politics differently -- a promise Wilson-Raybould says the government has reneged on -- and in doing things differently, “we encounter difficult moments.”

As he finished his remarks to caucus, Trudeau received a standing ovation, and at least one voice in the room could be heard saying “bravo.”

The Liberal caucus will hold another meeting on Wednesday, likely to discuss all other business now that the most pressing matter has been addressed. Then, Trudeau will partake in the annual Daughters of the Vote event where 338 delegates descend on the Hill, in the name of encouraging more women to enter politics.

Wilson-Raybould was received warmly by a number of the delegates at a reception on Monday night and some critics have questioned whether the Liberals wanted to be seen throwing out two female caucus members on the same day as the Equal Voice-run event.

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were federal political rookies, first elected in 2015. They were both appointed to Trudeau’s first and historic gender-balanced cabinet, and were seen to be key to the government’s pledge of reconciliation and developing a new nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous people.

Prior to her career in politics, Philpott was a family doctor, and Wilson-Raybould was a crown prosecutor and regional chief.

Speaking to questions over whether this move damages the government’s brand as a feminist government, Liberal cabinet minister Melanie Joly said: “We have a feminist prime minister and I profoundly think that loyalty has nothing to do with gender, you’re either loyal or you’re not.”

In a statement reacting to the news, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said that the pair’s removal “should tell Canadians everything they need to know about how things work in the Liberal Party of Canada,” and offered that there is a place in the Conservative Party for anyone who believes that “speaking truth to power should be rewarded, not punished.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said that this is the way that Trudeau thinks he can make the SNC-Lavalin scandal go away, but it is “not leadership.”

Last-chance letter asking to stay

Trudeau leaning into the narrative about the Liberals’ approach to politics appeared to be speaking directly to some of what Wilson-Raybould had to say in a last-chance letter to her entire caucus, sent Tuesday around noon.

The letter hit the inboxes of Liberal MPs as some were gathering, grim-faced, to discuss her fate. In the letter Wilson-Raybould said she wanted to remain a Liberal MP -- something she has maintained throughout this affair -- and implored her colleagues to consider “what kind of party you want to be a part of.”

In the letter the Vancouver-Granville MP spoke of the Liberals’ 2015 election commitment to do politics differently, more transparently, and by empowering MPs. She stopped short of explicitly saying that she still has confidence in Trudeau.

“I believed we were going to uphold the highest standards that support the public interest, and not simply make choices to create partisan advantage,” she wrote.

She said the vision that the Liberals came into power with was “one of the main reasons” she didn’t hesitate to stand up for what she thought was right in the case of SNC-Lavalin.

“I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the Prime Minister and the government from a horrible mess,” Wilson-Raybould writes in the letter, obtained by CTV News.

“I am not the one who tried to interfere in sensitive proceedings, I am not the one who made it public, and I am not the one who publicly denied what happened. But I am not going to go over all of the details here again. Enough has been said,” her letter said.

Those final few words are something that it seems the entire Liberal caucus agrees with.

“By their actions they have excluded themselves so for us now it’s time to move on,” said Liberal cabinet minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.

His colleague and fellow minister Jim Carr said that “when trust is broken it’s sad and inevitably in public life and in politics, trust and loyalty, and pulling in the same direction is the kind of commitment that is necessary for all team members,” Carr said.

Outrage over secret audio

Over the last two days, numerous Liberal MPs have been speaking out, and expressing disappointment and condemnation over Wilson-Raybould's decision to secretly record and subsequently make public a December conversation she had with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick about SNC-Lavalin.

That audio was released on Friday along with dozens of additional pages of testimony, text messages, transcripts, and copies of emails to supplement her Feb. 27 hours-long testimony.

Speaking to this, Trudeau said it is an “especially wrong” thing for a politician, especially a cabinet minister, to have done.

“And when that cabinet minister is the attorney general… it is unconscionable,” Trudeau said.

Wilson-Raybould defended her recording on Monday, saying it was a ""reasonable, rational thing to do in an unreasonable and irrational situation,"" and that she felt she needed to protect herself.

House filibuster, study shut down again

Since she testified to the allegations, Trudeau has faced calls to resign and the House of Commons has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, the latest being a budget debate filibuster from Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre which is poised to enter its third day.

Early Tuesday the House Justice Committee met behind closed doors to determine next steps for the new studies it decided to take on after ending its probe into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The opposition did try to revive its proposal to resume the study that Liberal MPs shut down a few weeks ago, but that was unsuccessful. Despite the committee having ended its meetings on the matter, it is still receiving new evidence. The latest came in today from Trudeau’s former top adviser Gerald Butts who resigned amid this scandal. He turned over texts and other messages between he and Wilson-Raybould that show the tensions between the PMO and the former justice minister as she was being shuffled into a different portfolio, a move Wilson-Raybould said she thinks was because of her intransigence over not interfering in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal case.

In his televised comments to caucus Tuesday night, Trudeau indicated a desire to refocus the government’s agenda on other matters, and took aim at his opponents.

“Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them, that’s why I made the difficult decision,” Trudeau said.

“Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided, we can’t afford to make that mistake. Canadians are counting on us,” he said.

Jody Wilson-Raybould statement

What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party. I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do. (2/2)

They called for the implementation of Bill C-71, which would make changes to the background check system for gun owners, introduce new record-keeping requirements for retailers, and put further restrictions on transporting a firearm.

The ""national day of action"" was organized by Canadian Doctors for Protection from Guns, a coalition formed in the wake of last year's mass shooting in Toronto's Danforth neighbourhood.

In a separate move, the Liberals are also studying the implications of banning handguns and ""assault weapons.""

In Halifax, two doctors and a gun owner held an in-depth discussion at one petition-signing event at the IWK Health Centre. CBC was there and asked all three for their thoughts.

These interviews have been edited for length and clarity.

Dr. Kirstin Weerdenburg , pediatric emergency physician at the IWK Health Centre

What is the overall goal of the day of action?

We've written a letter to our prime minister and we would like the House to pass Bill C-71, and so today we're just getting signatures in support of our letter to the prime minister.

What is the problem that the group has specifically with firearms?

Gun violence is increasing and it's a very important public health issue and the safety of Canadians is very important to us and should be to everybody else as well.

As a pediatric doctor what is your experience with children and firearms?

Intentional and non-intentional injury as well as suicide in adolescents ... across the country we've been seeing it, so not just here, but in other places across the country as well.

What is the effect on families who have had this happen?

It's devastating. As one can imagine, it doesn't affect just the family — it's obviously devastating for them but also the health-care providers that are caring for them as well. So it's kind of a ripple effect on how many people it actually does affect and, like I said, it's very devastating.

You heard from gun owners who have concerns about this bill and about the effort from your group. What's happened there?

It's not specific to myself but to the group in general. There's been a lot of pushback from them and that we recognize their concerns. Everybody has a right to their opinion, but our opinion is that our public safety of Canadians is a priority and that given the amount of gun violence, it's increasing, we need to make this a priority as well.

There is a lot of literature out there already showing the rates of gun violence are increasing. And there are countries in the world where they've actually had legislation to improve gun control, where we they've actually seen decreased rates of injury and harm due to guns. So I'd say that that's good evidence for this.

Amanda Schreiber, legal owner of a handgun and long guns

Tell me about yourself.

I am a legal handgun owner. And it's very calming, very almost meditative. With the safety issues I have to be 100 per cent present in the moment when I'm at the range, because if anything goes wrong because I wasn't paying attention that could potentially mean something very, very bad.

For your own personal life, what worries you about the bill should it pass?

The hobby is great. Legal gun owners aren't the issue. And unfortunately a lot of the public and people are lumping illegal guns and illegal gun owners with legal gun owners. For me to take my guns out to the range there are a lot of rules and I follow every last one of them.

But people are saying that, ""Oh, the guy who has a handgun loaded in the front seat of his car and he's going to have road rage."" People are lumping me in with that same person. And making guns more illegal isn't going to change that guy. It's already illegal for him to have that gun in the car loaded. So I don't see how making it more illegal is going to change what he's doing.

What did you think of the doctors' points that guns may be used in accidents in the home, or suicides, or those kinds of things? What came out of that conversation?

I did have a great conversation. These guys seemed to be open, at least here in Halifax, they seem to be open to the discussion. And apparently they were not aware of some things that were out there as far as the current laws. As far as the suicides and accidents and everything else, most especially in Halifax most of what you hear is already illegal guns. There was one two days ago from Gottingen Street. He was charged with illegal guns. He was charged with possession without a licence. You know, again, that's not going to change.

If you're on slightly different angles at this, what's the way that you see going forward?

I think just open and honest discussion. You know, finding some common ground. Obviously banning guns isn't going to fix everything. It's not going to stop suicide. It's not going to stop accidents from happening from illegal gun owners. There needs to be a little bit more give and take. There needs to be more mental health. There needs to be more money to other issues, crime, gang rates, gang violence.

They talk about violence going up. But it's all gang-related. So maybe fixing whatever it is that creates gangs. Put more money into public housing or public events that keep people out of gangs, I feel would be a better-suited use of money.

Dr. Fred Archibald, family doctor in north-end Halifax

It sounded like a good discussion going on today. What did you take away from that?

We in health-care professions have a real concern about the increase in gun-related violence and mortality. And we feel it is the responsibility of health-care professions to advocate for restrictions on guns so that we can have an impact on the amount of gun violence there is. It is my view, and I can't speak for all health professionals, but in my view there is no place in this country for semi-automatic weapons of any kind. And they are restricted but they're not banned, and they should be.

There are responsible gun owners in Canada and they have a point of view. But I feel that when public safety is the issue, when public safety is at risk — which clearly it is by gun violence — that people have to make sacrifices sometimes in order to advance the public good.

When you say that people sometimes need to make sacrifices, what did you have in mind?

Legal gun owners, I think, enjoy target practice. But oftentimes legally owned guns are stolen … I think in all public safety issues there are sacrifices that need to be made.

You know, if you look at people who like to smoke. We know that smoking is a health hazard, as is gun violence. Smoking is restricted. It's not allowed, smoking in public spaces and that sort of thing. So smokers have to make a sacrifice. Seatbelts are a public safety issue. It's inconvenient to put seatbelts on sometimes. And some people would object to that. Many people did object to it when seatbelt laws first came out, but the statistics are very clear: lives are saved in motor vehicle accidents when people wear seatbelts and I think that is analogous to what we're facing now. There are sacrifices that need to be made in the interest of the public good.",3 views as Canadian doctors advocate for stricter gun control,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/doctors-gun-control-halifax-gun-owner-1.5083154
331,Canada,2019-04-03T23:18:00.0000000Z,"During a question-and-answer session with Trudeau, Indigenous Nova Scotia delegate Hannah Martin, facing him, declared the Liberal government was perpetrating violence with its inaction on ...","OTTAWA — A weary-looking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau entered the temporary House of Commons chamber, with its literal glass ceiling, took the podium and began to deliver a speech to a sea of young women. One by one, more than 40 of them rose from their seats to turn their backs on him.

The silent protest just after noon on Wednesday came during Trudeau’s first public appearance after expelling former ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould, who accused him of trying to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of Montreal construction firm SNC-Lavalin, and Jane Philpott, who resigned in solidarity with her, from his Liberal caucus on Tuesday evening.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, locked out of the regular weekly caucus meeting Wednesday morning, visited the House of Commons gallery and sat to listen statements by some of the Daughters of the Vote delegates — 338 women, aged 18 to 23, chosen by the Equal Voice organization to represent all of Canada’s ridings for a day on Parliament Hill.

Dozens of young women here for Daughters of the Vote turn their backs as Trudeau speaks -in solidarity with Ms Wilson-Raybould and Ms Philpott pic.twitter.com/aAhdlDHrcS — Peter Julian (@MPJulian) April 3, 2019

The two sat with Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who quit the Liberal caucus in the wake of reporting on SNC-Lavalin. She snapped her fingers sometimes in agreement with the young women’s pronouncements. All three gave standing ovations for statements on issues including climate change, Indigenous suicide, accessibility and religious freedom, along with the rest of the room, which brimmed with loud enthusiasm for each speaker.

Ducking out to speak with reporters, neither Wilson-Raybould nor Philpott would address the elephant in the room — that here were young women being encouraged to speak up when Wilson-Raybould’s whistle-blowing is what ultimately led to their excommunication from caucus. Caesar-Chavannes told the National Post “we needed that little boost today,” though. “We are in the gallery watching, having, we hope, made a mark on the 42nd Parliament. And here are young women in those seats saying, ‘yeah, we are going to continue this,’” she said.

When he finally arrived, Trudeau, the self-proclaimed feminist and “minister of youth,” would face more than one rebuke from the young women in front of him. And he was not alone — dozens of them walked out on Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer while he spoke, because of a distaste for his policies. Upon their return, the women, including a majority of those who wore a hijab, got as much applause as Scheer had for his short speech.

During a question-and-answer session with Trudeau, Indigenous Nova Scotia delegate Hannah Martin, facing him, declared the Liberal government was perpetrating violence with its inaction on Indigenous issues. “You cannot be a feminist if you are allowing corporations to rape the land, because as Indigenous peoples, that is our mother,” she said. He thanked her for her “strong voice.”

Other delegates, talking in a buzz outside the Commons after the event, accused Trudeau of failing Indigenous people and women both by expelling Wilson-Raybould, who was the first Indigenous attorney general. “It was like a microcosm of the history of Canada, white men telling Indigenous women where they can or cannot be and exercising power,” said Riley Yesno, from Toronto.

“I don’t believe Justin Trudeau is a feminist,” said Brit Sippola, from Saskatchewan, recalling a section of his opening statement when he said nobody in the room would want to have to “pick who to believe between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Chrystia Freeland” or “know that one person has to be right and one person has to be wrong between Jane Philpott or Maryam Monsef.” The prime minister was deflecting attention away from his own mistakes by saying it was “Jane’s word versus Maryam’s,” Sippola said. “He’s the one who’s pitting women against women here.”

Other cabinet ministers were marching out in the early afternoon to say that the decision to remove Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had had nothing to do with feminism. Politicians had breached the trust of their colleagues. They hadn’t been team players. Loyalty wasn’t a gender issue, full stop.

But Trudeau’s long day of defending himself was nowhere near over.

During question period, he stood up again and again to answer all of the opposition’s questions, accusing him of fake feminism, calling him a coward and demanding his resignation over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He was interrogated on details in the testimony and evidence that Wilson-Raybould had provided to the House justice committee’s perfunctory study of the affair. For the first time, after weeks of being grilled day in and day out, Trudeau admitted that yes, Wilson-Raybould had asked him, during a September meeting, if he was trying to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution. He said he told her no.

But that wasn’t good enough for Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who would go on later Wednesday to continue a multi-day, marathon filibuster over the issue. He pointed out that in Trudeau’s earlier statements nobody had raised any concerns with him about interference.

“Now the prime minister has caught himself in a trap of his own making,” he said.

“The member opposite is twisting himself into rhetorical knots to try to make a point that is simply not there,” Trudeau responded.

New Democrats seized upon the Daughters of the Vote protest as a symbolic repudiation of Trudeau’s credentials as a feminist prime minister. “What have they seen this week? They have seen women speak truth to power and then get shown the door,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said.

Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus is being accelerated. The plan was to do it on Wednesday ...,"Government scientists have produced a new report on climate change in Canada, and it's beyond grim. The details trigger thoughts of hoarding and maybe selling the house and moving to higher ground. To a millennial, the findings should inspire naked fear.

Among other things, the report, which is scheduled to be released Tuesday, says:

Canada's climate has been warming at roughly twice the rate of the rest of the world. In Northern Canada, it's even higher.

And, says the report, there is simply no doubt about the cause. Climate change-skeptic conservatives will, of course, disagree, but here is what the scientists say:

""Canada's climate has warmed and will warm further in the future, driven by human influence. Both past and future warming in Canada is, on average, about double the magnitude of global warming.""

Our climate is not warming consistently. It is most pronounced in the Prairies and British Columbia, and especially severe in northern B.C. The effects are strongest in winter.

It is effectively irreversible. The antidote prescribed in the report is politically impossible, at least right now: ""Scenarios with limited warming will only occur if Canada and the rest of the world reduce carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century.""

The scientists predict an eventual increase in ""annual average country-wide temperature"" of about two degrees Celsius, a rate that will remain steady after mid-century. They say the increase could be as severe as six degrees.

Jason Franson/Canadian Press More

The oceans around Canada have become more acidic and less oxygenated. Future warming will be heaviest in ice-free waters of the Canadian arctic. Most Canadians can expect coastal flooding to increase during their lifetimes.

Warming of the oceans, in particular, is a truly vicious circle. According to the report:

""Ocean warming and loss of oxygen will intensify with further emissions of all greenhouse gases, whereas ocean acidification will increase in response to additional carbon dioxide emissions. These changes threaten the health of marine ecosystems.""

In other words, worse begets even worse, begets disaster.

Canada is experiencing hotter extreme heat and less cold extreme cold. Permafrost is warming. There is less ice and snow.

Rainfall is increasing, although less so in the summer months. As warming continues, Canada (of all places) will likely face freshwater shortages.

Those are just the highlights. The main takeaway: if climate change worldwide is much more frightening and immediate than we all thought, as the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported six months ago, it's at least twice as bad in Canada.

Twice. As. Bad.

To the Trudeau government, this is core-mission stuff. Last week, scientists from the environment department were brought in to the Prime Minister's Office for briefings. The report will be public and online Tuesday, and Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet will be pushing the issue as something bordering on a national emergency, which is not an unreasonable way to characterize it.

Normally, you'd think findings like these would penetrate deep into voters' minds. Climate change, with reports like this one and that of the IPCC last October, is becoming an issue of economic self-interest.

SNC-Lavalin scandal

But these are not normal times. The Opposition is determined to keep public attention riveted on the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's remarkably effective effort to take down the prime minister.

That's not to say the new report won't generate headlines, but they will not be as politically explosive as, say, Wilson-Raybould's secretly recorded conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, which she submitted to the Commons justice committee last week. Over the weekend, at a ceremony in her honour in British Columbia, Wilson-Raybould signalled her determination to keep the story alive, and to continue speaking ""her truth."" Tory leader Andrew Scheer is equally determined to assist her.

Probably not coincidentally, the report is also landing at exactly the same time as a new carbon tax (the government wants to call it ""a price on pollution"") lands in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick, increasing the price of fuel by about four cents a litre at the pump.

Now they have been expelled from Trudeau’s Liberal Party, months before a general election. The SNC-Lavalin controversy has cast a shadow over Trudeau’s leadership.","Ottawa, April 3 (IANS) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has expelled two MPs from his party’s caucus after they accused him of meddling in a criminal case involving an influential company.

Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott had already resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet citing their concerns over the SNC-Lavalin affair, the BBC reported.

Now they have been expelled from Trudeau’s Liberal Party, months before a general election.

The SNC-Lavalin controversy has cast a shadow over Trudeau’s leadership.

Andrew Scheer, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, said on Tuesday that the Prime Minister had betrayed justice by removing two corruption whistleblowers.

Trudeau repeatedly spoke about the breakdown of trust between Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and members of his staff.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told the media shortly after informing his caucus.

“If they can’t honestly say they have confidence in this team… then they cannot be part of this team.”

Philpott has been vocal about her concerns with the government, and gave an interview in a national magazine last month in which she said “there’s much more to the story that needs to be told”.

Trudeau said his decision was sparked by the revelation that Wilson-Raybould had secretly recorded a conversation she had with Canada’s former top bureaucrat, which she released publicly on Friday.

Wilson-Raybould said the tapes backed up her claim that government officials inappropriately pressured her to shield SNC-Lavalin from prosecution.

The Canadian firm is accused of bribing officials in Libya to win contracts under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime.

SNC-Lavalin has openly lobbied for an agreement that would allow it to avoid prosecution and instead face alternative penalties or measures, such as a fine.

Wilson-Raybould said members of Trudeau’s inner circle pressured her to cut a deal, and when she did not, she was removed from her position as Justice Minister.

Trudeau has repeatedly denied that there was any wrongdoing by him or his officials.

The political controversy, which has been dragging on for weeks, has caused Trudeau’s popularity drop sharply in opinion polls a few months before a general election.

He said he is expelling the women from the caucus to put an end to infighting, which he had vowed to stop when he was elected in 2014.

And I think of the First Nations Caring Society and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, and the fact that there have been, I believe, six or seven non-compliance ...","In March, the Prime Minister was in Nunavut, apologizing for the role that previous governments played in taking Inuit from their families and sending them to tuberculosis sanatoriums in the south. Next to him was Natan Obed, the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), the national group representing Inuit. Obed was critical of the media’s lack of attention to the Prime Minister’s apology, amid the furor over the SNC-Lavalin scandal. He spoke to senior writer Paul Wells about this issue and the challenges of working with governments to build a new relationship.

Q: I have been at announcements with politicians, and the questions from the press gallery are never about what the announcement is about. You reminded us that sometimes there are higher obligations.

A: In this particular instance, we’d just been through a really powerful apology by the Prime Minister of this country, where he not only apologized and talked about the political conditions and the attitudes of Canada during the time, but then also pivoted and talked a bit about today and the future. So we were not only talking about an apology, we were also talking about a way forward to eliminate tuberculosis.

So these fundamental, groundbreaking things are happening that are stories, and then also the passion and the hurt from families who had been trying to get the government to apologize, trying to ﬁnd their lost loved ones for decades. That the media rushed right past that was unacceptable.

Q: Tuberculosis is not simply a human rights disgrace of the middle part of the 20th century, it’s a public health catastrophe that’s continuing. The TB prevalence rate today in the territory that ITK covers is 290 to 300 times the TB prevalence rate here, right?

A: Right. Last year Inuit leadership and the government of Canada pledged to eliminate tuberculosis by 2030, and halve the active rate by 2025. We need massive investments in Inuit Nunangat to ensure that we can meet those targets.

Q: What is Inuit Nunangat?

A: Inuit Nunangat is a term that Inuit have created very speciﬁcally. It is our homeland: the Inuvialuit settlement region in the Northwest Territories; the entirety of Nunavut; the Nunavik region of Quebec, which is through the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement; and the Nunatsiavut region of Newfoundland and Labrador. Those four settlement regions comprise Inuit Nunangat. It’s about a third of Canada’s land mass and it encompasses about half of its coastline.

Q: The long-term goal for this Inuit Nunangat is a contiguous political space with similar jurisdiction to the provinces in the south. Is that right?

A: Well, we’ll see where our self-determination takes us.

Q: You have been the president of ITK for 3½ years. Let’s start with how you got there. I mean, you spent a large part of your teenage years living in Maine, correct?

A: Correct.

Q: Tell us a little bit about your background.

A: My mother’s American, from Maine in the U.S. I have to say that very speciﬁcally because my father is from Nain in Nunatsiavut. But my father is Inuk, and he is where I get my Inuit identity from.

I grew up all over the place, actually. I was born in Fredericton, on the way back to Labrador, because my father was in a trade school there, and he had also been studying to become a minister. So that’s what it says on my birth certiﬁcate. But we were in Nain and in Nunatsiavut, and that’s really where I say I’m from, because that’s where I feel that my identity lives and breathes.

I also lived in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, North West River, in Labrador, and then, when I was 12, my mother took my brother, my sister and I, and she separated from my father and we moved to Maine. I went to high school in Maine, and I played junior hockey in Montana and New Hampshire. And then I went to university in Boston, at Tufts. All the way through that, though, I was Inuk. I knew that I always needed to come back.

Q: There are some statistics about the life of Inuit in the North that give an indication of the challenge that we’re all facing as a country. The percentage of the population that live in crowded homes is 52 per cent, versus nine per cent here in the south. The number of families who are food insecure is 70 per cent in the North, versus eight per cent here. How do you go about addressing challenges like that?

A: It’s sometimes overwhelming to go every single day to another major societal foundational issue, from suicide prevention to TB to climate change to just the very basic political ﬁghts about Inuit and our place in this country. So we try to create practical solutions that move us forward in the path to self-determination and that, wherever possible, are realistic in terms of what governments can do. It would be easy for me to be hard-line: we need everything now. It’s much harder to be a politician who tries to work hand-in-hand with governments to ﬁgure out what the next step is, in the right direction.

Q: You were elected in the middle of 2015, so you had a few months of working with the Harper government and a few years of working with the Trudeau government. Did you notice a difference?

A: There are massive discrepancies between the way in which different governments work with Indigenous peoples. I’m very fortunate to be at a point in time when the government of the day has expressed interest in reconciliation as one of its key platform items. We’ve had some remarkable success. And I would like to think, as a non-partisan leader, that it’s the mobilization of Inuit, not necessarily the benevolence of any government of the day, that has led to a number of our really big wins. But at the same time, I think there is a basic level of respect and an openness to consider new ways of doing business that have unlocked the potential of Inuit self-determination.

Q: There is a current of thought to the effect that the new relationship is only a talking point.

A: After four years, this government is still not necessarily understanding how to transform the working relationship. And I’ve focused way more on the working relationship than on the political relationship, because that can come and go, but how the public service acts and the advice that it gives to any particular minister of the day has been entrenched for so long that we end up ﬁghting that more than we ﬁght the good intentions of ministers.

Q: I should also ask about your relationships over the last year or so with the leaders of the NDP, the Conservative Party and the Green Party. Do you ever see those folks?

A: I see Elizabeth May more than I see the other two leaders. And she’s always been very effusive and very supportive of ITK. With the leaders of the NDP and the Conservative Party, there hasn’t been as much of a connection, and I do hope that there can be more of an ongoing conversation.

Q: Are you surprised sometimes that you don’t hear as much from the other parties?

A: Well, the nature of federal politics is confounding to me. I don’t understand 90 per cent of it. I especially don’t understand question period.

Q: Come and work for us, then. You’ll ﬁt right in!

A: It was really surprising to me that the Liberal Party didn’t necessarily reach out to Inuit in setting up their platform when they were all-in on Indigenous people and reconciliation. It wasn’t until we saw the mandate letters and the real focus on reconciliation and the willingness for ministers to come and engage with us that we started to tell them who we were.

I don’t necessarily think that it’ll be any different for any party in any government. No matter what government is formed in October, I’m not losing sleep about the fact that I’m not lobbying right now on our interests, because there will be random new people who’ve never heard of Inuit that I’ll be talking to, who are ministers of very important portfolios. I can guarantee you that.

Q: What would you say to someone who’s never been to the North?

A: Our communities are very diverse. And they’re heavily influenced by colonization: which church denomination, what random whaling captain was there in the 1800s. There are all sorts of weird permutations of what sort of culture we have today that is Inuit culture. Like, square dancing is a very traditional thing, or being Moravian in Nunatsiavut is very traditional. So we have the effect of colonization, but we also have the resilience of Inuit. We have our language, we have our culture, we have our traditions, we have our food, we have the way that we raise our children, we have a love for not only the land but all things that live within it.

Also, most people are amazed at how welcoming and warm Inuit are and that there isn’t so much bitterness on the surface toward the colonial relationship and those powers that sometimes still do come in and exert undue influence. It’s not to say that it’s not there. There’s a lot of historical trauma, there’s a lot of bitterness. But the way in which we greet people and try to see people for who they are and welcome them is also a hallmark of any Inuit community that you’d ever go to.

Q: I want to ask about the fallout from political events here in Ottawa. Since the beginning of the year, the only Indigenous member of cabinet has left the cabinet; the former minister of Indigenous services, Jane Philpott, has also left. Is this something of direct concern to you as you try to push your agenda?

A: It is. I think it’s a direct concern to anyone trying to do any business with the federal government at this point in time, let alone what the implications are post-June, when everyone rises and you go into election mode.

I’ve thought a lot about this, because what this issue is all about is the rule of law, and the attack on the rule of law by individuals working for a government. And I bring that back to what I’m expected to put up with as a national Inuit leader in my day-to-day, and the government of Canada and its unwillingness, in many cases, to uphold UN declarations or UN human rights law, the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings, all in relation to Inuit. And it is not in the same category. It is not talking about offences in a Criminal Code, but it is still government not complying with what Canadians would expect government to comply with.

And I think of the First Nations Caring Society and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, and the fact that there have been, I believe, six or seven non-compliance orders that have been issued, but somehow nobody in cabinet walked away from cabinet over that; and that somehow an incremental approach was always the approach that was good for cabinet and good for Canada. This is, I think, where I’m truly trying—trying hard—to understand why everything falls apart over this particular issue, but not about the myriad different cases where the government of Canada has not lived up to its expectations or its duty in relation to the implementation of land claims or its compliance with things such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

So again, it’s turning the conversation into saying something about what members of cabinet, what members of the press, what Canadians think is important and what they’re okay with.

You talk to somebody about SNC-Lavalin, and somehow everything’s over. And I think that gets to what I was saying about our stories not being told. It’s also our rights not being upheld, the rule of law not applying to Inuit in the same way it applies in other workings in the government.

Q: It sounds like what we need is a work plan of some kind. What do you think that would look like?

A: The work plan would start with knowledge—there is a lack of understanding about the complexity of Indigenous peoples, our governance and the way we ﬁt into Confederation. So accepting that it is complex, and also accepting that it is not Indigenous people who created the complexity, it is the government of Canada, it is the rulings of supreme courts, it is the Constitution, it is the fabric of the colonial legacy. Expecting Inuit to know all of this and everyone else to ignore it is a continuation of that colonial mindset.

Everyone in Canada would accept that Indigenous peoples have rights, and we have the right to self-determination. Figuring out how to implement those rights, that’s the conversation we need to have.",Inuit leader Natan Obed on working with the Liberals—and his vision for the future,Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/politics/natan-obed-inuit-snc-lavalin-tuberculosis/

OTTAWA – Almost two years after the government's announcement regarding its agreement with the American giant Netflix, NDP Official Languages Critic François Choquette (Drummond) intends to once again denounce the treatment of linguistic minorities.

In the $500 million investment agreement by the platform, only a $25 million envelope, the equivalent of 5% of the total amount, was allocated to develop the French-speaking market. Without any guarantee that French content will be produced. Few details are available, as the agreement is still subject to secrecy under the Investment Canada Act.

""Where is the equality among Canada's official languages in this case? This is a real shame in a country where 22% of the population’s first language is French and where there are 10 million French speakers,"" said Choquette. “This is a failure by the Liberal government and Francophones are paying the price.”

After filing an unsuccessful complaint with the Commissioner of Official Languages, the Commissioner decided to clear the government on the grounds that the rights of Francophones had not been violated. Choquette therefore filed a judicial review notice for the Office to redo its investigation, this time requiring that a version of the Netflix agreement be obtained. This review of the conclusions would determine whether or not the government's commitments to protect and promote linguistic minorities have been respected, pursuant to Part VII of the Official Languages Act.

Finally, the NDP Official Languages Critic is also initiating legal proceedings against Canadian Heritage for failing to honour its commitments under the Act.

""It may not be Netflix's role to promote official languages, but it is certainly the government's duty to protect both the French and English languages,"" added Choquette. “New Democrats will always protect the French language and stand up for Francophones across the country.”",Netflix Agreement: NDP asks Court to force Canadian Heritage to comply with the Official Languages Act,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/netflix-agreement-ndp-asks-court-force-canadian-heritage-comply-official-languages-act

With only two seats, the Prince Edward Island Legislature has been a lonely place for the Green Party.

But that may be about to change. With the election campaign in full swing, the party has led in four of the last five polls.

If the lead continues through the election on April 23, it will form the first Green government anywhere in Canada. That would make Peter Bevan-Baker the country's first Green premier.

As It Happens host Carol Off spoke to Bevan-Baker about that prospect and why he thinks his platform is resonating with voters. Here is part of their conversation.

Mr. Bevan-Baker, as you know Prince Edward Island has gone back and forth between Liberals and Tories for generations. So what makes you think that Islanders are ready to have a Green government?

Like so many places in the world, there is a deep dismay and disappointment with conventional politics and unimaginative politicians. And people are looking for an alternative, a credible alternative, that feels comfortable for them.

Here on Prince Edward Island, the sort of natural traditions and personality of folks is not, as has happened in some other jurisdictions, to take a hard turn to the right. We've always been the ""keeper of each other's brother"" here. It's a very communitarian society. And so that sort of direction for something new was never going to happen here.

What do your Green Party colleagues across the country say to you about, ""Why P.E.I.?"" I'm sure there's a lot of jealousy that's going around.

I've had more support than jealousy. But they're certainly looking at this with great interest, because it's new. And there's obviously a lot of responsibility that comes with that.

PEI Premier Wade MacLauchlan drops the writ, with assistance from a prop, announcing Prince Edward Islanders will be going to the polls on April 23, in Charlottetown on March 26, 2019. (Brian McInnis/The Canadian Press)

What's your key offer to the people of P.E.I.? What makes you different from the Tories and Liberals?

If I were to focus in on one area of our platform, the one that I think is resonating most loudly with Islanders is to restore trust in government.

We've heard that sort of ping pong politics here between the red team and the blue team. And it seemed that no matter who was in there, the level of patronage really did not change.

But this time they have an opportunity for a different level of change — a deeper level of change.

Why have you downplayed to some extent your environmental concerns? I would think that would be front and centre with the Green Party.

Well, absolutely they are. And I think the Green Party, unlike the other parties, recognizes that a healthy environment is fundamental to a prosperous economy and to a healthy society. You cannot have a vibrant economy on a dying planet.

So it's not that we're downplaying that. But in order to present a comfortable alternative to people in politics today, we have to get past that idea that the Green Party is a single-issue party.

Well we just had a report come out, rather devastating news about what's going on with climate change in this country. You think this is a time to say, ""We just assume they know we care about the environment, and we'll move on?"" I mean I think you'd have to actually say, ""Hey guys, we need to do something right now.""

We are, and I am.

Of course carbon tax is a huge issue politically in Canada, and it's no different here in Prince Edward Island.

And I'm not trying to belittle the fact that for some people that is a significant amount of money added up, particularly if you live in rural Prince Edward Island, if you have a minimum paying job. But we have to also recognize our collective responsibility to pass on a livable planet to future generations.

P.E.I. Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King speaks to the crowd at the party's leadership convention. (Brian McInnis/CBC)

Our generation has done a terrible job of living on this planet. And I'm not just talking environmentally, I'm talking economically and socially as well. And we have to step up to the plate and take the action that's required.

It's early, but have you practiced that phrase — Premier Bevan-Baker? Have you said that out loud to yourself?

You know I have to be comfortable with that, Carol. Because if you can't imagine something then it's going to be a real shock to you if it ever if it ever materializes.

So I used to laugh when people said stuff like that, but it's not funny anymore. And we have to be ready to govern. And personally I am ready to do that, and the party I think has demonstrated on our platform and in the quality of our candidates that we are absolutely ready to govern here.

The long-time Edmonton Eskimo announced his retirement from the Canadian Football League Tuesday, and he did it as an Eskimo.

Stamps signed a one-day contract with the team he led in receiving for five consecutive seasons between 2009 and 2013.

“It’s the only way to go out,” Stamps said. “Once an Eskimo, always an Eskimo.”

Stamps played his final year in the CFL in 2015 with the Montreal Alouettes after being traded for receiver Kenny Stafford.

The numbers for Stamps are among the best ever for an Eskimos receiver. His 496 receptions is third-most, behind Brian Kelly and Terry Vaughn, and his 7,932 yards put him behind only Kelly in Eskimos’ history.

The native of New Orleans played eight seasons in green and gold and he registered five 1,000-yard seasons and was twice named the team’s Most Outstanding Player nominee.

The 37-year-old led the CFL in receiving twice and also had two 200-yard games.

“I really appreciate my time in the CFL and my time as an Eskimo,” he said. “It just was amazing. Even when I was in Montreal, I got the chance to be in the locker room with a great group of guys.”

On Sept. 14, 2011, in Hamilton, Stamps hauled in 14 receptions in a game — one off the Eskimos’ team record and two off the CFL mark.

The only thing that eluded Stamps in his great career was a Grey Cup.

“For me to leave Edmonton [in 2015], it was something that — I felt crushed. It was tough because I knew that Edmonton was going to be in the Grey Cup in 2015. I just saw it. I knew it.

Things play out how it’s supposed to play out, but I’m just excited I get to retire with the green and gold.”

Stamps will return to the Brick Field at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton on June 14 where he will be honoured by the club during its season opener against Montreal.

A Green New Deal can begin the transition from exploitative capitalism to democratic ecological socialism. The urgency and scale of the ...","An Ecosocialist Green New Deal: Guiding Principles

Humankind has reached a moment of existential crisis. Human activity is causing disastrous climate disruption and Earth’s sixth mass extinction event, triggering critical losses of biodiversity. We are already locked in for global warming that will have catastrophic effects, and we are on a slippery path to our own extinction. The 2018 Special Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns unequivocally that “without societal transformation and rapid implementation of ambitious greenhouse gas reduction measures, pathways to limiting warming to 1.5°C and achieving sustainable development will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.”

Yet, the crisis we face exceeds ecological breakdown. Deepening inequality, suppressed democracy, precarious jobs, racial and gendered violence, border hostility, and endless wars make up the terrain on which climate destabilization will be unleashed. The most vulnerable members of society will be hit hardest, first, and suffer most.

We must solve the climate crisis and the inequality crisis together. Climate remedies in the context of austerity will produce a popular backlash, as we see in the yellow vest protests against a fuel tax. Corporations profiting from fossil extraction have long worked to turn workers against environmentalists, claiming that clean energy would be a job killer. But working class and poor people’s quality of life, gravely threatened by climate disruption, would greatly improve in a just transition. Because corporate capitalism rewards extraction to concentrate wealth, it must be replaced by a sustainable economy. A Green New Deal can begin the transition from exploitative capitalism to democratic ecological socialism.

The urgency and scale of the crisis we face demand solutions that meet the magnitude of this moment. The ineffectual gradualism and corporate obedience demonstrated by the U.S. government’s climate response has proven to be a dead-end for humanity. We need rapid, systemic transformation that heals the stratification of wealth and power while putting decarbonization and justice at the forefront.

We need a Green New Deal

We demand a Green New Deal, and we demand that it serve people and planet – not profit.

For too long, our livelihoods have been undermined by the pursuit of profit. Land expropriation, mass murder, and slavery on a vast scale built the great fortunes, the markets in cotton and industrial goods, and the system of finance and extraction that are with us today. Their legacy is plain to see. People are starving while we throw away food. Buildings are empty while people sleep on the streets. Working class communities, especially those of color, are being poisoned by polluting industries that are wrecking the climate, all for the sake of making the rich richer.

We can no longer allow our lives and liberation to be undermined by an extractive system that uproots wealth from nature, communities, workers, and vulnerable peoples, while imposing onto them all of the costs. We will no longer allow corporate monopolies and their political servants to control the resources we need and the outcome of our lives. We demand justice and power for The People to determine our future – a future that belongs to everyone living and yet to live.

Future generations are entitled to a beautiful planet with a vibrant natural world that can sustain a good life for all people. Creating a fully ecological society will require a revolutionary transformation to replace the capitalist social order based on exploitation and oppression with a new society based on cooperation, equity, and justice. A Green New Deal must serve as a bridge toward this future. To that end, we support the resolutions introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the House and Sen. Ed Markey in the Senate while recognizing that they are conversation starters – not complete and adequate blueprints. Their proposals are facing fierce opposition from corporate politicians and nervous ridicule from Wall Street pundits, but the opportunity to campaign for a radical and effective Green New Deal remains in our hands. Comments by the Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) and the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN) advance the vision of what a Green New Deal rooted in a truly just transition should look like.

The radical Green New Deal we need will not be introduced in a single bill or resolution – it can only emerge from the grassroots struggles of working people and social movements. Together with our allies, we can organize a powerful multi-faceted movement to catalyze the major left turn in American politics and massive structural changes that are necessary to ensure climate justice and human survival.

Because we see the fight for the climate as a struggle against capitalism itself and the myriad forms of oppression which sustain it, we propose to organize within Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and without around the following guiding principles for a radical Green New Deal:

1. Decarbonize the economy fully by 2030. We need to set a more ambitious timeframe than the IPCC 1.5°C pathways suggest because of the United States’ historical responsibility for carbon pollution, because highly industrialized societies have the greatest capacity to rapidly reduce emissions and afford the shift from endless fossil-fueled growth to regenerative systems, and because faster decarbonization will give us the greatest chance of avoiding more catastrophic climate tipping points. We must mobilize all carbon-intensive sectors of the economy to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions at the source, and to scale up processes that safely and naturally draw down and remove excess carbon from the atmosphere – not as market-based “offsets” for ongoing emissions, but to begin restoring a safe climate for all.

2. Democratize control over major energy systems and resources. Nationalize fossil fuel producers to phase them out as quickly as necessary – no new fossil fuel projects can be authorized or built. Socialize fossil-dependent industries so that they can be scaled back or transformed to fossil-free processes. Establish public ownership of utilities and the electric grid, and support energy cooperatives and community solar and wind projects for democratic control of the shift to 100% renewable energy. Shift from monoculture and factory farms to diversified agroecology. Expand municipal and state public banks, finance community land trusts, and end water privatization. Reinvest in and expand national parks; vastly expand national forests, grasslands, and wildlife preserves to enable natural carbon capture; and preserve public lands for future generations. Encourage replacement of individually-owned vehicles and short-haul air travel with expanded regional and high-speed electric rail, free public transit, shared vehicles, bicycles and other non-fossil-fuel modes of transportation in ways that benefit disadvantaged communities. The future is a public good, not a private luxury.

3. Center the working class in a just transition to an economy of societal and ecological care. Guarantee a job with union wages and benefits to everyone who wants one by creating millions of public sector jobs and funding massive direct investments to build decarbonized infrastructure in critical sectors like renewable energy, regenerative agriculture, soil and ecosystem restoration, environmental impact mitigation, and climate adaptation while also expanding support for low-carbon care sectors like healthcare, education, and domestic work. Empower workers with stronger labor protections and rights to collectively organize. Promote worker-owned and worker-controlled cooperatives and enterprises at all levels of the economy. Ensure workers’ democratic control over the use of technological innovation and automation at work. Reduce the work week and guarantee substantial, paid parental leave and vacation time for all workers.

4. Decommodify survival by guaranteeing living wages, healthcare, childcare, housing, food, water, energy, public transit, a healthy environment, and other necessities for all. Ensure market forces do not displace frontline and working class communities from their neighborhoods by implementing universal rent control, and work cooperatively with communities in the line of climatic danger to relocate to safer grounds. Make college education free so everyone has access to learning skills that may better facilitate the rapid transition of society. Ensure land and resources are prioritized for building resilient communities and ecosystems for the many, not the few.

5. Reinvent our communities to serve people and planet, not profit. Facilitate the creation of neighborhood transition councils as hubs of distribution, education, participatory planning, and democratic decision-making. Prioritize funding for projects that build community health and wealth, beginning with working class, racialized, and Indigenous communities that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis and collective struggles for environmental justice. Decriminalize, decarcerate, and demilitarize spaces across all areas of society. Legally and materially empower communities to meet human needs in ways that redress social and environmental injustices, including economic, racial, colonial, and gender-based oppression. Work within cities, towns, and rural communities to provide better and more sustainable lives through improved land use, sprawl repair, and support for household and neighborhood downshifting. Fund targeted cleanup efforts to address environmental injustices and meet a demand of clean air, water, and soil for all. Help communities plan resilience and prepare for climate shocks, material shortages, and other consequences of blowing past planetary boundaries.

6. Demilitarize, decolonize, and strive for a future of international solidarity and cooperation. Enact policies and join in treaties to meet the existential threat of climate change and abandon the doomed strategy of global military domination. United States treaty commitments must account for our historical responsibility for the largest total and per capita greenhouse gas emissions, which will drive climate change for generations to come. Build consensus throughout the Global North for decarbonization targets that greatly outpace those of less industrialized countries, which have contributed the least to and will suffer the most from global warming. Welcome refugees, share life-saving technologies freely, and provide mitigation and adaptation resources requested by peoples in the Global South to whom we are materially and energetically indebted. Recognize the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples, with rights to free, prior, and informed consent before activities that will affect their territory or environment. Accept the decisions of Indigenous communities regarding the construction of future green infrastructure projects that impact their lands and the living beings they support. Remove United States military presence, influence, and occupation around the world; end military aid and arms exports; and demilitarize our borders.

7. Redistribute resources from the worst polluters with just and progressive taxes on the rich, on big corporations, and on dirty industry, as well as by diverting funds away from policing, prisons, and our government’s bloated military budget, which have nothing to do with defense of people living within American borders and everything to do with maintaining imperial dominance over other nations and capitalist control of the world’s resources. United States monetary policy has financed endless wars and wealth extraction by elites for long enough – it’s time to use it to fund the transformation we need.

These guiding principles are just a beginning, not an endpoint, for DSA’s engagement in the campaign for a Green New Deal. We agree with the call of CJA to develop a Green New Deal process that is transparent, inclusive, and democratic. We must warn all politicians that we will not accept a watered-down Green New Deal that they exploit as a mere electoral slogan. They will either fight for the radical Green New Deal that emerges from our coalition or be exposed as collaborators with the ecocidal elite who have no concern for our future.

Our role is to help build a militant mass working-class movement that is powerful enough to secure human flourishing for all beyond the critical next decades, not just survival for some. Together, we can break the power of capitalists and guarantee the regeneration of a vibrant natural world that is home for humanity – and all forms of life – for many generations to come.

Victoria Ahearn, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- TV dramas and debut features by women scored big at Sunday's Canadian Screen Awards as the hostless show moved along at a brisk pace with comedy bits from some of the country's biggest stars.

The CBC series ""Anne with an E"" and CTV detective drama ""Cardinal: Blackfly Season"" won two awards each during the CBC broadcast from Toronto's Sony Centre of Performing Arts, putting them atop the TV pack with a total of seven trophies apiece after a week of galas.

""Anne with an E,"" which is inspired by Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel ""Anne of Green Gables,"" won best drama series and an acting nod for lead actress Amybeth McNulty. That added to five trophies acquired on Wednesday for a season that expanded upon the source material to include more diverse characters.

McNulty, 17, used her acceptance speech to encourage ""every young person out there who doubts their voice, their mind, their power.""

""We are strong, capable and willing to fight for our world,"" she said.

Meanwhile, ""Cardinal"" took top acting nods for stars Billy Campbell and Karine Vanasse during the show, adding to its five trophies from Wednesday.

In a tearful speech, Virginia-born Campbell thanked Vanasse and the local cast and crew of northern Ontario, where the show is filmed.

""I'm a Yank and I'm particularly grateful for Canada being Canada these days,"" he said.

Best comedy series went to ""Schitt's Creek,"" resulting in a total of four awards for the week, including an acting nod for Catherine O'Hara's portrayal of eccentric matriarch Moira.

""In 'Schitt's Creek' we are writing a world that examines the transformational effects of love when the threat of hate and intolerance has been removed from the equation,"" said co-creator and showrunner Daniel Levy.

""And while that's not a reality for many, our goal is to shine a light out there that asks the question, 'What if it was? Wouldn't we all be happier if we were able to love out loud?""'

The CBC riches-to-rags show, which recently announced its next season will be its last, had tied with ""Anne with an E"" with a leading 15 Canadian Screen Award nominations going into this year's ceremonies.

On the film side, best picture went to Genevieve Dulude-De Celles' debut feature, the Quebec coming-of-age drama ""A Colony."" It got three awards in total, including best first feature and best actress for Emilie Bierre's portrayal of an insecure high school student who bonds with an Indigenous boy.

""This is a dream, guys,"" said Bierre, 14, noting she's been acting since she was five.

Barrie, Ont.-raised Jasmin Mozaffari won best director for her critically acclaimed debut feature, ""Firecrackers,"" about two young women longing to escape their small town. The Ontario-shot drama also won an editing award earlier in the day.

""Really did not expect to win this, honest to God,"" Mozaffari said onstage, noting it was ""a micro-budget"" feature that she made ""especially for women about living in a patriarchal world.

""I think I'm one of the few women to win this award. I don't think I'll be the last.""

Overall, the leading film winner was Maxime Giroux's allegorical drama ""The Great Darkened Days"" with five awards, including best cinematography for Sara Mishara and best supporting actress for Sarah Gadon. Martin Dubreuil stars in the surreal wartime story as a Quebecois draft dodger and Charlie Chaplin impersonator in the American West.

It was also a big night for Crave's small-town sitcom ""Letterkenny,"" which walked away with a nod for writing and one for acting for creator Jared Keeso, bringing its grand award total to five for the week.

Other top acting nods went to Kim Coates for the City mafia series ""Bad Blood"" and Theodore Pellerin for the crime drama film ""Family First.""

The Cogeco Fund Audience Choice Award went to actress Dominique Provost-Chalkley of the supernatural Western horror series ""Wynonna Earp.""

The show on CBC and its Gem streaming service capped off a week of ceremonies in which the bulk of the trophies were handed out.

The Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television administers the awards, which honour Canadian talent in film, television and digital media in 135 categories.

Organizers chose not to have a host this year in a bid to experiment with the awards-show format.

Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press

Danny Green had his best performance yet as a Toronto Raptor, leading his team to a 121-109 victory over an Orlando Magic team still charging hard for an Eastern Conference playoff spot.

Green led the Raptors with a season-high 29 points, including seven three-pointers, despite suffering a thumb injury during the game.

Five other Raptors scored in double digits, including Kawhi Leonard (15), Kyle Lowry (12), Marc Gasol (13), Serge Ibaka (15) and Fred VanVleet (10). It was a fourth successive victory for the Raps, who improve to 55-23 with four games left before the playoffs begin.

In the locker room afterward, players’ chairs were draped in t-shirts that read ‘Clinched: Atlantic Division Champions.'

The Magic, still battling with the Miami Heat and Charlotte Hornets for the final playoff spot in the East, had already handed the Raptors two losses this season. But Toronto didn’t let it happen again.

Monday night was the first of four games Toronto will play against teams fighting for the critical final playoff spots in the East. Likely locked into the No. 2 playoff seed with four games left, the Raps just wait to see how the bottom few seeds shake out in the conference.

“I don’t know if this is true for everybody – every coach in the league – but when you look at the standings from Day 1, Game 1 to Game 2, you look four times a day,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. “You’re always looking to see who’s going where, how it’s shifting, who’s going to end up where, and I don’t know, maybe it’s just something to do. Not much you can do about it.”

Green hit four three-pointers in the opening nine minutes alone, on his way to a 16-point first quarter. He was on his way to a career-high night. It was just shy of the eight three-pointers he had against Memphis earlier this year, and the career-high 33 he scored back on April 11, 2014, against Phoenix while he was a member of the San Antonio Spurs.

Still, the Raptors trailed by as much as 11 points for much of the first half, before finally pulling ahead with just two minutes remaining. They did so by improving at everything from fighting through screens to contesting shots and suffocating the Magic defensively.

By outscoring the Magic 33-16 in the second quarter, Toronto took a 62-52 lead into the locker room.

“We’d been playing some teams that hadn’t been playing with a lot of intensity and hadn’t been guarding us very well or very hard,” said Nurse. “And this team did. I think it was just such a big adjustment to make, just in general to get the juices back up to par there a little bit.”

Green was the best player on the floor all night – hitting everything from driving floaters to jumpers and bank shots, making good on 11 of his 15 shots, 7-of-10 from deep. He had three blocked shots and a pair of steals, while also nabbing five rebounds.

Green sustained a jammed left thumb in the first quarter and kept playing. X-rays done on site were negative. He went for an MRI after the game and wasn’t available to speak to reporters.

Before the game, the Raptors razzed young teammate Chris Boucher while media surrounded his locker to talk to him about a significant honour he’d just earned. Even Kawhi Leonard called out “big time” as he passed by.

Earlier Monday, Toronto’s Chris Boucher was chosen the NBA G-League most valuable player and the defensive player of the year for the 28 games he played with the Raptors 905. The Saint Lucian-born Boucher, who was raised in Montreal, became the first player to win both awards in the same season, and the first international player to earn MVP honours.

The 6-foot-11 forward – who signed a two-way contract with the Raptors in October before having it converted to a standard NBA contract in February – averaged 27.2 points, 11.4 rebounds and 4.1 blocked shots.

The team honoured him with his two trophies before the game. He said he hopes to be part of a growing list of Raptors who have flourished in the NBA after developing in Mississauga with Raptors 905.

“For sure, Pascal [Siakam] is a great example for me, just because look what he did and what he’s doing now,” Boucher said. “Not only Pascal, but Fred [VanVleet], Norm [Powell], Delon [Wright], just what those guys have been achieving, what they did last year, and what they did when they were in the G League. For me it’s just a good thing, just learn from them, try to take them as an example and do my own stuff too.”

Rising 18-year-old Canadian tennis star Bianca Andreescu was courtside Monday night during a trip home to Toronto. The Raptors honoured the WTA player for her recent title run at Indian Wells.

Such sweet irony…

This vast former factory on Monaghan Road in the city’s west end was once home to Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC), the international company that grew out of Ole Evinrude’s 1909 invention of a three-horsepower engine that could churn a below-water propeller. Its existence meant hunters and fishers and campers no longer had to paddle to get where they wanted to be. OMC’s Evinrude and Johnson outboards were once so popular there were a dozen such factories in North America, with 8,000 employees and more than $1-billion in annual sales.

That was then; this is now.

Story continues below advertisement

The Peterborough factory closed in 1990, not long before OMC declared bankruptcy. Today, the building is home to the Canadian Canoe Museum – celebrating the very thing Ole Evinrude’s invention was supposed to eliminate: paddling.

And on Monday, Canadian Heritage and Multiculturalism Minister Pablo Rodriguez was in Peterborough to announce a federal donation of $10-million from the Canada Cultural Spaces Fund that will go toward a brand new facility for the museum to be built next to Lock 21 on the Trent-Severn Waterway.

Open this photo in gallery The Canadian Canoe Museum has room to showcase about 100 canoes and kayaks but its new facility will be able to display most of its collection of 600 water crafts. Jeff Brooke

“A museum honouring the canoe should not be landlocked,” the minister told the gathering. “It should be connected to the open water – and soon this vision will be a reality.”

While the museum paid $1 to take over the old outboard factory in the mid-1990s, by 2022 it hopes to move into a dramatic, state-of-the-art facility that will cost $65-million. Even before the federal announcement, it had passed the halfway point of its fundraising goal.

The current structure is situated on a busy suburban street and cursed with a gravel parking lot, but the new museum will feature a “green” roof with walkways through more than 50 local plant species and a wildflower meadow. Inside will be a 30-metre chute of “rapids” down which children can send small wooden canoes. Apart from the canoes and artifacts on display, there will be three classrooms, workshops, a large rental space for weddings and special occasions and even a recording studio for the gathering of oral histories on the canoe. The parking lot will be paved. Organizers hope to have the first shovels in the ground by mid-summer. (An animated “fly-through” of the new facility can be found at www.canoemuseum.ca . )

For more than two decades, the old factory has served as a museum to the iconic canoe, a First Nations vessel that back in 2007 the CBC declared first of all in its national contest to name the Seven Wonders of Canada. (The six others were Pier 21, Old Quebec City, Niagara Falls, Prairie skies, the Rocky Mountains and the igloo.) There are 606 watercraft in the museum, the vast majority of them hidden away in a warehouse at the back of the museum.

The collection includes birch bark canoes that pre-date Confederation. There is a section for the Mi’kmaq legend of Glooscap and his stone canoe. There are “courting canoes,” including one with a fold-up gramophone capable of playing 78-rpm vinyl records.

The displays cover everything from Pierre Trudeau’s buckskin jacket to a birch bark canoe built by legendary craftsman and Algonquin elder William Commanda. There are ancient canoes, working canoes and canoes owned by the likes of songwriter Gordon Lightfoot, filmmaker Bill Mason and artist Robert Bateman. Mr. Bateman’s green 12-foot canvas-and-cedar canoe, which is on display twice, once as it is and once in a painting, was built by May Minto, who once produced 25 canoes a year in the central Ontario village of Minden.

The collection is magnificent, where they are collected not so much. “This facility is so tired,” museum curator Jeremy Ward says.

The building and its accompanying warehouse were perfect, however, for the first assemblage of the hundreds of different canoes collected in the second half of the 20th century by Kirk Wipper. Mr. Wipper was a Manitoban who owned Kandalore Camp near Haliburton, Ont. He developed Kandalore into a premier “tripping” camp, sending mostly urban children into the Haliburton Highlands and Algonquin Park to spend days and weeks paddling and portaging under the care of trained staff.

Mr. Wipper, who died at the age of 87 in 2011, was obsessed by this First Nation vessel and began collecting a wide variety of canoes and kayaks from all over Canada. When he ran out of space at his camp, he took to storing them in barns and buildings around the province.

To him, the canoe was “the gift of freedom,"" as he once told the CBC’s Ideas program. Go on a canoe trip, he said, and “you are removed entirely from the mundane aspects of ordinary life. You’re witnessing first hand beauty and peace and freedom – especially freedom. … Flirtation with the wilderness is contact with truth, because the truth is in nature…”

It is a familiar sentiment among canoe trippers. Nearly a quarter-century before he became prime minister, a young Montreal academic named Pierre Trudeau penned an essay in which he argued, “Travel a thousand miles by train and you are a brute; pedal five hundred on a bicycle and you remain basically a bourgeois; paddle a hundred in a canoe and you are already a child of nature.”

One of Kandalore’s young campers was James Raffan of Guelph, who became equally entranced with the vessel and went on his first Algonquin Park canoe trip at the age of 8. Mr. Raffan spent 14 summers at the camp, eventually guiding long trips, and became a disciple of Mr. Wipper. He went on to guide trips throughout Northern Canada for Black Feather Wilderness Adventures, became a high-school teacher and then spent nearly two decades as a member and eventually head of the outdoor education unit at Queen’s University’s Faculty of Education.

“I was deeply affected by a man who believed the canoe was the way into the country,” Mr. Raffan says, “that it was a metaphor for entering the conscience of the country.”

People in Peterborough stepped up when Mr. Wipper decided he had to do something with his enormous collection or it would be lost. They brought his canoes to the abandoned factory and began to establish a small museum. Mr. Raffan, who left Queen’s University in 1999, became involved and eventually served eight years as the museum’s curator. He is now deeply involved in promoting the new museum.

The project certainly has its support. Though it has yet to be officially deemed a national museum, as have Halifax’s Pier 21 and Winnipeg’s Canadian Museum of Human Rights, the Senate has declared the Canadian Canoe Museum “a cultural asset of national significance.” And Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, who became passionate about canoe tripping while attending nearby Lakefield College School in the late 1970s, is both a patron and serves as honorary chair of the museum’s national council.

“I believe this is a project of immeasurable cultural value and national resource,” the Prince has said.

While the federal grant was seen as pivotal toward moving into the actual construction phase, there have been plenty of other donors. Of the $65-million total, $30-million will come from private donors (the W. Garfield Weston Foundation gave $7.5-million, the Dalglish Family Foundation committed to $1.2-million and an anonymous donor recently gave $1.25-million). Another $30-million is from government sources. Along with the recent federal commitment, the province of Ontario has promised $9-million, the City of Peterborough $4-million and the County of Peterborough $500,000. An additional $5-million will come “in kind” from a variety of sources, including The Globe and Mail.

For Peterborough, a city of 80,000 that lies between Ottawa and Toronto along Highway 7, the museum would bring new life to an area that has boasted such industries as Outboard Marine, General Electric, Quaker Oats and others, only to see some vanish and others reduce their work force. The new museum is predicted to produce approximately 1,000 jobs during its construction and to have an economic impact of more than $100-million by the time it officially opens.

Canoe manufacturing, in fact, was among the very first industries of the area, which was opened up to logging and settlement in the 1800s. So popular were the vessels built by the Peterborough Canoe Company that the word “Peterborough” often came to stand for “canoe” in North American paddling circles. The last Peterborough canoe to come off the line in 1947 was sent by the government of Canada to England as a wedding gift for Princess Elizabeth and her new husband, Phillip. It is now on exhibit in the museum.

There is little debate over whether the canoe stands as a Canadian symbol as powerful as the beaver, the moose, hockey or Tim Hortons’ Roll-Up-the-Rim welcome to spring. Canoes were once counted as “baggage” on Canadian passenger trains, the trains stopping at designated drop-offs and pick-ups for hunters, fishers and recreational canoeists.

A former U.S. ambassador to Canada, Ray Atherton, wrote back in 1947 that, “What the covered wagon has been to the United States, this and more the canoe has been to Canada. … The story of the canoe is Canada’s story, because Canada is a gigantic waterway, a complex system of lakes and rivers stretching from the Atlantic to the Rockies.”

Perhaps the best description, however, was by a past general manager of the museum, Janice Griffith, who called the canoe a perfect “metaphor for the Canadian character. It’s not loud, pushy or brassy. It’s quiet, adaptable and efficient, and it gets the job done.”

The Canadian Canoe Museum, Mr. Raffan says, is in the process of “re-inventing” itself. “What,” he asks, “is a museum in this particular time?” It is a question museums around the world are facing, some with more success than others.

Story continues below advertisement

“It’s really going through an evolution,” adds Carolyn Hyslop, the museum’s executive director.

“It’s about re-location and re-invention,” says Mr. Ward, the current curator. “And re-thinking our relationship with First Nations, Métis and Inuit across the country.”

To that end, the museum has appointed Robin Binesi Cavanagh its first director of Indigenous Peoples’ Collaborative Relations. Mr. Cavanagh is a member of Sagamok First Nation on the north shore of Lake Huron, as well as a graduate of Peterborough’s Trent University. He was previously senior policy adviser with the Chiefs of Ontario.

The current museum and the future museum stand on the traditional territory of the Williams Treaties First Nations, which includes the Chippewas of Beausoleil, Georgina Island and Rama, and the Mississaugas of Alderville, Curve Lake, Hiawatha and Scugog Island. Mr. Cavanagh’s job is not only to liaise and consult with those First Nations, but to reach across the country to Indigenous groups.

“Not all of those relations have always been great,” Mr. Cavanagh concedes. “But there never has been an instance where somebody says ‘Give me my canoe back or I’m not going to speak to you.’”

In this time of truth and reconciliation, ownership is undeniably an issue for the canoe museum, just as it is for cultural artifact collections around the world. Jessica Dunkin, a Carleton University instructor who studies the culture of sport and leisure and is herself an avid paddler, writes in the current issue of Canada’s History magazine that the European explorers and settlers inarguably appropriated the First Nations invention. The canoe, she writes, “enabled the expansion of European economies and the colonial state, expansion that infringed with devastating consequences on the lives, lifeways and lands of Indigenous peoples.”

Story continues below advertisement

It is, however, a complicated issue. “The canoe is an object with a complicated past,” Ms. Dunkin writes. “It has long been, and continues to be, a symbolic tool of settler colonialism. But it also remains a symbol and tool of Indigenous nationhood, resilience and resurgence.”

Mr. Cavanagh and others at the museum are dedicated to the latter description. When the award-winning design team was selected – Heneghan Peng architects of Dublin, Ireland, working with Kearns Mancini Architects of Toronto – the museum had the designers spend three days meeting with Indigenous advisers. Talks were frank, at times heated, but the design team listened.

“We have to create relationships,” Mr. Cavanagh says. “We have to sustain relationships.”

Curve Lake First Nation leaders have held smudgings for the canoes in the warehouse. Last summer, Chuck Commanda, grandson of renowned Algonquin builder William Commanda of Kitigan Zibi, gave a 15-day workshop on building a birch bark canoe using only the traditional methods. In the future, welcoming ceremonies will be held for any future canoes and artifacts coming to the new facility. There are Indigenous staff, volunteers and, on the museum’s national council are such native leaders as Matthew Coon Come, former Grand Chief of the James Bay Cree, Chief Phyllis Williams of Curve Lake First Nation and Victoria Grant of the Teme-Augama Anishnabai Qway, former chair of Community Foundations of Canada.

“Together we need to learn, understand and acknowledge our shared history,” Ms. Grant says. “We can’t do that without first knowing and understanding the impact of the canoe in Canada’s story, from those very early times when the first visitors came to our shores. The Canadian Canoe Museum provides us with an opportunity to learn, to feel, to smell, and to see the canoe in its diversity and endurance.”

“The canoe must be seen as more than an artifact,” Mr. Cavanagh adds. “Here, canoes are thought of as inanimate objects, but to First Nations, canoes have their own spirits.”

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Mason, who was not Indigenous, obviously felt similar. As he wrote in Path of the Paddle, “The first thing you must learn about canoeing is that the canoe is not a lifeless, inanimate object; it feels very much alive, alive with the life of the river. Life is transmitted to the canoe by currents of air and the water upon which it rides. The behaviour and temperament of the canoe is dependent upon the elements: from the slightest breeze to a raging storm, from the smallest ripple to a towering wave, or from a meandering stream to a thundering rapid.”

Mr. Cavanagh is convinced that this “re-invention” of the Canadian Canoe Museum will be a national success, not just a local attraction, and that those who created the vessel being honoured here will feel that the museum is doing justice to the history and traditions of the First Nations canoe.

“We will find a path,” he says, “just as water finds a path.”

Just as the Canadian Canoe Museum finds its own path to be, finally, on the water itself.

TORONTO – TV dramas and debut features by women scored big at Sunday’s Canadian Screen Awards as the hostless show moved along at a brisk pace with comedy bits from some of the country’s biggest stars.

The CBC series “Anne with an E” and CTV detective drama “Cardinal: Blackfly Season” won two awards each during the CBC broadcast from Toronto’s Sony Centre of Performing Arts, putting them atop the TV pack with a total of seven trophies apiece after a week of galas.

“Anne with an E,” which is inspired by Lucy Maud Montgomery’s classic novel “Anne of Green Gables,” won best drama series and an acting nod for lead actress Amybeth McNulty. That added to five trophies acquired on Wednesday for a season that expanded upon the source material to include more diverse characters.

McNulty, 17, used her acceptance speech to encourage “every young person out there who doubts their voice, their mind, their power.”

“We are strong, capable and willing to fight for our world,” she said.

Meanwhile, “Cardinal” took top acting nods for stars Billy Campbell and Karine Vanasse during the show, adding to its five trophies from Wednesday.

In a tearful speech, Virginia-born Campbell thanked Vanasse and the local cast and crew of northern Ontario, where the show is filmed.

“I’m a Yank and I’m particularly grateful for Canada being Canada these days,” he said.

Best comedy series went to “Schitt’s Creek,” resulting in a total of four awards for the week, including an acting nod for Catherine O’Hara’s portrayal of eccentric matriarch Moira.

“In ‘Schitt’s Creek’ we are writing a world that examines the transformational effects of love when the threat of hate and intolerance has been removed from the equation,” said co-creator and showrunner Daniel Levy.

“And while that’s not a reality for many, our goal is to shine a light out there that asks the question, ‘What if it was? Wouldn’t we all be happier if we were able to love out loud?'”

The CBC riches-to-rags show, which recently announced its next season will be its last, had tied with “Anne with an E” with a leading 15 Canadian Screen Award nominations going into this year’s ceremonies.

On the film side, best picture went to GeneviÃ¨ve Dulude-De Celles’ debut feature, the Quebec coming-of-age drama “A Colony.” It got three awards in total, including best first feature and best actress for Ã‰milie Bierre’s portrayal of an insecure high school student who bonds with an Indigenous boy.

“This is a dream, guys,” said Bierre, 14, noting she’s been acting since she was five.

Barrie, Ont.-raised Jasmin Mozaffari won best director for her critically acclaimed debut feature, “Firecrackers,” about two young women longing to escape their small town. The Ontario-shot drama also won an editing award earlier in the day.

“Really did not expect to win this, honest to God,” Mozaffari said onstage, noting it was “a micro-budget” feature that she made “especially for women about living in a patriarchal world.

“I think I’m one of the few women to win this award. I don’t think I’ll be the last.”

Overall, the leading film winner was Maxime Giroux’s allegorical drama “The Great Darkened Days” with five awards, including best cinematography for Sara Mishara and best supporting actress for Sarah Gadon. Martin Dubreuil stars in the surreal wartime story as a Quebecois draft dodger and Charlie Chaplin impersonator in the American West.

It was also a big night for Crave’s small-town sitcom “Letterkenny,” which walked away with a nod for writing and one for acting for creator Jared Keeso, bringing its grand award total to five for the week.

Other top acting nods went to Kim Coates for the City mafia series “Bad Blood” and ThÃ©odore Pellerin for the crime drama film “Family First.”

The Cogeco Fund Audience Choice Award went to actress Dominique Provost-Chalkley of the supernatural Western horror series “Wynonna Earp.”

The show on CBC and its Gem streaming service capped off a week of ceremonies in which the bulk of the trophies were handed out.

The Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television administers the awards, which honour Canadian talent in film, television and digital media in 135 categories.

The broadcast kicked off in quippy Canuck style, with a skit on homegrown celebrities involving the cast of “Baroness von Sketch Show,” singer Jann Arden and actor Jerry O’Connell.

Comedy star Mary Walsh received the Earle Grey Award for her body of work, while Deepa Mehta got the Lifetime Achievement Award.

“Will & Grace” star Eric McCormack presented the Kids in the Hall comedy troupe with the Academy Icon Award, and actor Stephan James received the inaugural Radius Award, which goes to a Canadian making waves globally.

“When I was coming up in Scarborough with my brother, we hadn’t seen too many black actors who were doing incredible things abroad … people who had come from Toronto and Canada,” James said backstage.

The Green Organic Dutchman (TGOD), one of Canada's fastest-growing pot producers, applied for a bylaw exemption last summer to allow a 123,000-square-foot cannabis greenhouse at the corner of Jerseyville and Alberton roads. The current rural size limit in Hamilton for pot is 20,000 square feet.

Council rejected the proposal last year over the advice of its own planners, spurring an appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

A hearing was expected later this year — but council voted late Wednesday to sign off on a settlement proposal, although with unspecified conditions.

Related Content Take a tour of Green Organic Dutchman as it tries to woo Hamilton

The organic pot grower celebrated the settlement in a release that said the decision will ""allow TGOD to operate its cannabis greenhouse in Ancaster"" and start growing by June with a staff of up to 85 people. The company embarked on a lobbying and charm offensive after the fall election in the hopes council would reconsider.

Details of the settlement and proposed city conditions are still secret, so it was not immediately clear if the original planned size of the contentious greenhouse — about one-fifth as big as Lime Ridge Mall — was endorsed by council.

Mayor Fred Eisenberger did not take part in the vote because he is an investor in the company.

TGOD originally earned criticism from some politicians, particularly Ancaster Coun. Lloyd Ferguson, for starting to build the big greenhouse before earning permission to do so.

Ferguson had pushed to fight the proposal, arguing ""monster"" pot greenhouses could pop up across rural Hamilton.

After the city issued a stop work order last year, TGOD applied for an alternate permit to continue building the greenhouse — only for potted mums.","Hamilton settles with medical pot grower, the Green Organic Dutchman, to allow ‘monster’ Ancaster greenhouse",The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9246102-hamilton-settles-with-medical-pot-grower-the-green-organic-dutchman-to-allow-monster-ancaster-greenhouse/

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn

TORONTO – Danny Green had seven three-pointers and 29 points to lift the Toronto Raptors to a 118-109 victory over the Orlando Magic on Monday.

Kawhi Leonard and Serge Ibaka had 15 points apiece, Marc Gasol chipped in with 13, Kyle Lowry had 12 and Fred VanVleet finished with 10 for the Raptors (55-23), who stretched their win streak to four in a row.

Evan Fournier topped the Magic (38-40) with 21 points, while Montreal native Khem Birch had 11.

Green narrowly missed his career high of eight three-pointers he’d set in a January 19 victory over Memphis.

The Raptors, who’d lost twice to the Magic earlier in the season, got off to a slow start, but turned an 11-point second-quarter deficit into a 10-point lead by halftime.

Green had three threes and 11 points in the third quarter, and when VanVleet drilled a three-pointer with 2:17 left in the frame, the long bomb put Toronto up by 24 points. They cruised into the fourth with a 95-75 lead.

None of the starters saw the floor in the fourth quarter. Orlando made a run in the dying minutes after Raptors’ coach Nick Nurse had emptied his bench, pulling to within eight points with two minutes to play. But that’s as close as the Magic would come.

The Magic began the night one spot out of a playoff spot in the East, a half a game back of eighth-place Miami. Monday’s game was the first of four games for Toronto against teams playing for their post-season lives. The Raptors visit Brooklyn on Wednesday, Charlotte on Friday, then return home to host the Heat on Sunday, the Raptors’ final regular-season game at home.

Nurse was happy to have some competition after blowout wins in Toronto’s last three games (two versus Chicago, and one vs. the New York Knicks).

“I made a comment earlier that I’m glad this team’s in town because they’re gonna play their butts off,” Nurse said of Orlando. “I’m not so sure we’ve had a team play their backsides off here in a few games. It’s been just a little bit too easy, right?

“Not taking away anything from anybody. But we’ve been pretty comfortable here, and I wouldn’t mind maybe a little bit more stress. I don’t know why.”

The Magic controlled the first quarter, racing out to nine-point lead on a Fournier dunk midway through the frame. Orlando led 36-29 to start the second.

A Fournier jumper stretched the Magic’s advantage to 11 points, but the Raptors outscored the visitors 31-10 to end the half, taking a 62-52 lead into the halftime break.

352,,2019-04-03T22:50:00.0000000Z,"Finally, importers to Canada will gain the advantage over Canadian producers since the ... April Fool’s indeed. Kenneth Green is analyst at the Fraser Institute.","On Monday, April Fool’s Day, the federal carbon tax kicked in, in the four provinces that do not have their own carbon taxes — Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick.

The federal carbon tax (technically the “federal carbon-pricing backstop”) kicks in at $20 per tonne, rising by $10 per year to reach $50/tonne in 2022 (Alberta’s provincial carbon tax is scheduled to rise in lockstep with the federal plan).

Where it will go after that is anyone’s guess.

Some economists defend the federal tax, proclaiming it to be “revenue neutral” since some 90% of revenues will be rebated to households in lump-sum payments that somehow will magically actually exceed the carbon taxes paid by households, and thereby the carbon tax will make every Canadian better off.

(But as noted by economist Jack Mintz, when factoring in all the direct and indirect costs of the carbon tax, it’s likely impossible that everyone will receive a rebate that exceeds the tax.)

Because there will be lawsuits over federal carbon pricing (and a possible imminent court challenge of Alberta’s carbon tax), let’s review the necessary attributes of a textbook carbon tax that can justify it’s an “efficient” way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

First, economic carbon tax theory doesn’t simply call for some arbitrarily defined “revenue neutrality,” it calls for carbon tax revenues to be used to reduce other economically distortionary taxes such as personal and corporate income taxes.

That’s because reducing those taxes increases economic efficiency overall and offsets the drag introduced by taxing carbon emissions.

Giving lump-sum rebates to households will not generate those economic gains, therefore, the new carbon tax will simply be yet another drag on Canada’s economy.

And revenue neutrality (however defined) has been fleeting in Canada.

In British Columbia, actual revenue neutrality lasted only five years before carbon tax revenue turned into a new stream of government revenue.

Second, economic theory calls for carbon taxes to replace regulation, not be layered on top of regulation.

And the number of regulations already targeting energy use (and thus carbon emissions) must be phased out as carbon taxes are phased in.

Do you think the federal or provincial governments will eliminate building efficiency standards, vehicle efficiency standards, household appliance efficiency standards, electronic device efficiency standards, etc.?

Here in Canada, (and nowhere else that we can determine) there has been no regulatory displacement in provinces levying a carbon tax.

Third, economists worry about carbon leakage — where firms reorganize or relocate operations to avoid the carbon tax — and competitiveness.

Some economists argue that a border carbon-adjustment system would fix these problems, so imports would face a carbon tax and exports to countries without comparable carbon pricing would be exempt from a carbon tax.

But Canada has not done this.

While the federal carbon tax includes measures to mitigate competitiveness concerns for emission-intensive and trade-exposed industries, the government’s approach targets high-emitters, meaning that service and low-emitting manufacturers will pay more in energy costs thanks to the carbon tax.

Finally, importers to Canada will gain the advantage over Canadian producers since the federal plan does not include an import carbon tariff.

To make matters worse, exporters who cannot pass their extra carbon costs to world markets will likely see their competiveness wane since the federal carbon-pricing plan doesn’t issue export rebates.

Clearly, despite grandiose promises, as currently designed, the federal carbon tax is nothing like the tax favoured in economic literature.

It’s just another tax atop all the rest.

April Fool’s indeed.

Later in the same interview, he noted “there is a growing concern about environmental conservation and I think the question is not whether you make a major effort to improve environmental quality and environmental conservation but how is it to be done? Do you rely increasingly on government regulation and intervention or do you rely more on the marketplace?”

In other words, something like the carbon tax Jason Kenney has promised to eliminate in Alberta if he is elected in two weeks and that Andrew Scheer vows to destroy if he becomes prime minister next fall, or the cap-and-trade system in Ontario that Premier Doug Ford has already torn up and tossed away.

Mr. Manning has spoken about this a lot over the past 20 years, although for some reason he is awfully quiet lately. He may or may not have seen that the environmental impact of unchecked capitalism threatened the survival of the planet, but he certainly figured out that a deteriorating planetary environment presents an existential threat to capitalism.

He may also have worried that a cynical new generation of Canadian right-wing politicians would not be able to resist picking the low hanging fruit offered by new taxes and higher prices, which are always unpopular at first but are key parts of the market-oriented solutions Mr. Manning had in mind.

Think about it. Mr. Manning was probably in a better position than most of us to know just what people like Messrs. Kenney, Ford and Scheer were thinking.

If Mr. Manning’s musings sounded like blue-sky rambling 13 years ago, you would think it would have a good deal more credibility on the right now in a week when we have been told that Canada’s climate is warming at double the rate of the rest of the world.

Officials from Environment and Climate Change Canada published the results of their research yesterday, and the news was not encouraging. Their report said Canada is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet, northern Canada at almost three times the global rate.

And remember, this is based on actual observation, not computer models of what might happen in the future – which are easier for climate-change deniers to cast doubt upon.

But instead of a serious attempt to by the right to offer alternative solutions to climate change, we get a clown car of climate change denial and juvenile belligerence like Mr. Kenney’s attack on the modest reforms enacted by the governments of Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The UCP leader apparently wants to roll it all back and sue anyone who says anything different. He’s even promised to pull the plug on the NDP’s investment in renewable energy – which might even get him off Mr. Manning’s Christmas card list!

Meanwhile, whatever voters in Alberta decide to do in two weeks, the world is waking up to what’s happening to the planet and looking for solutions. As things grow worse, those solutions will grow more forceful.

Mr. Kenney was taking credit recently for getting Toronto City Council to drop Councillor Mike Layton’s call for Canada’s largest city to explore legal ways to seek compensation for the costs of global climate change from major contributors to global climate change.

This was baloney, of course, since city councillors frequently bring up ideas like this and they’re inevitably kicked to the curb a few times before they become part of the mainstream.

But you can count on it that this strategy will be back from cities likely to be impacted by global climate change – New York on the Atlantic, and Vancouver on the Pacific, for just two examples. All the “war rooms” in the world aren’t going to make this go away when the waters start to rise and the forests start to burn, as the findings of the Environment Canada report suggest they will soon.

Some go even farther. Last month, journalist George Monbiot published a column in the Guardian calling for the perpetrators of grave environmental harm to be hauled before an international court and charged with ecocide.

Such an approach, Mr. Monbiot wrote, could “do for all life on Earth what the criminalization of genocide has done for vulnerable minorities: provide protection where none existed before.”

This may sound crazy now, but give it another 13 years and see what folks think.

“Climate change is real and denial is not an option for energy industry players or the lawyers who represent them,” wrote Calgary-based corporate lawyer Colin Feasby, Calgary managing partner of the Osler law firm, in December.

“The energy industry is moving quickly on climate change and most sophisticated participants are in favor of market-based policies to reduce emissions,” he explained. “Many enterprises have already accounted for the risk of climate change litigation both in their public disclosure and in the conduct of their business. Some leading industry players have adopted public policy positions that promote the reduction of emissions, such as Exxon’s championing of carbon taxation and Shell’s advocacy of renewable energy solutions.”

Indeed, that’s undoubtedly why Royal Dutch Shell yesterday revealed it is urging Canada’s energy lobby groups to grow up and stop bucking carbon taxes, else it will pull its support and participation.

But what do we get from Mr. Kenney and his modern Canadian Conservative crowd? Denial and childish threats, plus promises to turn back the clock and make the world like it.

Right now, they are a trio of middle-aged men. And along with illustrator Frank Caruso, who is also a middle-aged man, they are launching this graphic novel. For women. By—in case we were not clear—four men. It’s utter nonsense, and Twitter agrees.

Perfect timing! I, a non member of Green Day, am writing my handbook for being in the band Green Day. Also due out 10/29 — Manny Santos (@DanuellaSantos) April 3, 2019

Genève Faranski, who has worked at Toronto comic shop The Beguiling for eight years, also agrees. “It has a certain aesthetic that seems dated,” she says. “And it’s by four men, so automatically it feels a little unpredictable in terms of the content.” Faranski also says that the world of graphic novels has historically been a boys club, but in the past 10 years, she’s seen an uptick in the number of women navigating the industry.

Does that mean she thinks Green Day could have found someone better to collaborate with on this project? “There are hundreds of women doing really popular work exhibited all over the world, and judging by the artwork, who could do a much more interesting and appealing job.” So… That’s a yes.

Here are some graphic novels that already exist, actually written by Canadian women, for women that Faranski loves. Full disclosure: we have not read Last of the American Girls, and probably never will, but we still bet these are much better.

Woman World by Aminder Dhaliwal

This novel is set in the near future, where all men have disappeared thanks to a birth defect. Earth gets a rebrand as Woman World, united under the flag of Beyoncé’s Thighs (seriously). “That’s what she said” jokes and Blockbusters are distant memories, and the biggest hurdle is continuing the species.

Available at Drawn & Quarterly, $10.

Somnambulance by Fiona Smyth

Faranski calls Fiona Smyth an “incredible figure on the Toronto comic scene.” The pages of her work are packed with images of feminism, sexuality and style. Somnabulance is a collection of her comics from the past 30 years, and while it’s NSFW, it’s also super empowering and sparks conversations that remain important, even decades after they were written.

Available at Indigo, $34.

XTC69 by Jessica Campbell

Jessica Campbell (in the novel) is from the planet L8DZ N1T3. She’s also the commander of a spaceship that’s traveling the galaxy, looking for men she and her crew can breed with. Jessica Campbell (the artist) is known for skewering gender politics, so it’s not surprising that XTC69 offers up hilarious commentary on the determination of women and non-binary folks who are constantly dealing with men who are trash.

Available at Amazon, $14.

Magical Beatdown Volume 1 by Jenn Woodall

Jenn Woodall, who Faranski says is one of The Beguiling’s best sellers, produced a series of graphic novels that’s like a feminist punk interpretation of Sailor Moon. It’s a revenge fantasy, lead by an otherwise average schoolgirl who changes into a magical being and takes down people who harass her in the street.

Available at Silver Sprocket, $6.

SuperMutant Magic Academy by Jillian Tamacki

This book is about kids in a high school for the supernaturally gifted, and all the bake sales, crushes and science experiments they experience along the way. It is geared towards a younger reader, and Faranski recommends it in case Green Day’s novel ends up being for younger women/girls, too. We truly have no idea at this point.

Available at Drawn & Quarterly, $23.

In 1996, it became the first ...","The last Canadian federal election in 2015 saw renewed promises for LGBTQ2 issues — from commitments to pass trans-rights legislation to ending the blood ban. But this time around, there’s a brand new People’s Party of Canada all too willing to rail against diversity, while the Conservative Party is being led by Andrew Scheer and his anti-trans, anti-marriage equality, anti-abortion voting record. It’s bound to be an especially tumultuous election for queer and trans Canadians.

To keep voters informed about our political parties’ commitments — and transgressions — we’ve noted each party’s policies on LGBTQ2 issues. And because these policies and promises will be changing throughout the election campaign, we’ll keep this story updated. Be sure to revisit it as campaign season begins.

The Liberal Party

Coming into office in 2015 after 10 years of Conservative governance, the Liberal Party immediately got to work tackling LGBTQ2 issues. Over the past four years, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s party has taken a ton of action on those issues, which they’ll definitely be relying on to earn our votes come election day on Oct 21.

Here’s what the party has accomplished since 2015:

– After more than a decade of trans activism, and in large part due to historic and ongoing efforts of New Democrat Members of Parliament (MPs), the Liberal government successfully passed a trans-rights bill — Bill C-16 into law in 2017 — enshrining gender identity and gender expression as protected grounds in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code of Canada.

– On Nov 29, 2017, Trudeau issued an apology on behalf of the federal government to the thousands of public servants, members of the military and police and intelligence employees discriminated against, fired, criminally prosecuted and sometimes imprisoned for their sexual orientation from the 1950s to the 1990s.

– The party appointed Randy Boissonnault, the openly gay MP for Edmonton Centre, as Special Advisor on LGBTQ2 Issues. Trudeau’s government also created the LGBTQ2 Secretariat within the Privy Council to help inform the government on issues and potential solutions of importance to our communities.

– In 2017, the Canadian government became co-chair of the Equal Rights Coalition, the first-ever international, intergovernmental coalition committed to protecting the rights of LGBTQ2 communities around the world.

– This February, the federal government made a commitment to advance human rights and socio-economic outcomes for LGBTQ2 people in developing countries, with $30 million in funding over the next five years, followed by $10 million a year after that.

– In their 2019 budget, the Liberals committed $20 million to LGBTQ2 service organizations to support capacity building and community-level work.

For some, their actions have rung hollow. While many applauded the 2017 apology to LGBTQ2 Canadians, others, like Michael Motala, one of the authors of the Egale report The Just Society Report: Gross Indecency, which was commissioned by the Department of Justice, said, “It feels like the government is just using these issues as a bit of a PR stunt and they’re really not tackling things substantively.”

And despite some significant victories, the Liberals haven’t made good on all of their promises to LGBTQ2 communities. The party campaigned in 2015 on a commitment to end the blood ban — which prevents men who have sex with men and trans people from donating blood unless they’ve remained abstinent for a period of time — but have failed to do so thus far. In 2016, the Liberals reduced that time period from five years to one, but the ban still exists despite outcry from LGBTQ2 communities and experts who say it unnecessarily targets queer and trans folks.

The New Democratic Party

While the New Democrats have never been the federal party in power, they’ve had a strong influence on LGBTQ2 issues. They were the first party to formally announce its support for the gay movement in 1976 and were home to Canada’s first openly gay MP Svend Robinson, who came out in 1998.

When the House of Commons voted on marriage equality in 2005, the NDP was the only party that required its MPs to vote in favour. And while Bill C-16 passed under a Liberal government, the NDP championed four separate legislative efforts since 2005 to enact federal trans-rights protections, re-introducing new legislation to keep the issue up for discussion, and building support across political parties.

The NDP hasn’t yet announced its 2019 election platform or any specific commitments on LGBTQ2 issues. But during his run for leadership two years ago, Jagmeet Singh made three key commitments:

– A total review of government policies and practices to ensure full compliance with trans-rights Bill C-16.

– A complete end to the blood ban.

– An LGBTQ2 lens on housing and homelessness reduction, with an emphasis on addressing the unique needs of homeless LGBTQ2 youth, though the commitments remain vague.

The NDP made a number of commitments of its own in the previous election, backed up by statements in their policy book, which include:

– Contributing to the repeal of the anti-sex work legislation Bill C-36, passed in 2014 under the Conservative government.

– Improving federal data collection on issues specific to the LGBTQ2 community, including health care needs and experiences, to improve availability of data to inform policies on a federal, provincial and local level.

– Investing in programs to promote equity for LGBTQ2 people, particularly LGBTQ2 young people. (No specific programs, however, were referenced.)

– Supporting international struggles against discrimination directed at LGBTQ2 communities.

The Conservative Party

Heading into the upcoming federal election, the Conservative Party of Canada is stuck in an uncomfortable position: facing a challenge on one side from Maxime Bernier’s right-wing People’s Party, which has the potential to split the conservative vote, and, on the other side, competing with an incumbent Liberal majority government for the centrist votes crucial to either party’s electoral success. With Andrew Scheer — a staunch social conservative who has voted against marriage equality, trans rights and pro-choice legislation — as its leader, the party seems likely to continue leaning into social conservatism. Scheer claims he’ll keep divisive social issues out of his government’s policies, but whether that’s true is debatable.

While the Conservative platform hasn’t yet been released, the party’s policy book is devoid of any references to LGBTQ2 communities. It’s worth mentioning that this is the party that only struck its definition of marriage as between a man and a woman from its policy book in 2016, more than a decade after Canada legalized same-sex marriage. Some members of the party, like Michelle Rempel and Michael Chong, have broken ranks from their peers in an effort to advance LGBTQ2 issues, with some success. When Bill C-16 came to a vote in the House of Commons, for instance, 38 Conservative MPs voted for it.

But whether or not the party will stay true to Stephen Harper’s legacy and sneak its way to electoral success without any discussion of LGBTQ2 identities remains to be seen.

The Green Party

Like the NDP, the Green Party has a strong history of tackling LGBTQ2 issues. In 1996, it became the first federal political party to officially support same-sex marriage, and was the first — and only — major federal political party to have an openly gay leader in Chris Lea.

While the Greens have yet to announce particular policies or commitments for LGBTQ2 communities for the upcoming election, the party articulated some vague commitments in the 2015 election that will likely shape their approach to LGBTQ2 issues this election. These commitments included:

– Investing in HIV/AIDS education and prevention services to ensure that those living with the virus are receiving comprehensive and effective treatments.

– Advocating for increased federal funding, coordination and support for strategies on mental health, addictions, sexual education, sexualized and gender-based violence and housing for all Canadians, with specific measures to address the needs of LGBTQ2 Canadians.

– Supporting public education to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

– Ending the targeting of LGBTQ2 bookstores and other LGBTQ2 businesses by Customs Canada.

– Improved protections for trans people and raised awareness of policies for inclusion.

– Advocating internationally to protect the human rights of LGBTQ2 communities.

The People’s Party of Canada

The People’s Party has been around less than a year, and it’s already collected a slate of candidates with ties to anti-abortion organizations, white supremacist groups and committed transphobes. One of the most infamous: Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, the Burnaby-South candidate — who earned more than 10 percent of the vote in a recent by-election — is on the record stating that gender fluidity is “the greatest and most insidious assault against our children that this nation has ever seen.”

Meanwhile, Maxime Bernier, founder and leader of the party, went on a Twitter rant in August 2018, claiming that diversity was threatening to “destroy what has made us such a great country.” Bernier has also spoken out against Bill C-16 in 2017, and previously voted to re-open the marriage equality debate in 2006, though he claims abortion and gender identity won’t be part of his platform.

While the People’s Party hasn’t yet announced its platform, the rhetoric of its leader and the politics of its candidates speak volumes about what we can expect.",Where do Canadian political parties rank on LGBTQ2 issues?,Daily Xtra,https://www.dailyxtra.com/where-do-canadian-political-parties-rank-on-lgbtq2-issues-150439

The Walrus

Trina O’Brien Leggott, a retired librarian, enjoys a breathtaking view of Pownal Bay and the surrounding countryside from her rural home outside Charlottetown. But she’s worried about climate change—and she says she’s grown tired of politicians who seem unable or unwilling to address it. “The way we’re doing things is not really working,” she says. “Surely there’s got to be better.”

Leggott has reason to worry. According to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, global temperatures are rising faster than scientists previously believed. Even a pledge by world leaders to cap the rise at 1.5 degrees may not be enough to prevent floods, droughts, heat waves, and catastrophic species loss. According to research from a University of Prince Edward Island climate lab, incremental rises in temperature will exacerbate already powerful storm surges and increase shoreline erosion in the province. The Island currently loses an average of twenty-eight centimetres of coastline a year. By the start of the next century, 1,000 PEI homes and cottages will be at risk of disappearing into the ocean.

Leggott’s house is far enough inland that it likely wouldn’t be one of them, but she has a sense of what’s at stake. “We’re very aware, living on an island, how fragile our ecosystem is,” she says. She wonders how the decline of organic matter in Island soil, described in a report released last year, will affect local agriculture. She also worries about what will happen to Island fisheries should the Northern Pulp mill in Nova Scotia proceed with a controversial plan to discharge effluent into the Northumberland Strait, off the Island’s southern shores.

Those concerns have led Leggott to the Green Party of Prince Edward Island. She’s not alone. Nearly four in ten Islanders have suggested they might vote Green in the next provincial election, according to a recent poll from Corporate Research Associates. (The election has since been called for April 23.) Leggott, who has voted Liberal, NDP, or Green in every provincial election since moving to PEI eleven years ago, says she appreciates the party’s focus on supporting local businesses and protecting farmland. She’s also impressed with how the party connects directly with Islanders, hosting Green Drinks gatherings in pubs and cafés across the province.

The party is headed by Peter Bevan-Baker, and under his leadership, the Green Party has vaulted ahead of the governing Liberals into first place: the latest quarterly poll from CRA has the party at 38 percent, eleven points ahead of the Liberals. If these numbers hold, tiny PEI may be on course to elect the first provincial Green government in Canada.

Frank Graves, president of Ekos Research Associates, says renewed support for the Green Party reflects wider voter concern for the environment. At a time when the majority of Canadians—particularly younger Canadians—see climate change as a serious threat to the planet, a provincial victory would vault the party and its policies into the national spotlight.

In its own unassuming way, PEI has quietly and steadfastly advanced some groundbreaking environmental policies over the past two decades. The province launched a mandatory provincial waste-sorting program in 1999 and now diverts 65 percent of its waste from landfill. It tops the country in the percentage of households that compost. A province-wide ban on single-use plastic bags will take effect in July. And PEI is a global leader in wind power, with Island wind farms producing more than 25 percent of the Island’s energy needs.

Like other Canadian jurisdictions, PEI is currently addressing robust immigration, rising housing prices, and concerns about climate change—but the small scale of the Island makes its case unique among other provinces. Nevertheless, as Prince Edward Island gradually embraces Green politics, it may become a testing ground for a party that has always been seen as an underdog rather than a serious contender for power. And whether or not the Greens win the next election, their influence on PEI politics may offer Canadians a chance to reflect on the broader splintering of traditional party loyalty across the country.

Before the 2015 provincial election, no Green candidate had ever come close to winning a seat. But, since 2017, Bevan-Baker has been the preferred choice of premier. A former dentist and father of four, he made his way to the Island from Scotland, via stints in Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario. He cut his political teeth running (and losing) nine times for the Green Party at the federal and provincial levels before a resounding win in his own rural riding in the 2015 election brought the Greens their historic breakthrough. A surprise by-election win in a Charlottetown seat in 2017 proved the party has momentum.

Don Desserud, a political scientist at UPEI, says the Greens’ appeal can be attributed not just to their environmental focus but also to the current electoral mood. The province’s Liberals are a three-term government with an unpopular leader. The Opposition Progressive Conservatives, on their sixth leader in as many years, have been languishing in the polls.

“There’s an underbelly of frustration with the standard parties doing the same things over and over again,” says Desserud. It’s a phenomenon seen in other recent provincial elections. In New Brunswick, neither the Liberal nor Progressive Conservative parties could eke out a majority victory as support for smaller parties increased. In Quebec, the upstart CAQ surged to power and Québec solidaire made huge gains, at the expense of the once dominant Liberals and Parti Québécois.

Although right-wing populist parties have garnered much media attention as of late, Graves, of Ekos Research, believes there’s an opening in Canada for a progressive, left-of-centre populist party that can speak to voter cynicism. According to a recent Abacus poll, nearly 36 percent of Canadians would consider voting Green in the next federal election, a number that’s remained relatively consistent in the firm’s polling since 2015. In other words, Canadians sympathetic to Green policies often vote for other parties—but, in the right circumstances, might cast their vote with the Greens.

Increased Green support on the Island follows a clutch of modest successes for the party in other provincial legislatures. The Green Party is in a position of strength in British Columbia, where it’s collaborating closely with the NDP. Ontario elected its first Green MPP in June. And, in New Brunswick, the September election saw three Green MLAs elected, giving them the balance of power. Elsewhere, however—particularly in the Prairies, where resource extraction plays a much larger role in the economy—provincial Green parties have struggled.

Nevertheless, Green legislators have taken full advantage of these wins to influence policy. The BC Greens were instrumental in providing input into the NDP government’s ambitious new carbon-reduction strategy, though it’s too early to say how successful the NDP-Green alliance will be in curbing carbon outputs. In PEI, the Greens recently managed to pass one of their own bills, aimed at recognizing the vital role of Island’s creative, cultural, and clean technology industries and designed to attract new investment, trade partnerships, and economic activity in these sectors. The Greens have also rolled out an integrated housing strategy, which calls for expanded seniors housing, tighter regulations on short-term rentals, and more dedicated housing for low-income families. By making climate change and access to housing two of their key priorities in the legislature—and possible planks in an election platform—the Green Party may be demonstrating that its politics are about much more than just saving the environment. Still, despite the party’s polling lead, Desserud isn’t optimistic it will win over the province.

On a federal level, the prospects are less clear. Under leader Elizabeth May, Greens are currently polling at historic levels of support, and Graves feels the timing may be favourable for a modest Green breakthrough in the upcoming federal election. His internal polling shows the Greens leading in three federal ridings, and in play in ten to fifteen more across the country. Yet provincial and federal voting intentions don’t always correspond. Even on PEI, the popularity of Bevan-Baker’s party has resulted in only a modest increase in the number of Islanders who say they plan to vote Green federally. Partly that’s the challenge of a first-past-the-post, winner-take-all system that often penalizes smaller parties. Under a system of proportional representation, if 10 percent of Canadians voted for the Greens, they’d end up with thirty-four seats in the 338-seat House of Commons—a substantive increase over Elizabeth May’s current lone seat, and enough to be a force to reckoned with in Parliament. But, even in the best-case scenarios under our current system, that outcome is highly unlikely. (Islanders have a chance to test-case electoral reform in April’s election. In concert with the provincial election, voters on PEI will be asked in a referendum to make a clear choice between the current first-past-the-post system and a mixed member proportional representation system of government.)

In the absence of electoral reform, it would take a powerful paradigm shift to elect a federal Green government, whose Vision Green platform would pair environmental protection with fiscal responsibility. Rising environmental awareness and disillusionment with the ruling Liberals may sway some voters, but these concerns have not yet positioned the federal party any closer to power. The nature of the current electoral structure, says Graves, is such that during a tightly fought contest—as in the 2015 election—what he calls “promiscuous progressive voters” rally around the candidate most likely to stave off a Conservative victory.

“I really think people are tired of the idea that we either have to vote red or blue,” says Jill MacIntyre, twenty-two. A recent graduate of Mount Allison University, MacIntyre grew up in Summerside and rallied behind causes such as gender rights and economic equality. After flirting with the Liberals and the NDP, she’s found her political home with the Greens. Voters like MacIntyre will be key to the next federal election. She and her millennial peers recently surpassed baby boomers as the largest voting bloc in the country. They voted in record numbers in 2015, and 45 percent of those parked their vote with the Liberals—as did MacIntyre.

Now she’s frustrated by what she perceives as the government’s lack of meaningful consultation with Indigenous communities, not to mention disregard for environmental impacts, in its support for the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. MacIntyre’s concerns are shared by a growing number of Canadians. As the election approaches, the prime minister’s approval ratings have been declining among both the general population and the millennial voters who put him over the top the last time around. “People are just so tired of that,” MacIntyre says of her peers. “And they see that the Greens are doing politics differently.”

In a province that elected Canada’s first premier of non-European descent (Joe Ghiz) and Canada’s first openly gay male premier (current premier Wade MacLauchlan), Islanders have already shown a willingness to make political history. But a provincial win for the Greens would also mark a turning point in Canada’s relationship to the party, as ascension into government would expose the scrappy grassroots party and its leaders to a whole new level of scrutiny. “It would make me so happy to elect the most progressive government in Canada, coming from this tiny island,” says MacIntyre.",Will PEI Start a New Green Wave?,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/will-pei-start-a-new-green-wave/
358,LifeStyle,2019-04-02T14:31:00.0000000Z,"For example, the report noted that green crab, which has been spreading across Canada’s Atlantic coast since the 1950s, were reported off the Island of Newfoundland in 2007, but DFO “had no response plan ready and took no action for almost a year while ...","The federal government is doing a poor job of preventing an invasion of aquatic species that could wreak havoc with Canada’s economy and ecosystems, says a new audit released on Tuesday by Parliament’s environment watchdog.

The audit was among a series of reports released by Julie Gelfand, the federal environment and sustainability commissioner, on a range of issues including fossil fuel subsidies and water pollution form mining companies.

Her report said that inadequate efforts to stop invasive species could have significant consequences. In one recent example, Canada and the U.S. have had to set aside a combined total of $40 million in the 2019-2020 fiscal year to control a species called sea lamprey that is affecting fisheries in the Great Lakes, the report said.

Invasive species can also damage hydroelectric and drinking water filtration facilities, pollute beaches and docks, damage tourism and have profound social and cultural impacts on Indigenous peoples and communities that rely on water resources, the report noted. The report added that the risk of invasive species is also increasing due to climate change.

Officials from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) told auditors that they respond to threats in an ad hoc manner, making decisions after reported sightings.

“We found that this response style could be slow,” the report said. “Delayed response times can allow a species to spread further, making it costlier and more troublesome to control or eradicate.”

For example, the report noted that green crab, which has been spreading across Canada’s Atlantic coast since the 1950s, were reported off the Island of Newfoundland in 2007, but DFO “had no response plan ready and took no action for almost a year while it worked with stakeholders to decide how to respond,” Gelfand’s report said.

“It started trapping green crab the following year but was not successful in eradicating the species,” said the report. “Green crab is now established in this area.”

The audit found one major exception, noting that the government has taken “significant steps” to prevent Asian carp, an invasive species that is now affecting the Mississippi River, from entering the Great Lakes.

The report said that prevention is cheaper than having to deal with an established invasive species, but it noted that the Canada Border Services Agency was also failing to enforce regulations to prevent an invasion of aquatic species at the country’s international borders.

These shortcomings were identified despite international commitments that Canada has made to protect biodiversity that go back to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

Both the agency and the fisheries department agreed with the recommendations and said they are prioritizing action to fix the problem.

DFO has also specially committed to drafting a national response strategy before the end of 2019 that will guide policies in the regions.

In a joint statement issued following the report's release, Fisheries Minister Jonathan Wilkinson and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna noted that the government had announced $43.8 million in spending over five years to tackle the ""dangerous threat"" that aquatic invasive species present to both the environment and economy.

""This federal funding led to the creation of the National Program on Aquatic Invasive Species,"" the ministers said in their statement. ""Through this program, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is working in close collaboration with Canada Border Services Agency to develop and implement procedures, tools and training to ensure border officers are well equipped to fulfill their responsibilities under the AIS (Aquatic Invasive Species) Regulations.""

LETHBRIDGE, Alta. – The Alberta hometown for a victim of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash will name an arena after him, and will also make an exception to a decades-old rule that prohibited its mayor from issuing proclamations.

Councillors in Lethbridge voted unanimously Monday to approve a name change that will see Adams Park Ice Centre become Logan Boulet Arena.

They also voted 8-1 to direct the mayor’s office, as a one-time exception, to proclaim April 7, 2019, as “Green Shirt Day” in the city.

The day is meant to honour the 21-year-old defenceman’s life and his contribution to organ donation, which has been called the Logan Boulet Effect.

Lethbridge councillors passed a resolution in 1999 stating the mayor’s office would discontinue its long-standing practice of issuing proclamations.

But Coun. Blaine Hyggen, who introduced the resolution, said it was important that the city where Boulet grew up to acknowledge the contributions he made.

“This movement has been unbelievable. The Logan Boulet Effect has changed so many lives and will continue to do so. For that reason I thought it was extremely important,” Hyggen said.

Sixteen people died and 13 were injured when the hockey team’s bus was hit by a transport truck on a Saskatchewan highway on April 6, 2018.

Prior to his death, Boulet decided to become an organ donor.

Six organ recipients benefited from his decision, and it inspired more than 100,000 Canadians to register as organ donors in the following weeks.

Coun. Joe Mauro opposed the resolution to allow the mayor’s proclamation, noting he didn’t want to set a precedent.

The city’s administration will work to make the name change on the arena in preparation for next hockey season.

Jason Arsenault, Jenna MacMillan, and Adam Perry are the producers of an award-winning script called ""A Small Fortune"" that’s been officially approved by Telefilm Canada for production.

Telefilm is a corporation that finances and promotes Canadian productions through various funds and programs.

“I’ve written many projects over the years, but this is by far the biggest,” said Perry, a Charlottetown resident. “I personally knew last fall that this film was going to happen when Telefilm Canada said they were interested, but it was only a couple of weeks ago that we executed the contract with them.”

Backing the production is Telefilm, Innovation P.E.I., Newfoundland Film Development Corporation, and Superchannel.

“Our co-producer is Mary Sexton, who recently produced 'Maudie' starring Ethan Hawke and Sally Hawkins,” said Arsenault. “We approached Mary as a partner because of her experience, but also to help us make an Island film, something that could be marketable on a national and international level.”

There’s a lot of business that goes into making a feature film, said Perry.

“It’s a small industry on the Island, so it takes a lot of training, networking, and mentorship. It’s a hard game to play if you’ve never done it before, and it’s been quite a learning process for us.”

“It’s very ingrained into the Acadian culture, specific to that area of P.E.I. It’s definitely an Island movie. The characters are also very grounded and relatable, but that’s what gets them into trouble.” - Adam Perry

In 2014, Perry set out to write the feature-length script about an Irish moss farmer and his wife.

“The couple lives in a hand-me-down house in need of repairs and is expecting a baby,” he said. “Usually people that are out on horseback raking Irish moss are doing it because they are desperate for money – no one does that dangerous work for fun, it’s a long-dead industry.”

The thriller is about what happens after the Irish moss farmer finds a duffel bag of money in the water.

“Before the money can be spent a body washes ashore and a police investigation begins. Things are about to turn upside down when the bad guys come looking for their lost money,” said Perry.

North Cape’s blustery red shores will set the backdrop, along with other identifiable P.E.I. landmarks.

“It’s very ingrained into the Acadian culture, specific to that area of P.E.I. It’s definitely an Island movie,” he said. “The characters are also very grounded and relatable, but that’s what gets them into trouble.”

Perry acknowledged it will take a year to make the film, as well as figure out the specific date for release.

A third Canadian grain company has been confronted by the Chinese government with a notice of non-compliance, based on allegations of pest concerns in its canola exports, according to a senior Agriculture Canada official.

After an emergency meeting of the House agriculture committee, Fred Gorrell, the assistant deputy minister for international affairs for Agriculture Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, told reporters that a third company — to join Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc. — is facing a complaint from the Chinese government.

Internationally

African Swine Fever (ASF) has hit both Japan and Cambodia.

Japan’s farm ministry discovered the infectious virus in sausages brought into the country from China in January. According to the Japan Times, the sausages were brought into the country as souvenirs by two passengers. The Japanese government had only detected ASF in a non-infectious state on Japanese soil before the new instance. It’s unlikely that a larger outbreak could have occurred unless pigs were fed the infected food.

The outbreak in Cambodia came near the Vietnam border. About 400 pigs were killed by the disease, while another 100 were culled. Reuters has more.

by Lynn Côté, Cleantech Lead, Export Development Canada

The global population is growing, the earth’s resources are dwindling, and the state of the climate is in flux. This isn’t a random list of three circumstances. The three are interconnected, each feeding into and off the other.

This symbiosis is known as the water-energy-food nexus, or WEF for short. Although it’s not necessarily a new concept (it hasn’t yet hit the mainstream, though), understanding how we interact with these three precious resources is critical to ensuring earth’s continued ability to sustain human life.

Imagine a Venn diagram with three circles. You have food in one, energy in the second, and water in the third. Each circle touches the other – we need energy and water to make food, after all – but in the middle, where all three overlap, is climate change.

Climate change affects all three resources, independently and as a group, just as the production of food and energy, and the use of water each affect climate change. As we work to mitigate climate change, though, we can’t abandon the need for energy, food or water. What we can do – must do – is consciously maximize the efficiency of producing and consuming each.

If we don’t, we risk running out of these valuable resources and, to be blunt, our planet will no longer be able to tolerate humans.

To set the table, let’s look at some statistics and data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN and the World Wildlife Fund: Agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of global water withdrawal, while the food production and supply chain accounts for about 30 per cent of total global energy consumption and 24 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Making one kilogram of rice – about five cups uncooked – takes, on average, between 3,000 and 5,000 litres of water. For the purposes of imagining that volume of water, let’s split the difference and say 4,000 litres. If we poured all that water into 2-litre soft drink bottles and stacked them one on top of the other, they’d stretch 672 metres into the air – that’s 139 metres taller than the CN tower.

Raising animals for human consumption also places a high demand on fresh water, not to mention cleared land for feed crops and grazing, and the greenhouse gases released through every stage of production.

In short, our current methods for growing and producing food require significant amounts of water and land, and contributes significant amounts of emissions.

Sadly, almost one-third of food produced for human consumption isn’t eaten, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. It’s lost either through storage and transport, or retail and consumer waste.

Now, consider the fact that, in 2017, the World Food Programme and several agencies of the UN estimated there were almost 800 million hungry people worldwide – and, with the global population careening toward 9 billion by 2050, food production is going to have to increase by 50 per cent to feed everyone.

Add to that a spike in water demand from increased manufacturing needs due to the ballooning population, and it becomes pretty easy to imagine that, by 2050, more than 40 per cent of the world’s population will be living in regions coping with severe water stress, according to research from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Clearly, the way we’re growing, consuming and wasting food right now isn’t sustainable.

So, what can we do? Technologies exist to address both the production and consumption/waste sides of the problem, many of which are in Canada, and many of which Export Development Canada’s cleantech team works with to help scale and grow beyond our borders.

For example, there’s Hortau, a Quebec-based cleantech company that developed a “smart farming platform” allowing growers to detect crop stress, optimize growth and reduce water and energy use. This company, which recently received a $7 million investment from EDC, is already seeing its technology put to work in California, where the conservation of water is critical for growers.

Vive Crop Protection, another innovative Canadian agricultural company, uses clean technology to improve crop quality and maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact. Put simply, its ground-breaking technology diffuses pesticides and herbicides more efficiently, enabling farmers to do more with less.

Vive Crop Protection recently received a contract with a large U.S. distributor, after which EDC signed a $1 million direct loan, enabling them to cover costs of meeting the order.

Another type of technology demonstrating an understanding of the WEF nexus turns plant-based foods into meat alternatives. Sol Cuisine has been in the Canadian market for years, but last spring received a $6 million investment from EDC to help it expand its offering of retail and food service customers looking for alternative proteins.

These are just three Canadian companies among a growing international group of peers taking on the challenge to responsibly and consciously maximize the use of energy and water in food production.

The people behind these technologies are rising to the challenge, and our team is dedicated to developing our knowledge and understanding of the companies in this space. We’re proud to work with these Canadian companies developing solutions to the water-energy-food nexus issue, and support for cleantech companies in the agriculture and food sector has increased as the industry advanced.

Even recently, the U.S.-based Cleantech Group didn’t rank the sector as a major player in the cleantech space. Whereas agriculture and food cleantech represented an average of three to four spots on the group’s first years of its annual Global Cleantech 100 list, it represented 12 spots in 2019.

Businesses, growers and financiers have their roles to play, but as consumers, we also exert control. What we can control is our understanding of the WEF nexus and how it applies to the products we buy and, critically, the amount of food we waste.

As a toddler, Gaylord Powless, was keen with a lacrosse stick. In the book “Lacrosse Warrior: The Life of Mohawk Lacrosse Champion Gaylord Powless”, Gaylord’s father Ross Powless talks about his son’s skill.

It was the dawn of the 1950’s and Ross was playing for a lacrosse team in Huntsville. His young family would travel north to watch Ross play.

“Gaylord and I used to put on a little show for the fans in between the periods,” Ross said. “I’d stand with my back to the net and he’d put a little shift on me and go in for the goal. Beat me every time!”

Ross was a lacrosse legend in his own right; he was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1968 and was twice granted the Tom Longboat Award, naming him Canada’s top Indigenous athlete. Gaylord was the oldest of the 14 children Wilma and Ross Powless had. For the Powless family, the game was more than just a hobby, it was ingrained into everyday life.

For indigenous people in Canada in the 1960’s, something else was also a daily truth — being confronted with racism.

In his early teens, regular clashes with that racism coming from white lacrosse players targeting him on the field earned Gaylord a reputation as a hothead. It was coaching from his father, along with teachings about the traditions of lacrosse, a medicine game to the Haudenosaunee from the Creator, that helped Gaylord overcome those attacks and hone his skills to become one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time.

A CBC biography by David Giddens on Gaylord says this became part of his tough skin strategy: play clean, frustrate opponents straight into a foul and his own team into a power play.

Strategic play combined with a cultural understanding of the roots of the game took him at the age of 16, to lead the Oshawa Green Gaels to four Canadian Junior A Minto Cup championships from 1963 to 1967 — twice being named MVP.

“I think he really enjoyed his junior years the most,” his son Chris Powless said of his father at the time. “He was really glad that he played for the late Mr. Jim Bishop (considered one of greatest lacrosse coaches ever) and the tight-knit group that they had.”

From there, it was a trajectory of national championship titles, awards and accolades — earning him the nickname “Marvelous Mohawk” by sports journalists.

Richard Powless told CBC he watched his older brother make a historical shot that he remembers. “Gaylord was running away from the goal, with his back to it. He had a defender on either shoulder. So the almost-predictable, reverse-over-the-shoulder shot was not an option. Instead, Gaylord rifled the ball straight back down between his own feet, where it caromed off the ground and buried top shelf in the net. Even the goalie had to admire that. Almost impossible.”

Powless is featured in the upcoming documentary “THE RULES OF LACROSSE — and the Men Who Break them” by Joanne Storken and Honest Engine Films. In it, hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky tells how much impact Powless had.

“I watched every Canadian, every North American that played lacrosse in the 60s and 70s,” said Gretzky. “Gaylord Powless was the greatest lacrosse player I ever saw play. He would do things with the ball and his stick that nobody’s ever done, nobody ever will do. He was just a very unique, special player. His creativity was so over the top. He could throw the ball backwards even better than he could throw the ball forward. And I remember watching him play each and every night idolizing what he brought, and how exciting it was as a young kid to watch him play.”

Gretzky said, “I saw a lot of great players but to me, there was nobody like Gaylord Powless.”

In 1968, at the age of 17 he was recognized as the best First Nations athlete with the Tom Longboat Award. In the same year he was given the National Lacrosse Association’s All-Star Award. By 1977, Gaylord had played for squads in Montreal, Detroit, Syracuse, Rochester, Portland, Brantford, Brampton and Coquitlam, B.C.. By 1978, he had won every title known in the world of lacrosse.

He retired and became an active coach and advocate for sports at Six Nations of the Grand River. In 1990, Gaylord was inducted to the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame, making Ross and Gaylord the first and only father-son duo in it’s legacy.

Powless continued his advocacy and support of local athletes up to his illness with colon cancer and eventual death in 2001. Days before his passing, community members at Six Nations made the suggestion to the Six Nations Elected Council to rename the Ohsweken Arena in his memory.

Members of Gaylord’s family said he was told about the decision days before his passing and say it was a happy moment during one of the most difficult journeys a family takes — saying goodbye.

On July 28, 2001, Gaylord died after a three year battle with cancer. He was 54 years old.

In 2017, he was named to Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame. His daughter, Gaylene Powless, accepted the award on behalf of her father and his surviving family — and gave a message to her father’s grandchildren — that the love of the Powless family was paramount to Gaylord’s success and his descendants, his greatest accomplishment.

The opposition Conservatives, joined by like-minded ...","They say that even in the unlikely event that the world meets its global carbon emission targets Canada is at high risk of extreme temperatures, drought and flooding.

The climate apocalypse is fast approaching. That’s the word from federal government scientists who Monday issued an alarming report on climate change in Canada.

The opposition Conservatives, joined by like-minded governments in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick, attack Justin Trudeau’s Liberals for imposing a carbon tax to deal with the global warming problem.

Yet so far the report has elicited a ho-hum response. The country’s political class remains consumed with the Jody Wilson-Raybould saga, a political scandal in which little scandalous has occurred.

They calculate that since 1948, mean temperatures in Canada have increased by more than double the world average.

But they offer nothing plausible in its stead. Ontario Premier Doug Ford argues that he doesn’t need to do anything to reduce carbon emissions — that the decision of a previous government to shut down the province’s coal-fired electricity generating plants was sufficient.

If the Tories were serious about climate change, they wouldn’t criticize Trudeau for doing too much. They would attack him for doing too little.

Federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, another vociferous critic of carbon taxes, says he’ll come up with ideas of his own — eventually.

By the federal government’s own reckoning, it is not on course to meet even the minimalist carbon emission targets it agreed to in Paris in 2015.

But perhaps the most bizarre distraction from the serious business of climate change is the fascination with every twist and turn of the Wilson-Raybould story.

I say bizarre because ultimately, this is a story in which nothing much happened.

Last fall, Wilson-Raybould was pressed by those around the prime minister to consider offering a form of plea bargain to SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec engineering firm under indictment for bribery. She demurred and eventually was shifted to another portfolio before quitting cabinet entirely.

But SNC-Lavalin still faces criminal charges and remains without a plea bargain. On the substantive issue, nothing has changed.

Still, the story rages along. A Commons committee investigates and then, when matters get too hot for the Liberal majority, calls the inquiry off.

From time to time, Wilson-Raybould and her ally, former treasury board president Jane Philpott, pop up to do no-information media interviews.

One week, we hear that Wilson-Raybould is releasing more details about this business. The next week we read that in order to counter her, Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, has done the same.

Wilson-Raybould releases an audio recording of her December 2018 conversation with former top bureaucrat Michael Wernick. Although the tape contains no additional information, it immediately gives the story new life.

Was it legal for her to tape the conversation without Wernick’s knowledge? (Answer: almost certainly yes). Was it proper? (Answer: almost certainly no).

As I write this, television is reporting breathlessly that Wilson-Raybould is appealing to her fellow Liberal MPs not to kick her out of caucus even though she has said she has no confidence in Trudeau’s government.

Will she succeed? Will feminist Trudeau have the nerve to oust a high-profile Indigenous woman from the government benches?

Stay tuned. The soap opera continues.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, climate change rolls along. The federal report predicts that if carbon emission growth continues unabated, sea levels on the east coast will rise by as much as one metre. In the St. Lawrence basin, water levels are predicted to rise half a metre.

Under the same scenario, the scientists report with medium confidence that, by 2100, periods of drought will become more frequent in the Prairies and the British Columbia interior.

This is the grim future Canada faces. If we paid more attention to it and less to every twist and turn in the admittedly entertaining Wilson-Raybould story, we might be able to better deal with what’s coming.

Trudeau said former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott would no longer be allowed to sit as Liberal legislators. They were also barred from running for the party in the federal election this October.

The Liberals have been in turmoil since Wilson-Raybould said in February that officials had inappropriately pressured her last year while she was justice minister to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escape a corruption trial.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told an emergency meeting of caucus.

“Civil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them,” said Trudeau, 47, who took office in November 2015 and faces a tough re-election battle this autumn.

Wilson-Raybould, who tweeted news of her ouster before Trudeau’s announcement, was demoted in January and resigned the next month. Philpott quit shortly afterward, saying she had lost confidence in how Trudeau was handling the matter.

“If people can’t express trust in the party and the prime minister, then they need to find another political vehicle in order to advance their ideas. It’s as simple as that,” Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters.

The expulsion represented a change of course for Trudeau, who said as recently as last week that the Liberals needed strong legislators with differing points of view.

But increasingly angry parliamentarians had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity.

Opinion polls show the crisis has cut public support for the Liberals to such an extent that they could lose in October to the official opposition Conservatives.

Trudeau, who came to power promising “sunny ways” and a greater role for women in politics, admitted it “has been a difficult few weeks.”

The scandal also cost him the services of his closest aide, Gerald Butts, and Michael Wernick, the head of the federal bureaucracy.

Wilson-Raybould said on Twitter: “I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do.”

Last Friday, to back her case, she released the audio of a confidential conversation with Wernick, who did not know she was recording him. Trudeau said that was “unconscionable.”

Philpott said on Facebook that she “did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the prime minister ... it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences.”

Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing. The scandal is starting to hit his fortunes in the populous province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in October to remain in power.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau’s decision sent a message that “if you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal Party.”",Canadian prime minister expels two ex-ministers from ruling party caucus amid scandal,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1RE2IY-OCADN
370,World,2019-04-03T19:32:00.0000000Z,"The last Canadian federal election in 2015 saw renewed promises for LGBTQ2 issues — from commitments to pass trans-rights legislation to ending the blood ban.

But this time around, there’s a brand new People’s Party of Canada all too willing to rail against diversity, while the Conservative Party is being led by Andrew Scheer and his anti-trans, anti-marriage equality, anti-abortion voting record. It’s bound to be an especially tumultuous election for queer and trans Canadians.

To keep voters informed about our political parties’ commitments — and transgressions — we’ve noted each party’s policies on LGBTQ2 issues. And because these policies and promises will be changing throughout the election campaign, we’ll keep this story updated. Be sure to revisit it as campaign season begins.

The Liberal Party

Coming into office in 2015 after 10 years of Conservative governance, the Liberal Party immediately got to work tackling LGBTQ2 issues. Over the past four years, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s party has taken a ton of action on those issues, which they’ll definitely be relying on to earn our votes come election day on Oct 21.

Here’s what the party has accomplished since 2015:

– After more than a decade of trans activism, and in large part due to historic and ongoing efforts of New Democrat Members of Parliament (MPs), the Liberal government successfully passed a trans-rights bill — Bill C-16 into law in 2017 — enshrining gender identity and gender expression as protected grounds in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code of Canada.

– On Nov 29, 2017, Trudeau issued an apology on behalf of the federal government to the thousands of public servants, members of the military and police and intelligence employees discriminated against, fired, criminally prosecuted and sometimes imprisoned for their sexual orientation from the 1950s to the 1990s.

– The party appointed Randy Boissonnault, the openly gay MP for Edmonton Centre, as Special Advisor on LGBTQ2 Issues. Trudeau’s government also created the LGBTQ2 Secretariat within the Privy Council to help inform the government on issues and potential solutions of importance to our communities.

– In 2017, the Canadian government became co-chair of the Equal Rights Coalition, the first-ever international, intergovernmental coalition committed to protecting the rights of LGBTQ2 communities around the world.

– This February, the federal government made a commitment to advance human rights and socio-economic outcomes for LGBTQ2 people in developing countries, with $30 million in funding over the next five years, followed by $10 million a year after that.

– In their 2019 budget, the Liberals committed $20 million to LGBTQ2 service organizations to support capacity building and community-level work.

For some, their actions have rung hollow. While many applauded the 2017 apology to LGBTQ2 Canadians, others, like Michael Motala, one of the authors of the Egale report The Just Society Report: Gross Indecency, which was commissioned by the Department of Justice, said, “It feels like the government is just using these issues as a bit of a PR stunt and they’re really not tackling things substantively.”

And despite some significant victories, the Liberals haven’t made good on all of their promises to LGBTQ2 communities. The party campaigned in 2015 on a commitment to end the blood ban — which prevents men who have sex with men and trans people from donating blood unless they’ve remained abstinent for a period of time — but have failed to do so thus far. In 2016, the Liberals reduced that time period from five years to one, but the ban still exists despite outcry from LGBTQ2 communities and experts who say it unnecessarily targets queer and trans folks.

The New Democratic Party

While the New Democrats have never been the federal party in power, they’ve had a strong influence on LGBTQ2 issues. They were the first party to formally announce its support for the gay movement in 1976 and were home to Canada’s first openly gay MP Svend Robinson, who came out in 1998.

When the House of Commons voted on marriage equality in 2005, the NDP was the only party that required its MPs to vote in favour. And while Bill C-16 passed under a Liberal government, the NDP championed four separate legislative efforts since 2005 to enact federal trans-rights protections, re-introducing new legislation to keep the issue up for discussion, and building support across political parties.

The NDP hasn’t yet announced its 2019 election platform or any specific commitments on LGBTQ2 issues. But during his run for leadership two years ago, Jagmeet Singh made three key commitments:

– A total review of government policies and practices to ensure full compliance with trans-rights Bill C-16.

– A complete end to the blood ban.

– An LGBTQ2 lens on housing and homelessness reduction, with an emphasis on addressing the unique needs of homeless LGBTQ2 youth, though the commitments remain vague.

The NDP made a number of commitments of its own in the previous election, backed up by statements in their policy book, which include:

– Contributing to the repeal of the anti-sex work legislation Bill C-36, passed in 2014 under the Conservative government.

– Improving federal data collection on issues specific to the LGBTQ2 community, including health care needs and experiences, to improve availability of data to inform policies on a federal, provincial and local level.

– Investing in programs to promote equity for LGBTQ2 people, particularly LGBTQ2 young people. (No specific programs, however, were referenced.)

– Supporting international struggles against discrimination directed at LGBTQ2 communities.

The Conservative Party

Heading into the upcoming federal election, the Conservative Party of Canada is stuck in an uncomfortable position: facing a challenge on one side from Maxime Bernier’s right-wing People’s Party, which has the potential to split the conservative vote, and, on the other side, competing with an incumbent Liberal majority government for the centrist votes crucial to either party’s electoral success. With Andrew Scheer — a staunch social conservative who has voted against marriage equality, trans rights and pro-choice legislation — as its leader, the party seems likely to continue leaning into social conservatism. Scheer claims he’ll keep divisive social issues out of his government’s policies, but whether that’s true is debatable.

While the Conservative platform hasn’t yet been released, the party’s policy book is devoid of any references to LGBTQ2 communities. It’s worth mentioning that this is the party that only struck its definition of marriage as between a man and a woman from its policy book in 2016, more than a decade after Canada legalized same-sex marriage. Some members of the party, like Michelle Rempel and Michael Chong, have broken ranks from their peers in an effort to advance LGBTQ2 issues, with some success. When Bill C-16 came to a vote in the House of Commons, for instance, 38 Conservative MPs voted for it.

But whether or not the party will stay true to Stephen Harper’s legacy and sneak its way to electoral success without any discussion of LGBTQ2 identities remains to be seen.

The Green Party

Like the NDP, the Green Party has a strong history of tackling LGBTQ2 issues. In 1996, it became the first federal political party to officially support same-sex marriage, and was the first — and only — major federal political party to have an openly gay leader in Chris Lea.

While the Greens have yet to announce particular policies or commitments for LGBTQ2 communities for the upcoming election, the party articulated some vague commitments in the 2015 election that will likely shape their approach to LGBTQ2 issues this election. These commitments included:

– Investing in HIV/AIDS education and prevention services to ensure that those living with the virus are receiving comprehensive and effective treatments.

– Advocating for increased federal funding, coordination and support for strategies on mental health, addictions, sexual education, sexualized and gender-based violence and housing for all Canadians, with specific measures to address the needs of LGBTQ2 Canadians.

– Supporting public education to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

– Ending the targeting of LGBTQ2 bookstores and other LGBTQ2 businesses by Customs Canada.

– Improved protections for trans people and raised awareness of policies for inclusion.

– Advocating internationally to protect the human rights of LGBTQ2 communities.

The People’s Party of Canada

The People’s Party has been around less than a year, and it’s already collected a slate of candidates with ties to anti-abortion organizations, white supremacist groups and committed transphobes. One of the most infamous: Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, the Burnaby-South candidate — who earned more than 10 percent of the vote in a recent by-election — is on the record stating that gender fluidity is “the greatest and most insidious assault against our children that this nation has ever seen.”

Meanwhile, Maxime Bernier, founder and leader of the party, went on a Twitter rant in August 2018, claiming that diversity was threatening to “destroy what has made us such a great country.” Bernier has also spoken out against Bill C-16 in 2017, and previously voted to re-open the marriage equality debate in 2006, though he claims abortion and gender identity won’t be part of his platform.

While the People’s Party hasn’t yet announced its platform, the rhetoric of its leader and the politics of its candidates speak volumes about what we can expect.",Where do Canadian political parties rank on LGBTQ2 issues?,Daily Xtra,https://www.dailyxtra.com/where-do-canadian-political-parties-rank-on-lgbtq2-issues-150439

But while some critics argue that a different prime minister would have ejected the former ministers much sooner, a political columnist argues that Trudeau knew exactly what he was doing.

""Trudeau, in his own way, believes that he did politics differently by letting this go on so long, and letting them stay in caucus,"" Susan Delacourt, the Ottawa bureau chief with the Toronto Star, told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.

Speaking Tuesday, Trudeau said the trust between the party and the two former ministers had been irreparably broken.

The controversy began in February, with allegations that the Prime Minister's Office pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the case of SNC-Lavalin, which the prime minister denies.

Delacourt said that the prime minister seemed aware of criticism that ""a Jean Chrétien or a Stephen Harper"" wouldn't have allowed the former ministers to stay so long.

FILE PHOTO: Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, March 19, 2019. REUTERS/Chris Wattie

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, citing international commitments to fight global warming, had made clear for two years he would slap the tax on any of the 10 provinces that did not come up with their own plans by April 1.

The measure is opposed by Ontario, the most populous province, where Trudeau’s Liberals need to do well to stand a chance of retaining power in a federal election this October.

Carbon pollution will initially cost C$20 ($15) a tonne, rising by C$10 a year until it reaches C$50 in 2022. It also applies in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.

“As of today, it’s no longer free to pollute anywhere in Canada,” Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said on Twitter.

Official data regularly show Canada has little chance of meeting its climate change goals of reducing emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.

Canada will heat up twice as fast as the rest the world, with northern regions warming at an even greater pace, a Canadian environment ministry report said on Monday.

Smaller snow packs and a loss of glacier ice could mean water supply shortages in the summer, it added.

Trudeau says extreme weather events like forest fires and floods underline the need to combat global warming.

Although Ottawa says the money collected from the next tax will be returned to Canadians in the form of rebates, right-leaning parties portray it as a cash grab.

The Conservatives, who polls show could win the October election as a political scandal dogs Trudeau, promise to scrap the measure.

Ontario premier Doug Ford vowed to oppose what he called “the worst tax ever” in court.

“We’re going to keep fighting this carbon tax with every single tool at our disposal,” he said.

Trudeau’s other efforts to combat climate change are also proving a challenge.

Last year Ottawa unveiled plans to overhaul environmental assessments of energy projects, paying more attention to greenhouse gas emissions. Critics say this will deter investment at a time when existing projects are in trouble.

With only two seats, the Prince Edward Island Legislature has been a lonely place for the Green Party.

But that may be about to change. With the election campaign in full swing, the party has led in four of the last five polls.

If the lead continues through the election on April 23, it will form the first Green government anywhere in Canada. That would make Peter Bevan-Baker the country's first Green premier.

As It Happens host Carol Off spoke to Bevan-Baker about that prospect and why he thinks his platform is resonating with voters. Here is part of their conversation.

Mr. Bevan-Baker, as you know Prince Edward Island has gone back and forth between Liberals and Tories for generations. So what makes you think that Islanders are ready to have a Green government?

Like so many places in the world, there is a deep dismay and disappointment with conventional politics and unimaginative politicians. And people are looking for an alternative, a credible alternative, that feels comfortable for them.

Here on Prince Edward Island, the sort of natural traditions and personality of folks is not, as has happened in some other jurisdictions, to take a hard turn to the right. We've always been the ""keeper of each other's brother"" here. It's a very communitarian society. And so that sort of direction for something new was never going to happen here.

What do your Green Party colleagues across the country say to you about, ""Why P.E.I.?"" I'm sure there's a lot of jealousy that's going around.

I've had more support than jealousy. But they're certainly looking at this with great interest, because it's new. And there's obviously a lot of responsibility that comes with that.

PEI Premier Wade MacLauchlan drops the writ, with assistance from a prop, announcing Prince Edward Islanders will be going to the polls on April 23, in Charlottetown on March 26, 2019. (Brian McInnis/The Canadian Press)

What's your key offer to the people of P.E.I.? What makes you different from the Tories and Liberals?

If I were to focus in on one area of our platform, the one that I think is resonating most loudly with Islanders is to restore trust in government.

We've heard that sort of ping pong politics here between the red team and the blue team. And it seemed that no matter who was in there, the level of patronage really did not change.

But this time they have an opportunity for a different level of change — a deeper level of change.

Why have you downplayed to some extent your environmental concerns? I would think that would be front and centre with the Green Party.

Well, absolutely they are. And I think the Green Party, unlike the other parties, recognizes that a healthy environment is fundamental to a prosperous economy and to a healthy society. You cannot have a vibrant economy on a dying planet.

So it's not that we're downplaying that. But in order to present a comfortable alternative to people in politics today, we have to get past that idea that the Green Party is a single-issue party.

Well we just had a report come out, rather devastating news about what's going on with climate change in this country. You think this is a time to say, ""We just assume they know we care about the environment, and we'll move on?"" I mean I think you'd have to actually say, ""Hey guys, we need to do something right now.""

We are, and I am.

Of course carbon tax is a huge issue politically in Canada, and it's no different here in Prince Edward Island.

And I'm not trying to belittle the fact that for some people that is a significant amount of money added up, particularly if you live in rural Prince Edward Island, if you have a minimum paying job. But we have to also recognize our collective responsibility to pass on a livable planet to future generations.

P.E.I. Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King speaks to the crowd at the party's leadership convention. (Brian McInnis/CBC)

Our generation has done a terrible job of living on this planet. And I'm not just talking environmentally, I'm talking economically and socially as well. And we have to step up to the plate and take the action that's required.

It's early, but have you practiced that phrase — Premier Bevan-Baker? Have you said that out loud to yourself?

You know I have to be comfortable with that, Carol. Because if you can't imagine something then it's going to be a real shock to you if it ever if it ever materializes.

So I used to laugh when people said stuff like that, but it's not funny anymore. And we have to be ready to govern. And personally I am ready to do that, and the party I think has demonstrated on our platform and in the quality of our candidates that we are absolutely ready to govern here.

Because a debate over whether Trudeau allowed slightly more dissent ...","Emmett Macfarlane is an associate professor of political science at the University of Waterloo.

Media coverage and analysis of the SNC-Lavalin affair has been even more bewildering and disheartening than the story itself.

We have witnessed allegations about political interference in a criminal prosecution go from strenuously denied to effectively verified. The literal party line has gone from “it didn’t happen” to “the pressure wasn’t illegal,” as if illegality is the only thing that would make this a scandal.

Yet somehow the debate has not been about the ethical propriety of asserting pressure on the attorney general—an attorney general we now have on tape repeatedly telling the country’s top public servant that she feels these conversations were inappropriate. Instead, the focus has inexplicably been about Jody Wilson-Raybould’s motives. Even more incredibly, Jane Philpott, whose only crime in all of this has been to resign on principle because she didn’t like what she saw and heard, has received the same treatment.

The Prime Minister’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, said in his testimony to the Justice Committee that “there’s a grey area in what you think is a political consideration” in responding to questions about what issues were repeatedly invoked to Wilson-Raybould over months, as the Prime Minister’s Office tried over and over to get her to change course. It is the type of acknowledgement that has led some people to conclude this is all a disagreement over interpretation, rather than question why top power players in this country were operating in a grey area in the first place.

So instead of think pieces devoted to the ethics of applying pressure on the attorney general or how best to protect prosecutorial independence in the future, we get risible columns accusing Wilson-Raybould and Philpott of attempting to destroy the Prime Minister. In any other context we would call this out for what it is: blatant victim-blaming.

Which brings us to Tuesday.

Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott have been booted from the Liberal caucus and there are still veteran press gallery journalists wondering what they thought they would get from creating this mess.

Whether it was watching members of CBC’s At Issue panel question Wilson-Raybould’s motives (again) on Tuesday night, or listening to another panel of journalists on CBC Radio Wednesday morning note that future politicians will learn not to take the same approach as Wilson-Raybould or Philpott, some of the media are part of the problem in Canada’s hyper-partisan, unprincipled politics.

It is not that covering politics for 15 or 30 years necessarily makes you stupid, but it can apparently blind some to the idea that not all political fights are attempted power grabs. Is it so rare to see politicians act on points of principle that we can’t recognize it when it smacks us in the face? Because to think this was an attempted coup you’d have to possess the mind of a conspiracy theorist (or be Sheila Copps).

In the aftermath of Tuesday’s caucus decision, the discussion turned to whether this whole thing proves or disproves the idea the Justin Trudeau is doing politics differently. There’s no doubt Stephen Harper or Jean Chretien would not have let this drag on so long. Trudeau himself seemed to hint that he tried to be patient and got nothing but trouble for doing so. On the other hand, watching Philpott get dumped for disagreeing with the Prime Minister on this one file (and having the gall to conduct a media interview with Maclean’s magazine on the issue), sure makes the new way of politics look like the old way of politics. Only in Canadian party politics does “working with the team” translate to never publicly dissenting.

But that discussion is almost besides the point. Because a debate over whether Trudeau allowed slightly more dissent for slightly longer than his predecessors masks the fact that there were people doing politics differently for all to see. On Tuesday, they were kicked out of caucus for it.

One need not paint the PMO as composed of moustache-twirling villains to get at what is most lamentable about all of this. Knowing some of the people involved, I’m confident the initial conversations with Wilson-Raybould were out of a true desire to save jobs or explore options. What is disheartening to see is the lack of introspection on the part of the players and, indeed, much of the Liberal caucus, given the fallout. Why would Wilson-Raybould object to these conversations? Why would she go to the extreme of recording a conversation with the Clerk of the Privy Council? Why would Philpott resign?

If the decent people implicated by this story, and the many decent people in the Liberal caucus, including the Prime Minister, engaged in some self-reflection, perhaps Tuesday’s decision would not have been necessary. Perhaps instead we would have seen an apology, if not for wrongdoing, then for making Wilson-Raybould feel as if she was subject to inappropriate pressure. And perhaps we would have seen a promise to examine the relationship political actors have with the attorney general, and the principle of independence in that role.

Because if we had seen evidence of that self-reflection, we could have concluded weeks ago that maybe this Prime Minister does do politics differently.",Not all political fights are power grabs,Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/snc-lavalin-jody-wilson-raybould-trudeau-power-grab/

Mike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Business leaders are warning that the Trump administration's threat to tighten the U.S. embargo on Cuba could sideswipe Canadian companies that are doing business on the Caribbean island.

The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says it is worried that the United States could enact a never-before-used section of the 1996 Helms Burton Act that would allow Americans to sue foreign companies linked to Cuban properties that were confiscated after its 1959 revolution.

""It's an administration that's not afraid to break with what are considered to be the normal ways of doing business in international diplomacy,"" said Mark Agnew, the chamber's director of international policy.

Case in point: an insistence in the Trump White House that Canadian steel and aluminum exports remain subject to tariffs imposed on dubious national-security grounds, even though it has been months since the two countries and Mexico joined in signing a new North American trade pact.

Agnew said the chamber is especially concerned about the potential impact on Canadian mining, financial services and tourism companies with operations in Cuba.

""They're not afraid to go out and take a fairly bold stance that isn't necessarily in the interest of the business community,"" he said. ""I think you need to take the threat quite seriously that they would go through actually make it happen.""

Canadian businesses should brace for the activation of the Title III section of Helms Burton, even though it has essentially remained dormant for 23 years, said Mark Entwistle, a business consultant in Cuba who served as Canadian envoy to Havana in the 1990s.

There is strong opposition to activating Title III among the U.S. business and agricultural leaders, but that might not be enough, Entwistle said.

""All the rules of the game have been changed. We have to be prepared for the president not to further waive Title III.""

Last month, the U.S. State Department extended the Title III exemption by only 30 days, linking it to Cuba's ongoing support of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. The U.S., Canada and other western countries want Maduro to resign and make way for opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate leader of a country in the throes of an economic and political crisis.

Several foreign countries, including Canada, have invested in Cuba during the more than 50 years since the U.S. froze relations and imposed an economic embargo. Obama relaxed the embargo and began normalizing relations with Cuba, but Trump has rolled that back.

Toronto-based resource company Sherritt International is long established in Cuba, and its executives are banned from travelling to the U.S. or doing any business there under existing provisions of Helms Burton. Other countries, such as Britain, France and Spain, have companies active in rum, cigars and tourism ventures in Cuba.

Title III allows Americans to use their courts to sue foreign entities who may have ""trafficked"" in property confiscated by the communist Castro regime after it overthrew Cuba's U.S.-backed government in 1959.

Agnew said U.S. courts have never been asked to rule on what constitutes trafficking.

""It could affect any company which has any, any relationship with Cuba,"" said Agnew.

""It could be a financial transaction that has a point of connection with someone in Cuba, which is now the owner of the property that we nationalized in 1960. It could be a financial, a trade operation. It could be investment -- it could be anything.""

Without naming companies, Agnew said it is conceivable that Canadian tourism operators or resource companies could be at risk. ""We're talking to our government as well as our business counterparts in the U.S. and Europe. The overall message is we don't want this to come into effect.""

Josefina Vida, Cuba's ambassador to Canada, said she has been urging Canada to push back against Trump, warning that the latest escalation is making it difficult to attract much-needed Canadian investment to her country.

""It is a very obvious clear violation of international law, of the rules of international trade and the sovereignty of states.""

In 1996, Canada, the European Union and Mexico reacted ""in a very strong way"" to Title III, which helped encourage then-president Bill Clinton to postpone it, she said.

Canada has been actively engaging with the U.S. government on the issue, including speaking directly to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said Adam Austen, spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland.

""We continue to raise our concerns about the possible negative consequences for Canadians -- concerns which are long-standing and well-known to our U.S. partners,"" said Austen.

""She has also been in contact with Canadian businesses to reaffirm that we will fully defend the interests of Canadians conducting legitimate trade and investment with Cuba.""","Trump pressure on Cuba could hit Canadian companies, business leaders warn",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/trump-pressure-on-cuba-could-hit-canadian-companies-business-leaders-warn-1.4360913

Spacing is pleased to introduce our newest urban issues correspondent, Nicholas Sanderson. Nick is an independent policy and communications consultant from the UK, currently working out of Toronto, specializing in transport and environment issues. Follow him on Twitter @Nicholas_I_S This is a crosspost from a post he made on his Medium site.



Congestion has been in the news again. The Washington Post presents Arity’s findings, that Americans spend almost three-times more time commuting by car than they get in vacation. More time each year spent travelling to work than they get off. Congestion is a pain. The great inefficiency of automobility.

A partial solution to the congestion problem favoured by economists is road pricing. We have ready-made examples at work in London, Stockholm and Singapore. But road pricing is politically challenging such that the cities that have it are still a minority. Why?

Simply put, it’s a challenge for cities founded on democratic governance. When Ken Livingstone sought to bring one to London, it was billed as his great gamble: a decongested nirvana or international embarrassment and electoral defeat. But even when it was first considered in 2000, over half (52 per cent) of journeys in London were by public transport, walking or cycling. The majority of travelling Londoners were already set to benefit. And Livingstone must have taken confidence from this.

Cities have also held referendums to decide. In Manchester, road-pricing proposals fell foul of plebiscite. While in Stockholm citizens supported a charge. Crucially however, before putting the scheme to a popular vote, Stockholm trialled a congestion charge for six months. Popular opinion changed dramatically and when the referendum arrived, citizens voted in favour. But even reaching a trial can be a challenge.

More recently, in New York and Toronto, proposals were called off by higher political office. Getting a form of rationing through our democratic institutions — particularly fragmented city governance — has proved problematic.

Indeed, one extreme view is that a solution cannot be delivered democratically (at least in America). Speaking to The Economist in 2003, Anthony Downs, author of Stuck in Traffic said, “this is a problem without a solution — at least a solution the American people will accept … Learn to enjoy being stuck in traffic as another leisure activity, because congestion is here to stay.”

Downs’ position is strengthened when we consider that trust in our political institutions has declined. According to polls highlighted by the OECD, trust in government sits at an average 43%. Between 2007 and 2015, trust in political parties decreased by an average two percentage points; while trust in parliaments decreased five percentage points between 2008 and 2014 in OECD/EU countries. Why are these stats an issue?

Government, political parties and parliaments are the bodies that would make the tough decisions needed to develop road pricing (decisions I’ve written about before). If we don’t trust them, we won’t trust the solutions they propose. In this environment, politicians might wish to stay clear of volatile policies and tough decisions.

But with time running out to curb carbon emissions, urban populations rising, and congestion with it, is there a way for democrats (with a small ‘d’) to deliver road pricing?

I would argue there is. And it requires a bit of trust in people. People that members of the public see a bit of themselves in: no ulterior motive, no investments to shore up, no expenses to syphon off, no political career to progress.

The wish list: long-form public deliberation, from a representative group, informed by experts with the right structure to incentivize proper engagement. I don’t claim to have the perfect recipe. But at least we have examples to learn from: the Irish Constitutional Convention, Melbourne’s Peoples Panel, multiple participatory budgeting initiatives at a local level and Scotland’s 2015 Community Empowerment Act, to name a few.

In the transport world, my previous employer Sustrans have a long history of community co-design on street and neighbourhood level schemes. Leaders of the cycling and walking-friendly transformation of one London borough saw it as critical to their success.

There are abundant examples to learn from in order to get it right.

As Claudia Chwalisz argues, “by engaging a broad cross-section of the population — rather than the loudest voices — and giving the time and resources to consider the problem from all angles, public bodies encourage a consensual approach to decision-making and gain the legitimacy to act on hard choices.”

This isn’t an alternative to political leadership, but an accessory to it — giving decisions more transparency and legitimacy. Features sorely needed on such controversial topics as road pricing. Ultimate decision making should, of course, rest with elected representatives. But opening up the development process to the public could help gain the legitimacy needed to act.

Across the world, proposals to deal with the thorny issue of congestion so far have a low success rate. It’s one of the dilemma’s that might just benefit from being one of the issues we put a citizen’s assembly to work on. Long-form deliberation is gaining traction around the world because when it comes to difficult policy-decisions, we’re more likely to trust people like us. And trusting people might be a way to rebuild trust in our political institutions and put forward a workable solution.",Is it time for Canadian cities to think about road pricing?

The SNC-Lavalin affair, as the scandal is now known, has dominated Canadian media and raised questions about Trudeau's leadership, most notably on transparency ...","The former Cabinet member at the center of the political scandal rocking Canada says she has been expelled from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party, a development that is likely to deepen questions about his handling of the case.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was Canada's first indigenous attorney general, said Tuesday Trudeau had informed her she was no longer part of the Liberal caucus and had been stripped of the party's nomination for the upcoming election to keep her seat in Parliament.

article continues below

""More to come,"" she tweeted.

Minutes later, Trudeau confirmed the news and the expulsion of former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, who had publicly supported Wilson-Raybould.

""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. ""It's become clear that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott can no longer be part of our Liberal team.""

Trudeau has tried to move beyond the political scandal that has tarnished his international reputation and could dim his prospects in October's federal election. But the expulsion of the two former allies will bring more attention to the affair.

Trudeau and his team have been dogged since February by accusations that they inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould as attorney general to cut a deal for a Quebec-based engineering firm, SNC-Lavalin - and demoted her when she resisted.

The SNC-Lavalin affair, as the scandal is now known, has dominated Canadian media and raised questions about Trudeau's leadership, most notably on transparency, indigenous affairs and women's rights - the issues that helped him get elected.

Trudeau has refused to apologize. He has said there was an ""erosion of trust"" between his office and the Cabinet, but he denied allegations of backroom dealmaking or bullying.

The roots of the scandal stretch back to 2015, when SNC-Lavalin was charged by Canadian authorities with allegedly using bribes to secure business in Moammar Gadhafi-led Libya. Gadhafi was unseated and killed in 2011.

The Globe and Mail newspaper reported in February that Trudeau's team ""pressed"" Wilson-Raybould to cut the firm a deal known as a deferred prosecution agreement.

These deals, which are used in several countries, allow firms to avoid criminal convictions if they admit wrongdoing, pay fines and commit to stricter compliance rules.

Trudeau has said his team did not ""direct"" Wilson-Raybould's decision, but few have been satisfied by the response.

In a January Cabinet shuffle, Wilson-Raybould was moved from the Ministry of Justice to Veterans Affairs. The Globe and Mail published its report the next month, and Wilson-Raybould resigned as minister of veterans affairs and hired a retired Supreme Court justice to represent her.

As questions grew, Trudeau's best friend and closest aide resigned. Gerald Butts said he did not want the allegations to ""take one moment away from the vital work the prime minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.""

But his resignation did little to quell the controversy. Wilson-Raybould testified before a parliamentary committee that 11 members of Trudeau's team had pressured her - some resorting to ""veiled threats"" - to get her to cut a deal.

Then Philpott resigned from the Cabinet in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau appeared for a spell to have weathered the storm, but the scandal burst into view again last week when Wilson-Raybould went public with a recording of a December phone call with Canada's then-top civil servant.

In the call, she warned Michael Wernick, at the time Canada's clerk of the Privy Council, that Trudeau ""was on dangerous ground.""

Some have questioned her decision to tape the call.

Before her meeting with the Liberal caucus Tuesday, she wrote a letter saying she should have been able to stay.

""I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to. In giving the advice I did, and taking the steps I did, I was trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess,"" she wrote in a letter to fellow Liberals.

Shortly after breaking the news of her expulsion, she tweeted:

""What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party.

""I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do.""",Trudeau government expels former allies who challenged him in political scandal,The Prince George Citizen,https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/washington-post/international/trudeau-government-expels-former-allies-who-challenged-him-in-political-scandal-1.23778604

In a report issued this week, Al Mussell, research lead at Agri-Food Economic Systems in Guelph, Ont., noted that an outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in China is also disrupting the global meat supply.

“We’re in uncharted waters,” Mussell said. “We’ve never had a structural bull market in agricultural products led by the protein complex, while at the same time experiencing an opposite trend in oilseed.”

Generic lean hog futures have shot up 40 per cent since the beginning of March as a result of the outbreak, one that could wipe out seven million sows according to Rabobank estimates cited by Mussell.

“There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year,” Mussell said, predicting that the demand for all kinds of meat would rise as a result.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says ASF is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. It causes high death rates in infected pigs and can infect swine herds in various ways. There is no treatment.

Mussell said that swine populations in other countries, including Canada, are at risk of infection and that the disease has already spread to Vietnam, Russia and some Eastern European and African countries.

There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year Al Mussell

According to a Bloomberg News report, China may increase U.S. pork imports to a record 300,000 metric tonnes in 2019 as part of a commitment to increase American farm imports to resolve the trade war – 81 per cent more than the 166,000 tons in 2017.

But Pan Chenjun, an analyst at Rabobank International in Hong Kong, noted that increased U.S. pork imports alone would not be enough to offset China’s shortage.

“All protein imports may rise,” as a result, she told Bloomberg.

Ray Price, president of Sunterra Farms in Acme, Alberta, is worried about ASF.

“The biggest risk is people bringing meat into Canada,” he said. “But we have a very high standard of health and biosecurity in this country.”

While the swine flu outbreak poses risks, high pork prices could also create an opportunity Mussell said, and bring about investment in pork production in China and Canada.

“This is an incredible earning opportunity for hog producers and processors,” he said.

That comes in contrast to the potential bear market in oil seeds.

On March 22, the Chinese Government placed a ban on all Canadian canola imports, with both Viterra Inc. and James Richardson International having their canola importing permits suspended for unspecified reasons.

According to the Canola Council, Canada produces 18 million tonnes annually — 10 per cent of which is exported. Approximately 40 per cent of Canadian exports go to China.

Mussell said farmers will need to rotate to different crops.

“This would increase the supply of wheat and other grains at a time when China is drawing down its supply of rice, which will lower the demand for imported feed grains.”

Jay Schultz, co-owner of a 7,000-acre Alberta grain farm, said the Canadian grain sector is in for a rough ride.

“Normally markets are driven by fundamentals, charts, supply and demand — now it might be politics,” he said.

“Right now, we should be locking in new crop pricing for harvest,” he said. “And we haven’t signed futures contracts for next year yet – something we normally do.”

Schultz explained that many farmers have already purchased seed, equipment and chemicals.

“It’s hard to change at this point,” he said.

Mussell’s assessment of the 2019 growing season was in line with Schultz’s.

“Farmers are getting their machines ready for seeding,” he said. “But how are they supposed to know what seeds to plant? What should they expect for fall prices? Who is buying?”

Representing the solvency ratio of a hypothetical plan, Mercer Canada’s index sat at 106 per cent on March 31, up from 102 per cent at the start of the year. The median solvency ratio of Mercer clients’ pension plans was 97 per cent on March 31, up from 95 per cent at the end of 2018. It also found almost one out of every two Canadian pension plans was fully funded and less than five per cent are below 80 per cent funded on a solvency basis.

During the first quarter, double-digit equity market returns went a long way to reviving the funded position of pension plans, according to Mercer Canada.

“Although many pension plans ended Q1 2019 at or close to a fully funded state, the volatility over the last few months has spooked plan sponsors and served as a reminder of how fleeting a fully funded position can be,” said Andrew Whale, principal in Mercer Canada’s financial strategy group, in a release. “Rather than sit tight, many view the sudden drop and immediate recovery as a catalyst to take action and right-size the risk held in the plan.”

A typical balanced pension portfolio would have risen by nine per cent during the first quarter of 2019, noted the release. The quarter saw the S&P/TSX composite index post a 13.3 per cent return, gaining back losses posted at the beginning of the year.

Canadian fixed income markets improved over the quarter, as well, with long-term bonds (6.9 per cent) outperforming universe bonds (3.9 per cent). Real-return bonds (5.1 per cent) also rose.

“Although global financial markets are more settled than they were in the fourth quarter, investors still remain wary amid slowing economic growth in the global economy,” said Todd Nelson, partner at Mercer Canada. “This economic softening combined with political uncertainty saw central banks slow their tightening path from 2018.”

Aon’s latest survey also found a similar rebound in the median solvency ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2019, at 98.5 per cent.

“The first quarter was very good for pension asset returns, particularly coming on the heels of a year that most institutional investors would rather forget,” said Calum Mackenzie, partner and head of investment in Canada for Aon, in a release. “Domestic and global equity markets rallied, while the volatility that marked the fourth quarter of 2018 receded. The question is, what now? Bond yields are falling and a flattening yield curve is signalling caution for economic and market conditions going forward.”

That trend, he noted, may not only raise pension plan liabilities, but also lower expected risk-asset returns through the year. “Market volatility is unlikely to stay missing in action for long, given continuing uncertainty over developed-market monetary policy, global economic growth and political risk.

“While the first quarter in 2019 was positive, many plan sponsors continue to be complacent and play the waiting game.”

The issues the NDP have brought up in relation to Kenney through their attack ads are valid and important. We should be concerned about a party leader who has a track record of pushing for anti-abortion legislation and challenging the idea of same-sex rights. But we also need to be looking deeper into actual political issues facing us, which often transcend party lines due to their systemic nature.



When attack ads draw our attention away from issues and towards individuals, we get sucked into discursive spirals that can put blinders on our political outlooks. I will freely admit I’m no fan of Kenney, but I’m also no fan of Rachel Notely and her uncritical push for pipelines in the face of a global climate crisis.

TOM BRENNER/The New York Times News Service

A lot has happened since Canada and its neighbours reached a deal for the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade, but one thing has not happened – no country has ratified the agreement yet. And Canadian companies with cross-border interests have had to live with the uncertainty that creates.

“There’s definitely some concern that it won’t get ratified,” says Matthew Stewart, director of economics for the Conference Board of Canada.

“There are a bunch of moving parts to this, and they’re all interrelated,” says Jesse Goldman, partner in international trade and investment at Borden Ladner Gervais (BLG) law firm in Toronto.

Story continues below advertisement

USMCA was agreed to informally on Sept. 30, 2018, after tough and often acrimonious negotiations that began in mid-2017. The agreement was signed last November by all three countries, but it does not take effect until it is ratified, which none has done.

Experts say it is still likely that the agreement will be ratified eventually, but there are political and economic stumbling blocks. Each country has its reasons for taking its time.

The biggest impediment is the continuation of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on steel and aluminum imports to the United States.

The President used a controversial clause dealing with national security, commonly called Section 232, to slap tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminum from Canada and Mexico. Canada and Mexico say these tariffs are illegal.

Mexico’s new government under socialist reformer Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has indicated that it will not even look at ratifying USMCA until its congress reconvenes Sept. 1. Even then, Mexico says it will not ratify until the steel and aluminum tariffs have been lifted.

Canada is equally unhappy, with Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland saying on March 25 after meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, “The existence of these tariffs for many Canadians raises some serious questions” about ratification. Transport Minister Marc Garneau has said that the tariffs are “a serious impediment to us moving forward on what is the best trade deal in the world.”

The U.S. Congress is not in much of a hurry to ratify, either. “There are hurdles to overcome,” says Brian Kingston, vice-president, policy, international and fiscal at the Business Council of Canada.

Mr. Kingston, who recently visited legislators on Capitol Hill, says that, in addition to the tariffs holding up ratification in Mexico and possibly Canada, there are obstacles in Washington, too.

The most high-profile roadblock is concern among members of the new Democratic-majority House of Representatives that the labour and environmental provisions in USMCA are not strong enough to bring about the change they seek.

“They want Mexico to implement labour reforms and they want more enforceability on the environmental commitments [in the agreement],” he says.

“They also have concern with biologics. The U.S. got Mexico and Canada to agree to a higher level of data protection than under NAFTA.” The North American free-trade agreement, which precedes the USMCA, is still in force, until the new deal is ratified.

USMCA shields new biologic drugs from competing cheaper generic drugs for at least 10 years, up from the current protection of eight years in Canada and five in Mexico. But some Democrats in Congress want to lower the threshold to seven years, so cheaper generics can get to market faster.

There is also the general idea in Congress that there’s no need to rush. “I think the Democrats don’t want to just hand Trump a victory,” Mr. Stewart says.

This go-slow approach might be exacerbated now that the report by special counsel Robert Mueller has been tabled and appears to remove the allegation that Mr. Trump colluded with the Russians before his 2016 presidential election. The Mueller report’s conclusions and the President’s statement that he has been “completely exonerated” puts the Democrats in a position where it might be even more difficult to hand the Trump administration a win.

Tariffs are a drag on the Canadian economy because the United States is our largest export market for steel, and our steel represents nearly 17 per cent of U.S. steel imports, Mr. Stewart says. Canada also provides the United States with about half of its annual aluminum needs.

The U.S. economy is roaring, so Canadian exports there continue to be strong. A stumbling block is that the United States has proposed to end tariffs by replacing them with quotas limiting the amount of steel and aluminum Canada can export there.

“You can’t agree to that in a business, limiting how much business you can do,” Mr. Kingston says.

While NAFTA remains in effect until USMCA is ratified, Mr. Trump has threatened to “tear up” the earlier agreement, which would have North American trade revert to bilateral and other trade rules that existed before a continent-wide deal.

Tariffs and the question of which trade rules are operative are less a problem than the lingering uncertainty over when and if USMCA will get ratified, says David Detomasi, associate professor of international business at Queen’s University’s Smith School of Business in Kingston.

“The actual impact of tariffs themselves is not the worst. It’s the symbolism, the idea that trade relations might be getting worse,” Dr. Detomasi says.

“They may not sign until the stars are all aligned,” Dr. Detomasi warns. But that’s not the end of the world either, he says.

“My guess is that for now it will be business as usual under the old agreement. One thing people tend to not notice about trade is that it’s often made out to be a bigger deal than it really is,” he says.

“People think free trade is some kind of magic elixir but it’s not true. Free trade makes life easier in a lot of ways, but there are still tariffs on a lot of goods and services and the world’s not going to end.”",Lack of USMCA ratification a nail biter for Canadian businesses,The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-lack-of-usmca-ratification-a-nail-biter-for-canadian-businesses/
386,Business,2019-04-02T20:06:00.0000000Z,"“In Canada, the political pendulum is starting to swing towards a more pro-business outlook with right-of-centre governments now elected in five of ten provinces (up from two in early 2016), with further movement possible or even likely in the Alberta ...","Look for slower growth but higher equity valuations in the year ahead, say investment bankers GMP Securities, who on Tuesday released their Best Ideas for the upcoming 12 months, including tech sector names ATS Automation (ATS Automation Stock Quote, Chart TSX:ATA), Descartes Systems (Descartes Systems Stock Quote, Chart TSX:DSG), Enghouse Systems (Enghouse Systems Stock Quote, Chart TSX:ENGH) and Stingray Group (Stingray Group Stock Quote, Chart TSX:RAY.A).

With 2019’s first quarter rounding out, investors are concerned about slowing global growth, but GMP says there’s room for optimism.

“We continue to think the market will climb a wall of worry and new highs are likely this year in both Canada and the US. A slowing of growth in the US towards 2 per cent supports our scenario of monetary policy stability, an extended slow growth cycle, and higher equity valuations,” GMP says.

“In Canada, the political pendulum is starting to swing towards a more pro-business outlook with right-of-centre governments now elected in five of ten provinces (up from two in early 2016), with further movement possible or even likely in the Alberta provincial election in April and the federal election in October. Any progress towards an improved investment climate generally and pipeline construction in particular should prompt a catch up rally in the S&P/TSX, which has badly lagged the S&P 500 in recent years,” they write.

Analyst Justin Keywood reiterates his “Buy” recommendation and $27.00 target price for ATS Automation, saying the factory automation company should do well in a climate of increasing pricing pressure, rising wages and low unemployment, all of which are drivers for greater automation.

“We see ATS as entering a new phase of evolution as it approaches $1 billion in backlog and integrates recent acquisitions. This is not without challenges but as a whole, we see ATS as executing well on the secular strength of automation, leading to a much greater share price this year,” says Keywood.

The analyst notes that ATS could be in for some M&A activity as it has a balance sheet with over $600 million to support new deals. His $27.00 target represents a projected return of 37 per cent. (All return rates are as of time of publication.)

Logistics and supply-chain management company Descartes gets the nod from analyst Deepak Kaushal, who sees good growth opportunity and higher relative profitability coming from Descartes new data content services and analytics. DSG has climbed a long way over the past three months but Kaushal says there’s room for more upside.

“While the steady rise in share price has increased valuation risk, we are comfortable with Descartes’ growth prospects and the strength of the company’s proven growth-by-acquisition business model,” says Kaushal.

The analyst is maintaining his “Buy” rating with the raised target of $59.00 (previously $52.00), which represents a projected 12-month return of 21 per cent.

Enghouse Systems made headlines last week with an announced agreement to buy Espial Group in an all-cash offer of $56.5 million, a deal which Kaushal says gives ENGH a strong fourth pillar to its current markets.

Kaushal rates Enghouse a “Buy” with a $43.00 target, representing a projected return of 28 per cent.

“ENGH stock has pulled back from recent highs and so too has valuation. We believe this offers an attractive entry point. Our $43.00 target is based on 18x F2020 EBITDA vs peers at 20x. We continue to believe ENGH can maintain a high multiple given its track record for cash-accretive M&A,” says Kaushal.

Finally, media and entertainment company Stingray Digital gets the nod, with Kaushal pointing to the more than 35 acquisitions and 33 per cent annual growth rate since 2007 as proof of Stingray’s ability to drive growth both organically and accretively.

“We see Stingray as a successful growth-by-acquisition company that is rolling up the long tail of the music industry to drive accretive cash flow growth. We believe Stingray can sustain high growth, profitability and shareholder returns via continued acquisitions and strong organic growth,” says Kaushal.

Wild Rose Country. Land of Living Skies. Friendly Manitoba. Yours to Discover. Je me Souviens. Canada’s Ocean Playground. Birthplace of Confederation. Klondike. The shape of an actual polar bear.

What do these licence plate slogans — and shapes — have in common? They all show a desire to embrace what is best about their region of this country, its beauty, its possibilities. They all show a need to demonstrate the glories of the Canadian landscape, the importance of our history, and to invite others to experience those things. Like most American states, Canadians choose slogans to represent us at our best, and to celebrate the extraordinary natural world we live in.

Open for Business, proposes Doug Ford. Well, that’s somewhat less soothing. But it is the newest change being offered up by Ontario’s Conservative government, in an earnest attempt to make Ontario sound like the grubby edge of town where all the steel plants are.

There is competing nattering going on right now about whether he intended it just for commercial plates and not passenger vehicles, but quite frankly, with this administration’s record of talking out of both sides of its mouth, what they say now will probably have no resemblance to what they ultimately do. They’ve sent up a weather balloon, again, to see if people will have an aversion to having “Open for Business” stamped across their butt.

In fact, as I write this, the government has admitted passenger plates will indeed be changed, too, but they haven’t told us to what. I heard “For the People” being kicked around, and wanted to kick something around myself. That would mean a province that, in a single year, will see marijuana come off the black market as licence plates go on one. This government had better think long and hard — something they don’t appear functionally able to do — about slapping political branding across every driver, considering most of us didn’t vote for him.

As a woman, I foresee some challenges. Even if they force this on commercial vehicles only, women drive vehicles with commercial plates and “Open for Business” is an invitation to crass comments that, while never welcome, are now even less so.

When my sister had her first car, we got her vanity plates for Christmas. This was 37 years ago, when the plates were first offered. She loved them — though my father, upon spying his daughter’s name with “Yours to Discover” beneath it, was less than amused. But he understood when it was chosen, vanity plates were not in existence. The province had just changed its slogan from “Keep it Beautiful”, something he would have been far more on board with.

Open for Business. It’s dull, leaden, and uninspired. It’s like naming a cat Fluffy or a hamster Hammy. I mean, it’ll do, but it’s boring. I’m not getting any kind of vibe that would make me want to find, say, the extraordinary Great Lakes that are in Ontario — especially Superior, which is the deepest, of course. We have the world’s longest freshwater beach at Wasaga, and national parks that are world class. From Toronto’s towering glass buildings to the CN Tower, majestic rock faces scattered through our endless north, a crazy great bird in Wawa, tiny hamlets, historic sites, a province saturated in history and stunning in geography.

Open for Business. Thud.

Idaho plates say “Great Potatoes”, and I love it. New Hampshire gets right to the point with “Live Free or Die”, something that always makes me raise an eyebrow as a helmetless motorcyclist blasts by. Virginia used to be for history lovers, but then they got bold and omitted the word, “history”. The District of Columbia is the only place that displays a protest on every plate: “Taxation Without Representation”, a reminder that they pay taxes but have no vote in Congress. Americans, like Canadians, make the most of that little space running across the bottom of the plates, frequently changing it up, but always hewing to the wonder and beauty of where they live, displaying pride in what matters most to them.

Open for Business. If we held a contest, this wouldn’t win. This wouldn’t win in any state or province in North America. In a single line, just a handful of words, you are literally displaying the message you want to send about an entire province and represent the best of it. This is not a place for political parties to park their slogans. Every slogan for a licence plate that is chosen has a history to it. A backstory.

For one, Advanz’s operational headquarters is located in London. That’s because Britain ...","Britain’s decision to exit the European Union (EU) will forever change the economic and social landscape of the country. Two years after the public referendum was completed, there is still little clarity over the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the bloc of 27 EU nations.

As we enter the end-game of these negotiations, it is apparent that the impact of the exit will be felt across the globe. The UK is, after all, Canada’s third largest trading partner after China and the US. Commonwealth trade agreements enhance this relationship further. It’s fair to say that some Canadian businesses will suffer should the divorce turn messy.

One such business is Mississauga-based pharmaceutical company Advanz Pharma Corp (TSX:ADVZ). Formerly known as Concordia Healthcare Corp, Advanz develops, acquires, or licenses niche established medicines and markets them in over 90 countries.

The company’s portfolio of medical products include 200 niche generic and branded medicines for endocrinology, ophthalmology, urology, anti-infectives, pain management, central nervous system disorders and intensive care treatment.

While the company is well-diversified geographically and commercially, its core operations are significantly exposed to British politics and economics. For one, Advanz’s operational headquarters is located in London. That’s because Britain is a key market for the company’s products.

According to their latest filing – “ADVANZ PHARMA International has significant operations within the U.K. and other parts of the EU.”

In fact, the company states that Britain is the largest pharmaceutical market in Europe. The country’s demographics, regulatory environment, intrinsic demand for off-patent medicines, and steady population growth make it an essential market for the Advanz’s operations.

The vast majority of Advanz’s sales last year were international. In 2018, sales across North America accounted for only 25% of the total. While the company doesn’t break out sales by regions, there is reason to believe sales in the UK account for a significant portion of the total.

In its latest filing, the company said that “market share erosion in the UK market,” was a primary reason for a US$79 million decrease in revenue last year. This decline was partially offset by a US$17 million increase in revenue as a result of the Great British Pound (GBP) strengthening against the United States Dollar (USD) in the first half of 2018.

In fact, the company’s GBP hedging strategy yielded $29 million in other comprehensive income’ in 2018 and lost $50 million in 2017. In other words, the hedging strategy alone accounted for roughly 8% of the company’s gross profit last year.

Finally, the company’s sales and profits have been steadily declining since 2016, right after the referendum.

It is currently undergoing a corporate reorganization that changes the business structure substantially, so I’m not sure what the company’s core prospects are over the long-term. However, the stock seems like an ideal short-term bet on the Brexit outcome over the next few months.

Bottom line

Advanz Pharma is a multinational pharmaceutical company that is overexposed to the UK market. For traders willing to bet on the outcome of Brexit negotiations and the value of the pound over the next few months, ADVZ may be an ideal proxy.

Although your playlists are probably packed with Canadian indie giants like Metric, Broken Social Scene, or Mac DeMarco, there are so many outstanding up-and-coming indie artists you’ve got to check out that are sure to offer up unique, dynamic sounds you’ve never heard before.

From Valley to Ellevator, check out some Canadian up-and-coming artists you need to take a listen to below.



Valley

Toronto indie band VALLEY are full of timeless, anthemic tunes packed with full instrumentals and catchy pop bangers. The up-and-coming foursome was created by two bands who accidentally got double-booked for studio time, when they decided to use it to collaborate, eventually becoming the refreshing and engaging new band that Toronto knows and loves. Each of their tracks portray the band’s distinct sound while maintaining their upbeat, dynamic energy.



Jane’s Party

Toronto-based pop-rock quartet Jane’s Party are a genre-blending band stacked with a repertoire of anthemic hits and shimmering, yet dark singles. With hooky lyrics, catchy melodies, and bouncy, driven instrumental lines, you won’t be able to take this band off repeat. Their recent album Casual Island explores themes of politics, relationships, technology, and the complexity of human nature, all atop elaborate, yet accessible melodies.



Ellevator

Hamilton-based indie outfit Ellevator aim to capture the immediacy and rush of listening to music through their meticulous and elaborate pop tunes. Frontwoman Nabi Sue Bersche creates raw, vulnerable lyrics that come layered atop catchy indie pop melodies, making for intimate, yet accessible electronic hits. Ellevator’s music frequently explores “finding the person underneath all the noise and learning to live with them, even if I don’t always like them,” Bersche explains in a statement.



Dizzy

Oshawa dream-pop band Dizzy creates lush, elaborate, and texturally complex tunes that pack in soulful vocals, intoxicating instrumentals, and mesmerizing melodies that are sure to stick with you. “Oshawa is dense. We all grew up in modern suburbia so there’s an arm’s length between my neighbour’s house and mine,” frontwoman Katie Munshaw explains. “Making music always stemmed from my being overly sensitive about everything, so when you’re that close to so many people you’re bound to meet the essential characters that screw you up enough to start writing about them. Oshawa introduced me to friendship and heartache and change while keeping me bored enough to sit at home and write about it.”



Ten Kills The Pack

Ten Kills the Pack is the moniker of Mississauga folk singer-songwriter Sean Sroka, who finds influences from outstanding artists like Stan Rogers, Bob Dylan, Laura Marling, and The National. With raspy, throaty vocals and soft, yet powerful instrumental lines, Ten Kills the Pack creates poetic, impactful tunes that will resonate with you time and time again. Sroka created his tunes “for every late night bar dweller, every person unsure about their ‘path’ and for every introspective human being overanalyzing their life choices.”



Dead Soft

This British Columbia band needs to be on your radar, with their playful grunge punk anthems. Four years after the release of their debut album, Dead Soft have returned with a powerful grunge-pop EP called New Emotion. Lyrically, Dead Soft explores dark, unsettling themes of gloom alongside bright, renewing choruses. The record is all about new beginnings, with a tighter, more refined and distilled sound based on strategic harmonies and creative guitar riffs.



Basement Revolver

Canadian indie rock trio Basement Revolver packs intimate stories from songwriter Chrisy Hurn’s past through 90’s infused dream pop. Hurn’s vulnerability shines through on their poignant, resounding tracks as she sings blunt lyrics like, “My friends all tell me to hope for the best but I feel the worst/ I try to get sleep but my body won’t stop shaking/ I’m blue.” The Hamilton band released Heavy Eyes in 2018, which explores the feelings that come with growing up atop a shoegaze melody.



Loony

Rapidly ascending artist Loony creates her signature soulful swinging and swaying tracks through unique rhymes that are intricately woven together into strong vocal harmonies. Loony’s blunt, vulnerable honesty comes through her music, making for an authentic sense of connection. “I feel like it’s so easy to see how others are fucking up, but it’s so much more interesting to turn the lens inward and see the ways that you yourself can be lost, wrong, or even toxic,” Loony reveals of her single “Overnight” in a statement.



Ice Cream

Toronto electronic post-punk duo Ice Cream through their unique blend of manipulated synthesizers, groovy bass guitars, and catchy drum machines. Their almost dystopian tunes look to the future, while staying linked to the past through soulful instrumentals and moody, strong melodies. Band members Carlyn Bezic and Amanda Crist have distinctive vocal lines that blend together perfectly for a bleak, yet intimate sound full of catchy hooks.



Cleopatrick

Hard-hitting Toronto alt-rock duo Cleopatrick consists of life-long best friends Luke Gruntz and Ian Fraser, who have translated their connection into unified voice of anthemic rock. The young pair have yet again shown the city that you don’t need an expansive backing band to create a sound to be reckoned with, as they perform cleverly constructed indie rock tunes with provocative riffs and compelling breakdowns.

Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott had already resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet citing their concerns over the SNC-Lavalin affair, the BBC reported.

Now they have been expelled from Trudeau’s Liberal Party, months before a general election.

The SNC-Lavalin controversy has cast a shadow over Trudeau’s leadership.

Andrew Scheer, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, said on Tuesday that the Prime Minister had betrayed justice by removing two corruption whistleblowers.

Trudeau repeatedly spoke about the breakdown of trust between Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and members of his staff.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Trudeau told the media shortly after informing his caucus.

“If they can’t honestly say they have confidence in this team… then they cannot be part of this team.”

Philpott has been vocal about her concerns with the government, and gave an interview in a national magazine last month in which she said “there’s much more to the story that needs to be told”.

Trudeau said his decision was sparked by the revelation that Wilson-Raybould had secretly recorded a conversation she had with Canada’s former top bureaucrat, which she released publicly on Friday.

Wilson-Raybould said the tapes backed up her claim that government officials inappropriately pressured her to shield SNC-Lavalin from prosecution.

The Canadian firm is accused of bribing officials in Libya to win contracts under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime.

SNC-Lavalin has openly lobbied for an agreement that would allow it to avoid prosecution and instead face alternative penalties or measures, such as a fine.

Wilson-Raybould said members of Trudeau’s inner circle pressured her to cut a deal, and when she did not, she was removed from her position as Justice Minister.

Trudeau has repeatedly denied that there was any wrongdoing by him or his officials.

The political controversy, which has been dragging on for weeks, has caused Trudeau’s popularity drop sharply in opinion polls a few months before a general election.

He said he is expelling the women from the caucus to put an end to infighting, which he had vowed to stop when he was elected in 2014.

In the United States, Canada has become shorthand for “a more sane place to live” in the exasperated vernacular of the left. It’s most often evoked in the phrase “if this certain happens, I’m moving to Canada.” And “this certain thing” can be literally anything to do with a victory on the right, depending on the mood of the left-leaning American using the phrase, but the best amongst us at least try to reserve it for instances of, say, Donald Trump being elected to the office of the president.

Keep in mind that this is typically uttered by the same people who for the last several years thought a parade of sure-things was going to save us from our sad little tyrant, from the Supreme Court to the Mueller investigation. So the feeling is, well, nothing in my country can save me from this awful thing, so I guess I’ll count on another country to save me from this awful thing.

My feeling is that Canada doesn’t need that responsibility. Canada has its own problems to deal with, forget about throngs of whiney American liberals packing the borders and swearing they’ll learn more about hockey, really. And holding a nation on a pedestal because you perceive it as “nice” — well, that’s not an entirely nice way to treat any country. You should love Canada on its own terms, and not because you’re convinced it’s a better catch than what you currently have.

Besides, Canada has had its own issues with immigrants in the past. And white supremacy in general.

All this came to mind as I was reading Christie Pits, which recounts a riot in Toronto in 1933 that erupted between 10,000 people. Sparked a group of Nazi supporters called the Pit Gang when they began to harass Jewish and Italian immigrants following a baseball game, the scene turned into a battle royale of improvised weaponry that lasted for six hours and resulted in, among other things, the mayor of Toronto banning the swastika.

But as portrayed by Michaels and Pedrau, this was no sudden conflict and, in fact, the weeks of local enmity between the groups that had been building was etched in hostility through history and across the globe. One part of the air that humans breathed seemed to contain some level of anti-Semitism and in Toronto in 1933, it coalesced into a physical manifestation of mass violence. And so it was always there, in North America, years before World War II, it was not acknowledged by the people breathing it in. Like the sun and the moon and the oceans, it was just something that was there, accepted as natural.

Michaels’ script walks a thin line of non-fiction and dramatization, meticulously crafted from research but shaped in such a way to bring the events alive. Following a group of young Jewish men in the neighborhood at the time, enthused by baseball and boxing, talking politics, pining for cute girls, and doing their best to evade the hostility of local Nazi lovers, Michaels presents a reality where conversation always returns to the place of Jews in the world and in history, and how those connections have direct relevance in their own family lines.

We are taken outside the neighborhood also, shown how the neighborhood came to be by watching events unfold in the Ukraine, 30 years before, as young lives were disrupted by hate and murder, and they fled west to give their future children a chance to live the lives that were seized from them. But we are also taken to other cultural areas, most notably the classroom, where historical anti-Semitism is traced angrily through centuries of so-called classic literature that students are required to read. This reality is dismissed by the professor, who has been breathing it in all his life and cannot see it.

The real challenge the creators faced with Christie Pits was to transform all this into a readable, engaging drama, rather than a fact-driven historical examination of anti-Semitism in western culture or a recounting of local bloodshed caused by anti-Semitism. That’s achieved by creating a living, breathing community, electric in both its tensions and excitement, with much time spent on spirited debate between the characters, and also teasing, arguing, pleading, the real human drama that springs forth from struggle and strips down wider political issues into clunky human ones that compete for attention with romance and fun. Life, even during struggle, is a full spectrum, and it’s the passion of that wide range that keeps people going beyond the hard parts.

These days, too many of these old struggles and hates have been revealed to have not gone away after all, so Christie Pits is a helpful reminder of that hateful thread, and an examination of what a community requires to overcome it.

In 1956, Japanese doctors first noticed Minamata disease, the affliction that is destroying the people of Grassy Narrows. Despite the repressive, state-colluding culture of Japanese industry, by 1968, the Chisso Corporation had been forced, by public pressure and citizen activism, to stop dumping mercury into Minimata Bay, poisoning shellfish and fish eaten by the people of Minamata City.

In other words, more than half a century has gone by since the story of corporate mercury-poisoning of a population played out on the global stage. Before I was 10 years old, the story of Minamata had become a touring stage play, which I watched in the early 1980s at the Vancouver Children’s Festival.

It goes without saying that—as with the fracked gas, bitumen, sulphur, and chemical waste we dump into Indigenous people’s drinking water throughout the petro-belt from Chetwynd to Llodyminster—we did not become aware of the adverse consequences of poisoning First Nations’ water through industrial activity after starting our mining projects; we knew of the consequences before we even began planning the projects, before any shovel hit soil.

This, of course, fits into the larger program of poisoning Indigenous Canadians through inferior reserve water systems that pipe nonpotable, dangerous poison into residents’ homes from coast to coast. When placed in context with the water systems of black-majority communities in Michigan like Flint, Dearborn, and Detroit, it seems almost as though when a group of racialized people in North America cease to be a necessary part of a regional labour force, we simply pipe poisoned water into their homes to kill them.

But that is not the scandal that has horrified Canadians. The systematic poisoning and murder of a racialized rural underclass is not news. It is the business of Canada, not just within our borders but in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, et cetera.

This, in other words, is not our Minamata scandal. Nobody is saying “How could we let this company do this to Canadians?”

We do not even construct that question because Canada’s white settler state nationalism does not include the people of Grassy Narrows in the way Cold War Japanese nationalism included the people of Minamata.

So what has scandalized Canadians about last week’s confrontation between our prime minister and the woman who witnessed against his government’s callous indifference to the poisoning of her people?

Etiquette. The failure of etiquette.

The problem, for Canadians, is the way Justin Trudeau deported himself when confronted.

Opposition politicians and media opinion leaders have decried Trudeau’s “sarcasm”, “callousness”, and “dismissal” of the protester’s concerns. They have spent no time decrying the disability and premature deaths of dozens of Indigenous people, the thing to which the protester sought to direct the nation’s attention.

The framing of our national debate goes to the heart of the Canadian colonial project and of our theory of civic nationalism. More than almost any other state on Earth, Canada is a liberal state, one in which the authority to govern is linked to the embodiment of the culture of the haute bourgeoisie, the upper middle class.

The fairy tale that best expresses this is ""The Princess and the Pea"". A young woman, switched at birth, is unaware that she is heir to a European throne. People question her legitimacy and the justice of her inheriting the throne. So, she is tested by placing a single dried pea under her mattress.

The consequence is that she cannot sleep and tosses and turns all night. But does not complain. The bed is padded more and more by those seeking to show she is not a princess. But she continues to feel the pea and she continues to stoically endure this fate until she is universally recognized as heir to the throne.

This story embodies the essence of the liberal project and the culture of the class leading it. The princess embodies self-control, the most important bourgeois value. This self-control functions as a form of merit, of deservedness. The fact that she has inherited it and it is in her blood is in no way contradictory of it also functioning as a meritocratic qualification.

In this way, hereditary privilege and merit are fused into a single thing. But the princess also embodies the other bourgeois value: sensitivity. There is no more haute bourgeois act than the well-timed stifling of tears, the fusion of two other contradictory values: sensitivity and self-control.

Video of Bedtime Stories for Kids - Episode 28: Princess and the Pea Video: The Princess and the Pea.

In a liberal Canada, one must understand that the tearful public apology and the territorial acknowledgement are not countervailing forces mobilized against colonialism; they are the justifying discourse of colonialism itself.

“Are you apologizing [to former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould], Mr. Trudeau?” the prime minister was asked after sacking our nation’s first Indigenous justice minister for failing to give special treatment to his friends.

“I will be making an Inuit apology [in Iqaluit] later today,” he responded.

That is because we have tied our sense of entitlement to keep stealing Indigenous land, abducting Indigenous kids, and just flat out murdering Indigenous people by poison, by cop and by poverty, to our embodiment of restraint and sensitivity.

In other words, etiquette, the body of knowledge that distinguishes the haute bourgeoisie from the other classes.

That is how we give unemployed Indigenous parents $175 per month to look after their kids and then, when the kids appear to be suffering from the effects of colonialism and poverty, we abduct them and pay foster parents $750 per month to do the same job.

We explain that, unlike our racist ancestors, we don’t want to hurt Indigenous kids. We care about them. We care about them so much that we are prepared to rescue them from the cycle of poverty, colonialism, and intergenerational trauma.

Liberal Canada is freaking out right now because Trudeau’s mask has been torn; our mask has been torn.

When we see Trudeau smirking as he “thanks” the protester for her donation as she is violently ejected from the room by uniformed thugs, it is as though we have caught our own reflection in the mirror at a particularly unflattering angle.

Trudeau has revealed himself as fundamentally no different than the conservative bullies like Doug Ford who challenge Canada’s liberal state project by proudly embodying the cruel swagger, arbitrary violence, and misanthropy the liberal project seeks to conceal.

What offends us are not children convulsing in hospital beds in Thunder Bay; it is the glimpse in the face of our prime minister of who we really are.","Stuart Parker: The prince, the pea, and the mercury—Justin Trudeau's politics of poisoning and politeness",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1221901/stuart-parker-prince-pea-and-mercury-justin-trudeaus-politics-poisoning-and-politeness

by Morgan Lowrie April 1, 2019by Morgan Lowrie

MONTREAL – Last September, Hans Laroche embarked on an unusual teaching assignment. He and a few thousand fellow Quebecers were enlisted to help Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa learn the finer points of Canadian French, from the distinctive accent to so-called “joual” expressions and the linguistic mishmash known as “Franglais.”

With Amazon’s official release of its French Canadian language option for Alexa on March 21, the results are now available for all to hear.

Because Alexa’s algorithm requires a great deal of data, Laroche says he and his fellow testers were given a free Echo device and asked to interact with it on a regular basis by asking it questions, getting it to perform household tasks or using it to play music, audiobooks or news. Every week or two, they were asked to provide feedback to developers, who worked to further refine the algorithm and its language capabilities.

Laroche, who runs a Facebook page for Quebec Alexa enthusiasts from his home near Victoriaville, Que., said he was impressed with how well the device picked up on his requests.

“It was pretty surprising the things Alexa can understand, especially in Canadian French,” he said. “The French language from France has been available for a while, but it’s not the same as the language Quebecers use.”

As an example, he said Quebecers tend to use English verbs such as “check” or “cancel” rather than their French counterparts, “verifier” or “annuler.”

“If Alexa is in (European) French and I ask it to ‘cancel le timer,’ it won’t understand,” he said. “But if I’m in Canadian French and I say it, it will understand what I’m saying.”

Laroche noted that Amazon still has some catching up to do, since competitors such as Google Assistant already have French Canadian language support.

Nicolas Maynard, the man in charge of Alexa in Canada, said teaching the virtual assistant to understand French was a difficult challenge, due to the complexity of the language and the prevalence of homonyms, contractions, and a vocabulary that differs widely by region.

Adapting it to a French-Canadian audience meant ensuring it would understand commands delivered using local colloquialisms and pronunciations, he said in a phone interview from Seattle.

Maynard said that while French speakers in France use as many, or possibly more, English words than their North American linguistic counterparts, the inflection is very different.

“The pronunciation of English words in Quebec is much closer to the English pronunciation than in France,” said Maynard.

“If you ask a French person to say the name of an American song, you’ll clearly hear the French accent. But if you ask a Canadian (francophone), you’ll get a pronunciation that is very close to English.”

But while Alexa may understand local slang, its own voice was given an accent designed to be as neutral as possible while still being that of a Quebecer.

“I think it’s more or less a Montreal accent, but you’ll tell me,” Maynard said.

He said it was also important to ensure the voice service is equipped with general knowledge from each region by being able to answer basic questions about politics and culture.

As a result, Alexa can recite the poem “Le vaisseau d’or” by celebrated Quebec writer Emile Nelligan, and has a repertoire of jokes to tell on demand.

Laroche said he has noted a lot of improvement in this department since he first began interacting with the device.

“If you ask who is Montreal’s mayor, who is the prime minister of Canada, it knows the answer, which was not the case in the beginning,” he said.

He says the voice assistant is still not perfect, however, and there are still many times when it answers a question with “Je ne sais pas” (I don’t know.) But he’s still pleased to have a product that will start his coffee maker in the morning and turn on the equipment in his home gym when he announces he’s ready for a workout.

Guillaume Dufour, the founder of enthusiast group Alexa Quebec, was also an early user of the experimental “beta” version.

He was impressed with Alexa’s ability to understand mixed-language commands, such as when he asks it in French to play an English-language song. He said the virtual assistant understands his normal accent perfectly, although he sometimes has to repeat himself when he tries out the stronger accent of his native Charlevoix region.

“We can see that Amazon’s language recognition training was excellent,” said Dufour, an IT expert and programmer who also creates “skills” for the devices.

And he would know, having amassed an impressive collection of voice-activated assistants including four Echo devices, a Google Home, Apple HomePod and a Harman Kardon Invoke.

Dufour said he has noticed only one true “glitch” – the device sometimes delivers the weather report in a jumble of English and French – but he has found that some of Alexa’s jokes are told “in a slightly jerky intonation that does not quite follow the rhythm of the French language.”

As for Maynard, he said Alexa’s education is far from complete.

He won’t say how many Quebecers are currently using Echo or other Alexa devices, but he says the virtual assistant’s artificial intelligence-driven algorithm will continue to absorb new data and refine its capabilities the more it is used.

“I see the launch as just the beginning of my job,” he said.","Bonjour, Alexa! How a virtual assistant learned to speak Canadian French",Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/business-intelligence/bonjour-alexa-how-a-virtual-assistant-learned-to-speak-canadian-french/

Similarly, removal of travel advisory for Pakistan will also enable Canadian traders to travel and avail the existing profit making opportunities.","OTTAWA, Canada: Pakistan’s High Commissioner Raza Bashir Tarar met the Canada-Pakistan Friendship Group at the Canadian House of Commons in Ottawa to brief them on host of issues including travel advisory against travel to Pakistan and high rate of visa refusal to Pakistani students and traders.

The High Commissioner briefed the Friendship Group on improved security situation in the Country and the priority areas of the new government to introduce structural reforms in the key sectors and institution-building. He also highlighted FDI friendly policies available in the automobile, energy, telecom, manufacturing and tourism industry in Pakistan, from which Canadian companies can benefit.

The High Commissioner said that as Canada pursues a path to diversifying its partnerships, Pakistan is one of the emerging economies in Asia offering tremendous opportunities. Pakistan seeks reviving the full spectrum relations in political, trade, investment and development fields with Canada, he added.

Raza Bashir Tarar also informed the Parliamentarians that the existing trade relations between the two countries need to be given boost and allowing genuine traders to visit Canada to meet with their counterparts can provide required impetus to trade relations between the two countries. Similarly, removal of travel advisory for Pakistan will also enable Canadian traders to travel and avail the existing profit making opportunities.

The High Commissioner also took up the issue of high rate of visa refusal for Pakistani students and stressed that the visa processing center should be moved back to Islamabad, as done by other western countries, in view of the improved security situation. Raza Bashir Tarar added that it will allow the Canadian immigration officials to ascertain the credentials of the visa applicants etc.

The Co-Chair of Canada-Pakistan Friendship Group Rob Oliphant briefed the High Commissioner on their endeavours to promote friendship between the parliamentarians of the two countries. He said that Canada recognizes economic importance of Pakistan and appointment of new trade commissioner will help business community to increase trade. He assured the High Commissioner that the Parliamentary Group will take up the issue of visas for students and traders with Immigration department and of removal of travel advisory with the concerned department. He informed that with the group’s efforts Islamabad has been excluded from travel advisory and more cities will be placed in that category. He also discussed the future roadmap for bringing together the two people.

Most Canadians can expect ... shown itself capable of burning up all the political oxygen in Ottawa. Almost certainly, Scheer and his allies will shrug at the findings of the ...","Government scientists have produced a new report on climate change in Canada, and it's beyond grim. The details trigger thoughts of hoarding and maybe selling the house and moving to higher ground. To a millennial, the findings should inspire naked fear.

Among other things, the report, which is scheduled to be released Tuesday, says:

Canada's climate has been warming at roughly twice the rate of the rest of the world. In Northern Canada, it's even higher.

And, says the report, there is simply no doubt about the cause. Climate change-skeptic conservatives will, of course, disagree, but here is what the scientists say:

""Canada's climate has warmed and will warm further in the future, driven by human influence. Both past and future warming in Canada is, on average, about double the magnitude of global warming.""

Our climate is not warming consistently. It is most pronounced in the Prairies and British Columbia, and especially severe in northern B.C. The effects are strongest in winter.

It is effectively irreversible. The antidote prescribed in the report is politically impossible, at least right now: ""Scenarios with limited warming will only occur if Canada and the rest of the world reduce carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century.""

The scientists predict an eventual increase in ""annual average country-wide temperature"" of about two degrees Celsius, a rate that will remain steady after mid-century. They say the increase could be as severe as six degrees.

Jason Franson/Canadian Press More

The oceans around Canada have become more acidic and less oxygenated. Future warming will be heaviest in ice-free waters of the Canadian arctic. Most Canadians can expect coastal flooding to increase during their lifetimes.

Warming of the oceans, in particular, is a truly vicious circle. According to the report:

""Ocean warming and loss of oxygen will intensify with further emissions of all greenhouse gases, whereas ocean acidification will increase in response to additional carbon dioxide emissions. These changes threaten the health of marine ecosystems.""

In other words, worse begets even worse, begets disaster.

Canada is experiencing hotter extreme heat and less cold extreme cold. Permafrost is warming. There is less ice and snow.

Rainfall is increasing, although less so in the summer months. As warming continues, Canada (of all places) will likely face freshwater shortages.

Those are just the highlights. The main takeaway: if climate change worldwide is much more frightening and immediate than we all thought, as the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported six months ago, it's at least twice as bad in Canada.

Twice. As. Bad.

To the Trudeau government, this is core-mission stuff. Last week, scientists from the environment department were brought in to the Prime Minister's Office for briefings. The report will be public and online Tuesday, and Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet will be pushing the issue as something bordering on a national emergency, which is not an unreasonable way to characterize it.

Normally, you'd think findings like these would penetrate deep into voters' minds. Climate change, with reports like this one and that of the IPCC last October, is becoming an issue of economic self-interest.

SNC-Lavalin scandal

But these are not normal times. The Opposition is determined to keep public attention riveted on the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's remarkably effective effort to take down the prime minister.

That's not to say the new report won't generate headlines, but they will not be as politically explosive as, say, Wilson-Raybould's secretly recorded conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, which she submitted to the Commons justice committee last week. Over the weekend, at a ceremony in her honour in British Columbia, Wilson-Raybould signalled her determination to keep the story alive, and to continue speaking ""her truth."" Tory leader Andrew Scheer is equally determined to assist her.

Probably not coincidentally, the report is also landing at exactly the same time as a new carbon tax (the government wants to call it ""a price on pollution"") lands in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick, increasing the price of fuel by about four cents a litre at the pump.

Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has expelled his ex-attorney general and another former minister from the Liberal Party, months before a general election is held in the country.

Citing repeated questioning of his leadership, Mr Trudeau also said it was ”unconscionable” that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould had publicised a secretly recorded conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant.

Jane Philpott, a former cabinet minister who stepped down from her role after she said she lost confidence in how the government has handled the affair, was also kicked out of the party.

Both had remained as members of Mr Trudeau’s party in the country’s parliament after resigning but kept making remarks that damaged the prime minister and the party.

“The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,” Mr Trudeau told the media shortly after informing his caucus about the expulsions.

He added that they could not be part of his team “if they can’t honestly say they have confidence in this team”.

The pair were high-profile female ministers in Mr Trudeau’s cabinet, half of which are women. Ms Wilson-Raybould was Canada’s first indigenous justice minister.

Ms Wilson-Raybould tweeted that Mr Trudeau had removed her and she will not be a Liberal candidate in autumn’s election.

“What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party,” she wrote. “I have no regrets. I spoke truth as I will continue to do.”

She has previously claimed that she was demoted from her role as attorney general and justice minister to veterans’ affairs minister in January because she refused to give in to pressure to enter into a remediation agreement with a Canadian company accused of bribing officials in Libya.

Had it been criminally prosecuted, engineering giant SNC-Lavalin would have been prevented from receiving any federal government business for a decade.

The company which has 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide, has openly lobbied for an agreement that would allow it to avoid prosecution and instead face alternative penalties or measures, like a fine.

Ms Wilson-Raybould claimed members of Mr Trudeau’s inner circle pressured her to cut a deal, and when she refused, she was removed from her position as justice minister.

The scandal has led to multiple resignations, including Gerry Butts, Mr Trudeau’s top aide and best friend. And it has damaged the party.

In a letter released before her expulsion, Ms Wilson-Raybould pleaded with her colleagues to remain and acknowledged they are enraged but said she was “trying to help protect the prime minister and the government from a horrible mess”.

She said: “I know many of you are angry, hurt, and frustrated. And frankly so am I, and I can only speak for myself. I am angry, hurt, and frustrated because I feel and believe I was upholding the values that we all committed to.”

What I can say is that I hold my head high & that I can look myself in the mirror knowing I did what I was required to do and what needed to be done based on principles & values that must always transcend party. I have no regrets. I spoke the truth as I will continue to do. (2/2) — Jody Wilson-Raybould (@Puglaas) April 2, 2019

Mr Trudeau has been under pressure as a result of the scandal.

The secret recording Ms Wilson-Raybould made public features Mr Wernick telling Ms Wilson-Raybould that Mr Trudeau “is determined, quite firm” in finding a way to avoid a prosecution that could put 9,000 jobs at risk.

Ms Wilson-Raybould can be heard saying she regards the pressure as “inappropriate”.

Ms Philpott said neither she nor Ms Wilson-Raybould initiated the crisis now facing Mr Trudeau and the party.

“Rather than acknowledge the obvious – that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former attorney general in relation to a prosecutorial decision – and apologise for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious – to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould’s credibility and attempt to blame her,” Ms Philpott said in posting on social media.

“That approach now appears to be focused on whether Jody Wilson-Raybould should have audiotaped the clerk instead of the circumstances that prompted Jody Wilson-Raybould to feel compelled to do so.”

Renee Merrifield Wasylyk and I meet on a brisk Saturday afternoon. She’s at home, so it’s not the power-suit-clad executive with that signature red lipstick who greets me; it’s a relaxed, makeup free, softer version of Renee who pours two glasses of VQA and invites me to her kitchen table.

This is home base for a busy, blended family of eight: Renee, her fiance Carlos, the five (mostly grown) children between them that come and go, and the adorable hound, Winston.

I let Renee know my intention is not to write an article about her political aspirations, but as we talk and the conversation flows freely, I realize her passion for being a voice and bringing people together at the family, business and political levels is truly who she is at her core. We can’t “not” talk about it.

“Honestly, I love it. I don’t love politicking, politics or shenanigans, but I love democracy,” she says, leaning forward in her chair. “I love the conversation, contrary ideas that have to be shared in order to figure out the consensus.”

Renee is seeking the Conservative nomination in the federal riding of Kelowna-Lake Country. She doesn’t see herself as a politician; she prefers the word conduit.

“I am simply someone who can get people to the table. I’m not the one doing anything other than putting the pieces together.”

Renee has been putting pieces together and asking the big questions since she was a child.

“At eight years old I asked my dad why there were no female presidents and he told me, ‘honey, you can be the first female president of the United States of America.’” She chuckles at the memory, adding that this could never be the case as a Canadian citizen; however, the seed was planted.

“If I look back, that was one of the two moments in my life that told me it’s okay to be a change-maker.”

The other inspiration came from a Rabbi professor at Concordia University. (Renee holds a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies and a Master of Theology)

“He said, ‘Renee, God is so big, He is not afraid of your questions, but also don’t be afraid when He asks you to change the world.’”

Renee has been enacting change, most notably on the Kelowna development scene, since she started Troika Developments in 1998. Based on her degrees and first career job as a Celebrative Arts Ministry Associate at Trinity Baptist Church, development wasn’t the obvious choice. It became a necessary choice as Renee faced the reality of financially supporting a young and growing family.

“I started working for a developer. I negotiated a land assembly. Then I started my own consultation business. It was the school of hard knocks, just learning on the go.”

After just two and a half years of consulting on land assemblies, acquisitions, permits and contracts for other developers, Renee was ready to launch Troika — and she most definitely made waves.

“When I launched, I had three projects. A 56-unit townhome development, a 44-unit apartment block and a mixed-use commercial site that I launched all at once,” she says, shaking her head. “I would never do it like that again, but it really put me on the map. Other developers where like, ‘Who is she? Who does she think she is?’”

Renee says “she” is simply someone who listened to people who knew more than her; someone who accepted help when it was offered and someone who still lives by those principles today.

“I remember being overwhelmed by the kindness. If I was doing it wrong, they’d say, ‘Renee, you should do it this way.’ My network became my teachers and I still look at it that way.”

With 21 years in business under her belt and many business accolades, including Entrepreneur of the Year – Pacific Region, Most Influential Business Woman of the Year – BC, and two appearances on Canada’s list of the Top 100 Most Powerful Woman, Renee is ready to step into a new role.

“When [Conservative Party Leader] Andrew Scheer came and asked me to run, that to me was an invitation to the table. So now I have an invitation to be able to affect change and that’s a pretty powerful invitation. I will also get to bring my community to a greater standing on the national stage. Who wouldn’t want to do that?”

As of press time, no date for the Conservative nomination has been set, but Renee is actively talking to the people in her community as if she’s already representing them and loving every minute of it.

“Should I win the nomination, and you don’t do this because you think you’re going to lose” she adds, “I want to make sure the right people are part of the conversation. I’m meeting all these farmers, for example. My mind is blown — they have incredible stories and incredible knowledge. They should be at the table telling their story and allowing me to make it easier to build our economy with their businesses.”

Renee’s family supports her decision to pursue the nomination. She smiles from ear to ear when I bring up her children. I wonder aloud what someone who expects so much of herself might expect from her kids.

“I have high expectations for them, but I’m not proud of them when they achieve something. I’m proud of them when they work hard, when they put in effort. I’m proud of them because of what they give to what they care about.”

When it comes to pride, Renee’s fiance, Carlos, is brimming with it. The importance of that support is not lost on her.

“That is sometimes a difficult thing for a man to be, but when you find the man who is happy to be your champion, cheerleader, lover and friend — you hold on to him tightly and you will do the same for him.”

Carlos appears as if on cue. Our time is almost up as Renee has another function to attend. As I swallow the last of my wine and feel grateful that I am going home to enjoy a quiet night “in,” Renee seems just as enthusiastic about her night “out.” An opportunity to meet more people, to listen as they share their stories and — as that cherished Rabbi professor told her all those years ago — to accept a role that may one day “change the world.”",Troikia’s Renee Merrifield Wasylyk Considers A Move To The Political Arena,haidagwaiiobserver.com,https://www.haidagwaiiobserver.com/life/troikias-renee-merrifield-wasylyk-considers-a-move-to-the-political-arena/

The Canadian Border Service Agency’s Migration Detention Centre Is Set to Open by 2021

While the world reacted in horror to the Trump administration’s widespread use of detention and child separations as a deterrent to asylum seekers on its southern border last year, Canada has been quietly employing similar practices for quite some time.

While a new legislation tabled by the Coalition Avenir Québec government could put many migrants and asylum seekers in a furthered state of legal precarity here in Quebec, there is a new migrant detention facility is scheduled to be opened in 2021. The facility is being constructed in Laval by the Canada Border Services Agency.

The cavernous lobby of the Guy-Favreau complex on René-Lévesque Blvd. is familiar to anyone who has had to navigate the complicated, costly, and often opaque Canadian immigration process. In the Service Canada offices located there, posters of smiling, helpful faces loom over migrant hopefuls as they wait in line to submit their forms and documentation.

This is the national identity that Canada wants to project to the world: We are multicultural, inclusive, and tolerant—a tapestry of the intertwined experiences of our ancestors, who fled forgotten hardships and prejudices now somewhat extinguished by the passage of time.

We tend to consider ourselves a little kinder, gentler, and more sensible than our southern neighbours. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said to CNN in 2016, “The fact is, Canadians understand that immigration, that people fleeing for their lives, that people wanting to build a better life for themselves and their kids is what created Canada.”

Every year thousands of migrants end up indefinitely incarcerated within a network of detention facilities and prisons strewn across the country, often after having been detained without criminal charges or a trial. Some have remained incarcerated in a state of legal limbo for years on end.

During the 2016-2017 fiscal year, 6,251 migrants in Canada were detained and spent a total of 131,617 days in detention, according to CBSA statistics. These numbers are not an anomaly. Nearly 36,000 people have been detained between 2012 and 2017. At least 16 migrants have died in detention in Canada since the year 2000.

Child separation and the detention of minors, though not as widespread as in the U.S., are not unheard of.

According to 2017 CBSA statistics, the most recent ones available, 66 minors were detained in a currently existing detention centre running out of Laval. 31 minors were also housed there, meaning they had no grounds for detention but remained with parents to prevent family separations.

“In the exceptional cases where a minor’s parent [or] legal guardian may be subject to detention, the CBSA will work with the parent or legal guardian and child welfare authorities to assess [the] best interests of the child and the best way forward,” said CBSA spokesperson Jayden Robertson.

This often forces parents to either subject their child to incarceration at their side, or to surrender them to foster care.

Take the case of Glory Anawa, brought to light by the CBC, who was attempting to claim refugee status in Canada on the grounds that she was fleeing forced female circumcision in her home village in Cameroon. When she arrived, a few months pregnant, at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport in 2013, her claim was denied and she was put in detention.

Her son, Alpha Anawa, came into the world at a detention centre. Alpha’s first words were “radio check,” the phrase used by their guards to signal a shift change in the centre in which they were forced to live. Anawa remained there for nearly three years before being deported back to Cameroon.

Stories like that of her and her son are not unusual. Last year in Canada, an average of 333 people sat in detention every day.

Within the past few years, there have been a series of detainee hunger strikes and detainee deaths—along with pressure from support networks outside the centres—that forced the then-incoming Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale to address the state of the migrant detention system in 2016.

“In my first few months as minister responsible for CBSA, I have certainly heard the concerns about immigration detention, and I’ve studied those concerns with great care,” Goodale told the CBC. “The government is anxious to address the weaknesses that exist and to do better.”

In response to deteriorating conditions and overcrowding in detention facilities, the Liberal government launched the National Immigration Detention Framework. The NIDF’s goals are, “To create a better, fairer immigration detention system that supports the humane and dignified treatment of individuals while protecting public safety” through greater transparency and improved “risk assessment” of detainees.

The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states migrants to Canada should only be detained after all alternatives to detention have been explored and when grounds for detention exist, primarily if the person poses a flight risk or is a danger to the public.

$138 million in federal funding over a period of five years was earmarked to meet NIDF objectives. The money will go towards improvements to immigration holding centres and the increased implementation of “alternatives to detention” technologies, including the use of electronic monitors and biometric voice-recognition check-in systems.

But the majority of the budget is going to the construction of two new dedicated detention centres, one of which is currently under construction in Laval.

Sam Hoffman is a spokesperson for Ni Frontières, Ni Prisons, an organization dedicated to halting the construction of the new Laval centre. The group has started targeting the companies involved in the construction process, in an attempt to dissuade them from participating.

They started with the Montreal-based architectural firm Lemay, who have won over $5 million in contracts to design the Laval facility, along with the Quebec City based architecture Group A.

“Lemay is profiting off of putting migrants into prison by designing a new migrant prison for the federal government,” said Hoffman.

The blueprints for the Laval site mention that, “The general design principle is to use long life cycle materials in interesting ways, to bring a human scale to otherwise unforgiving environments.”

“Heavy timber or engineering wood will be used throughout in order to showcase a warm and homey feeling.”

Since people in detention centres aren’t charged under the criminal code, but on immigration grounds, Robertson mentioned the new centre is not a prison.

“It is a facility built to accommodate individuals whose risk level necessitates CBSA surveillance, in order to ensure the agency is able to effectively carry out its mandate.”

But critics like Hoffman feel the facility’s designs betray the underlying character of the NIDF budget, which he characterized as an expensive, disingenuous redirection which achieves only incremental change while attempting to divert public attention away from the larger issue of migrant detention itself.

“It doesn’t matter how nice you make a prison. Migrant detention just shouldn’t be happening,” said Hoffman. “The government is hoping that it can succeed in masking this violence, both of the prison itself, but also of the deportation process that it is subjecting these people to.”

Lemay declined to comment on their role in the project based on conditions set by what Lemay Spokesperson Annie Gagnier described as “their contractual agreement with their client.”

“The design of the CBSA immigration holding centres were undertaken in a manner that ensures Canada’s alignment with international obligations and standards for immigration detention,” said Robertson. “It is premised on the basis that immigration detention is administrative in nature and not punitive.”

But whether a deportee is placed in an administrative or punitive holding cell before being ejected from Canada, Hoffman pointed out that migration is often driven by uncontrollable circumstances like war, poverty and persecution. Migrants deported to their countries of origin can return to the difficult or dangerous circumstances that drove them to leave in the first place.

“If my grandparents had come to this country with these kinds of policies in place, they would have been hunted down by the CBSA, thrown into a migrant prison, and then deported back to Europe to probably die at the hands of anti-Semitism,” said Hoffman. “The fact that this is happening today and no-one seems to think that it’s a problem is atrocious.”

“If my grandparents had come to this country with these kinds of policies in place, they would have been hunted down by the CBSA, thrown into a migrant prison, and then deported back to Europe to probably die at the hands of anti-Semitism.”

Raúl came to Canada from Cuba. A pseudonym has been granted to protect him and his family from persecution.

“I’m here in Canada under a refugee protection claim,” Raúl told The Link. “I’ve been here for a year and a half. It’s kind of hard, honestly, because I have no idea how my future is going to be.”

The last major battle of the Cuban Revolution was fought in 1958 in Santa Clara, Raúl’s home town. The revolution, in its infancy, strived to improve the quality of life for Cuba’s poorest through land redistribution and a wave of progressive social reforms.

But after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Cuba entered what Fidel Castro dubbed a “Special Period in a Time of Peace.” During that period, Cuba was suddenly deprived of crucial economic aid from the U.S.S.R. and plunged into grave economic crisis characterized by scarcity, fuel shortages, and starvation, which lasted for years and marred the psyche of an entire generation.

“At that time I was a teenager,” Raúl said. “My parents had a really hard time feeding us. One of my brothers suffered from malnutrition. There’s a lot of things that aren’t nice to talk about, but this was my experience. It was a bad time.”

While the economic situation in Cuba has marginally improved since then, most Cubans, who survive on rations and an average wage of $25 USD a month, still struggle to get by.

“The main problem is food,” Raúl said.

Long-standing U.S.-led sanctions have also exacerbated Cuba’s economic woes, pushing the island nation to the brink of collapse. The recent crisis in Venezuela, a key economic partner of Cuba, has threatened to further destabilize the Cuban economy, which depends heavily on economic assistance from the oil-rich nation.

Raúl said his situation is further complicated by the repressive nature of the Cuban political system and its utilization of state employment as leverage to force compliance to authoritarian censorship laws and practices.

“I used to have a band,” Raúl explained, “We wrote some lyrics about problems in society and with the government, and obviously that is not allowed. The first problem I had was that I lost my job. Nobody told me it was for this reason, but I know it was. I was then informed by the government that my mother, who is a lawyer and works for them, could have problems at her job too. This is normal in Cuba.”

Today, Raúl is living in Quebec and has applied for permanent residency. So far, he said he has no news regarding the outcome of his case.

But the recent announcement of new legislation which could cause his application to be thrown out has caused Raúl to worry about his future here. That new legislation is Bill 9, the CAQ’s proposed amendment to the Quebec Immigration Act.

The bill, tabled on Feb. 7, calls for sweeping changes to provincial immigration policy. Immigrants would undergo a mandatory test to prove that their values align with the province’s and demonstrate their proficiency in French. The bill also states that any application submitted through the Regular Skilled Worker Program prior to Aug. 2, 2018 will be voided.

The bill also stipulates that the roughly 18,000 applicants still awaiting a resolution of their cases, will subsequently be reimbursed for their application fees, at a total cost of $19 million to the province.

These applicants would then have to re-apply for their Quebec selection certificate under new, more restrictive criteria, through a new system which Quebec’s Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette described as the “Tinder of immigration” likening it to the popular dating app.

“After all of this happening, it’s a big concern that’s always in my mind,” Raúl told The Link. “If you try to leave Cuba, they know. You leave everything behind. If I have to go back, I go back to a country where I have nothing.”

Raúl is not alone in his concern. The application purge would apply not only to the 18,000 main applicants, but their families as well, ultimately affecting over 50,000 people currently awaiting processing.

While Legault proposed slashing immigration levels by 20 per cent, he recently clarified, “We’d take more French people, and Europeans as well,” while speaking to Le Devoir during a visit to France earlier this year.

“We do not want to keep too many people who do not accept our language [and] our values,” Legault later added in an interview with Radio-Canada.

Bill 9 has been critiqued as being nationalist and exclusive, granting the party praise by far-right anti-immigrant group La Meute, whom CAQ leader François Legault has tried to distance himself from. The CAQ’s immigration policies have also won acceptance by France’s Le front national leader Marine Le Pen.

Bill 9 has faced significant pushback, both in Quebec and in Ottawa. An injunction filed by the Association québécoise des avocats et avocates en droit de l’immigration has ensured the application purge will stay on hold until the bill has cleared the review process in the National Assembly and is signed into law.

The federal government shut down the tests and conditions proposed by Bill 9, saying it overstepped Quebec’s jurisdiction within the federal immigration system.

Meanwhile, the 2019 federal budget, tabled by the Liberals on March 19, has allocated an additional $1.18 billion to be spent over the next five years to expedite the apprehension, processing, detention, and deportation of irregular asylum seekers arriving from the U.S., whose numbers spiked in 2018 in response to the Trump administration.

For the time being, Raúl tries to stay positive. “If I get denied again, it’s back to Cuba I guess. Then I try to save money, go back and try to survive as best I can.”

Wow, you might think. What a score for a bedroom in a shared house in East Vancouver. Or maybe a holiday flight to Toronto. $760. If you’re the type, maybe a fancy pair of shoes?

$760 is a lot of things, and sometimes it’s a lot of money. Except when it is literally everything you have to survive on in a month.

$760 is the latest amount that a single person receiving income assistance will get each month in British Columbia. This is after a decade of rates being frozen under the previous government and the first increase since an initial boost in September 2017.

Please show me a single place in the Lower Mainland where you can rent a one-bedroom or even bachelor suite for $760 a month, let alone the designated “shelter rate” portion of $375.

So often, the group I work with, Raise the Rates BC, encounters the misguided belief that being in poverty means you just need to budget better or pull up your bootstraps and get a job.

But when the total amount of money you have to live on leaves no room for adequate food, clothing, shelter, transit, hygienic care, a visit to the dentist or a cell phone (to look for that job you’re supposed to be trying to find), no amount of budgeting or individualized effort makes getting off of welfare possible.

And of course, that’s assuming you’re able to access income supports in the first place, considering the ominously long application.

The thing that really got me mad after the B.C. government’s 2019 budget and in the recent reveal of the province’s first-ever poverty reduction “strategy” is how overwhelmingly clear it is that there is loads of room for a far more significant increase to income assistance.

Every time the government announces a healthy surplus, it feels like salt in the wound: “Look at all the things we did, and we still have money to spare.” Meanwhile, those on income assistance continue to face severe deprivation and legislated poverty.

That $760 a month is what we call “deep poverty,” and many of the nearly 190,000 people surviving on income assistance in B.C. live deeply below the poverty line. Federally, the poverty line is measured at the “Market Basket Measure” of around $1,600/month for a single person. $760 is less than half that amount.

The obvious question is, “but why?” Why doesn’t the government understand the depths of poverty in which it is keeping people? Why don’t they do something to help, if the money is so obviously there?

According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives calculations (which echo similar numbers from the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction), it would cost a mere $365 million to raise everyone receiving income assistance (welfare and disability) to 75 per cent of the poverty line. It would cost $1.16 billion to raise everyone to that poverty line.

This is a fraction of the subsidies promised to, for example, the liquefied natural gas industry. It’s around one per cent of the GDP of our wealthy province.

There is an answer to this rhetorical question, “but why?”

For all the talk and show of the “TogetherBC” poverty reduction plan, decades of austerity politics under a neoliberal system ensures that the government still refuses to see the poorest people and people with disabilities as worthy, of support or even part of our society.

It’s because of the stigma we carry in our middle- to upper-class hearts about poverty: that it’s an individual’s fault and therefore an individual’s responsibility. If you can’t work, you don’t have worth.

It’s because in our so-called democratic system, minority governments focus mostly on staying in power and refuse to plan for long-term, sustainable benefits to our society.

I want to challenge the government and all of the ministers to prove me wrong. Show me not just that you understand that ending deep poverty benefits all of society (for the $8 to 9 billion that is saved in reduced strains on the system, and for the proven benefits of a more equal society), but that you will take action.

Do something about that $760 per month. Act like this is the crisis it is, and take action beyond incremental steps. The money is there, so show me, and the 190,000 people on income assistance that you truly believe people on welfare are human beings who deserve to live in dignity.","BC Is Thriving, Yet Our Most Marginalized Remain in Deep Poverty",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2019/03/29/Fair-Income-Assistance-Poverty-BC/

The review comes after a company insider told CBC News the engineering giant secured billions in loans from the Crown agency over the years, some of which he alleges was intended to pay bribes.

If true, it could mean taxpayers have unwittingly backed illegal payments.

Export Development Canada is a federal agency that provides financing and insurance to Canadian businesses operating abroad.

The insider, who worked on several large projects funded by EDC, claims it was an ""open secret"" within SNC-Lavalin that ""technical fees"" listed in budget proposals included cash to be used as bribes to secure international contracts.

Those line items could total millions of dollars. The insider says EDC's internal due diligence policies should have detected something was going on.

He says ""technical fees"" were part of a larger ""lexicon of bribes"" used within SNC-Lavalin.

EDC has denied knowledge of any improper payments, but last Friday said it is taking a closer look at a 2011 deal with SNC-Lavalin involving a $250-million project to refurbish the Matala hydroelectric dam in Angola. EDC provided the Quebec-based company with ""political risk insurance"" for the project.

""We would never, under any circumstances, knowingly participate in a transaction tainted by bribery or corruption,"" David Bhamjee, EDC's vice-president of corporate communications, wrote in an email.

""This behaviour goes against EDC's core values and deep-rooted culture of business integrity.""

The SNC-Lavalin insider's allegations come as a political storm rages over accusations Prime Minister Justin Trudeau replaced his attorney general for refusing to intervene and spare the company a criminal prosecution on fraud and corruption charges.

CBC News has agreed not to identify the insider because he fears losing his job.

He says EDC support was vital for the success of construction projects in underdeveloped parts of the world known for corruption. The projects included airports, power plants and dams, and the EDC loans to SNC-Lavalin ranged from a few million dollars to upward of $500 million.

The insider alleges that, prior to 2012 — when the head of SNC-Lavalin's construction division was arrested in Switzerland for bribery in Libya — EDC was funding numerous projects that featured ""slush funds.""

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, appearing at the Commons justice committee on Feb. 27, says she resisted pressure from the Prime Minister's Office to intervene in the fraud and corruption case against SNC-Lavalin and spare the Quebec-based engineering firm a potentially damaging prosecution. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

He says the problems with the technical fees should have been caught by EDC auditors for two reasons. First, he says, they were listed as Canadian expenses, but a portion flowed to consultants or ""agents"" on the ground in foreign countries to help the company win contracts.

The second red flag, he says, should have been the sheer size of the technical fees, which could total as much as 10 per cent of a project's overall budget.

""That's a lot of steak dinners,"" the source quipped.

In 2013, CBC News and the Globe and Mail exposed a similar scheme inside SNC-Lavalin. Some budgets included items called ""project consultancy costs"" or ""PCCs."" The code was used to mask secret payments for projects in Africa, India, Cambodia and Kazakhstan.

SNC-Lavalin admitted to CBC News those PCC payments were ""improper,"" and in 2015, paid a $1.5-million penalty to resolve allegations it bribed public officials to win road projects in Uganda and Mozambique that were funded by the African Development Bank.

None of the projects tied to PCC payments was funded by EDC.

Angola dam project under review

EDC insists that if it learns its funding is being used for bribes or corruption, it cancels the deal.

The Angola dam project first came under scrutiny in 2013, when an SNC-Lavalin employee fired from the job filed a lawsuit claiming the company had covertly paid a 10 per cent commission to win the contract.

SNC-Lavalin settled the suit out of court. It is unclear what steps, if any, EDC took to examine the deal at the time.

The insider recalls there was tension within SNC-Lavalin because numerous bribery scandals involving the company had made headlines.

""There was a lot of breath-holding,"" he said. ""Some of the projects that were investigated … were projects overseas that were financed by EDC.

""If it had been [exposed publicly], at that time, that a bribe had been paid, EDC would have been obliged never to allow SNC-Lavalin to have access to export credit funds.""

EDC announced last week it will now review its role in the Angola project, after receiving questions from CBC News. The agency says based on that review, it could expand its probe to look at other past agreements with SNC-Lavalin.

In the past, SNC-Lavalin has blamed rogue employees for problems with the Angola project. This week, the company declined to answer a list of questions about its use of technical fees on other EDC-backed projects.

'Increasingly concerned'

EDC says it conducts due diligence and that ""technical fees and agent fees are common and legitimate operational expenses.""

""We also appreciate that they can be used as one of many mechanisms to hide illegal or improper payments,"" Bhamjee wrote. ""Those who want to conceal payments take great pains to do so, making these payments extremely difficult to uncover.""

However, EDC says it did not begin scrutinizing these types of fees until 2006, when the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development issued a warning about their potential abuse.

""We remain confident that the processes we undertook throughout our financing history with the company were sound and adhered to best practices of the day,"" wrote EDC spokesperson Jessica Draker.

Over the past 25 years, EDC has provided as much as $4.7 billion in loans to SNC-Lavalin for ventures in Europe, Africa and Latin America, making the company one of the largest recipients of taxpayer-backed loans.

EDC concedes it was slow to suspend funding for new SNC-Lavalin projects, which it did from late 2014 until 2017, as the company faced multiple scandals.

The World Bank sounded an alarm in 2012 over allegations SNC-Lavalin tried to bribe officials in Bangladesh. It has banned the company from bidding on World Bank projects until 2023.

""In the years leading up to our suspension, we became increasingly concerned about the myriad allegations facing the company,"" said EDC's David Bhamjee, noting EDC did beef up monitoring of SNC-Lavalin deals.

""We could have — and perhaps should have — suspended business earlier,"" he said.

EDC only resumed doing business with SNC-Lavalin in 2017, after the company overhauled its internal accounting and whistleblower policies, he said.

'Black box'

The head of Toronto-based watchdog group Probe International says if there's any truth to the allegations EDC money was used for bribes, it implicates all Canadians.

""[EDC] operates on the Queen's credit card,"" said Patricia Adams. ""That means that it operates on our credit cards.""

According to EDC's website the Crown agency operates at arm's length from government and is ""self-financing.""

However, Adams says all of its debts and liabilities are backed by the government.

""It doesn't exist but for the Canadian taxpayer.""

Adams says the public has very little idea of how the Crown agency operates.

""[It] is a secretive institution that sets its own rules and standards and regulates itself, with little public oversight,"" she said.

""They're a black box.""

One EDC-backed SNC-Lavalin project is currently under investigation by the RCMP.

The case dates back to the early 2000s. RCMP investigators believe SNC-Lavalin funnelled $2.3 million from a contract to build an airport hangar in Algeria to pay bribes in Canada, according to a search warrant issued last year.

Michel Fournier, the former head of Canada's Federal Bridge Corporation, which maintains several of the country's largest overpasses, has already pleaded guilty to accepting the money in exchange for helping SNC-Lavalin win a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge.

When asked about the ongoing RCMP probe, SNC-Lavalin replied: ""No comment.""

Canada has had a front-row seat in the SNC-Lavalin sausage factory for the past two months and it has distinctly spoiled our appetites. Starting with a leak, a narrative emerged that then-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould was under siege, holding out like the Alamo against an onslaught of attempts to persuade her that she should use her extraordinary powers as AG to change the already decided course of the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and allow them to enter into negotiations for a plea deal. The plea deal may be on terms more or less onerous than a roll of the dice on the outcome of a criminal trial, but it comes with the ability of SNC-Lavalin to keep bidding on Canadian contracts. A conviction would not. SNC-Lavalin is on trial for what was at one point systemic corporate corruption. Because of institutionalized bribery and kickbacks, they were banned by the World Bank from bidding on any of its contracts, and if convicted in Canada could face a similar 10-year ban here as well.

Well and good. The prime minister, his office and various other departments thought a deal was in the best interests of Canada, investors (including Quebec pension funds), employees, and would be generally popular in Quebec. Except the independent prosecutor in the attorney general’s office said no deal. The AG backed her prosecutors and said that was the end of it — prosecutorial independence, cornerstone of our justice system. Except it wasn’t. The government pressed, pleaded and argued. Some experts say that is acceptable, as long as the final decision remains with the attorney general. Others are stricter and say no means no. Trudeau and others pressed on and the AG said their attempts at persuasion were unwelcome. Buzz off. It is an accepted rule that if an attorney general feels their independence has been compromised, they have to resign — immediately — usually with a short statement in the House of Commons as to why. The few times it has happened, it has been devastating to a government. But that didn’t happen here. Instead of a bombshell we’ve had a brush fire. The attorney general didn’t resign. At least not as attorney general. Someone else became attorney general, she was shuffled to another portfolio and after a month resigned. For two months there have been arguments, speeches, leaks, taped phone calls, tweets, hearings, statements and now expulsion from caucus.

So the question is, are we better off having seen the sausages being made? The SNC-Lavalins of the world come and go. Factories and companies close, leave or are put out of business. Life goes on, and whatever the outcome, we will survive, even if they don’t.

And depending on the gloss you put on it, either there was the breach of a fundamental principle of our rule of law by putting pressure on the AG in this one case, or it was a misunderstanding of a new law and where the line should be drawn between advocating and interference. The pundits, experts, politicians, media, and the denizens of Twitter and Facebook have been dealing, sometimes with limited success, with complex constitutional and legal issues, not to mention personalities and conflicting evidence. It’s not CSI: Ottawa — resolved in an hour with the guilty identified and all loose ends accounted for. Some of our highest principles of justice are under discussion, which is a good thing. If there is real problem, it should be exposed — although at present the original SNC-Lavalin prosecution decision stands, no cash has changed hands, and the former attorney general herself said nothing “illegal” happened. Transparency and faith that our institutions work the way they are supposed to is also a good thing, provided that at the end of the day that transparency is enlightening and doesn’t leave you more confused than ever. Or worse, leave you cynical and disgusted after digesting a lot of opinion and the slimmest diet of facts. Or erodes your faith in a system that works pretty well most of the time, even to the point where you give up. After all, no one can stand being fed a steady diet of sausage. Stephen Lautens is a lawyer, writer and political commentator on Twitter.

A federal agency that supports Canadian exporters through loans and insurance has retained legal counsel to review an insurance policy covering political risk it underwrote on SNC-Lavalin’s behalf in 2011.

On Wednesday, the CBC reported that an SNC-Lavalin employee who requested anonymity had alleged that portions of loans the engineering giant obtained from Export Development Canada were intended to pay bribes. The Crown corporation told The Globe on Wednesday that it hired the law firm Fasken to conduct the review on March 6 after learning the source alleged EDC had “turned a blind eye” to improper payments in connection with Angola’s Matala Dam.

“Our review is primarily focused on the steps EDC took during the transaction screening process for the Angola transaction to ensure that we did not do what the CBC’s unnamed source has alleged,” EDC spokeswoman Jessica Draker wrote in a response to questions.

It’s the latest twist in a commercial relationship stretching back decades. Between 2001 and the end of last year, SNC-Lavalin benefited from 18 EDC financings worth a combined value of between $2-billion and $4.3-billion. (EDC does not disclose precise values of the support it provides to companies.) Additionally, EDC has occasionally provided loan guarantees and political-risk insurance policies to the company’s benefit.

Data provided by EDC and analyzed by The Globe and Mail suggest SNC-Lavalin has been among the leading recipients of EDC financings over the past two decades.

Bribery allegations against SNC-Lavalin over its activities in Libya have been at the heart of recent political turmoil in Ottawa. Former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould told a parliamentary committee she came under pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office to defer the prosecution against the company in the Libya case.

The Matala Dam was one of several large hydroelectric dams damaged during Angola’s decades-long civil war. SNC-Lavalin won the contract to repair the dam and a bridge in 2010. The following year, EDC underwrote a political-risk insurance policy for Société Générale Canada worth an undisclosed value between $250-million and $500-million to support SNC-Lavalin’s “sale of engineering and procurement services” in connection with the dam’s rehabilitation. According to reports at the time, Société Générale provided an export loan of US$281-million to the Republic of Angola to finance the work; EDC’s insurance covered a portion of that loan.

That year, Angola ranked among the worst 20 of 183 countries on Transparency International’s ranking of perceived levels of public-sector corruption. Hydroelectric projects have long been regarded as particularly vulnerable to corruption. “Today, billions of development dollars are earmarked for large dams and associated project infrastructure in Africa,” noted a 2010 briefing by International Rivers, an NGO that focuses on large dam projects in developing countries. “Lucrative construction, power purchase and investment contracts can drive bribery and other corrupt business practices. The lack of transparency and limited legal enforcement to halt these practices allow shady deals to go forward.”

According to the CBC report, the anonymous source alleged EDC’s due diligence procedures should have detected problems with “technical fees” paid by SNC-Lavalin, some of which went to agents in foreign countries to win the contracts.

EDC said it would not knowingly participate in a transaction involving bribery. “We have a rigorous transaction screening/due diligence process” that meets or exceeds practices recommended by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the federal agency said, “but there are limits as to what it can reasonably detect.” EDC did not provide further details about the due diligence it had conducted on the transaction.

In 2011, news broke of an RCMP investigation into alleged corruption at SNC-Lavalin; the company faced numerous corruption-related allegations in the following years. EDC says it increased its monitoring of the company in 2012. Nevertheless, in 2013 and 2014, at a time when SNC-Lavalin had already been debarred by the World Bank for corruption-related infractions, EDC provided two financings that benefited SNC-Lavalin, each in an amount between $50-million and $100-million.

In late 2014, EDC suspended support to SNC-Lavalin. “We can appreciate that people will say that we didn’t act soon enough,” EDC said in a statement on Wednesday. “We don’t disagree with that view … we could have – and perhaps should have – suspended business earlier.”

EDC’s suspension remained in effect until spring of 2017, by which point the Crown corporation was satisfied with measures taken by SNC-Lavalin, including replacing the management team and board and introducing new compliance and ethics programs. Since then SNC-Lavalin has benefited from three additional EDC financings.

In response to questions from The Globe, Ms. Draker confirmed that SNC-Lavalin had not notified EDC of any improper payments in connection with the Matala insurance policy or any other EDC-financed projects.

“It’s important to note that this is not the first time that we have reviewed SNC-Lavalin and SNC-Lavalin-related files,” Ms. Draker wrote. “In fact, we have actively reviewed, as part of our due diligence processes, the company and various SNC transactions throughout our financing history.

“When allegations arose, we worked to understand them and take appropriate actions given the information available at the time.”

Daniela Pizzuto, spokeswoman for SNC-Lavalin, said the allegations about the way the company did business date to before 2012, when SNC-Lavalin was under different management. She declined to comment further.

The Crown corporation, which acts as a credit agency for Canadian firms looking to do business abroad, says it could widen its investigation to scrutinize other deals it struck over the years with the construction and engineering firm — likely worth several billion dollars combined.

A report by CBC News, based on allegations from an unnamed SNC-Lavalin insider, said it was well known within the company that “technical fees” in its proposals included cash earmarked for local consultants or agents to help the firm secure international contracts.

The source told the CBC that issues related to technical fees — which could amount to millions of dollars for a given project — should have been detected by EDC as it evaluated SNC-Lavalin’s applications.

The story comes with the beleaguered company at the heart of a political controversy that has engulfed the federal Liberal government for nearly two months. It has cost Prime Minister Justin Trudeau two senior cabinet ministers, his most trusted adviser and the country’s top public servant.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould maintains she was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office last fall to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided to proceed with a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya.

On Wednesday, SNC-Lavalin spokeswoman Daniela Pizzuto declined to comment on the CBC report, except to say in an email that the allegation in the story “dates back to prior to 2012.”

The company has argued elsewhere that despite past bad behaviour by some executives, it has cleaned house.

EDC has hired an outside lawyer to examine SNC-Lavalin’s contract to work on the Matala Dam in Angola. The agency provided the company with between $250 million and $500 million worth of “political risk insurance” for the deal.

The allegation was that EDC turned a blind eye to improper or illegal payments

A spokeswoman for the Crown agency said EDC would have never knowingly taken part in any transaction involving bribery or corruption.

“We made the decision to review the Angola matter immediately upon hearing about a new and serious allegation,” Jessica Draker wrote in an emailed statement.

“Specifically, the allegation was that EDC turned a blind eye to improper or illegal payments regarding the Angola project.”

The agency said it might expand the scope to examine other deals with SNC-Lavalin. Since 2002, EDC has provided as much as $4 billion in financing, including guarantees and insurance, to SNC-Lavalin for projects outside North America.

Draker said that, generally speaking, technical fees and agent fees are common, legitimate operational expenses.

But the justice department ...","OTTAWA—The Liberal government could invoke a “public interest” exception that would allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid a 10-year federal contract ban even if it is criminally convicted, according to a justice department memo. Yet the justice department advice, which had been requested by the Privy Council Office (PCO) but never delivered, says the reasons to grant such an exemption are “narrow.”

Justice Department deputy minister Nathalie Drouin prepares to appear before the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair, on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on March 6, 2019. Drouin wrote a five-page memo, dated Nov. 9, 2018, that outlined how SNC-Lavalin could avoid a 10-year federal contract ban if it is criminally convicted. The advice was requested by the Privy Council Office. ( Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

The five-page memo was written by Nathalie Drouin, Jody Wilson-Raybould’s former deputy minister, and is dated Nov. 9, 2018. It makes clear the option of a mediated settlement of the SNC-Lavalin corruption charges is one avenuue that would avoid the contracting ban because no conviction would be registered against the company. The government could also change its policy on contracting bans, or in certain “narrow” circumstances, invoke the public interest exception to continue doing business with the company. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not rule out a mediated agreement for the company. Asked if it was still on the table for his government, Trudeau replied, “That is entirely up to the attorney general.”

The justice department’s memo indicates there is also another option in law. It says that depending on the offence for which the company is convicted, it could be ineligible to bid on federal contracts for a period of up to 10 years “unless the government considered it possible and appropriate to invoke a public interest exception.” Marked “protected/solicitor client privilege,” it was quietly posted on the Commons justice committee website this week as the controversy over the Liberal government’s attempts to aid SNC-Lavalin culminated with Trudeau’s ouster of Wilson-Raybould and former cabinet Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus. The two women had already resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet over concerns the prime minister and his officials pressured Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a settlement in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. Trudeau acknowledged for the first time in the Commons that he did hear Wilson-Raybould’s first early warning to him on Sept. 17. She has testified she looked him in the eye and asked “Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the attorney general? I would strongly advise against it.”

Asked directly by Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre if he heard her say that, Trudeau said in question period Wednesday, “once she said that, I responded no, I am not, it is her decision to make and she then committed to revisit and look into the decision once again.” Wilson-Raybould testified she told him that day her mind would not change. The prime minister, his former top aide Gerald Butts and former privy council clerk Michael Wernick have said they did not believe her decision was — or could be — final at that early stage, and that she ought to consider the fallout of a conviction on the company.

Drouin testified her officials drew up a memo on the topic after the Privy Council requested an opinion on what the possible consequences of a criminal conviction might be for the company. SNC-Lavalin still faces one count of fraud under the criminal code and one count of corruption under the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act. But the memo does not outline any of the evidence or indicate that the company is alleged to have bribed the Libyan regime of Moammar Gadhafi between 2001 and 2011.

Drouin said she never delivered the memo to Wernick at the instruction of Wilson-Raybould’s office. Drouin testified at the justice committee that “I knew my minister was not comfortable for us continuing those conversations. I felt I should test with her office before I shared the piece with the Privy Council Office, and I was instructed not to send it.” Wilson-Raybould testified she didn’t recall giving a specific instruction on the memo. But in her written brief last week she questioned why Wernick asked for the advice “in the first place having known I had already considered the matter and had decided not to intervene.” The memo essentially summarizes the general legal frameworks that cover the SNC-Lavalin case. The Star had requested the document last week, but was denied access because justice department officials said their analysis of whether it could be released was still underway. It says the biggest difference between a conviction and an outcome under the newly enacted legal regime that allows a deferred prosecution agreement or remediation agreement in cases like SNC-Lavalin’s is the “ineligibility” period during which a convicted company would be suspended from business with the federal government. “In other words, a conviction might lead to a period of ineligibility, but a remediation agreement would not,” she wrote. “Any period of suspension or debarment is likely to trigger adverse effects, such as foregone business opportunities, reputational damage, and possible reporting requirements to third parties, such as banks and other financial institutions that are the source of operating capital.” In the SNC-Lavalin case, the independent director of public prosecutions Kathleen Roussel declined as early as Sept. 4 — according to court documents — to enter negotiations with the company to mediate a settlement of the criminal trial. The company announced the prosecution decision to its shareholders and to the public on Oct. 10 and continued to aggressively lobby for a deferred prosecution agreement or DPA. A DPA could allow it to avoid being “debarred” from bidding on federal contracts for up to a decade as a result. Roussel gave formal notice of her decision to Wilson-Raybould on Sept. 4, when the former attorney general was out of the country at a conference, but Wilson-Raybould testified she provided a copy of that notice to the PMO in September, and in the Sept. 17 meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told him she would not overrule Roussel. Wernick said, in the now-infamously recorded phone call on Dec. 18 between the clerk and the former minister, that he was not aware she had shared Roussel’s notice with the PMO that he worried she and Trudeau were at loggerheads. He said the prime minister “was gonna find a way to get it done one way or another.” Trudeau told the Commons Wednesday, “I was not debriefed on that conversation between the clerk and the minister. I should have spoken directly with the minister. There was not an opportunity to do that.” Wilson-Raybould says she was finally replaced as attorney general for refusing to bend to what she called “inappropriate political pressure” by Trudeau and his officials to mediate a settlement for SNC-Lavalin. She later quit cabinet in February after the story went public and Trudeau denied pressuring her. Her replacement as justice minister and attorney general, David Lametti, says the option of a deferred prosecution agreement or DPA with SNC-Lavalin remains one that is available under the law, however Lametti’s office confirmed Wednesday he has so far not issued a directive in the matter.

Councillors could demand more information on the controversial SNC ...,"Councillors could demand more information on the controversial SNC-Lavalin contract to extend the Trillium Line if they pass a motion being planned for Wednesday's council meeting.

Last week, CBC reported that SNC-Lavalin did not meet the minimum 70 per cent technical score needed to qualify for the $1.6-billion contract, while its two competitors easily met the threshold, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the evaluation process.

Citing commercial confidentiality, city officials have refused to say whether SNC-Lavalin met the technical threshold.

Asked if there are provisions in the request for proposals that would allow a bidder to win without earning a 70 per cent grade, the city wouldn't explicitly say.

Coun. Jeff Leiper said he heard a ""non-stop stream of reaction from residents"" about the story over the weekend.

""Residents are concerned that the bidding process was not fair,"" said the Kitchissippi councillor.

""I think it's incumbent on us as a city to put those questions to rest.""

Now, the councillor is working with colleagues, city staff and the clerk's office on the wording of a motion that ""would simply request more information from the city"" before the SNC-Lavalin contract is finalized at the end of the month.

Council would have to waive the usual rules of procedure at Wednesday's council meeting to allow such a motion to be discussed.

Council refused answers on minimum scoring

Earlier this month in a 19 to 3 vote, council approved the contracts for both the east-west Confederation Line and north-south Trillium Line extensions.

Councillors Diane Deans (Gloucester-Southgate), Rick Chiarelli (College) and Shawn Menard (Capital) voted against the deal.

At the time, Deans and a few other councillors pressed city officials and their lawyer, Geoffrey Gilbert of Norton Rose Fulbright, on whether SNC-Lavalin achieved the minimum technical score.

Mayor Jim Watson defended the city's procurement process last Friday, saying it was carried out by professionals and ""not politicians"" and overseen by a hired fairness commissioner.

The SNC-Lavalin bid was also ""the best deal for taxpayers,"" according to Watson.

Mayor Jim Watson and city manager Steve Kanellakos say they have no doubts about the procurement process that resulted in SNC-Lavalin winning the $1.6-billion contract to extend and maintain Ottawa's north-south LRT line. 1:13

SNC-Lavalin's contract to extend the Trillium Line from Greenboro station to Riverside South is worth about $800 million — $230 million more than the city was expecting to pay.

When the 27-year maintenance contract is included the contract is worth $1.6 billion, about $100 million less than expected.

It remains unclear why city officials have spoken about SNC-Lavalin's financial score — they have said repeatedly that the Montreal-based company submitted the cheapest bid — but are not able to confirm that it met the technical threshold.

Concerns over litigation

Not all councillors see eye-to-eye with Leiper.

Cumberland ward Coun. Stephen Blais, who has not yet seen the wording of the motion in progress, said he is ""never against getting more information.""

But he trusts that no rules were broken during the evaluation process and is worried about potential legal action against the city.

""What we heard was that providing information on technical scores would violate the terms of the [request for proposals],"" said Blais.

""This would open us up to litigation, which would lead to extra costs for taxpayers in legal fees, settlements and delays in construction.""

Coun. Diane Deans is calling on city staff to explain to council how SNC-Lavalin won the $1.6-billion contract for the expansion and maintenance of the LRT's Trillium Line. 0:38

Leiper said he's also concerned about any council action that ""could trigger millions [of dollars] in penalties.""

He's also willing to believe there is a mechanism in the process that could allow a proposal that did not meet the minimum technical threshold to be named the winning bidder.

""But we need to know what that mechanism is,"" said Leiper.

""We need to know what the balance of considerations was that led staff to recommend SNC-Lavalin.""",Council could demand more info on controversial SNC-Lavalin bid,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/council-details-snc-lavalin-bid-1.5070627

(TSX:SNC) scandal.



Trudeau said that former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board Chief Jane Philpott would no longer be allowed to sit as Liberal legislators. They were also barred from running for the party in the federal election taking place this October.



In announcing the decision, the prime minister said that the two former cabinet members were actively undermining his government concerning the SNC-Lavalin case. The governing Liberals have been in turmoil since Wilson-Raybould said in February that officials had inappropriately pressured her while she was justice minister to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin would escape a corruption trial.



The expulsions are a change of course for Trudeau, who said last week that the Liberals needed strong legislators with differing points of view. But increasingly angry parliamentarians had demanded both women be removed from caucus on the grounds they were undermining party unity. Recent opinion polls show the crisis has cut public support for the Liberals to the point that they could lose the October election.



Last Friday, Wilson-Raybould released the audio of a confidential conversation she had with Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council Office, who did not know she was recording him. The recording showed that Wernick, who recently resigned from his senior post, pressuring Wilson-Raybould to settle the SNC-Lavalin case quietly and expeditiously.



Trudeau was seeking a remediation agreement that would allow SNC-Lavalin, one of the world’s biggest engineering firms, to avoid criminal proceedings on corruption and fraud charges related to its business activities in Libya.



In the recorded phone call, Wernick repeatedly asks Wilson-Raybould why she is not using all the tools at her disposal in the SNC-Lavalin case. She pushes back, saying she would not override the decision of the director of public prosecutions to pursue a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud.

The court of Quebec hearing, which is subject to a publication ban, relates to fraud and corruption charges against the Montreal-based engineering and construction giant.

The proceedings began last fall after SNC-Lavalin failed to secure a deferred prosecution agreement, a kind of plea deal that would have seen the firm agree to pay a fine rather than face a trial.

Over the past two months, SNC has found itself in the eye of a political firestorm following accusations from former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould that top government officials pressured her to overrule federal prosecutors, who had opted not to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with the company.

Both SNC-Lavalin and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have argued that a criminal trial could trigger the company’s exit to the United States and the loss of thousands of jobs.

The RCMP has accused SNC-Lavalin of paying nearly $47.7 million in bribes to public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011. The company, its construction division and a subsidiary also face one charge each of fraud and corruption for allegedly defrauding various Libyan organizations of about $129.8 million.

If the case proceeds, the company could choose a trial by jury or by judge alone, said prosecutor Richard Roy at the Montreal courthouse Monday.

“We’ve already argued that the company should be committed to trial, and we stand by arguments,” he said.

The judge has reserved his decision, with a court date set for May 29.

But Scheer would do things differently, you say? Keep two things in mind: SNC-Lavalin officials who met with Scheer describe him as being friendly to the idea of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement. And the legislation that allows such agreements, which the Conservatives allege the government tried to sneak in as part of the omnibus budget bill? It went through the Commons justice committee, and was unanimously approved — including by the Conservatives.

Those harassed elected officials may complain, as Jody Wilson-Raybould did, or they may suffer in silence, or they may bend to the muscle. But the lack of a public spectacle doesn't mean this sort of thing doesn't happen behind the scenes on a host issues.

Does it matter? Or is this just the price of a system of government like ours? It's not a simple question.

Wilson-Raybould knew she held all the cards on the question of SNC-Lavalin's prosecution. We learned she asked for and received a legal opinion to the effect that her getting involved in the decision would be unprecedented and risky, but also that the ultimate authority on the matter was hers as Attorney General. Not the prime minister, or his staff. She was in the driver's seat, and clearly knew that.

What she objected to was being under sustained pressure to (depending on who you believe) overturn the original decision or get an outside legal opinion on the matter overall.

None of this is at issue. The only thing that matters is whether or not the pressure on her was improper, unprofessional or just unpleasant.

Regardless of the final answer on that, regardless of whether Wilson-Raybould's and Jane Philpott's public mutiny against their party and leader ends up costing the Liberals the election, the central reality doesn't change. This entire sordid saga is more like a symptom than the disease.

It was back in 1968 when Justin Trudeau's father created and institutionalized the practice of having partisan advisers play key roles in the PMO. Trudeau the younger has criticized that, including in a 2015 CBC interview where he said: ""One of the things that we've seen throughout the past decades in government is the trend toward more control from the Prime Minister's Office. Actually, it can be traced as far back as my father, who kicked it off in the first place."" From the same interview: ""I think I actually quite like the symmetry of me being the one who'd end that. My father had a particular way of doing things; I have a different way, and his was suited to his time and mine is suited to my time ... I think we get better public policy when we're done, when it's done openly and transparently.""",Editorial: SNC-Lavalin debacle a symptom of a bigger problem,Waterloo Region Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion-story/9265756-editorial-snc-lavalin-debacle-a-symptom-of-a-bigger-problem/

Joan Bryden , The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got a first-hand glimpse of the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair when he addressed young women staging a mock Parliament in the House of Commons Wednesday: about four dozen of them turned their backs on him while he tried to explain why he had booted Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott out of the Liberal caucus the day before.

It was a rough start for Trudeau's efforts to re-establish himself as a feminist and supporter of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

""There's always going to be a range of opinions we need to listen to,"" Trudeau told the women. ""But ultimately, diversity ... only works if there is trust and within a team when that trust gets broken, we have to figure out how to move forward.""

""It's actually easy to stand in a place and cross your arms and stand in a place and say, 'I'm not budging from my position because I'm right,""' he added later. ""What is actually more difficult is to look for thoughtful compromise.""

Some of the women, delegates chosen to represent each of the country's 338 ridings through a program called Daughters of the Vote, were unconvinced. They called him a ""fake feminist"" and doubted the authenticity of his commitment to reconciling with Indigenous Peoples -- sentiments echoed by opposition parties.

""It was like a microcosm of the history of Canada, with a white man telling Indigenous women where they can and cannot be and exercising their power and their privilege over them,"" said Riley Yesno, one of the young women brought to Parliament by Equal Voice, a group dedicated to increasing the presence of women in politics.

Yesno, an Anishnaabe University of Toronto student who grew up in Thunder Bay, Ont., called Trudeau's treatment of Wilson-Raybould ""colonial violence"" and further dubbed him a ""fake feminist."" While she doesn't necessarily believe he has ""malicious intent"" towards women, she said the expulsions of the former ministers ""extremely negatively affect women"" and ""impact matters more than intention.""

Many of the same women walked out of the Commons altogether when Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer addressed them. Yesno said that was done deliberately, so their protest against Trudeau couldn't be used as ammunition by the official Opposition.

However, Trudeau got some unexpected support from Philpott, who spoke a short time later, alongside Wilson-Raybould, outside the Commons.

Asked about the prime minister's feminist credentials, Philpott said: ""I wish him the best. I wish him the opportunity to continue his good work.""

Trudeau informed the two former ministers Tuesday that he won't allow them to seek re-election as Liberal candidates this fall. Both said Wednesday it's too soon to say whether their careers in politics are finished or whether they might run as independents or for another party.

""I would like to think that there may be steps, that I could continue in a political role somehow but I don't know what that will be,"" said Philpott, speaking alongside Wilson-Raybould. ""It's too early to say.""

""I need to take some time to reflect,"" said Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould believes she was moved out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. She has testified that she faced relentless pressure last fall from Trudeau, his office, the top public servant and others to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided not to invite the Montreal engineering giant to negotiate a remediation agreement, a kind of plea bargain.

Wilson-Raybould quit the cabinet in mid-February and Philpott followed a few weeks later, saying she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

The revelation last week that Wilson-Raybould had surreptitiously recorded a phone conversation with Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council, to bolster her contention of undue pressure was the last straw for Liberal MPs, who openly called on Trudeau to expel the former ministers. On Tuesday, Trudeau called the secret recording ""unconscionable,"" proof that the ex-minister could no longer be trusted.

""Trust is a two-way street,"" Wilson-Raybould shot back Wednesday. ""It is unconscionable not to uphold the rule of law.""

Neither Philpott nor Wilson-Raybould expressed regret for standing up for what they believed was right.

""You have to be able to hold your head high and look at yourself in the mirror at the end of the day and say that the choices you made were the best ones under the circumstances,"" said Philpott.

In the Commons during question period, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the whole episode demonstrates that ""speaking truth to power"" disqualifies strong women from inclusion in the Liberal party.

Trudeau said he'll take no lessons from the Conservatives on feminism, noting that he still has ""18 strong women members of cabinet who lead every day on the big issues that matter to Canadians.""

Trudeau ended the day at a meeting with Natan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and several other Inuit leaders and federal cabinet ministers, for a meeting of the Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee, formed two years ago to improve the relationship. He promised to continue a path towards reconciliation on issues such as education, suicide prevention, and climate change.

The Commons justice committee has been studying ...","Documents submitted by Gerald Butts, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's former principal secretary, to the parliamentary committee investigating the SNC-Lavalin affair have been released by the committee.

The Commons justice committee has been studying allegations first reported in the Globe and Mail that former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould faced pressure from the Prime Minister's Office to overturn a decision by the director of public prosecutions to not offer a deferred prosecution agreement to Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Such an agreement would let the company avoid a punishing criminal trial over bribes paid a decade ago in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet on Feb. 12, less than a week after the Globe story appeared and four weeks after she was shuffled out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

The documents released by the committee include texts Butts exchanged with Wilson-Raybould after a meeting in December, and notes from a meeting between Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould and Butts in January before the shuffle.

Butts also told committee members that he had access to the texts and notes because they were obtained by his lawyer for his March 6 appearance before the committee, but they remain in the control of the Prime Minister's Office.

In the letter, Butts takes issue with Wilson-Raybould's account of how her former chief of staff, Jessica Prince, characterized her meeting with Butts and his PMO colleague Katie Telford in December — particularly his request to seek independent legal advice on whether SNC-Lavalin should be offered a deferred prosecution agreement.

Butts' submission follows explosive documents from Wilson-Raybould released last week that included an audio recording of her phone conversation with Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick. The clerk was not aware he was being recorded.

417,,2019-04-04T05:23:00.0000000Z,"Although it may feel like ancient history, and remembered about as clearly, it was just last week that Finance Minister Bill Morneau introduced the Liberal's final, pre-election budget, a 460-page basket of goodies titled ""Investing in the Middle Class.","Today, the Liberals find themselves 204 days out from voting day and yet no closer to any resolution on SNC. And to make matters worse, their last, best opportunity to ""change the channel"" is now behind them.

As a crisis manager, it is clear to me that the cost of the SNC-Lavalin scandal to the Liberals has become twofold: the scandal itself as well as those 53 lost days. In crisis communications, each lost day — each lost hour — in which your message is not getting out, or in which your messages are reactively instead of proactively focused, is an hour or a day in which you are losing the message battle.

And things got materially worse for the government this week. The budget simply has no chance to compete with the release of a recorded conversation between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Michael Wernick.

The budget was a critical opportunity to turn the page, and yet two days after it was introduced, it had fallen off the front pages of the national media. In its place was a return to a regularly scheduled program of SNC revelations. By Saturday, the lead story in this newspaper's business section was calling it a ""forgettable budget."" By all accounts, that headline nailed it. The budget has already been thoroughly forgotten.

The budget did not fare much better on television, either. The day after its release, CBC's Power and Politics covered it only notionally, before moving on to a smorgasbord of other news, including Celina Caesar-Chavannes's resignation, Jane Philpott's remarks that there was ""more to the story"" on SNC-Lavalin, and the marathon voting session underway in Parliament. CTV's Power Play similarly skimmed the surface, while Question Period devoted an entire segment with the chyron, ""Budget overshadowed by SNC-Lavalin.""

And although political parties can often circumvent traditional media through the skilful use of social media, the budget was, by all accounts, a flop there as well.

Between March 16 (two days prior to the budget, when hype begins) and March 24, the budget was tweeted or posted about on Facebook 31,938 times. SNC-Lavalin? 408,101 times.

And so, as the calendar counts down to election day, the news cycle has little room left for the prime minister's message of sunny ways.

A prospect that portends stormy days ahead for the government and its message.

But SNC-Lavalin controversy completists will nevertheless want to scan one of the less talked-about documents provided to the House justice committee in response to its now-closed investigation into the allegations of attempted political interference: namely, the November 9, 2018 memorandum on the potential consequences that a criminal conviction could have on the embattled Quebec engineering firm, which was prepared at Wernick’s request, but never delivered.

During her second appearance before the committee, deputy minister Nathalie Drouin said that, after she shared the document with the minister’s office, she was “instructed” not to send it to the Privy Council Office.

In her supplementary written submission to the committee, Wilson-Raybould says she has “no recollection, nor … any notes” on giving such an instruction to her deputy minister, and isn’t sure why she would have done so.

She does point out that she’s “not clear” on why Wernick “would be asking for such an opinion in the first place, having known I had already considered the matter and had decided not to intervene.”

Alas for those who may have been hoping that the now-public memo would crack the case, it provides no new insight into the rationale behind the decision to decline SNC-Lavalin’s plea for a remediation deal, although it provides a decent overview of one of the issues at the heart of the debate: What would happen if the firm is convicted?

The answer, according to the brief:

[P]ursuant to the current “interim” Policy, the convicted company/supplier would be ineligible to contract with the government. Depending on the offence for which there was a conviction, the period of ineligibility could be as long as 10 years. This ineligibility status would remain for the entire period unless the government considered it possible and appropriate to invoke a public interest exception. The reasons to invoke the public interest exception are narrow (emergency where delay could harm public interest; company/supplier is the only person capable of performing the contract; the contract is essential to maintain sufficient emergency stocks; not entering into the contract with the company/supplier would have a significant adverse impact on the health, national security, safety, public security or economic or financial wellbeing of Canadians or the functioning of any portion of the federal public administration).” Other than this narrow public interest exception, the Policy does not afford the government any discretion to continue to contract with the convicted company/supplier.

It points out that under a new policy proposal from Public Services and Procurement Canada, “the government would have the discretion to vary, or even rescind, the period of ineligibility of a convicted company/supplier,” which would be “at the discretion” of the department.

It also summarizes the potential impact on a company’s ability to bid on public contracts in Quebec, where conviction on bribery could carry a five-year ban, as well as the World Bank sanction system, under which SNC-Lavalin has already been debarred until 2023 over two separate cases of alleged “misconduct.”

Overall, the document itself adds little to the debate, at least in its current form — and, perhaps most frustratingly, doesn’t mention the remediation agreement regime itself at all, which means we still don’t have a clear answer on whether the prohibition on taking “national economic interest” into account when deciding whether to offer such a deal would include the prime minister’s oft-cited concern at the prospect of losing thousands of Canadian jobs if the firm was convicted.

It does, however, add a new entry to the Process Nerd list of annoyingly unanswered questions: Given how innocuous it is, why did the minister allegedly tell her deputy not to hand it over to PCO? (And if she didn’t, why would her deputy tell a parliamentary committee that she did?)

Finally, while not part of the body of evidence presented to the justice committee, the OECD has, somewhat serendipitously, just published a new study that examines “settlements and non-trial agreements by parties to the Anti-Bribery Convention.”

Remarkably, it, too fails to expand on the concept of “national economic interest, which may seem like a minor technicality, but nothing drives a Process Nerd more bonkers than an obscure legislative reference that no one seems to be able to define, including the international body that coined it.

But it also offers helpful context on anti-corruption efforts around the world — and may even provide some guidance on how our laws could be strengthened.",Process Nerd: Unsent SNC-Lavalin memo raises more questions than it answers,iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/04/03/process-nerd-unsent-snc-lavalin-memo-raises-more-questions-than-it-answers/

Once more with feeling: For a Liberal-dominated justice committee that wants nothing more to do with the SNC-Lavalin controversy, there seems to be no end to past witnesses hoping to get in a last word on the matter. After former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould released an explosive audio recording of her conversation with soon-to-be-former Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick—with that release coming after Wernick reappeared before the committee to address Wilson-Raybould’s testimony—Justin Trudeau‘s close friend and former advisor Gerald Butts revealed he has more to say, too. “Having reviewed Ms Wilson-Raybould’s further testimony,” he tweeted Sunday, “I have tabled with the Justice Committee notes and texts between us related to the events Ms Wilson-Raybould describes.” (Twitter)

After Butts’s texts and other documents have been translated they will be released to the public, ensuring another news cycle in the justice committee’s SNC-Lavalin investigation, which officially ended March 19 when the committee’s Liberal majority determined “we have achieved our objectives with regards to these meetings.” (CTV News)

Over the weekend Wernick’s lawyer said the PMO was not briefed about Wernick’s call with Wilson-Raybould because “everyone went on holidays the next day” and that despite Wernick’s assertion that Trudeau would “find a way to get [a deferred prosecution agreement] done one way or another” the SNC-Lavalin issue wasn’t even a top priority for the Prime Minister. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer found that hard to believe: “The idea that [Trudeau] was on vacation and couldn’t be briefed about an issue that he took such great interest in, that he sent his principal adviser multiple times to lobby Ms. Wilson-Raybould to interfere in this situation, an issue that he himself had a meeting with her on, and then never asked about it, certainly I’m not buying that.” (CBC News)

In case you missed it, here are key highlights from Wilson-Raybould’s phone call with Wernick along with a recording of their conversation. (Maclean’s)

Wilson-Raybould and her tape recorder brought out more grumbling from the Liberal caucus about her continued presence on Team Liberal. Labour Minister Patty Hajdu called the tape recording “unethical” and “deceptive” and said while the decision about Wilson-Raybould’s future in the party is up to Trudeau and her fellow Liberal MPs, she’s not happy: “I, personally, don’t feel comfortable, personally, with a colleague who may be recording me without my knowledge.” (Canadian Press)

Go away: Hajdu joins a long list of other Liberal MPs—overwhelmingly women—who’ve come out against Wilson-Raybould and former cabinet minister Jane Philpott. Their futures as Liberals will likely be put to the test Wednesday when the party’s MPs gather for their next caucus meeting.

Here to stay: Wilson-Raybould has no plans to go anywhere. “I was just doing my job,” she told the Toronto Star after a ceremony in her honour near her We Wai Kai First Nation in Campbell River, B.C. on Saturday. She said she is “absolutely ready” for whatever comes next in the SNC-Lavalin saga and stated once again that she intends to run as a Liberal in the next election. As for Philpott, she said her former cabinet colleague resigned “for her own integrity.” (Toronto Star)

Happy carbon tax day: In the same way the SNC-Lavalin saga stole the thunder from the Trudeau government’s pre-election budget last month, it has overshadowed the roll-out of carbon taxes in Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick today, for better or for worse. While Scheer and the Conservatives, as well as Premier Doug Ford in Ontario, have stepped up their campaign against the carbon levy on social media, the new tax, which will add 4.4 cents to the price of a litre of gas, has garnered relatively little coverage. (Canadian Press)

Alberta election dispatch

NDP’s sexual misconduct baggage: Late last year, Rachel Notley conceded two NDP MLAs were the subjects of noncriminal sexual misconduct allegations, and that they were investigated and dealt with through “education and instruction.” The two NDP men implicated were never named—the Premier said the cone of secrecy was to defend the complainants’ privacy, though it cast a shadow on every male in her caucus. Complainants have never come forward.

In recent days, the UCP has urged their rivals to name the misbehaving politicians. Deputy leader Leela Aheer released a public letter to Notley that asks by name whether one senior MLA is among the two, stemming from a tweet posted and then deleted by a former political aide who also accused Liberal MP Kent Hehr of sexual harassment. The opposition Alberta party called Sunday for better rules on MLA conduct and complaints. Notley is sticking with her previous line of disclosing nothing about the accused parties to protect the privacy of the accusers. With no evidence to name names, this story seems to be in a holding pattern. (We’re not linking to Aheer’s letter due to this lack of evidence.) This has now become a highly partisan issue, if it wasn’t already.

After the UCP has fielded nearly two weeks of questions about allegedly nefarious deeds in Kenney’s leadership bid and the bigoted comments of ex-candidates, the Conservatives clearly wish to drag the NDP into the mud and get Notley on defensive, too, and perhaps deservedly. It could be a sign the UCP isn’t having the cakewalk they expected.

Is the race tightening? There are hints and murmurs that the NDP have slightly narrowed their gap behind the UCP. We won’t know the definitive answer until some horse-race polls come out, likely later this week. (No new ones have come out since the election was called.) Alberta Labour Federation’s president threw out some jolting numbers about a mere four-point lead for Kenney’s party—down from an average of 15— but it’s likely the sort of polling released to give the impression of great momentum, not to give an accurate state of the race.

It’s an Ekos poll conducted for Unifor, and it only represents a selection of the polling the NDP-friendly union commissioned. One labour official also explained that the poll wasn’t conducted for public release, but to direct union activists where to mobilize support. The respondents weren’t a random sample of Albertans, but a panel of the same sample of people used for previous Unifor polls—a less conventional method designed primarily to track changes in support. Mainstreet Research claims the NDP are gaining and now lead in Calgary and Edmonton, but they release data only to subscribers. That firm’s reputation is dismal in Alberta after Mainstreet terribly botched the Calgary last mayoral race.

Weekend politics show roundup

If you didn’t catch the weekend political shows, here’s some of what you missed:

Nothing to see here: In the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s release of her phone conversation with Wernick, Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault, a member of the justice committee, was dispatched to do damage control with a message that there was nothing new in the recording. “The prime minister’s been very clear that there was an erosion of trust here,” he said on Global’s West Block. “Really good working relationships broke down. But even in yesterday’s, you know, submission to the justice committee, what’s clear is that nothing illegal took place.” (Global News)

Pump up: Ahead of today’s debut of the new federal carbon tax and rebate program in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna appeared on CTV’s Question Period to defend the Trudeau government’s climate plan against attacks from Conservatives: “Yes, let’s be clear. The price of gas will go up just over four cents. And that creates an incentive for people to consider ‘Maybe I should look at a more energy-efficient vehicle’ … but that’s your choice. You still get the money back at the end of the day.” (CTV News)

Sunless ways: After Trudeau smugly thanked Indigenous protesters at a Liberal fundraising party for their donation last week—a remark he apologized for the next day—Union of B.C. Chiefs Grand Chief Stewart Phillip unleashed on the Prime Minister during an interview on the West Block: “Now that he’s under tremendous pressure from the Jody Wilson-Raybould/SNC-Lavalin issue, Mr. Trudeau is really revealing himself to be who he really is, which is a very self-centred, conceited, arrogant individual and I think that was demonstrated with his very smug, mean-spirited response to the Grassy Narrows demonstrators … Without question, the sun is setting on Justin Trudeau.” (Global News)

You have to believe that when Jody Wilson-Raybould told Trudeau in September that she had made up her mind and would not interfere with the decision to proceed with a prosecution against SNC-Lavalin, he either didn’t grasp what she was saying, or didn’t accept how serious she was.

You have to trust that none of the numerous complaints she made over the ensuing weeks, warning that the pressure being exerted was inappropriate and had to stop, made it through to Trudeau.

You have to consider it wholly believable that Gerald Butts, the political whizz-kid and guru considered the brains behind the throne, likewise missed or misinterpreted the signals, and didn’t alert his boss that they had a real problem.

You have to find nothing odd in the fact none of the supposedly highly-skilled and politically adept people surrounding Trudeau appreciated the severity of the warning Wilson-Raybould was making: that if Trudeau used his office to muscle a subordinate to interfere in the independence of the public prosecutor, he was racing headlong towards a cliff and was taking his government with him.

Even though Wilson-Raybould says she has “documented evidence” to the contrary, you have to believe that the Prime Minister’s Office never received the formal explanation — known as a Section 13 — outlining the reasoning for going ahead with the Lavalin prosecution, and that, in all the months of back-and-forth among ministers, their staff and the PMO, no one took the time to acquaint Trudeau with the contents of that report.

You have to consider it wholly believable that Gerald Butts … didn’t alert his boss that they had a real problem

If you want to agree with complaints that the whole affair has been overblown, you need to accept at face value the apparent inability of Michael Wernick, supposedly among the top minds in the civil service, to understand why Wilson-Raybould refused to use the “tools” she had at her disposal to halt the prosecution of SNC, even after she made crystal clear in their 17-minute phone conversation that using those tools would inevitably explode in the face of the government. And you need to take seriously Wernick’s claim that he didn’t pass on the message to Trudeau, despite specifically telling Wilson-Raybould he had to “report back,” because everyone left town the next day on a holiday.

This is the same Wernick, remember, who opened the conversation by warning that time was of the essence, that Trudeau was eager to find a solution, and had earlier testified that if she had concerns, the minister could have contacted Trudeau any time, at any hour, because he was always available.

It’s a lot to accept. But there’s even more to digest. For instance, how is it that neither Butts nor Trudeau realized something was badly amiss when Jane Philpott told them Wilson-Raybould might feel that shuffling her out of her job was punishment for refusing to cave to Trudeau’s demands? And how could they be shocked when Wilson-Raybould demurred from accepting a transfer to Indigenous Services, a post she’d made known she could never accept?

Is it really feasible that no one in the Liberal hierarchy foresaw that imposing limits on Wilson-Raybould’s ability to testify before the Justice committee would strike a negative chord with Canadians, or that letting Liberal MPs peremptorily shut down the committee in the wake of her testimony would only make things worse?

It’s a lot to accept. But there’s even more to digest

There are Liberals out there who insist they can buy the whole package, that accept Trudeau’s bland assurances over the minister’s detailed evidence. Somehow they can listen to the Wernick phone call and not see what’s going on: a minister being strong-armed by a powerful messenger armed with warnings that the boss is “going to find a way to get it done, one way or another.” They argue that Trudeau would never act in such a threatening manner, that it’s out of character.

But the truth is, it’s entirely in character, and the proof has been there all along, in multiple examples of Trudeau’s response to situations that try his patience. Such as when he elbowed his way across the Commons to berate a member of the opposition. Or the moment in Edmonton when he sarcastically suggested a woman use the term “peoplekind” rather than “mankind.” Or his determination to block students from summer jobs unless organizations employing them signed a statement attesting to support Liberal values.

Or his snarky response just last week to an inconvenient intruder at a Liberal fundraiser who tried to draw attention to the ongoing health problems at Grassy Narrows, a First Nations community long troubled by mercury poisoning.

Wilson-Raybould has had plenty of time to learn what lies beneath the pleasant image the prime minister works so hard to project

Over more than three years of working closely with Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould has had plenty of time to learn what lies beneath the pleasant image the prime minister works so hard to project. “I am not under any illusion how the prime minister … gets things that he wants,” she tells Wernick in their recorded phone call.

“I am having … thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here, Michael,” she confesses, alluding to Richard Nixon’s desperate effort to save himself from Watergate by taking a buzz saw to his justice department. “I am waiting for the … other shoe to drop.”

The shoe dropped a few weeks later, when she was ousted from her job, then resigned to make clear her differences with Trudeau. The prime minister’s version of her departure is that it resulted from an “erosion of trust” of which he was entirely unaware, in spite of the events of the previous three months, the warnings she issued, the stark alert issued to Wernick and the concerns raised by Philpott.

Maybe it’s possible that the prime minister really was caught off guard, that his aides and advisers failed to bring the danger to his attention. But if that’s the case, you have to ask yourself whether a government that could make so many errors in judgment, could miss so many signs of trouble, could press ahead with a bad idea even when one of its senior members is waving her arms and shouting “stop!” — you have to ask yourself whether a government so clumsy, myopic and accident prone has any business running the country.

421,Politics,2019-04-04T01:21:00.0000000Z,OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got a first-hand glimpse of the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair when he addressed young women staging a mock Parliament in the House of Commons Wednesday: about four dozen of them turned their backs on him while ...,"Trudeau informed the two former ministers Tuesday that he won't allow them to seek re-election as Liberal candidates this fall. Both said Wednesday it's too soon to say whether their careers in politics are finished or whether they might run as independents or for another party.

""I would like to think that there may be steps, that I could continue in a political role somehow but I don't know what that will be,"" said Philpott, speaking alongside Wilson-Raybould. ""It's too early to say.""

""I need to take some time to reflect,"" said Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould believes she was moved out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. She has testified that she faced relentless pressure last fall from Trudeau, his office, the top public servant and others to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided not to invite the Montreal engineering giant to negotiate a remediation agreement, a kind of plea bargain.

Wilson-Raybould quit the cabinet in mid-February and Philpott followed a few weeks later, saying she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

The revelation last week that Wilson-Raybould had surreptitiously recorded a phone conversation with Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council, to bolster her contention of undue pressure was the last straw for Liberal MPs, who openly called on Trudeau to expel the former ministers. On Tuesday, Trudeau called the secret recording ""unconscionable,"" proof that the ex-minister could no longer be trusted.

""Trust is a two-way street,"" Wilson-Raybould shot back Wednesday. ""It is unconscionable not to uphold the rule of law.""

Neither Philpott nor Wilson-Raybould expressed regret for standing up for what they believed was right.

""You have to be able to hold your head high and look at yourself in the mirror at the end of the day and say that the choices you made were the best ones under the circumstances,"" said Philpott.

In the Commons during question period, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the whole episode demonstrates that ""speaking truth to power"" disqualifies strong women from inclusion in the Liberal party.

Trudeau said he'll take no lessons from the Conservatives on feminism, noting that he still has ""18 strong women members of cabinet who lead every day on the big issues that matter to Canadians.""

Trudeau ended the day at a meeting with Natan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and several other Inuit leaders and federal cabinet ministers, for a meeting of the Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee, formed two years ago to improve the relationship. He promised to continue a path towards reconciliation on issues such as education, suicide prevention, and climate change.",Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott have no regrets over the SNC-Lavalin affair,Waterloo Region Record,https://www.therecord.com/news-story/9266293-jody-wilson-raybould-and-jane-philpott-have-no-regrets-over-the-snc-lavalin-affair/

The changes include Liberal party clarification that a breakfast reception at the Royal York in Toronto actually garnered $55,000. Actual numbers by date will be available in quarterly financing reports.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet raised $464,600 in contributions to the Liberal party for exclusive fundraisers held between the beginning of the year and March 14, according to the first report from Elections Canada’s new regulations.

While Trudeau and several of his top ministers appeared at fundraising events that donors paid anywhere from $200 to the maximum contribution of $1,600 to attend, a breakfast reception with the Prime Minister at Toronto’s Fairmount Royal York Hotel garnered $55,000.

Trudeau hosted the 7:15 a.m. event on Feb. 1, one week before the Globe and Mail first reported on the SNC-Lavalin affair, a story that has dragged the Liberal government into its worst crisis since Trudeau became prime minister in 2015.

On Feb. 7, when the Globe published its report, an evening fundraiser in Toronto featuring Trudeau raised $64,000 from 40 donors.

Total donations for several of the Liberal events had to be tabulated using a mean because individual donations varied, ranging upward from $200.

The Elections Canada report on regulated fundraising stems from legislation the Trudeau government introduced in May 2017, in the wake of a Globe report about “cash for access” fundraisers featuring Trudeau that were attended by influential business leaders with an interest in federal economic policy.

The controversy prompted the Liberal party to make its own public release of fundraising events the same year. The party also opened events to news media.

The Canada Elections Act amendments received Royal Assent on June 21, 2018, and took effect on Dec. 21. The new sections of the Act require any political party with at least one seat in the House of Commons to report details of all fundraising events attended by the party leader, interim leader, leadership contestant or federal cabinet minister where at least one person had to pay or contribute more than $200 to attend, or to have another person attend.

A previous version of this story included contributions for four large receptions the party describes as Laurier Club Donor Appreciation Events, where no specific contributions were required. Those who attended had already qualified to become members of the party’s elite Laurier Club of supporters by contributing the current requirement of a contribution of $1,500 for a year or by instalments, with a lower minimum for those under 30.

Contributions raised beforehand to qualify as Laurier Club members with access to those four receptions totaled $263,750.

The Elections Canada regulated fundfraising regime remains in place through federal election periods.

The Elections Canada report lists only two fundraising events attended by Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer, from which the party secured a total of $267,000.

One of the fundraisers, on Feb. 4 in Toronto, raised a total of $156,000 from 104 donors who each paid $1,500 to attend. The event organizers included Conservative Senators Linda Frum and Nicole Eaton.

The Conservative party did not respond to two emails from iPolitics.

Conrad Black, the former Canadian media tycoon who gave up his citizenship to become a British Lord and was subsequently convicted of fraud in the United States, is named on the list of supporters who attended Scheer’s Toronto event, but it is unclear whether he paid to attend, since only Canadian citizens can legally donate to Canadian political parties.

The other fundraiser Scheer attended, in Saskatoon, raised a total of $111,600, with donors paying $1,200 to attend.

The NDP has no entries in the report.

A party spokesman, Guillaume Francoeur, said no report was required because New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not attended any fundraisers where at least one person had to pay or contribute over $200 to attend, at least not since Dec. 21. The one event that Singh did attend, in London—Fanshawe, had a ticket price of $25.

“To date, we have not had any event that would satisfy these (thresholds),” said Francoeur.

The fledgling People’s Party of Canada, led by former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier, reported a total of $7,950 in contributions from B.C. donors — seven of whom contributed $250 each to attend a “Cocktail With Maxime Bernier” at Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier in North Vancouver, and 31 donors who contributed $200 each for a “Brunch with Maxime Bernier” in Chilliwack, B.C.

Top draws for Liberal contributions included Global Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair, and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who attended only one fundraiser during the reporting period, in Conservative MP Lisa Raitt’s electoral district of Milton.

Despite the SNC-Lavalin furor that has gripped the Liberals over the past months, two appearances by Trudeau — Feb. 20 in Halifax and Feb. 22 in St. John’s — raised a total of $119,000.

Braeden Caley, a spokesman for the Liberal party, told iPolitics that Liberal online fundraising in March 2019 was 167 per cent higher than in March 2018.

(The margin of error is ±3.1 percentage points.)

And that makes one wonder if Canadians are getting weary of the SNC-Lavalin controversy or perhaps getting put off by the Conservatives’ relentless attack on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

It could also be that many Canadians have been shocked at former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould indulging in unethical behaviour by secretly recording her conversation with Canada’s top public servant, Michael Wernick.

The NDP are at 16.6 percent, the Bloc Quebecois at 4.4 per cent, the Greens at 8.1 per cent and the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) at 0.5 per cent.

Asked whether they would consider voting for each of the federal parties, 49.6 per cent of Canadians say they would consider voting Liberal while 45.7 per cent would consider voting Conservative.

Four in 10 (40.1%) would consider voting NDP, 34.2 per cent would consider voting Green, 10.1 per cent would consider voting for the People’s Party and 34.5 per cent would consider voting for the BQ.

Nanos tracking has Trudeau as the preferred choice as Prime Minister at 31.1 per cent of Canadians followed by Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer (26.7%), NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (7.8%), Green Party Leader Elizabeth May (7.6%) and PPC Leader Maxime Bernier (2.7%). Twenty-three per cent of Canadians were unsure whom they preferred.

Fewer than half of Canadians (45.5%) believe Trudeau has the qualities of a good political leader while 41.6 per cent believe Scheer has the qualities of a good political leader. Three in 10 (32.2%) say Jagmeet Singh has the qualities of a good political leader, while 35.8 per cent believe the same about May. One in six (18.1%) believe Bernier has the qualities of a good political leader and 27.9 per cent said BQ Leader Yves-François Blanchet has the qualities of a good political leader (Quebec only).","Nanos poll: Conservatives 35, Liberals 35.

I find it amazing how quickly the RCMP have seen fit to open an investigation in the matter of Jason Kenny’s election team allegedly pulling off some high-handed tricks to help defeat his leadership opponent Brian Jean in Alberta. Kenny claims that is done all the time in politics, and that it is a blood sport. Immoral maybe, but not illegal.

Yet here in Ontario, with many legal scholars screaming for the same intervention because of the Trudeau gang attempting to change the decision of the public prosecutor by repeatedly pressuring our Attorney General to go against that decision, and give a powerful Quebec-based corporation a get out of jail card, there are crickets from the Horsemen.

Are they not empowered to protect all of us in this country from all potentially corrupt politicians that would have it all their way, and to hell with law and order, or does that only apply when the alleged perpetrators are of the Conservative variety. Like the “crime of the century” committed by Mike Duffy, that after many millions wasted was found to be nothing more than a man paying back taxpayers for wrongful bookkeeping with a loan from a friend! Imagine the gall to actually pay back taxpayers. That is a normally foreign concept to the Liberal brand!

With all the evidence here and now in Ottawa and the many top bureaucrats, and cabinet ministers resigning their posts, where are the top cops?
