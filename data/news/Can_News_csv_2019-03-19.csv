""Mr. Axworthy will head the Canadian delegation of short- and long-term elections observers deployed to Ukraine,"" said a release obtained by CBC News.

""Together, they will observe all aspects of the presidential and legislative elections, including monitoring the participation of women, internally displaced persons and minorities in the electoral process.""

Axworthy, who served under former prime minister Jean Chretien, led the Organization of American States election observation mission to Peru in 2006.

The release also states that Canada will provide funding to counteract the ""negative impact of disinformation"" in the electoral process as well as supporting electoral reform and efforts to get more women to participate in the the country's elections.

The first of Canada's election monitors began arriving in Ukraine last month in a bilateral effort organized between the two countries.

The crisis dates back to the Kremlin's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and its backing of Russian separatist militias in eastern Ukraine.

Canada and its NATO allies consider Russia's actions, backed by President Vladimir Putin, to be a breach of Europe's borders, and have shored up the 28-country alliance's military forces in several eastern European countries.

Now with a pivotal Ukrainian presidential election campaign swinging into high gear, the Trudeau government is following in the footsteps of previous Conservative and Liberal governments in sending a Canadian-led observer mission, organized between Canada and Ukraine, while also contributing to a multinational mission led by the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe.

Two proposed Russian observers were rejected by Ukraine, and the Kremlin withdrew their request to serve on the mission, said Thomas Rymer, spokesman for the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights

Ukraine's pro-Western President Petro Poroshenko launched his bid for a second five-year term in January.

When you head to the polls this fall, expect some changes. There's a good chance the name of the riding you used to live in will have completely changed. Your old Member of Parliament might also be campaigning in a new part of town this year.

That's because Canada's federal electoral map underwent a substantial redesign in 2013. Once per decade, the divisions that dictate where Canadians vote get redrawn to ""reflect population shifts and growth,"" meaning the map used in the 2011 election is now defunct.

The new map, which was created by 10 separate electoral boundary commissions, came into effect in 2014, and will divide the country up into 338 different pieces — 30 more than we had in 2011.

The big map above has two layers, which can be toggled by clicking on the ""Visible layers"" tab. The white lines show the new boundaries drawn in 2013, while the darker ones in the layer below show the old ridings that were drawn in 2003.

The smaller maps below break down the changes province by province, highlighting every major boundary adjustment and new riding. Click the links to jump to a specific province.

British Columbia — Alberta — Saskatchewan — Manitoba — Ontario — Quebec — New Brunswick — Nova Scotia



Ridings in 2003: 36 2013: 42 Median riding population: 104,718 British Columbia TOP Four of British Columbia's six new electoral districts will be bunched in the small southwest section of the province's mainland.

The old Delta—Richmond East riding will be roughly broken into two separate pieces, a new Cloverdale—Langley City riding will be added in Surrey, and a sixth Vancouver riding will pop up in the centre of the city.

Most notably, the old Burnaby—Douglas riding now extends north across the water, taking up a large part of the old North Vancouver riding.

Two additional riding will also be added outside of the city — one on Vancouver Island and one in the Fraser Valley.



Ridings in 2003: 28 2013: 34 Median riding population: 106,939 Alberta TOP Most of Alberta's six new ridings are being introduced in the province's two major cities.

Calgary area: Calgary was divided into eight ridings for the last election, but will be split into 10 when Albertans head to the polls this fall.

The north section of the city used to be divided into two ridings, but will now be encompassed by three separate ridings. Calgary—Nose Hill will retain its name, but will be shifted into the centre of the city, sandwiched between a Calgary Rocky Ridge and a Calgary Skyview riding.

In the south, a riding called Calgary Midnapore will appear between what used to be Calgary Southwest and Calgary Southeast.

Edmonton area: Edmonton's ridings are gravitating more towards the urban centre, with three new ridings popping up outside the perimeter of the city.

Though the city core will keep its eight ridings, those boundaries will be tightened up into a more compact space.

And instead of giant, sparse spaces surrounding the city, three new ridings will encompass the Edmonton area: Edmonton—Wetaskiwin, Sturgeon River—Parkland and Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan.

And in the north part of the province, a new riding called Peace River—Westlock will pop up in the middle of what used to be Peace River and Fort McMurray—Athabasca.



Ridings in 2003: 14 2013: 14 Median riding population: 68,742 Saskatchewan TOP Saskatchewan will still have 14 ridings this election -- the same number as in 2011 -- but the province’s riding map has been dramatically redrawn.

A new, exclusively urban riding in Saskatoon called Saskatoon—West is seen as a possible NDP gain in the historically Conservative region. Saskatoon—University and Saskatoon—Grasswood are also new ridings for the city. Regina—Lewvan and Regina—Wascana are also new, urban additions for 2015.

Several rural ridings have been combined for this election. The Prince Albert riding has now expanded to include parts of the old Saskatoon—Humboldt and Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River ridings. Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre has now expanded to include all of Blackstrap and most the Palliser riding.

Three MPs called it quits ahead of the writ drop, before the major riding redistribution forced everyone to revise their campaign calculations.



Ridings in 2003: 14 2013: 14 Median riding population: 85,723 Manitoba TOP Manitoba voters will head to the polls with relatively unchanged boundaries compared to the last election.

Other than some slight tweaks to the names of the ridings, the borderlines in the province's largest city, Winnipeg, are nearly identical to what they were in 2011.

The largest change comes to the north part of the province. A new riding called Churchill—Keewatinook Aski will be an expanded version of the old Churchill riding, and covers much of the region that was previously included in the Selkirk—Interlake riding



Ridings in 2003: 106 2013: 121 Median riding population: 107,084 Ontario TOP Most of the country's new ridings are being introduced in Ontario. The province will jump from 106 to 121 ridings, with most of those 15 new ridings sprouting up around the Greater Toronto Area.

Toronto: The former Oak Ridges—Markham riding has effectively been chopped into three pieces, with much of the land being broken into a new Markham—Stouffville riding in the east, and an Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill in the centre.

A new Markham—Thornhill riding has split off from the Markham—Unionville riding with a new Don Valley North riding popping up in between Don Valley East and Willowdale.

In the east end of town, Scarborough—Rouge Park now covers parts of three old ridings, including Pickering—Scarborough. And downtown Toronto, which used to be covered by the Trinity—Spadina and Toronto Centre ridings, is now three ridings, with a new University—Rosedale riding taking up the north part of the space.

West of Toronto: Mississauga, having been previously divided into four districts, will be getting a new Mississauga Centre riding in the middle of the city.

Brampton will also now be divided into five separate ridings, with Brampton North emerging from half of the old Brampton—Springdale riding and Brampton South occupying the bottom half of the old Brampton West riding.

Heading farther west, what used to be called the Halton riding is being broken into Milton in the north and the new Oakville North—Burlington riding.

A new Hamilton West—Ancaster—Dundas riding also now encompasses the west side of Hamilton, with a riding called Kitchener South—Hespeler now forming from parts of the former Kitchener—Conestoga and Cambridge ridings.

Other parts of the province: Elsewhere in Ontario, three new ridings will be formed in the Ottawa area, the Barrie area and Prince Edward County.



Ridings in 2003: 75 2013: 78 Median riding population: 103,201 Quebec TOP Though Quebec only has three new ridings in the upcoming election, the entire province underwent a substantial rejigging when the electoral district map was redrawn.

It's difficult to pin down where exactly the ""new"" ridings are, but there will be three additional ridings in the area that roughly makes up the Montreal island and the surrounding area.

On the western side of the island, what used to be the large space of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel was broken in two, with a new riding called just Mirabel in the east part of the area. Beside that is a new riding called Thérèse-De Blainville, which is mostly made up of a portion of the old Terrebonne—Blainville riding.

On the other side, a new Brossard—Saint-Lambert riding will be wedged in between the old Brosard—La Prarie and Saint-Lambert ridings.



Ridings in 2003: 10 2013: 10 Median riding population: 79,336 New Brunswick TOP New Brunswick keeps the same number of ridings heading into the 2015 election. The ridings around the province's major cities remain more or less unaffected, with the exception of a portion of the Fredriction riding.

This year, those in the northern part of Fredricton will vote in a separate riding called Miramichi—Grand Lake, which covers parts of the old Miramichi and Beauséjour ridings.



Ridings in 2003: 11 2013: 11 Median riding population: 83,654 Nova Scotia TOP Nova Scotia is still divided into 11 ridings, but some of the boundaries have moved around.

The Central Nova riding, for example, has expanded to cover some residents who were previously within the Sackville–Eastern Shore and Cumberland–Colchester–Musquodoboit Valley ridings.

The Halifax West riding has also contracted, moving those in the southern half of the district into South Shore–St. Margaret's riding.



Ridings in 2003: 4 2013: 4 Median riding population: 34,819 Prince Edward Island TOP Prince Edward Island's four ridings remained untouched when the electoral districts were rearranged.

Despite a population of just 140,204, PEI is represented by four Members of Parliament due to the ""senatorial clause,"" which guarantees no province has fewer seats in the House of Commons than it has in the Senate.

Some single districts – like Ontario's Brantford–Brant riding with a population of about 132,000 – have a comparable population to the entire island. With an average riding size of about 100,000, PEI residence have about three times the representation in Parliament as the average Canadian.



Ridings in 2003: 7 2013: 7 Median riding population: 81,540 Newfoundland and Labrador TOP Though Newfoundland and Labrador will have the same total number of ridings as it did in 2013, the boundaries on the island will change significantly.

In addition to slight tweaks around the St. John's area, the population of most of the western part of Newfoundland will be divided into three verticle stripes, with the Coast of Bays–Central–Notre Dame riding now encompassing parts of three former ridings.

Labrador – which boasts only 26,728 people, the smallest population represented by a seat in the House of Commons – retains the same boundaries it had in the previous election.",Election 2015: Riding Map of Canada,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/election/election-2015-riding-map-of-canada

Freeland described Ukraine as a “laboratory” for Russia’s disinformation campaigns in cyberspace as she and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan announced Monday that Canada is extending its military missions in the eastern European country and Iraq — commitments that were both due to expire at the end of the month.

In a statement, Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland reaffirmed Canada’s commitment to Ukraine’s ‘Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.’ ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )

The extensions shore up Canada’s contributions to the effort to curb Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and to the fight against Islamic militants in the Middle East. Ukraine is bracing for Russian interference in its upcoming presidential election on March 31, and Freeland said the threat has implications for Canada’s own federal vote later this year. “We do need to be concerned about malign actors seeking to interfere in the elections in Ukraine and seeking to interfere in our own elections. That is all the more reason for us to be very active in countering this threat,” she said. “Ukraine tends to be a laboratory for malign intervention and disinformation.”

Canada is committed to helping Ukraine and its neighbours counter the cyberthreats from Moscow, and broader disinformation campaigns, the minister said. “We help them a lot, but I’ll tell you, we learn a lot from them.” The mission of about 200 Canadian Forces personnel in Ukraine will be extended to the end of March 2022. The Forces have been involved in Ukraine since September 2015, helping train the country’s military, which is battling Russian-backed separatist forces. The decision to extend Canada’s commitment was welcome news to Ukraine as it continues to cope with Russia’s annexation of its southern Crimea region in 2014, and the continuing unrest in its eastern Donbass region, which is plagued by a pro-Russian rebellion.

Ukrainian Ambassador Andriy Shevchenko said cyberattacks by Russia have become an everyday occurrence as the election nears. “There are constant cyberattacks on the Ukrainian objects of critical infrastructure,” he said in an interview. “We see massive cyberattacks on our election digital infrastructure, and our media sector.”

Shevchenko said his country is “like a workshop where you can see in real time how our neighbour is trying to interfere with our election.” Canada has trained almost 11,000 Ukrainian military personnel, with techniques that have helped save many lives on the front line of the conflict with Russia, he said. Shevchenko said Canada’s military commitment to his country shows global leadership. He also cited Canada’s contribution of election monitors and Friday’s imposition of additional sanctions on 129 people, companies and organizations over Russia’s treatment of Ukraine. Canada said the measures were a response to the ongoing occupation of Crimea and the Russian arrests of 24 Ukrainian sailors in the Black Sea last November. Former foreign-affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy is leading a delegation of Canadian election monitors to Ukraine. Canada will also host an international conference on Ukraine’s economy and political reforms in July that will include foreign ministers from the European Union, the G7 and NATO countries, Freeland said. Canada also has about 500 troops leading a NATO battlegroup in Latvia, part of the alliance’s broader effort to deter Russia along Europe’s eastern flank. “For defence and deterrence to work, we need to make sure that Russia knows what our capabilities are. That’s how deterrence operates,” said Sajjan. “It’s very important to send our NATO allies a very strong message that we will be there for them, but also to send a very strong message to Russia.” Canada will also extend the Canadian Forces’ contribution to the Global Coalition Against Daesh and the NATO mission in Iraq, until the end of March 2021. Canada has about 500 military members in Iraq, including 200 who are part of a NATO training mission and 120 special forces who have been helping Iraqi forces root out Islamic State insurgents around the northern city of Mosul. Those are parts of Canada’s larger Middle East strategy, which also includes humanitarian assistance and diplomatic engagement in Iraq, Syria and the surrounding region.

London, Ont., voters to make history with first ranked ballot election for a city in Canada Of the 39 per cent of ...","City staff have reviewed Canada's first ranked-ballot municipal election and will present a report to corporate services committee Tuesday.

Here are some of the findings from the report about London's municipal election:

Most voters ranked their ballots

Of the 39 per cent of Londoners who voted in the municipal election, most took advantage of the fact that they could, for the first time in a municipal election in Canada, rank their ballots. 47 per cent of voters ranked three candidates; 22 per cent ranked two candidates; and 31 per cent just ranked one candidate. That means that while one-third of voters rejected the idea of ranking their ballot, the other two-thirds didn't.

It was labour intensive

Managers and staff in the city's clerk's office worked evenings and weekends to get people ready for the different voting system. And the city hired 1,906 workers to staff election day and the advance polls. And in the four months leading up to the election, 500 people quit or were otherwise unable to work, so had to be replaced on or before voting day.

It was not cheap

In total, the election cost more than $1.7 million, up from the 2014 election, which cost $1.3 million. Some of that cost came from the technology to run the ranked ballot election, such as vote tabulators, ballots and ballot boxes and software. That added up to $470,500. The city also spent $24,700 on supplies such as security seals and pens, $147,752 on an auditor to verify that everything was being done according to the rules, and $82,686 in staff time. The cost of outreach and education was $141,100.

Sign, sign, everywhere a sign

There were new rules for politicians who wanted to put up election signs, and complaints about signs kept bylaw officers busy. In the three months leading up to the election, there were a lot of complaints. In August, there were 60 complains; in September, there were 62 and in October, there were 55.

Tick tock

Polls closed at 8 p.m. on election night, and poll workers drove tabulators from 199 polling stations to city hall. They'd all arrived by 9:30 p.m. Eight wards had winners that night, but the remaining seven were set aside until 10 a.m. the next morning. All of the results were published 19 hours after polls closed.",What we know about Canada's first ranked-ballot municipal election,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/ranked-ballots-london-ontario-1.5060927

( Richard Drew / The Associated Press file photo )

Bill C-76, which received royal assent in December, bans the use of money from foreign entities to conduct partisan campaigns. It also requires online platforms, such as Facebook and Google, to create a registry of all digital advertisements placed by political parties or third parties during the pre-writ and writ periods and to ensure they remain visible to the public for two years. Google recently said the demands of the new law are too onerous for its advertising system, which auctions ad space on the fly. It’s simply refusing to take political advertisements in Canada around the upcoming election.

Article Continued Below

Kevin Chan, head of public policy in Canada for Facebook, says the company is trying to exceed the standards the Canadian law sets. “C-76 is, in fact, very important and consequential legislation. It actually regulates online platforms, including Facebook,” Chan said. “In order to comply we actually need to build new systems and new products to be able to do this, so right now we have our product-engineering teams working very, very hard between now and the end of June to ensure that we will be in compliance with what C-76 requires.” Advertisements that refer to political figures, political parties, elections, legislation or issues of national importance will have to go through an authorization process. This will capture the information of the entity or group buying the ad and ensure the buyer is based in Canada. Political ads that appear on Facebook during the pre-writ and writ periods will be labelled with a “paid for by” disclosure. People will be able to click the disclosure and see the ad library. This library will include information on the ad’s reach — who saw it, their gender and location, as well as a range of its impressions. Information in the library will be viewable and searchable online for up to seven years, which exceeds the period required in the new election laws.

Another effort to exceed the legislative rules will see Facebook using its artificial-intelligence technologies and algorithms to detect ads or content that tries to circumvent the rules. “We recognize that there’s going to probably be the potential for bad actors to try to work around the system — in other words, they may want to run a political ad and not seek to self-declare and not seek to be authorized,” Chan said. “That is obviously problematic for us because we recognize that the spirit of what Parliament intended and what we intend, in terms of what we’re trying to do, is provide the most transparency for political ads as possible.”

To help Facebook predict what issues might become key points of debate in the federal election, the company has amassed an group of policy advisers from a wide range of political backgrounds and expertise. The group includes: former NDP MP Megan Leslie; former Stephen Harper aide Ray Novak, who is the managing director of Harper and Associates; Antonia Maioni, McGill University’s dean of arts; Ry Moran, executive director of the truth and reconciliation centre at the University of Manitoba; and David Zussman, a professor at the University of Victoria’s school of public administration.

Premier Rachel Notley has not yet set a date for the election, but Alberta law states it must be held between March 1 and May 31.

Voters will be asked to cast their ballots at a time of controversial government intervention in Alberta’s oil market that has drawn support from some major producers and fierce criticism from others.

The NDP stunned many political commentators when it swept to power in Alberta in 2015 in the midst of the global oil price crash, ending 44 years of conservative rule in the province.

Since then Notley’s government has grappled with shrinking capital investment in the province’s energy sector and persistent budget deficits, and is focused on convincing voters an economic recovery is underway.

“We remain on track to balance the budget by 2023, with the best balance sheet in the country. We are doing this without making reckless cuts to the services all Albertans rely on,” the government said in a speech to the legislature delivered by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Lois Mitchell.

Effective Jan. 1, the Alberta government mandated oil production cuts to help relieve congestion on export pipelines that last year led to a glut of crude building up in storage and the price of Canadian barrels plummeting to record lows.

The move threw a lifeline to oil producers selling their barrels at a loss but has been harshly criticized by integrated companies with refining operations like Suncor Energy and Husky Energy that were benefiting from cheap crude.

On Friday Imperial Oil delayed a C$2.6 billion oil sands project in northern Alberta and laid the blame squarely on the uncertainty generated by government intervention in the market.

The provincial government also plans to lease 4,400 rail cars to transport crude while waiting for long-delayed export pipelines to be built, even though stronger oil prices as a result of curtailments mean rail transportation is no longer economic.

Opposition leader Jason Kenney has promised to rip up those rail contracts if the UCP wins the election, adding to uncertainty in the oil industry.

Notley said her government will continue to manage curtailments and the differential between Canadian and U.S. crude slowly and carefully.

“This is not the long-term solution...Long-term we need more pipelines and more value added in Alberta,” she told a news conference.",Canada's Alberta kicks off final legislature session before election,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKCN1QZ2KG-OCABS

The Liberal government’s fourth and final budget before the election is expected to include measures to help first-time home buyers, seniors and adult Canadians who want to return to school for skills training.

READ MORE: Federal budget 2019 — here are the ‘goodies’ taxpayers can hope for

It’s also expected to take an initial step towards a national pharmacare program and disclose details of previously announced tax credits and incentives, worth $595 million over five years, to help Canada’s ailing journalism industry.

But Finance Minister Bill Morneau will also try to set the narrative for the coming election, arguing that years of deficit spending have put the economy on a stronger footing.

Expect him to credit the Liberals’ investments in infrastructure and other spending measures for the creation of almost 950,000 jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in almost 40 years, and point to the Liberals’ enhanced child benefit for the lowest poverty rate in 10 years.

WATCH: Morneau discusses ‘strange tradition’ of Finance Minister getting new shoes ahead of budget

Moreover, Morneau is expected to boast a better fiscal picture than he anticipated in last fall’s economic update, thanks to an increase in tax revenues despite surprisingly weak economic growth in the final three months of 2018.

The budget is being presented in the midst of a continuing furor over allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to end a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. The affair has so far cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and the country’s top public servant, although he continues to insist no one did anything wrong.

The Liberal-dominated House of Commons justice committee is to meet behind closed doors today to discuss opposition demands for Wilson-Raybould, who’s already given nearly four hours of testimony, to be recalled. She has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period between her mid-January move from Justice to Veterans Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

However, the Liberal MPs on the committee sent a letter to the chair late Monday indicating that they’ll block any further investigation into the matter. They said they’ve heard enough after 13 hours of testimony from 10 different witnesses and they “believe that all rules and laws were followed.” The Liberal MPs said the “appropriate way forward” is to let the federal ethics commissioner conclude his own investigation into the matter.

Tuesday’s budget may at least give the Liberals a short respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

But it will also draw attention to the Liberals’ failure to deliver on a major 2015 campaign promise, to run up annual deficits of no more than $10 billion before balancing the budget by 2019.

Instead, the Trudeau government has posted deficits of more than $18 billion in each of the last two years and has offered no timeline for returning to balance. In his economic update last fall, Morneau projected annual deficits of between $18.1 billion and $19 billion over the next three years.","Liberals to unveil 2019 federal budget, attempt to set stage for fall election",Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5070852/federal-budget-2019-liberals/

“We take the protection of elections on Facebook very seriously, and we are committed to being a force for good in Canadian democracy.”

The social media giant said the tool will require advertisers to “confirm their identities before running political, election-related and issue ads,” and that includes those that refer to candidates.

The news was announced to be in line with the requirements of Bill C-76. The government House Bill C-76, which received Royal Assent on December 13th, 2018, provides rules and regulations on the use of social media during an election campaign.

“Understanding the importance of Bill C-76 and what’s potentially at stake, we’re doing the hard and rigorous work to get our political ads transparency tools right for Canadians. We are approaching our efforts with a Canadian lens in building the Ad Library and other processes, while simultaneously applying learnings from similar efforts around the world,” Keven Chan, head of public policy at Facebook Canada, said.

“We take the protection of elections on Facebook very seriously, and we are committed to being a force for good in Canadian democracy. This is why we devote significant time, energy and resources to these issues.”

Facebook has remained in the hot seat when it comes to meddling in elections campaigns, an issue that has affected many countries, including Canada. The Cambridge Analytica scandal involves the firm that helped US President Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election campaign by harvesting data from millions of Facebook users.

In Canada, 60,000 people were affected by the scandal. More recently the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics (ETHI) concluded its study on Cambridge Analytica and produced recommendations for how Facebook should be involved during elections as well as how the Privacy Commissioner’s office can deal with social media.

Facebook Canda says the Ad Library will store ads related to politics and will be “viewable and searchable by anyone globally for up to seven years.”

The library will also not only house electoral ads but also “issue ads – ads which don’t explicitly back one candidate or political party but that are major issues of national importance.”

Advertisers that want to run these types of ads, which reference political figures, political parties, elections, or issues of national importance, “will have to go through the ad authorization process and comply with all applicable laws.”

Facebook Canada also said it intends to work with the advisory group to get input on political advertising.

The group consists of Megan Leslie, CEO of WWF Canada and former deputy leader of the NDP, Antonia Maioni, dean of the faculty of arts at McGill University, Ry Moran, executive director of the Truth and Reconciliation Centre at University of Manitoba, Ray Novak, managing director of Harper & Associates and chief of staff to former prime minister Stephen Harper and David Zussman, adjunct professor at University of Victoria.

The measures will bring the company into compliance with new federal rules designed to stop foreign interference in the election, as Canada tries to avoid its own version of the Russian interference alleged in the 2016 election in the United States.

The new details come just weeks after Google announced it was throwing in the towel and banning political advertising, complaining that the government’s new political advertising rules are too onerous and legally risky to comply with.

Facebook said the government’s rules, set out in bill C-76, were a “difficult undertaking” but it still plans to have its ad library up and running by the end of June.

“If Parliament had wanted us to ban political ads it would have passed a law that required that,” said Kevin Chan, the head of public policy at Facebook Canada.

Chan said the internet has allowed for democratization of advertising, which allows smaller players to get involved. “It allows for very affordable ads, so smaller players and individuals can participate in the political discourse. We think that’s a very important part,” said Chan.

When the ad library comes into effect in the coming months, all Facebook users will be able to click on a “paid for by …” button on any political ad and see information about its performance, a range of the ad’s cost and the amount of people who saw it. The library will also have demographic information about the people who saw the ad, including age, gender and location. A version of the library already exists in some countries, like Brazil and the United States, but the Canadian version will be customized to comply with the country’s new laws. The ads will be stored in the library for up to seven years.

If Facebook had decided to follow Google’s lead and simply ban the ads, it would have deprived political parties of a huge chunk of the internet’s advertising space. Just under three-quarters of Canadian digital advertising dollars go to either Google or Facebook, according to the Canadian Media Concentration Project.

Facebook’s eagerness to comply comes in the wake of a widespread public relations crisis after the company was partially blamed for Russian interference in the 2016 election in the United States and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, about the cavalier use of personal information.

In response to Google’s decision earlier in the month, Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould said the company was doing it for “business reasons,” and not necessarily because of the “quality of the laws.”

In order to assure that only Canadians are purchasing political ads during the election, Facebook will be authorizing the people who buy them. During the writ period, the company will be scanning ads for political content and checking them against the registry of authorized users and, if the process hasn’t been completed, the company will boot the ads from the platform.

People from across the political spectrum, like former Halifax NDP MP Megan Leslie and Ray Novak, who was chief of staff to former prime minister Stephen Harper, will also be advising the company on what kind of issues will be up for debate in the upcoming election. That advice will be fed into Facebook’s automated system for analyzing political issue advertising, as it tries to uncover potential interference from outside Canada’s borders.

The company is also seeking input from a group of prominent Canadian leaders from diverse political backgrounds.

In compliance with the Elections Modernization Act, Facebook will be launching the Ad Library in Canada to help ensure that authenticity and transparency are at the core of paid election advertising on Facebook.

The social media giant says it will require advertisers to confirm their identities before running any political or election-related ads, including those that refer to candidates.

“Understanding the importance of bill C-76 and what’s potentially at stake, we’re doing the hard and rigorous work to get our political ads transparency tools right for Canadians. We are approaching our efforts with a Canadian lens in building the Ad Library and other processes, while simultaneously applying learnings from similar efforts around the world,” said Kevin Chan, Head of Public Policy at Facebook Canada.







The Ad Library will store ads related to politics targeted to people in Canada and will be viewable and searchable by anyone globally for up to seven years. Furthermore, the Ad Library will cover not only electoral ads but also ‘issue ads’, which don’t explicitly back one candidate or political party but are major issues of national importance.

Advertisers who want to run ads in Canada that reference political figures, political parties, elections, or issues of national importance, will have to go through the ad authorizations process and comply with all applicable laws.

Opposition parties have been calling for the clerk of the Privy Council’s resignation since he first vehemently rejected allegations that he and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Wernick’s combative testimony to the House of Commons justice committee was denounced as partisan and unbecoming a senior bureaucrat who is supposed to be impartial.

In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, Wernick said he will retire before this fall’s federal election campaign kicks off. He noted that the clerk is supposed to be “an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference” occurs during the campaign, as part of a new federal watchdog panel, and is also supposed to be ready to help whichever party is elected to form government — two roles he no longer believes he can fulfil.

“It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” Wernick wrote.

“I wish to relinquish these roles before the election. It is essential that Canadians continue to see their world leading public service as non-partisan and there to provide excellent services to Canadians and the governments they elect.”

Wernick, who has served in senior public service roles for nearly 38 years, has been clerk of the Privy Council since 2016, shortly after the Trudeau Liberals assumed office. Government insiders have said he wanted to retire as clerk a year ago but was persuaded to stay on.

Wilson-Raybould has accused Wernick of making “veiled threats” that she’d lose her job as justice minister and attorney general if she didn’t cave in to pressure last fall from Trudeau and his senior staff to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya. She has said they inappropriately pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Montreal engineering giant, which would have forced the company to pay stiff penalties while avoiding the risk of criminal conviction that could threaten its financial viability.

Wernick has denied the accusation and maintained that all concerned acted with the highest standards of integrity.

Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about undue pressure only surfaced publicly after she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle. She resigned from cabinet a month later. Her exit was followed by the departure of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and the resignation from cabinet earlier this month of Jane Philpott, who cited loss of confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Wernick’s decision to quit as well proves “this SNC-Lavalin scandal is even bigger than we thought,” said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre.

“The reality is, the prime minister’s government is in total crisis mode caused by his personal political interference in a criminal trial … The only person left to resign now is Justin Trudeau himself, whose corrupt government no longer has the confidence of Canadians.”

Trudeau said he intends to name Ian Shugart, currently deputy minister of foreign affairs, to replace Wernick.

On his way into the House of Commons, Trudeau thanked the clerk for his “extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades” and credited his government’s accomplishments “definitely in large part” to Wernick’s leadership of the public service. Trudeau did not respond when asked if he’d sought Wernick’s resignation.

Wernick’s letter was released just minutes before MPs reconvened for their first question period after a two-week March break, an exchange that proved explosive almost from the get-go.

Opposition members erupted in protest when Trudeau announced he’s appointed former Liberal justice minister Anne McLellan as a special adviser to explore what he called “important questions” about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice, who plays a dual role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

McLellan “will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation, of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,” the prime minister said in a statement. “She will consider whether machinery of government or legislative changes may or may not be recommended.”

“Her work will be another important step towards maintaining Canadians’ confidence in their institutions,” he told the Commons.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer mocked the announcement as nothing more than saying “Liberals will investigate Liberals.”

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus ridiculed the idea of a Liberal minister from the era of the sponsorship scandal looking into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which he dubbed “a five alarm dumpster fire.”

As for Wernick, Angus professed no surprise at his decision to retire.

“I think once we saw how much of an active political player Mr. Wernick was in the SNC scandal, it became impossible for him to carry on his job, which is to have the trust of all parliamentarians on key matters of policy,” he said outside the Commons.

Angus also said Wernick should have “known better” in the way he presented himself before the justice committee, suggesting he was combative, evasive and partisan.

“He served our country for many years and in many capacities, but in this scandal, he was serving the prime minister and not the people of Canada.”

Angus also said Wernick should have “known better” in the way he presented himself before the justice committee, suggesting he was combative, evasive and partisan.

MPs on the committee were taken aback when he prefaced his initial testimony with a diatribe about the deteriorating tenor of political discourse, with incitements to violence that he said made him fear someone will be assassinated during the coming election campaign. He cited the example of a Conservative senator who’d urged truckers in a pipeline protest on Parliament Hill to “roll over every Liberal” in the country.

Wernick engaged in a number of testy exchanges with opposition MPs. In a second appearance, he suggested profane messages he received through the social media “vomitorium” after his first appearance amounted to witness intimidation.

The Liberal-dominated committee is to meet Tuesday to consider opposition demands to recall Wilson-Raybould. She has already testified for nearly four hours but has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation a month later.

But the five Liberals on the justice committee — Edmonton’s Randy Boissonault, Toronto-area MPs Iqra Khalid and Ali Ehassi, B.C.’s Ron McKinnon and Nova Scotia’s Colin Fraser — tipped their hand in an open letter to their fellow Liberal who chairs it, Anthony Housefather.

“The committee has heard from principal witnesses in this matter,” their joint letter says, including Wernick, Wilson-Raybould, and Trudeau’s top aide Gerald Butts. They’ve met for 13 hours of testimony over 11 meetings, it says, and “Canadians can judge for themselves the facts, perspectives and relevant legal principles … As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings.”

McLellan’s work and a separate investigation by the federal ethics commissioner will complete the picture, the letter says.

In the Commons, Trudeau himself likewise argued that the committee has been meeting for five weeks and has heard “all perspectives.” He suggested further inquiry should be left to the federal ethics commissioner.",Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick to quit before election in wake of SNC-Lavalin scandal,Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/national/privy-council-clerk-michael-wernick-retires-in-wake-of-snc-lavalin-scandal

In an open letter to the prime minister published on the Government of Canada website, Wernick said that ""recent events have led me to conclude that I cannot serve as Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to Cabinet during the upcoming election campaign,"" and that he intends to retire before the election is called.

Wernick said that there ""is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties,"" after both the Conservatives and New Democrats have called for his resignation given his role in the still unfolding SNC-Lavalin controversy.

He was directly named by Jody Wilson-Raybould as one of the senior officials who she alleges was involved in a ""sustained effort"" to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. She accused Wernick of issuing ""veiled threats"" if she did not change her mind about instructing federal prosecutors to pursue a remediation agreement rather than continuing with the criminal trial.

During his two appearances before the House Justice Committee on this matter, Wernick delivered direct and sometimes terse responses to MPs' questions about his alleged involvement. He denied ever making any threats in relation to Wilson-Raybould’s handling of the criminal case against the Quebec company, as she had alleged.

""The minister experienced lawful advocacy to consider doing something lawful in the public interest. I made no threats, veiled or otherwise, that the minister’s decision would lead to consequences for her…It is my contention the minister was doing her job and I was doing mine,"" Wernick testified earlier this month.

He also raised eyebrows during his first round of testimony when he offered off-topic opening remarks on the state of online discourse, partisanship and the prospect of political assassinations in the upcoming campaign.

In addition to concerns over his behaviour and perceived partisan comments as part of the SNC-Lavalin affair, MPs have also registered their discomfort with a related role he held: being part of a high-level panel responsible for deciding when and how to inform Canadians about concerning online behaviour during an election campaign.

NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus sent an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prior to Wernick’s second round of testimony, saying that Wernick was ""deeply compromised,"" has ""overstepped his role,"" and could not remain in his position. As of last week, the PMO had confirmed to CTV News that Wernick still had the confidence of the PM.

""It is essential that during the writ period the Clerk be seen by all political parties as an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference has occurred,"" Wernick said in his letter. ""It is essential that Canadians continue to see their world leading public service as non-partisan and there to provide excellent services to Canadians and the governments they elect.""

The precise timing of his departure is unclear, with Wernick saying it is something he and Trudeau ""should discuss.""

Trudeau announced Monday that he intends to appoint current deputy minister of foreign affairs Ian Shugart as Wernick's replacement, ""in the coming weeks.""

Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould told reporters that the makeup of the panel — the Clerk of the Privy Council, Canada’s National Security Adviser, and the deputy ministers of the justice, public safety, and global affairs departments — will not change.

""When it comes to our elections, safeguarding them, protecting them from foreign interference is of top priority… this will continue to guide those individuals should they have to inform Canadians of foreign interference,"" Gould said.

Minutes after announcing the major shakeup to the leadership of the public service, Trudeau thanked Wernick for his service.

Wernick has been a public servant under both Liberal and Conservative governments over the last three decades.

""We've accomplished a lot as a government over these past three and a half years and it was definitely in large part because of the extraordinary public service and Michael Wernick's leadership within that. ""He will be missed,"" Trudeau told reporters in the House of Commons foyer.

Opposition MPs seized on the latest development in what has become a string of high-profile resignations in the aftermath of the initial report of alleged PMO pressure, published in The Globe and Mail.

""Now we have an attorney general who has resigned, a Treasury Board president who has resigned, a top adviser to the prime minister who has resigned, and now the head of the public service itself has stepped down… the only person left to resign now is Justin Trudeau himself,"" said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who was celebrating his first day in the House as an MP, said that more than ever, a public inquiry is needed into the SNC-Lavalin case.

A year after the so-called mortgage stress test came into effect, the mortgage underwriting guidelines are being targeted by Conservative politicians ahead of a provincial and general election.

Alberta United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, a speaker at the Calgary Real Estate Board on Jan. 30, said the mortgage stress test was punitive to prospective Alberta homeowners and out of touch with housing markets in the province.

“One of the reasons why homes are less affordable in Alberta today is because of unfair rules imposed by Ottawa to deal with the overheated real estate markets in Toronto and Vancouver,” Kenney said.

“The so-called ‘stress test’ imposed by the CMHC (Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation) has put tens of thousands of Albertans out of reach of home ownership, diminishing the value of the homes they can buy, to deal with the real estate market in Toronto and Vancouver.”

READ MORE: Canadian home sales fall in February, average price down 5.2% year-over-year

Kenney went on to say that the mortgage stress test came into effect in January 2018, in the middle of Alberta’s post-oil price shock-fueled recession.

“We did not have the risk of overheating nationally. They did have the risk of overheating in Toronto and Vancouver. They took out a bazooka rather than a fly swatter to take care of the problem.”

READ MORE: Jason Kenney wants Alberta exemption on housing stress test

Calgary-Shepard Conservative MP Tom Kmiec also took aim at the stress test in a House of Commons debate on affordable housing on Jan. 31, calling the CMHC regulations “a one-size-fits-all tool that punishes Canadians from coast to coast to coast, regardless of the prices in their local markets.”

What’s the allegation?

Kenney and Kmiec purport that the mortgage stress test is unfair to Albertans and punishes them for overheating housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver. They also say the stress test has put “tens of thousands of Albertans out of reach of home ownership.”

They call for the mortgage stress test to be scrapped in Alberta.

What are the facts?

The stress test is applicable to all prospective home buyers with a less-than-20 per cent down payment — the buyers who require mortgage insurance offered by CMHC and two private insurers.

Those home buyers are evaluated on whether they could pay their mortgage if interest rates went up by two per cent above their current rate. The interest rate rise also serves as a proxy to other financial stresses a household might face, like a job loss or a reduction in income.

The stress test was passed along to Canada’s federally-regulated financial institutions in guideline B-20, “Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures,” from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). It is the latest in a series of mechanisms designed to stabilize house prices across Canada.

“The federal government and CMHC were looking at things like price-to-income ratios and price-to-rent ratios and noted that, globally, Canada is at the top end of those ratios,” said David Dale-Johnson, the Stan Melton Chair in Real Estate at the University of Alberta School of Business.

“In other words, housing prices here are pretty high relative to most other places around the world. Their concern is that Canadians are overextended with respect to their purchases of housing.”

What do the experts say?

While the CMHC’s mission stated on its website is “to make housing affordable for everyone in Canada,” housing prices were running away from being affordable in cities other than Toronto and Vancouver, with areas like Ontario’s Golden Horseshoe, Victoria and the greater Lower Mainland who were getting most of that overheating in 2017.

The size of the Toronto and Vancouver markets in proportion to the national housing market gave good reason for regulatory intervention, especially in the event houses in the 416 and 604 area codes experience a downturn.

“When you have Toronto and Vancouver representing more than half of home resales across Canada, they do register at the national level,” Dale-Johnson said. “You have to pay attention to what’s going on and, if it’s overheating, the risk of the market turning down with the potential of a brutal decline that could disrupt the market with a significant price decline — just for the sake of the stability of the market — it did make sense.”

“If we go back a couple of years prior to the oil price shock, there were some worries in Edmonton and Calgary,” Dale-Johnson added.

Before the stress test, insured mortgage eligibility requirements changed to include an increase in the minimum credit score, reducing the amortization period to 25 years from 30, limiting the home price tag mortgage insurance would cover, among others.

Vancouver introduced a one per cent empty homes tax in November 2016 and the Ontario government announced its Fair Housing Plan in April 2017, which included a foreign buyers tax and expanded rent controls.

In addition to stabilizing housing prices, the B-20 guideline is designed to reduce the number of Canadians with high mortgage debts.

“They are particularly focused on reducing the share of borrowers who are highly-indebted, so those borrowers who are seeking high loan-to-value mortgages,” CMHC senior analyst James Cuddy said.

“And there’s evidence to show that the share of mortgages going toward highly-indebted individuals is declining in Calgary and Edmonton.”

This probably a good thing, according to RBC senior economist Robert Hogue.

“Alberta households are the most indebted in Canada,” Hogue told Global News.

“Household debt has been identified by the Bank of Canada and many of us in the private sector as a key vulnerability to the health of the economy.

“High household debt may exacerbate the outcome” of the next downturn in the economy, Hogue said, adding the prudent course of action is to keep focusing on debt.

How indebted are Albertans?

Nationwide, Canadians have a debt-to-income ratio of 179 per cent to start 2019. Put another way, on average, for every dollar a Canadian earns, she or he owes $1.79. That’s the highest it’s been since records began in 1990.

According to an RBC economics report published in April 2018, Albertans’ total debts rose from $164,000 per household in 2010 to $192,000 in 2016, the highest of the 10 provinces. As of 2016, RBC says Alberta’s households spend 15.2 per cent of their disposable income servicing debt.

On Wednesday, Statistics Canada said Canadian households are spending even more to service their debt.

“Debt-to-income levels remain relatively high in both markets (Calgary and Edmonton). Part of the reason OSFI revised B-20 was to address this issue,” Cuddy added.

Moody’s, the international credit service, released a report Thursday saying “Canadian consumers are increasingly vulnerable to an adverse economic scenario despite stabilized household debt and low unemployment.”

What else do I need to know?

If a buyer has to qualify for a mortgage at a higher rate, does that affect how much house they can buy? Put simply, yes.

“The stress test had the biggest impact on the budget of buyers,” Hogue said.

“They have to have 20 per cent more income than they used to have or they would be buying a house that’s 20 per cent cheaper than they would have liked to have bought,” Dale-Johnson said.

In addition to lowering the budget Canadians are working with when buying a home, Mortgage Professionals Canada — a mortgage industry association — estimates a July 2018 report, that “about 100,000 Canadians have actually been prevented from buying a home.”

Credit report and credit score company Equifax recently said that consumer delinquency rates are on the rise in Canada.

Equifax reports that non-mortgage debt amounts are trending up in Alberta, with delinquencies increasing in Calgary but decreasing in Edmonton.

READ MORE: What you probably don’t know about renewing your mortgage

“Delinquency rates have much more to do with the state of the economy rather than interest rates or property values or size of mortgage,” Hogue said. “Delinquency rates, especially mortgage delinquency rates, correlates very highly with the unemployment rate.

“So what you’re witnessing in Alberta is the weakening in the provincial economy that is taking a toll on a number of borrowers that are facing some difficult situations,” the RBC senior economist added. “Rising interest rates possibly exacerbate the matter.”

According to the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada, more Albertans and Canadians are declaring bankruptcy — Alberta alone saw a 9.9 per cent increase in the 2018 calendar year.

Does the stress test unfairly punish Albertans?

For Hogue, one of the benefits of the stress test is a reduced debt load for Albertans who are already in a tough economy.

While reducing or eliminating the stress test could help increase house-buying budgets in the short term, market economic basics would kick in and increase demand and prices.

“While policymakers making changes might be well-intended, at the end of the day you’re not solving the basic issue of housing affordability,” Hogue said.

Hogue argued in a Feb. 28 report that the solution to getting more people into buying houses is to increase the supply of houses affordable to those entering the market.

According to ATB Financial, a record number of completed homes remain vacant and unpurchased in Edmonton, with Calgary reaching record numbers, as well. The provincial financial institution did not include a breakdown of the prices of those homes.

For the University of Alberta housing economist, the downturn in oil prices in 2015 took a lot of momentum out of the province’s housing market.

“If you look at Alberta separate from the rest of the country, I’d be inclined to think that you would not have needed a stress test because the oil price shock has taken care of any problem that might have arisen,” Dale-Johnson said.

The stress test isn’t the only reason it’s been difficult for Albertans to buy homes, according to Cuddy.

“The caveat is that it’s very difficult to disentangle the individual effects when looking at an environment in Calgary and Edmonton where we have some real challenges in the economy and higher interest rates as well,” Cuddy said. “Understanding the magnitude of the stress tests in terms of impact is difficult to assess.”

“Anywhere in Canada it’s hard to put together a down payment and finally get into home ownership,” Hogue said. “The bar is the highest it’s ever been in the country.

“At the same time, you don’t want to put young families, young households, at risk down the road of an even worse outcome.

“Knowing that Alberta households are the most indebted in Canada, that’s something to keep in mind when criticizing the type of policy that was really designed to address issues elsewhere but they are applicable to situations in Alberta.”

“If you want to help millennials or first time home buyers, focus on the economy,” Hogue said.

What can a premier do?

Given that the OSFI and CMHC are an independent federal agency and Crown corporation, respectively, premiers of any province are unable to do away with the mortgage stress test. The best they can hope for is to lobby and convince the finance minister and the executives of the OSFI and CMHC to change the mortgage stress test.

Whether or not they should is a question of caution.

Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau — whose purview includes the OSFI and CMHC — is set to table the pre-election budget on March 19, where he could relax mortgage eligibility requirements, lengthen the amortization of mortgages (the amount of time to pay a mortgage off, reducing monthly mortgage payments) or increase the amount a home buyer can withdraw from an RRSP for a house purchase.",Alberta Election Fact Check: Time to end the mortgage stress test?,SooToday,https://www.sootoday.com/global-news/alberta-election-fact-check-time-to-end-the-mortgage-stress-test-1324714

In a week that the Liberals would much rather be talking about pre-election budget goodies, the SNC-Lavalin saga looks set to overshadow events once again.

Talk to my lawyer: With a federal ethics investigation into the SNC-Lavalin controversy underway, as well as the potential for an RCMP probe, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several key members of the PMO have lawyered up. Trudeau, along with his advisors Katie Telford, Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques have hired outside legal counsel to advise them on the case. (Globe and Mail)

Meanwhile, Trudeau’s former top advisor Gerald Butts remains out of work, which doesn’t sit right with Andrew MacDougall. Why, he asks, should Butts be the only one to go?:

If there’s one thing most Canadians can get behind, it’s that nobody should ever lose their job over a silly misunderstanding. We believe in fairness much too much to let such an injustice pass. That’s why it’s time for Trudeau to pick a lane on SNC. Either nobody did anything wrong, or everybody did something wrong. It’s either everybody involved gets fired, or Gerry Butts gets re-hired. (Maclean’s)

A budget to save the housing market: With home prices starting to tumble the Trudeau government will use its pre-election budget on Tuesday to encourage Canadians to buy more houses. It’s not clear exactly what housing measures the budget will contain, but citing a government source, Canadian Press reports Finance Minister Bill Morneau will target issues related to real estate “supply, demand and regulation”. (Canadian Press)

Budget smudget, more about SNC: Tomorrow isn’t just budget day though, and the Conservatives are doing their darndest to remind Canadians of that. The justice committee will meet behind closed doors tomorrow morning to debate whether to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify a second time. A Conservative threat to delay the release of the budget if the Liberals block Wilson-Raybould’s return was itself blocked by procedural maneuvering by the Liberals. (CBC News)

Déjà Vu: For the third time in three months Trudeau will shuffle his cabinet today to replace Jane Philpott as Treasury Board president, after she resigned from cabinet two weeks ago. Among the names being bandied about: Public Services and Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough and Joyce Murray, who currently serves as parliamentary secretary to the president of the Treasury Board. (CBC News)

Christchurch: In the wake of the terror attacks on two mosques in New Zealand, political party leaders from around the world denounced the massacre and expressed support for the victims. Not so Maxime Bernier, leader of the People’s Party of Canada. Why? “As a rule I don’t comment on these horrible tragedies in other countries. Period,” he tweeted, apparently oblivious to his own lengthy tweet history of condemning terror attacks when the perpetrators are Muslim. Stephen Maher examines why Bernier can’t bring himself to speak out against the Christchurch attacks:

Since Bernier rarely spoke about immigration issues before launching his party, he looks like a callow opportunist, seeking to peel off some of [Conservative Leader Andrew] Scheer’s voters by giving them messages that Scheer cannot deliver without alienating multicultural suburban voters. (Maclean’s)

After Andrew Scheer‘s initial statement about the attack was criticized for not mentioning the victims were Muslim, he issued a longer statement on Friday, and then visited a mosque in his hometown of Regina to meet with religious leaders. (Facebook, Twitter)

Singh in the House: Today is NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh’s first day in the House. After being sworn in Sunday, he thanked his supporters: “Any time you achieve anything, there are so many people that made it possible. You never do it alone.” However Singh’s problem going into this fall’s election is he’s more alone than almost any other federal leader in history when it comes to incumbent support. At least 32 per cent of NDP incumbents have said they won’t run again, far higher than the average of 12 per cent for federal parties going back to the 1940s. Only Kim Campbell’s doomed re-election campaign in 1993 had less incumbent support. (CBC News, Global News)

The Liberals, meanwhile, lost another incumbent over the weekend. Don Rusnak, the first Indigenous MP to represent the riding of Thunder Bay-Rainy River, said he won’t be running again this fall, citing “family commitments”. As some have noted, his statement was noticeably absent of any mention of gratitude towards Trudeau, let alone even mentioning the prime minister’s name. (Twitter)

Weekend politics shows round-up

If you didn’t catch the weekend political shows, here’s what you missed:

Ahead of the release of the federal budget on Tuesday, Labour Minister Patty Hajdu appeared on CBC’s The House. She steered away from addressing the Trudeau government’s refusal to provide a timeline for a balanced budget, and kept the focus instead on increased spending for skills training: “What people are talking to me the most about is not a balanced budget but what are we going to do about the labour shortage.” (CBC News)

Weeks after Canada’s ambassador to the U.S. first predicted America would lift its steel and aluminum tariffs “in the next few weeks,” David MacNaughton is still confident the tariffs will be nixed. When? “In the next few weeks. … It’s not just because I think we’ve done a good job of improving our relationship with the United States,” he said on Global’s West Block. “These tariffs are hurting them.” (Global News)

On CTV’s Question Period Jagmeet Singh continued his push for a national public inquiry into the Trudeau government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin file. “The fact that high-ranking people in the Prime Minister’s office don’t care about political interference and don’t care about legality shows that this is a Prime Minister and a Prime Minister’s Office that does not care about the rule of law.” (CTV News tweet)

Liberal MP Francis Drouin continued to argue on Question Period that there is no point in having Jody Wilson-Raybould testify about what happened after she was shuffled out of the role of attorney general. “The Prime Minister has already lifted client cabinet confidentiality for the time that the attorney general was in the attorney general’s role and all the testimony that we’ve heard at committee predates January 14,” said Drouin. Not so, replied host Evan Solomon, noting that Trudeau’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts as well as Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, not to mention Trudeau, all spoke about events following that date: “You know who the only person is who hasn’t been able to speak about that? Jody Wilson-Raybould.” (CTV News tweet)

The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading c ...","(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s next budget will look very familiar, with Justin Trudeau set to spend much of a revenue windfall and continued red ink in his government’s books.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.

None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.

“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.

The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of C$18.1 billion ($13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totaling C$76.8 billion.

The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labor market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.

Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 percent of gross domestic product.

“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by C$10 billion, to C$7.7 billion, and fall to C$12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.

Skills Training

Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modeled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”

That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly-skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”

On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday. Her father was charged with first degree murder and died a few days later in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We’re mere weeks into a new year and there have been at least four femicides across Canada already. It’s time for us to demand that the lives of women and girls in Canada be prioritized.",The Election Issue That Isn’t Even On Politicians’ Radar,Chatelaine,https://www.chatelaine.com/opinion/femicide-the-election-issue-that-isnt-even-on-politicians-radar/

Andy Blatchford, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- When the Liberals release the last budget of their mandate Tuesday, Canadians can expect to hear arguments that years of deficit spending have put the economy on stronger footing.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau has promised the budget will contain help for workers in need of skills training, young people looking to buy their first homes, seniors worried about their own finances, and patients with high drug costs.

""It's an election budget ... There's been a tendency to use these as important communications vehicles -- almost platform-launching vehicles,"" Kevin Page, Canada's former parliamentary budget officer, said in reference to recent budgets from federal and multiple provincial governments.

The likelihood that the Liberals will use the budget to sell their own record raises a question: who deserves credit for Canada's strong economic run?

Job-creation numbers have been solid and the unemployment rate has fallen close to a 40-year low. A recent Statistics Canada report said in 2017 fewer Canadians were living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade. The agency credited the drop to a mix of a stronger economy and the Liberals' enhancement of child benefits.

Canada rode a long stretch of impressive economic growth until the final three months of 2018 before it abruptly decelerated -- and nearly stalled -- along with a drop in oil prices. Experts predict the economy will regain its momentum over the coming months.

But even with a surprisingly weak end to 2018, Ottawa's financial situation is better than last November's fall fiscal update projected.

Experts say the federal treasury pulled in more tax revenues than anticipated. Many fully expect the Liberals to dedicate the bulk of the extra money to new promises, as they've done with windfalls in past budgets and economic statements.

Over the last few years, the Liberals have spent billions more than they promised in their 2015 election platform.

They vowed to post annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to return to balance by 2019. Instead, they've posted shortfalls of more than $18 billion in each of the last two years and have offered no timeline to balance the budget. In their November update, the Liberals projected annual deficits of between $18.1 billion and $19 billion over the next three years.

Morneau has regularly argued that the Liberal plan is working.

""Our government has made smart and responsible investments in the middle class, and Canadians are seeing concrete results,"" Morneau told the House of Commons last month as he announced the budget date.

Morneau has argued the bigger-ticket commitments, in areas such as child benefits and infrastructure, have been necessary to juice the economy for years to come. He's also insisted the deficits remain small enough that they're fiscally prudent.

Page expects the Liberals to take credit for the economic improvements and he thinks they deserve some recognition -- particularly for enhancing child benefits and an ambitious, expensive infrastructure plan, despite its slow start.

But he added Canada's prospects have also been lifted by strong economic performances in the United States and the world as a whole.

Page said it's difficult to know whether the Liberal deficits will actually raise Canada's long-term growth or if they've mostly created a big, temporary bump in consumer spending, as the government has borrowed money and put it into Canadians pockets.

""You don't have to be at balance. There's nothing perfect about a zero (deficit) number in this environment,"" said Page, who now heads the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy think-tank at the University of Ottawa. ""Having said that, we are adding to the stock of debt and that creates potential instability down the road and we'll have less room to manoeuvre -- and future generations, definitely, are going to pay higher interest costs on the public debt.""

The Opposition Conservatives, some economists and leaders in corporate Canada have criticized the Liberal deficits, especially because they've come during good economic times that are traditionally thought to be when governments should pay debt off.

""My concern is, and I've said this to him ... privately and publicly, it's not that you're spending, it's where you're spending,"" Goldy Hyder, CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said of his exchanges with Morneau. ""You're spending a lot on things that no one can really point to and can say (there's a) direct line back to helping the economy.""

Hyder said he supported Morneau's move last fall to use some fiscal space for new accelerated investment write-offs for businesses. He also applauds the Liberals' commitment to invest in worker training in Tuesday's budget and their earlier efforts on trade, immigration and child benefits.

But he insists there's an urgent need for Canada to be more competitive on regulations and taxes if it hopes to avoid falling behind the rest of the world.","Liberal budget to applaud Canada's economy, but who deserves credit?",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/liberal-budget-to-applaud-canada-s-economy-but-who-deserves-credit-1.4341306

Peter McKenna, a political scientist at the University ...","CHARLOTTETOWN — The governing P.E.I. Liberals are expected to send Island voters to the polls as early as this spring, but despite a booming economy the party is likely facing a rough ride.

The smallest province's economy is on fire — the Conference Board of Canada says it will lead the country in economic growth over the next year.

But the Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs Premier Wade MacLauchlan — a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier — is personally unpopular.

A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released this month suggests the Green party has a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals are in third place, the poll suggests.

CRA president Margaret Brigley said satisfaction with the government has been declining.

""Right now there's 51-per-cent satisfied. Based on our history, we see when satisfaction falls below 51 per cent it's not necessarily likely that party will be voted back in. They're right at the threshold right now,"" she said.

The Charlottetown Guardian newspaper said in an editorial this week the Liberal party may have no choice but to switch leaders if it hopes to win the election.

Peter McKenna, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said in an interview there's a strong desire for change among Island voters.

""What we're seeing is even though the economy is very strong here on Prince Edward Island, it's not translating into support for the governing party. More specifically, it's not translating into support for Wade MacLauchlan as leader of the party and premier,"" he said.

McKenna said MacLauchlan's leadership style is seen as ""too top-down, too dictatorial, that the public is not being properly consulted or listened to.""

""I quite frankly don't think that the Liberals are going to be able to hold onto power in the next election if he's the leader of the party,"" McKenna said.

The current standings in the Island legislature are 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member.

McKenna said that even with a lead in the polls, Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker will have to assemble enough credible candidates in the Island's 27 ridings if he hopes to have a chance to form Canada's first Green government.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

""Islanders are desperate for something different. They're tired of politics as usual. They think the change agent is the Green party and Peter Bevan-Baker,"" he said.

The Tories saw a slight bump in the polls after choosing their new leader last month.

Brigley says voters may be looking to give someone else a turn after three terms of Liberal government, starting with then-premier Robert Ghiz 12 years ago.

The government doesn't have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7, under the province's fixed-date election provisions, but there have been indications the Liberals want to go early in an effort not to overlap with the federal election this fall.

MacLauchlan and Island cabinet ministers have made a series of funding announcements this month, joined by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several federal ministers.

And this week the provincial government released its third-quarter forecast for 2018-2019, showing a projected surplus of $13.8 million — up from a budgeted surplus of $1.5 million.

The P.E.I. election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform — asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model.

In an open letter to the prime minister published on the Government of Canada website, Wernick said that “recent events have led me to conclude that I cannot serve as Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to Cabinet during the upcoming election campaign,” and that he intends to retire before the election is called.

Wernick said that there “is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties,” after both have called for his resignation given his role in the still unfolding SNC-Lavalin controversy.

He was directly named by Jody Wilson-Raybould as one of the senior officials who she alleges was involved in a “sustained effort” to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. She accused Wernick of issuing “veiled threats” if she did not change her mind about instructing federal prosecutors to pursue a remediation agreement rather than continuing with the criminal trial.

During his two appearances before the House Justice Committee on this matter, Wernick delivered direct and sometimes terse responses to MPs’ questions about his alleged involvement. He denied ever making any threats in relation to Wilson-Raybould’s handling of the criminal case against the Quebec company, as she had alleged.

“The minister experienced lawful advocacy to consider doing something lawful in the public interest. I made no threats, veiled or otherwise, that the minister’s decision would lead to consequences for her…It is my contention the minister was doing her job and I was doing mine,” Wernick testified earlier this month.

He also raised eyebrows during his first round of testimony when he offered off-topic opening remarks on the state of online discourse, partisanship and the prospect of political assassinations in the upcoming campaign.

In addition to concerns over his behaviour and perceived partisan comments as part of the SNC-Lavalin affair, MPs have also registered their discomfort with a related role he held: being part of a high-level panel responsible for deciding when and how to inform Canadians about concerning online behaviour during an election campaign.

NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus sent an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prior to Wernick’s second round of testimony, saying that Wernick was ""deeply compromised,"" has ""overstepped his role,"" and could not remain in his position. As of last week, the PMO had confirmed to CTV News that Wernick still had the confidence of the PM.

Trudeau announced Monday that he intends to appoint current deputy minister of foreign affairs Ian Shugart as Wernick’s replacement, “in the coming weeks.”

In the statement announcing the major shakeup to the leadership of the public service, Trudeau thanked Wernick for “his support over the last few years as we worked to implement an ambitious agenda to build a better future for the people and communities at the heart of this country.”

More to come.

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

In October 2018, Liberal MP, Patty Hajdu in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding announced she would be seeking re-election.

23,Business,2019-03-19T09:37:00.0000000Z,Former Competition Bureau commissioner John Pecman notes a federal election is looming ... laws governing corporate competition reflect Canada’s outdated view of itself as primarily a ...,"Canadians like to believe they live in one of the most sophisticated free-market economies in the world. Don’t tell that to John Pecman. Until May of last year, Pecman was commissioner of the Competition Bureau, the agency responsible for enforcing anti-competitive practices in the Canadian marketplace.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Want Justice? Then Let the Youth Lead When The Tyee’s Katie Hyslop won a major honour, here’s how she used the platform it provided.

After he stepped down in September 2018, he published an article in the Canadian Competition Law Review that called for reforms to give the bureau more power to check corporate concentration, including added independence by separating it from the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development.

In a phone interview with The Tyee last week, Pecman elaborated, saying that federal laws governing corporate competition reflect Canada’s outdated view of itself as primarily a resource exporter and otherwise unable to compete with the big U.S. economy next door.

This led to laws favouring corporate consolidation in the name of “efficiency” over promoting competition or the interests of consumers.

The Competition Bureau he ran lacks the independence that would make it truly effective, he said — a vulnerability to political meddling that brings to mind other headline grabbing moments in Ottawa of late.

“Scarce enforcement resources” further erode the bureau’s ability to take initiative, he noted. The Trudeau government trimmed the bureau’s already strained budget to help cover a $950-million industry initiative called “superclusters,” says Pecman.

When it comes to not just studying market concentration but moving to break it up, says Pecman, Canada is “so far behind other western economies on this front. The fact that the country does not treat competition policy seriously is just a great disappointment to someone who has spent his entire life working in this area.”

Here is more of what Pecman, who spent 34 years at the bureau and now is senior business advisor at the nation-wide law firm Fasken, had to say...

On why it’s time to get the Competition Bureau out of the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development:

“If you look at any international body’s recommendations on institutional framework and design for competition authorities, the number one no-no is to be housed in the industry department that’s there supporting business, particular [corporate] ‘national champions.’ Of course the industry department is probably the most lobbied department, so there’s the perception of political interference.”

On years of competition law foot-dragging in Canada:

“Competition law has been sort of shunned to the side, other than there were some serious amendments in 2010. I think particularly when you’re reading the papers today and [headlines reflecting] the angst about monopolies and IT giants, and corporate concentration and income inequality, we haven’t heard much from the government on any plans to study these issues.

“There have been calls outside of my requests from time to time to look at the law. For example, Carolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada. During her speech this past year at the G7, she raised a concern about the growth of the IT giants and its impact on labour.”

On ‘scarce resources’ and ignored cases:

“Notably, on the abuse of [corporate market] dominance or consumer protection and deceptive marketing practices, particularly on the latter part, we receive more complaints than we have resources. We have to be careful, the bureau does, where to invest our scarce enforcement resources.”

On the big 2008 recommendation never enacted:

“If you are familiar at all with the competition review policy report done by L.R. (Red) Wilson [for the Canadian Council of Chief Executives] back in 2008... the largest recommendation that they made was to create an independent Canadian competitiveness council that would report to parliament that would do the advocacy and the policy work for competition. And that was not adopted by the previous government or this government.”

On how Canada lags behind other nations, hurting innovation:

“There is a huge gap. Most countries around the world have their competition authorities spending significant budgets to work in terms of promoting competition. In Canada, that’s just not the case. It depends on the discretion of the commissioner. There is no expressed authority to do it.

“To me, there needs to be some clarification of the importance of competition policy and advocacy in Canada with expressed authority to do that kind of work — whether it’s referred back to an independent competitiveness council to do the work or give the authority to the competition bureau. Someone has to do it.

“It’s hurting the competitiveness of the country not focusing on that, including the innovation agenda. The number one driver of innovation is competition.”

On why the Competition Bureau is ‘spinning its wheels’ because it can’t make regulations:

“We are so far behind other western economies on this front. It’s just disappointing. The fact that the country does not treat competition policy seriously is just a great disappointment to someone who has spent his entire life working in this area, knowing how powerful it is.

“Let’s take a good example — FinTech (Financial Technology). We engaged in a serious market study on the whole question of financial services technology. We put together a significant consultation and put out a report with 30 recommendations, including moving to an open banking system whereby consumers can move their banking data easily to competitors, whether it’s FinTechs or other banks, to facilitate competition, lower prices, better services.

“The government, in its last speech in the throne, identified this as important and in finances started to look at the issue.

“But in England, their competition authority did a robust market study because [unlike Canada] they can compel information from companies. Then it issued regulations. So England is about a year ahead of us. They’ve actually implemented open banking. And the FinTech companies and services and banking service fees have gone down significantly in the U.K. And FinTech is twice the size in Europe as it is in Canada.

“So there’s an example of the importance of competition advocacy in changes by government to facilitate competition and the benefits to the marketplace, where consumers have greater choice, lower prices, better services, better quality.

“And so, we’re spinning our wheels on open banking. The finance department is going to study this for years and who knows where it is going to end up?

“It just speaks to the lower priority competition policy has in Canada, in my view, compared to Europe, Australia, the U.S.”

On why Canada tolerates such high corporate concentration:

“I think it has to do with the fact is that we’re a small open economy next to the U.S. Economic thinking back in the ‘60s was that we needed to have large economies of scale in order to be competitive internationally. And of course, Canada has significant barriers to foreign competition in many sectors, whether it’s the financial services, transport, agriculture, just go down the list.

“The government has created economic policies that create corporate concentration, with the view of becoming more competitive internationally. I think that’s the thinking behind it. Whether it’s been successful or not, you can be the judge of that.”

On why ‘efficiencies’ enriching corporate shareholders supersede consumer interests:

“The ‘efficiencies defence’ was part of that thinking [that], in Canada, having larger companies to compete internationally was important. So this defence, which is an outright defence [supporting] an anti-competitive merger, was implemented. And we’re unique in that. I think we’re the only major economy in the world that has this defence, whereby an anti-competitive merger could proceed because of cost savings. Sometimes just static cost savings going to shareholders are more significant than potential higher prices to consumers or other businesses.

“It’s something that I don’t believe we should be an outlier on.”

On how consumer resentment may fuel populism:

“I just think [the efficiencies defence] needs a rethink, particularly when you’re looking at the whole issue of populism, corporate concentration and income inequality. In Canada, we can clear mergers to create increases in concentrations — further increases in concentration — because of cost savings that go to shareholders from a merger transaction. Increases that could be one-time, that do not benefit the economy at all writ large.”

On Canada’s own monopoly game, and why it’s rigged:

“I’m concerned about the rules that have created the concentration in Canada. Concentration per se, is not a problem. That is the end game for any company in a business — they want to become a monopoly. And if you earned organically and not through anti-competitive processes, more power to you! You’ve got a better mouse trap, you can reap the monopoly benefits of that.

“That’s not what competition laws are designed to prevent. They’re preventing abuses in a monopoly situation, or once you’ve emerged to become a monopoly. That’s what competition laws are in place to do.

“So really, the concentration piece doesn’t bother me, it’s how these companies are able to obtain concentration in Canada. It’s not through open, competitive markets. It’s through protection from government, protecting companies against competition.

“That’s the concern I have in Canada, with regard to our foreign investment rules, our supply management rules, our efficiency defences — those are my concerns with our process in Canada.”

On whether corporate concentration and competition could be an election issue this fall:

“I think it’s starting to make its way back to the front pages, and people may be following. But generally speaking, it’s an obtuse area that most don’t pay attention to. And so it rarely makes it as a priority in politicians’ platforms because it’s not a big vote-getter at the end of the day.

“But there’s a federal election coming up and, you know, what better way of targeting the middle class or consumers than saying there’s going to be a review of the Competition Act, given the growing concern about corporate concentration. To me it’s an easy, low-hanging fruit. But I haven’t seen any talk about that yet in Canada.”",Monopoly-Friendly Canada ‘Does Not Treat Competition Policy Seriously’,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/03/19/Monopoly-Friendly-Canada-Competition-Policy/

Badiei comes from an engineering background, having started her career at BC Hydro working on grid-scale transmission planning.

She then spent a couple of years with a power company in California before jumping into a string of humanitarian positions — in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Philippines with Doctors Without Borders; in Afghanistan working to treat municipal water with the Red Cross; and in Jerusalem as an energy specialist with the World Bank.

Several Liberal MPs were on hand at Port Moody’s Old Orchard Hall to welcome Badiei’s nomination, including Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam MP Ron McKinnon, Burnaby North-Seymour MP Terry Beech, and Harjit Sajjan, Minister of National Defence and MP for Vancouver South.

While the Conservative Party has yet to choose its candidate for the Port Moody-Coquitlam race, on Friday, Coquitlam City Coun. Bonita Zarrillo launched her bid to represent the NDP in this year’s election.

Zarrillo will be competing against Sean Lee, who currently works as communications director of the electoral district’s executive. Both have less than three weeks to prepare for the NDP nomination scheduled on March 31.

The federal riding of Port Moody–Coquitlam was left wide open when NDP MP Fin Donnelly — who has held the seat for nearly a decade — announced in December he would not be running for re-election.

Now, Saskatchewan’s longest-serving Conservative Member of Parliament — and one of just a few left from the Canadian Alliance days — says he won’t stand for re-election when Canadians go to the polls in the fall.

“We’ve put in six terms and at some point there’s a reason to go back to a normal life, particularly around family life,” Anderson said, adding that he spends about two-thirds of his time away from his wife, Sheila.

“It’s time that we started living our life together, not apart, and really enjoying our time together.”

Anderson was first elected to represent Cypress Hills — Grassland in 2000, and was re-elected with wide margins in five subsequent elections. In 2015, he won more than 25,000 votes, good for 69 per cent of the total.

In an interview on Monday, the veteran MP — among current members, only Liberal Ralph Goodale has held a Saskatchewan seat for longer — said he is most proud of the role he played in dissolving the Canadian Wheat Board.

At the time of the still-controversial decision, Anderson was Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and the Canadian Wheat Board, a supporting role for former agriculture minister and Saskatchewan MP Gerry Ritz.

It is not immediately clear who will seek the nomination in the riding, one of the safest Conservative Party of Canada seats in the country. A party spokesman said the date for a nomination meeting has not been set.

“David — thank you for your dedication and your service to SW Sask and to the country. It has been an honour to work with you over the years,” Anderson’s friend, former Premier Brad Wall, said in a tweet on Monday.

Anderson, meanwhile, said he looks forward to spending less time on the road, but leaving public life behind won’t be easy.

“I don’t think anybody leaves easily. There’s a lot of really good things about this job; it’s an incredible privilege to be able to serve. So yeah, I expect there will be some days where it’ll be difficult, but it is the right thing … for us.”

Ugo Gieguere, The Canadian Press





Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves Francois Blanchet declared Sunday that his party is looking for renewal as the beleaguered party sets its hopes on youth and the environment in the run-up to the 2019 federal election.

""We'll do what we have to to win,"" Blanchet told the crowd at the end of a two-day meeting in Sorel-Tracy, Que.

""Organization, funding, inauguration, House of Commons,"" he repeated like a mantra.

Some 200 party members attended the closing speech for what the party dubbed its ""refoundation,"" although Blanchet said he preferred the term ""renewal.""

Whatever the term, the separatist party is hoping to emerge from a difficult period marked by deep divisions under its fifth leader since 2011.

Members have been debating new ideas and reflecting on their future in a vast reflection initiated by the party's youth wing, who were behind many of the new ideas the party is adopting.

But will it be enough to lure young voters back to the Bloc?

""I want to say: watch us go!"" Blanchet said. ""It's going very well for us.""

In his closing, Blanchet stressed the importance of appealing to young people, many of whom consider the environment their top priority.

He also pointed out that the party's national office is gender-balanced, and promised to present a team of candidates in the ""parity zone"" come the fall election.

Blanchet, a former entertainment industry executive and Parti Quebecois cabinet minister, is now tasked with guiding the party from a period of unprecedented division that saw seven of its 10 MPs quit caucus under former leader Martine Ouellet.

The Bloc lost official party status in 2011 after two decades as a major player in Canadian politics, and failed to regain it in 2015 despite an improved showing.

The 53-year-old Blanchet was named the Bloc's leader in January after no other candidate stepped forward to oppose him.

But with the party reunited, many of its members say they're feeling hopeful about a future they say will be younger and greener.

Veteran MP Louis Plamondon, the Bloc's longest-serving member of the House of Commons, said there has been a concerted effort to allow the party's youth wing to take the lead.

""The youth told us, we want to re-found the party for our generation because we're the ones who will continue the fight,"" he said.

This openness was appreciated by the president of the party's youth forum, who plans to run in the fall in a Montreal riding.

Twenty-five-year-old Camille Goyette-Gingras said the party's old guard showed strength by allowing the youth to take more control.

""We didn't win all our votes, but a very big part of the program was written by young people,"" she said.

In an opening speech on Saturday, Blanchet said the party will still be relevant until Quebec has achieved independence.

While it may be that the Trudeau government wants to defer action beyond the next election for political reasons, that's highly unethical on an issue of public safety.","While the latest mass murder of Muslims by a terrorist happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, it could have happened in Canada.

Despite the fact that Canada had its own national tragedy with Islamophobia on Jan. 29, 2017 when Alexandre Bissonnette opened fire on Muslim worshippers in Quebec City, little has fundamentally changed since then. Even after Parliament's Heritage Committee published a study last year on Islamophobia and religious discrimination in Canada, the Trudeau government failed to respond to its 30 recommendations. Surely another mosque attack is not necessary for the government to get serious about the problem of Islamophobia.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivers a statement on the Christchurch, New Zealand terrorist attack in the House of Commons, on Monday, March 18, 2019.

Two years after the Quebec City attack, many Canadian politicians still appear to want to cultivate support within Canada's anti-Muslim right wing. In Quebec, for example, Francois Legault seems intent on catering to the anti-Muslim minority. In January, he disingenuously suggested that Islamophobia doesn't exist in Quebec, just months after proposing legislation which would outlaw the wearing of religious symbols in certain lines of work. At the national level, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer shared a podium last month with white nationalist and anti-Muslim groups, and then failed to condemn Islamophobia in his first statement on the Christchurch killings.

A willful blindness from our politicians may suggest to some extremist elements that anti-Muslim bigotry is acceptable. While the Christchurch shooter who killed 49 Muslims at prayer had no criminal history, he was an alleged white nationalist and self-described fascist. Like New Zealand, Canada is one of many Western countries which has a growing number of white nationalists and Islamophobes who congregate online and off in a long list of right-wing, anti-Muslim groups, including the Soldiers of Odin, the Three Percenters and La Meute.

In fact, the number of right-wing extremist groups in Canada grew by 20 to 25 per cent between 2015 and 2018. Between 1980 and 2014, such groups were responsible for 120 different criminal incidents, ranging from drug offences, attempted assassinations, bombings and other attacks — incidents that Canada's Muslim community is all too familiar with. By comparison, there were only seven ""Jihadist-inspired incidents"" over the same period in Canada.

Despite this history of criminal incidents by right-wing extremist groups in Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had abandoned its investigations into such groups prior to the 2017 Quebec City attack. According to Bernie Farber of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, Canada's public security organizations have a long history of downplaying the danger from far-right groups.

ALICE CHICHE/AFP/Getty Images La Meute, a far-right, anti-immigration group, holds a rally in Quebec City on August 20, 2017.

While Canada does have anti-hate laws in its federal criminal code, the Conservative government repealed section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in 2013 — thus weakening the legal options to combat hate speech. According to Dr. Barbara Perry, an expert on hate crime in Canada, ""The legislation is weak, and the enforcement is even weaker.""

Politicians should use their platform to calm the strong emotions around bigotry, not to stoke the flames of intolerance. Unfortunately, this was not the case when Australian senator Fraser Anning suggested that the Christchurch shooting was understandable given New Zealand's immigration policy which allowed ""Muslim fanatics"" into the country.

But many Canadian politicians have hardly been better. When motion M-103 to condemn Islamophobia came before Parliament during the Conservative leadership race in 2017, several Conservative leadership candidates catered to right-wing tropes, suggesting that the motion could suppress free speech or open the door to Sharia law in Canada. So merely weeks after the Quebec City mosque shooting, rather than using their platform to temper Islamophobia in Canada, these politicians used the motion to polarize sentiments.

To be clear, politicians are free to disagree about immigration policy, but they should feel a moral obligation to publicly support the public safety and inclusion of all citizens, especially immigrants. But even while motion M-103 was the source of such outrageous discourse in Canada, it ultimately provided a path forward for the Trudeau government. The motion called for a study on religious discrimination that was ultimately published by Parliament's Heritage Committee in February of 2018.

The Christchurch mosque shootings should serve as a kick in the pants to the Trudeau government.

While not perfect, the study did gather input from dozens of representatives of Canada's religious communities, along with experts on religious discrimination and bigotry. Based on this input, the study made many sensible recommendations. It proposed, for example, additional grant funding for security systems for religious communities. It also recommended that the government do a better job of collecting hate crime data, and that law enforcement better standardize the data.

The study also recommended programs to promote public awareness of different cultural and religious practices. Such programs would be intended to promote diversity and inclusion, and would target certain sectors that appear more vulnerable to religious bigotry. Law enforcement and government employees would also be the beneficiaries of programs promoting cultural sensitivity, as they are often caught up in the public controversies around Islamophobia.

Creative Touch Imaging Ltd./NurPhoto via Getty Images Canadians take part in a vigil for the victims of New Zealand mosque shootings held at Nathan Philips Square in Toronto, Ont. on March 15, 2019.

Such steps are important: studies repeatedly suggest that media coverage in the West favours negative discourses about Muslims and other minorities. For example, violent crimes committed by Muslims tend to be emphasized in news reports, while violence against Muslims is downplayed or ignored.

The Christchurch mosque shootings should serve as a kick in the pants to the Trudeau government. The Quebec City mosque attack was over two years ago, and the Heritage Committee report was released over one year ago. Given the continued increase in Islamophobic incidents in Canada, it's unconscionable that this government still hasn't implemented some of the recommendations of the report. Even if some programs need time to take effect, the government could immediately take the symbolic step of recognizing January 29 as a national day of action on Islamophobia — another recommendation of the Heritage Committee.

While it may be that the Trudeau government wants to defer action beyond the next election for political reasons, that's highly unethical on an issue of public safety. Worse, it will appear to be shamefully negligent if a mass shooting — especially one on the scale of the New Zealand attack — takes place in another Canadian mosque.

For all our sakes, let's hope that never happens again. Not in Canada, nor anywhere else.

FILE PHOTO: An oil pump jack pumps oil in a field near Calgary, Alberta, Canada, July 21, 2014. REUTERS/Todd Korol/File Photo

The increases mean that by June, oil companies will be limited to 3.71 million bpd of production.

Alberta mandated production cuts this year to ease congestion on export pipelines that resulted in crude getting bottlenecked in storage and the discount on Canadian heavy crude widening to record levels.

“This temporary policy has been critical to reducing the oil price differential while we move ahead with our medium-term plan to ship more oil by rail and lead the long-term charge for new pipelines as we fight to get full value for the resources owned by all Albertans,” Premier Rachel Notley said in a statement.

The government said the increase in production limits comes as warmer weather reduces the amount of diluent needed to help oil sands bitumen flow through pipelines, increasing capacity.

Diluent is any ultra-light hydrocarbon mixed with viscous bitumen to enable it to flow.

The government said giving production limits two months in advance gives the energy industry and markets greater certainty when making decisions.

Some producers like MEG Energy (MEG.TO) supported curtailments because the move boosted prices, but it was criticized by integrated producers including Suncor Energy (SU.TO) and Imperial Oil (IMO.TO) whose refining operations were benefiting from cheap crude.

Critics also blasted the government for making crude by rail shipments uneconomic and adding to volatility in the Canadian crude market.

On Friday, Imperial canceled a $2.6 billion oil sands project in northern Alberta, blaming the uncertainty caused by government intervention in the market.

Alberta is leasing 4,400 rail cars to ship 120,000 bpd of crude out of the province and ease pipeline congestion, with the first shipments due to begin in July.

Morneau has also said he wants to make sure workers have dedicated time off so they can get that skills training. As part of the package, the Liberals plan to create a lifelong savings account for adults after drawing inspiration from a similar program launched a few years ago in Singapore, said a government source, who was not authorized to speak publicly because the plan is not yet released. The program is expected to share traits with Canada's registered education savings plan (RESP), but be aimed at mid-career adults rather than youth. In late 2017, Morneau's council of economic advisers recommended such a program, which the group called the ""Canada Lifelong Learning Fund.""

2) Helping more millennials buy homes

The budget will include plans to help more first-time buyers enter the housing market, changes that will arrive at a time of out-of-reach real estate prices in some parts of the country. Morneau has said he's particularly focused on helping millennials, a generation of people who are now in their mid-20s to late 30s. His budget will make home-buying more affordable with a series of changes affecting housing supply, demand and regulation, a government source said.

3) (Early) steps toward national pharmacare

The Liberals also plan to move toward their two main goals on pharmacare: keeping costs down and ensuring better coverage for everyone. Earlier this month, an advisory panel assembled by Ottawa released an interim report that recommended the federal government create a new agency to oversee the rollout of a national drug plan, the first part of a much broader pharmacare program. The panel, led by former Ontario health minister Eric Hoskins, said the federal government should also develop a national list of drugs to ensure consistent coverage across the country. It called for funding to gather better data on prescription medications. Some have high hopes Tuesday's budget will include an extensive pharmacare component, but a government source said any firm commitments won't go much beyond the interim report's recommendations.

4) On or off the fiscal track?

In November, Morneau predicted annual deficits of $18.1 billion in 2018-19, $19.6 billion in 2019-20 and $18.1 billion in 2020-21. After 2020-21, the annual shortfalls were expected to shrink each year, reaching $11.4 billion in 2023-24. Ottawa's fiscal track promises to be a key issue in the October election campaign — with Liberals calling for investments to lift long-term growth and the Opposition Conservatives demanding balanced books to ensure future generations aren't stuck with the tab.

5) Lifeline for the news industry

The Trudeau government is due to deliver an update to its plan to support the ailing journalism industry. Last fall, it announced new tax credits and incentives worth $595 million over the next five years. Ottawa said it would create an independent panel of experts from the journalism community to seek advice on the measures and, in particular, define which outlets will be eligible for a refundable tax credit on labour costs. But it has yet to assemble the panel, which has raised concerns in the news industry that the support is taking too long to materialize.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government remains in hot water over SNC-Lavalin. Even anti-bribery officials from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are “concerned” and watching the situation.

But the controversy has resulted in some misinterpretations of the legal mechanism at its heart: Deferred prosecution agreements, known as DPAs.

Jody Wilson-Raybould is a career prosecutor who has devoted her life to justice. It’s reassuring that the former attorney general testified nothing illegal happened on the SNC-Lavalin file, yet she provided details of 10 instances she described as “consistent and sustained effort” of “inappropriate pressure” to “politically interfere” with her prosecutorial independence in the matter.

In recent days, Wilson-Raybould has also said the SNC-Lavalin affair has served as a “wake-up call” that’s inspired her to push to ensure there’s respect for the rule of law and prosecutorial independence.

Prosecutorial independence is an unassailable tenet of Canadian democracy, as is judicial independence. Any attempt to wilfully interfere in either would be grave.

But it’s important to understand how the new DPA regime works.

Will not open the floodgates

Some have argued that DPAs are a “get-out-of-jail-free card” that could result in opening the “floodgates” to corporate evasions of justice. This is wrong.

The raison d’etre of Canada’s new DPA law is to fight corporate impunity. The law was passed in 2018, after years of discussion and a months-long public consultation in 2017 in which more than 340 stakeholders participated, including those from SNC-Lavalin.

In 2015, the Globe and Mail – which broke the news of Wilson-Raybould’s allegations – argued that Canada needed a DPA regime to efficiently fight corporate crime and keep in step with other OECD countries.

In Canada, a DPA regime has been supported because of the following downsides of prosecution:

1. Corporate convictions are difficult to achieve.

2. Corporate prosecutions go on for years, are expensive to taxpayers and have uncertain outcomes.

3. When corporations are fighting charges or are convicted, too often innocent parties end up disproportionately suffering by losing jobs or pensions or contracts.

4. Canada can lose out economically if a corporation is prevented from bidding on domestic or international contracts or goes bankrupt.

These criteria must be balanced against the nature of the crimes, the impact upon victims and the public interest in fighting corporate crime.

Avoiding lengthy trials

Canada’s DPA regime seeks to avoid lengthy trials and skip ahead to an admission of guilt by the corporation. Ideally, the corporation voluntarily discloses wrongdoing. Then a series of steps follow.

First, a prosecutor decides if it’s appropriate to invite the corporation to negotiate a DPA. Second, the attorney general must approve the DPA. Third, unlike any other country, Canada requires court approval of any DPA. The court weighs factors including public interest, impact on victims and innocent parties.

The court approval safeguard in Canada – not to mention the prerequisite attorney general approval – is aimed at preventing any concerns corporations are flouting the law.

If a DPA is approved, the accused corporation admits guilt, pays hefty fines in proportion to the crime (in the tens of millions in some cases), pays the Crown’s costs, forfeits gains from the crimes, makes reparations to victims, including those overseas, and agrees to strict new corporate governance rules to be reviewed by an independent monitor.

If the corporation violates the DPA, prosecution is back on the table – hence the word deferred – and the corporation faces a criminal trial.

A DPA is never available, however, if the prosecutor believes the corporation’s alleged crimes resulted in death, serious bodily harm or terrorism. Furthermore, if the corporation is charged under Section 3 of the Foreign Corrupt Officials Act (FCOA), the prosecutor cannot consider the national economic interest in deciding whether to negotiate a DPA.

Final say

The RCMP charged SNC-Lavalin with fraud under the Criminal Code and with a Section 3 corruption crime under the FCOA.

Undoubtedly, the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and the attorney general would have considered all the above factors. And ultimately, as attorney general, Wilson-Raybould had the final say on whether to negotiate a DPA.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, testified that the PMO believed that the final decision was the attorney general’s, and that there was no intention to interfere.

But Butts added that he and others believed Wilson-Raybould could change her mind up until conviction. This assertion was ridiculed by commentators, yet the DPA legislation supports that interpretation.

The new legislation clearly states that if a DPA is negotiated, then the prosecutor can stay any ongoing proceedings. In other words, if a criminal trial has already started, the prosecutor can intervene, halt or defer it due to the DPA.

Butts also testified the Department of Justice had suggested an outside opinion should be pursued, which is how the names of retired Supreme Court Justices arose amid the controversy.

Butts’ testimony, in short, was that there was no intention to interfere, but only to ensure that no stones had been left unturned in this new DPA environment, which is why a “second opinion” was suggested.

Given that they were dealing with Wilson-Raybould, a one-time prosecutor and the justice minister who ushered in the new DPA legislation, it’s unfortunate no one in the PMO stopped to think that she might fully understand the law.

‘Strongly advise against it’

Wilson-Raybould testified that during a conversation in September 2018 when Trudeau reportedly mentioned the upcoming Quebec election, she asked him directly if he was interfering with her decision as attorney general, and if so she would “strongly advise against.”

She testified he denied such interference, and said he was simply seeking a solution.

It’s not implausible that a politician would look to help their constituents, and that a prime minister would seek to protect the national economic interest, regardless of party.

Subsequently, there has been clarification from the PMO that the concern in September and throughout the fall was for Canada’s national economic interests, including jobs and revenues.

Trudeau’s caucus, and ultimately Canadians, will decide his political fate as the SNC-Lavalin saga continues. But unless some new evidence is unveiled, it seems that the PMO and staff genuinely believed they were not interfering.

In the meantime, there are some broader questions for Canadians to contemplate.

Despite the national economic interest, if we are serious about stamping out corporate crime, is it time we stopped giving corporations options rarely available to individuals?

It may also be time to revisit the wisdom of having one person hold the attorney general portfolio, which requires vigilant independence from political concerns, and the job of justice minister, which requires by necessity a cabinet team player with political concerns.

The extensions shore up Canada's contributions to the global effort to curb Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and to the fight against Islamic militants in the Middle East.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland say the mission of about 200 Canadian Forces personnel in Ukraine will be extended to the end of March 2022.

The Canadian Press Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan make an announcement in Ottawa on March 18, 2019 about Canada extending its military missions in Ukraine and Iraq.

The Forces have been involved in Ukraine since September 2015, helping train the country's military, which is battling Russian-backed separatist forces.

Canada will extend the Canadian Forces' contribution to the Global Coalition Against Daesh and the NATO mission in Iraq, until the end of March 2021.

Canada has about 500 military members in Iraq, including 200 who are part of a NATO training mission and 120 special forces who have been helping Iraqi forces root out Islamic State insurgents around the northern city of Mosul.

Those are parts of Canada's larger Middle East strategy, which also includes humanitarian assistance and diplomatic engagement in Iraq, Syria and the surrounding region.

The people of Ukraine know they can count on Canada. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland

The decision to extend Canada's commitment in Ukraine will be welcome news to that country as it continues to cope with Russia's annexation of its Crimea region in 2014, and the continuing unrest in its eastern Donbass region, which is plagued by separatist rebels backed by Moscow.

""The people of Ukraine know they can count on Canada,"" Freeland said in a statement. ""We are steadfast in our commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as it works toward a stable, democratic and prosperous future.""

Ukraine is bracing for Russian interference in its upcoming presidential election on March 31.

In a statement Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referenced the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting in which six people were killed, saying “Canada remembers too well the sorrow” of that event.

He said the Canadian government will work closely with that of New Zealand “to take action against violent extremism.”

“To move forward as a world, we need to recognize diversity as a source of strength, and not a threat,” he said. “Last night’s victims were fathers, mothers and children. They were neighbours, friends and family members. As with every life taken too soon, the full measure of their loss will never be known.”

The name of the Quebec City shooter, Alexandre Bissonnette, was found written on equipment used by the Christchurch killer.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called the attack an attack on freedom.

“There are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred,” he said in a tweet. “I am praying for peace for the families of those lost and recovery for those injured.”

Quebec Premier Francois Legault also referenced the Quebec City mosque shooting, saying he “fully understands” the emotions of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

“There is no room for extremism in our societies; there is no room for intolerance,” he said. “We will not allow violence to take root in our democratic societies.”

Quebec Muslims devastated

Among the Quebec Muslim community, the New Zealand terrorist attack exacerbated wounds that still haven't healed. Boufeldja Benabdallah, head of the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre where Bissonnette carried out his attack, said his thoughts are with the grieving families. He added that members of his own community are in indescribable pain and called for lawmakers to legislate against extremism.

""Imagine the children of those families here in Quebec who are hearing it on the radio and will watch their mothers cry and ask 'Why are you crying?'"" he said. ""The mothers will remember the 29th, when they ran to get husbands who were killed by Alexandre Bissonnette.

""We must get back to work once again to explain, to tell these extremists of all stripes who politicize religion, like extremists who use race as a basis for discrimination, that we must change. The world cannot continue like this.""

Samer Majzoub, President of the Canadian Muslim Forum, said he was speechless when he heard what had happened.

""The pain was severe, I tried to hold my dears back, I had my children in front of me,"" he said. ""It's something that's beyond horrible and terrible to see, such atrocity being again and again performed against peaceful people in a mosque, for no other reason than their faith.""

Majzoub said he feared that such an attack could again happen in Quebec, calling the current atmosphere for Muslims ""toxic.""

""It's been escalating recently, since the last elections,"" he said. ""The normalization of hate that is coming from the top, through the media and social media, it will certainly lead to terrorim the way we've seen in Quebec and we saw yesterday. Again and again we express our voices very loudly to say we are all concerned. I don't think it's just the Muslim community that's concerned, I believe it should be the whole society in Quebec and Canada to share this kind of grievances and concerns.""

Dorval Mosque Imam Mehmet Deger said he believes the vast majority of people are horrified by the attacks but that the few who carry them out ""get all the traction.""

""It's very sad what happened in Quebec, but 0.001 per cent of the population is doing these acts. The majority of people are very nice people in Quebec or New Zealand, but some minorities like this get all the traction and they want this massacre to go on all over the world. They videotape it and broadcast it to the whole world. This is very sad.""

Bissonnette issues statement

In a statement released through his lawyers, Bissonnette said he was ""troubled"" to have his name connected with the attack.

""Mr. Bissonnette does not seek at any time to be imitated or to serve as a model for anyone who wishes to perpetrate an act of violence or would like to follow in his footsteps,"" read the statement. ""Mr. Bissonnette deeply regrets the actions he committed and wants everyone with problems or difficulties to talk about it and seek help, something he had not been able to adequately do. There is no justification for committing such acts of violence against others.""

On Feb. 8, Bissonnette was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years. Both the Crown and Bissonnette's defence team have announced plans to appeal the sentence.

34,,2019-03-18T14:16:00.0000000Z,"The findings were published in a new report released this week, just in time for the upcoming federal, pre-election budget, set to be delivered on March 19. The report, entitled Canada’s Rising ...","Canada’s top marginal tax rates are punitively high, have put Canada in an uncompetitive position and discourage individuals from engaging in productive economic activity, ultimately hindering economic growth and prosperity. These are the observations of the Fraser Institute, based on a study of Canada’s top tax rates and how they compare to other jurisdictions. The findings were published in a new report released this week, just in time for the upcoming federal, pre-election budget, set to be delivered on March 19.

The report, entitled Canada’s Rising Personal Tax Rates and Falling Tax Competitiveness, calls on both the federal and provincial governments to consider “reversing the trend toward higher marginal tax rates on upper-income earners” and begin lowering personal tax rates. The marginal tax rate is the rate of tax you pay on the next dollar you earn.

According to the Institute’s analysis, Canadian workers across the income spectrum — and across the country — pay significantly higher personal income taxes than our U.S. counterparts. In fact, at incomes of $50,000, $150,000 and $300,000, among all 61 provinces and states in Canada and the U.S., the ten highest combined personal marginal income tax rates are in the ten Canadian provinces.

So, how did we get here?

Federally, you’ll recall that back in December 2015, our newly elected Liberal government introduced a couple of changes to Canada’s personal income tax system. One was the middle-income tax cut, which reduced the rate on middle-income earners (for 2019 income between $47,629 to $95,259) to 20.5 per cent from 22 per cent. At the same time, the federal government added a new income tax bracket, hiking the top tax rate from 29 to 33 per cent on incomes over $200,000 (currently $210,371).

To compound matters, the increase in the top federal rate came on top of numerous recent provincial increases. Nova Scotia bumped up its top rate in 2010, and, in nearly every year since then at least one Canadian government has increased its top personal income tax rate. To wit, since 2010, seven out of ten provincial governments increased their tax rates on upper-income earners. The net result is an increased top combined federal/provincial tax rate in every province over the past decade.

Who was the hardest hit? No surprise — it was high-income Alberta earners, who saw their top combined federal/provincial rate (48 per cent) increase by 9 percentage points (or 23.1 per cent), attributed mainly to the fact that the increased federal rate was added on top of Alberta’s decision to eliminate its relatively low 10 per cent provincial flat tax rate. In Ontario, the combined federal/provincial top marginal rate (53.53 per cent) increased by 7.1 percentage points (or 15.3 per cent) while Quebecers saw their top rate (53.31 per cent) increase by 5.1 percentage points (or 10.6 per cent).

Our top combined marginal tax rates compare unfavourably to those in the U.S. and other industrialized countries. The study found that out of 61 Canadian and U.S. jurisdictions (i.e. the 50 states, 10 provinces and Washington, D.C.), Nova Scotia currently has the highest combined top marginal tax rate at 54 per cent, followed closely by Ontario and Quebec. Nine Canadian provinces occupy the list of the 10 Canada/U.S. jurisdictions with the highest top combined marginal income tax rates and all our provinces are in the top 12. The report found that there are 49 U.S. jurisdictions with combined top tax rates lower than all ten Canadian provinces.

And it’s not just at the highest income levels that we’re uncompetitive. Canada’s top tax rates are often applied to lower levels of income than in the U.S. For example, the U.S. top federal rate kicks in at US$510,300 in 2019. The report looked at incomes of $150,000, $75,000 and $50,000 (in Canadian dollars!) and concluded that our combined rates are uncompetitive, even at these lower levels of income.

The report also looked beyond the U.S. since Canada also competes with other industrialized countries for highly skilled workers and investment. The study compared Canada’s top statutory marginal income tax rates with the rates in 34 industrialized countries. It found that in 2017 (the latest year of available international data), Canada had the seventh highest combined top tax rate out of these countries. The 2016 increase in our top federal rate “markedly worsened Canada’s competitive position,” bumping us up from the 13th highest rate, before the 2016 federal rate change.

Most economists would agree that high marginal tax rates, which reduce the reward of earning more income, discourage people from engaging in productive economic activity, which can ultimately hinder economic growth and — although there is some debate about the exact magnitude of this effect.

Knowing this, why then do our Canadian governments insist on raising rates? The obvious answer is to raise more revenue as they pay for more spending, while trying to tackle deficits and an increasing debt load. But, as the Institute points out, the tax increases are unlikely to raise as much revenue as governments expect since taxpayers, and, in particular, upper-income earners, tend to change their behaviour in response to higher tax rates in ways that reduce the amount of tax they pay. In other words, tax rate increases often don’t raise the amount of revenue governments were expecting.

To understand why, keep in mind that the amount of revenue collected from an income tax depends not just on the tax rate itself but on the total income that is subject to the tax or “the base,” to use the economic lingo. The tax rate times the base equals the amount of income tax a government will collect. But, when a government chooses to increase the tax rate, studies have shown that taxpayers often respond by changing their behaviour in ways that actually shrink the tax base, resulting in less total government revenue.

Prior research by the Institute found that there are a number of ways that taxpayers can respond to a tax in­crease that would reduce the tax base, including working less and thus re­porting less taxable income or negotiating with an employer to substitute taxable income with certain tax-free fringe benefits.

The study cites the U.K. example whereby the government introduced a 50 per cent tax rate on upper-income earners in 2010 which was expected to bring in £2.5 billion. A government report estimated that it brought in £1 bil­lion or less and the U.K.’s top rate has since been reduced to 45 per cent.

TORONTO, March 18, 2019 /CNW/ - Canadian business leaders support personal income tax cuts in the federal budget but also want to see corporate tax reductions to improve our global competitiveness, says KPMG in Canada.

""We have been hearing concerns from our clients and business leaders about Canada's slowing growth relative to GDP and how current tax rates are hurting our global competitiveness,"" says Greg Wiebe, Canadian Managing Partner, Tax at KPMG. ""The negative effects of major U.S. tax reform are top of mind for many in the business community, who would like to see Canada's competitive tax advantage restored. On average, Canada's combined federal and provincial corporate tax rate is now roughly on par with the average U.S. corporate tax rate.""

""Although this is an election year, we hope this budget contains substantial measures to address the competitive challenges facing Canadian companies and our ability to attract foreign investment,"" adds Wiebe. ""We will be watching to see how the government manages to deliver an economic plan that balances the interests of both business and individual Canadians.""

According to a recent KPMG online survey of clients and stakeholders, 70 per cent believe the economy is weakening (30 per cent concerned and 40 per cent less optimistic) in the near-term. Eighty-seven per cent say U.S. tax reform has had a negative impact on Canada's tax competitiveness, while nearly all respondents (98 per cent) have some level of concern about the impact of current trade disputes on the economy, particularly for Canadian exporters. The top measures identified to foster business growth in this federal budget are reductions to personal income tax rates (37 per cent) and reductions to corporate tax rates (26 per cent). Furthermore, 29 per cent of respondents identified taxation and regulatory requirements as a key challenge for the economy, while household debt levels (40 per cent) were considered the most significant issue for Canadian consumers.

In 2018, the U.S. government reduced the corporate federal tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. The representative U.S. corporate tax rate (combined federal and state tax rate) is approximately 27 per cent. Currently, Canada's representative corporate tax rate is 26.5 per cent, based on federal and Ontario rates. Some provincial and state corporate tax rates are higher or lower than the representative rates. The highest personal tax rate in Canada now exceeds 50 per cent in most provinces, significantly higher than in the U.S.

Yes, we are all aware that Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was lobbying Trudeau’s inner circle hard in order to secure a deferred prosecution agreement, rather than face a possible criminal conviction for bribery charges.

In turn, Wilson-Raybould has testified before the Commons justice committee that Trudeau’s top aide, Gerald Butts, and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick pressured her on this file. Their argument was that a criminal conviction would preclude SNC-Lavalin from bidding on future federal government tenders. Should that occur, SNC-Lavalin executives had suggested they would fold up their headquarters tent in Montreal, and 9,000 skilled jobs would vanish from the Canadian landscape. This would, of course, not sit well with voters in an election year.

The allegations of political interference in this case have made this a decidedly Liberal Party scandal, with the Conservative opposition circulating petitions urging Trudeau to resign.

Upon closer examination, however, the actual accusations of SNC-Lavalin having bribed their way into lucrative Libyan construction contracts spans the period of 2001 to 2011. During that decade it is alleged that SNC-Lavalin representatives paid an estimated $48 million in bribes to members of the Gadhafi family.

During a 2008 visit to Canada it is believed that Garda World was hired by SNC-Lavalin to protect Saadi Gadhafi, the former Libyan president’s third-eldest son. That protection by Garda is alleged to have included some $30,000 worth of prostitutes and tickets to a Spice Girls concert.

The timeframe also puts this sordid affair back onto the Harper Conservatives. Fast forward to the spring of 2011 and the start of the Libyan uprising. At that juncture, no doubt thanks in part to the $48 million in palm grease paid to the Gadhafi family, SNC-Lavalin had secured billions of dollars’ worth of construction in Libya. Heck, they were even in the process of building a big new jail for the very president we were now labelling as a bloodthirsty despot.

Foreign affairs minister John Baird was among the loudest and most bellicose of western voices demanding that Gadhafi must go.

To help make that happen, Canada was among the first countries to participate in the NATO air campaign aimed at destroying the Gadhafi loyalist forces.

It took a hell of a lot longer than anyone would have imagined for the world’s most sophisticated air armada to defeat a fourth-rate African army, but by early October 2011, the end was clearly nigh. The last of the Gadhafi loyalists were contained alongside their embattled leader in the town of Sirte.

On Oct. 11, 2011, a full nine days before Libyan rebels would capture and murder Gadhafi, Baird made a secret visit into the rebel held Libyan capital of Tripoli. During that whirlwind trip, Baird met with and praised several of the Libyan rebel leaders and he announced Canada’s commitment of $10 million to secure Libyan weapons once the war was finally won.

Travelling with Baird were a number of Canadian business executives, including representatives from SNC-Lavalin, eager to start a new round of lucrative Libyan projects under the new post-Gadhafi leaders. Keep in mind that at this point Gadhafi was still alive and fighting.

So, if we are to believe that paying bribes to corrupt Third World leaders in order to obtain contracts is criminal nature, how do we define using military force to effect regime change, and then bringing in the carpet-baggers to profit from the puppet regime which we installed next?

The only problem with the Libyan caper was that Baird and company failed to listen to ambassador Sandra McCardell. She was with Baird in Tripoli as he used that same visit to reopen our embassy.

Her prophetic statement to the Canadian Press at that time was that getting the guns out of the hands of young, heavily armed rebels would be the best way for Canada to contribute to Libya’s post-Gadhafi reconstruction. That’s right, the best way to help Libya would be for us to disarm the rebels we had armed.

Baird never did say just how his $10 million in pledged funding would actually secure the Libyan arsenals, but suffice it to say whatever he had planned failed miserably.

Once Gadhafi was dead, the various rebel groups, Islamic extremists, human traffickers and tribal thugs began fighting among themselves. Libya quickly plunged into a failed state of violent anarchy, where it remains to this date.

The Trudeau Liberals tried to avert a possible criminal conviction for SNC-Lavalin’s alleged bribery. That’s bad.

Published 5:00 PM, March 19, 2019

TORONTO, Canada – When Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen announced two new 5-year caregiver immigration pilot projects and an interim pathway to permanent residency for care workers already in Canada on February 23, Jhoelyn Cruz said she didn't know whether it was good news for her.

""I'm not sure what to do,"" said Cruz in an interview shortly before she joined 50 other care workers who gathered Sunday, March 17, for an information session organized by the Caregivers' Action Centre (CAC) about the Trudeau government's new caregiver program.

Cruz, who arrived in 2016 under the Caring for Children Program stream, thinks she will meet the one-year work experience requirement and quite possibly, the language and education requirements to apply for the interim pathway to permanent residency.

What concerns her is that she only has until June 4 to submit the application. For someone who's earning minimum wage and sending most of it back to family in the Philippines, 3 months is a short time to cough up thousands of dollars to pay for an application fee for her and her two dependents ($1,040 each), the cost of taking the language proficiency test (about $300), having her education assessed ($300-$2,000), getting a medical exam, plus other processing fees.

It's also not enough time to go through the hoops of gathering her documents, having her education assessed and language proficiency tested.

But she worries that if she lets this opportunity pass, she may not get another chance. ""There are so many factors to consider. I'm so stressed,"" Cruz said.

The new program – intended to replace the current one set to expire in November – will assess whether care workers are eligible for permanent residency before they come to Canada. If deemed eligible, they can bring their children, spouse, or common-law partner to Canada and will be offered a ""pathway to permanent residency"" after two years of work experience.

The new program also gives care workers open work permits that will allow them to change employers quickly, unlike the current model which ties them to employers, making them vulnerable to abuse.

What Cruz and many others like her already here in Canada are wondering is whether these open work permits will also apply to them since they arrived under a different program. There are also unanswered questions about whether they can qualify under the new program.

""A lot of people are going to be left out,"" said Kara Manso, who came to Canada as a caregiver in 2012 and now heads CAC.

She said aside from the huge financial burden, a number of care workers will be unable to meet the one-year work requirement for permanent residency under the interim pathway ""because the system didn't allow them to continue.""

This includes workers who lost their jobs for various reasons – for example, an employer died or their services were no longer needed – and may have found another job, but got stuck waiting for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) that is required before a work permit can be issued. The typical waiting period for for an LMIA to be issued is 8 months, and for a work permit, 5 months.

Also excluded are workers who became undocumented because they lost jobs and were unable to find another employer who is willing not only to hire them, but also pay for the cost of the LMIA ($1,000). Some care workers have borne the cost of the LMIA in cases where an employer refuses to pay for them.

Uncertainty

Since the government has not laid out the criteria for the new program, it has raised a lot of uncertainty about who will qualify for it.

If the program maintains the permanent residency requirement of one-year Canadian post-secondary education equivalent and high levels of English language proficiency, it will ""shut out migrants with fewer resources who have historically been able to come to Canada under [past] caregiver programs,"" care worker groups have said.

""It's really concerning because a lot of care workers are here and they are contributing to the country. They're making sure that Canadian families are taken care of, but they don't even know what's going to happen to them,"" Manso said. ""We've been trying to make sure that no one is left behind.""

Aside from the uncertainty about the details of the new program, Manso said there are no assurances that they will be implemented since it hinges on whether Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government will be reelected this October.

""Whatever happens in the election, we want to make sure the program will actually work for care workers,"" she said.

The CAC and other migrant workers' groups have launched an email campaign reiterating their call for the federal government to offer care workers landed status upon arrival.

""It's only fair for us to have landed status upon arrival. We're not asking for special treatment – just the same rights to be with our families and even for our work to be recognized,"" Manso said. ""We've contributed. We're part of Canadian society and we should be treated fairly.""

The email, addressed to the immigration minister, also asks that undocumented care workers and those who have not finished 12 months of service be allowed to apply for permanent residence via the interim pathway.

""The new 2019 pilot program must not repeat the mistakes of the past. This means open work permits, no second medical, no high school English language test, and no requirement for one-year Canadian post-secondary education,"" the email stated.

The email campaign also calls for the scrapping of a law denying permanent residence to an entire family if one of them has a disability.

It asks for an end to the backlog of 30,000 care workers waiting for a decision on their permanent residency, and 20,000 for family reunification. – Rappler.com",Canada's new caregiver program raises more questions than answers,Rappler,https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/us-canada/226119-new-caregiver-program-more-questions-than-answers

And despite a nasty internal backlash after her explosive appearance before the federal justice committee, she has no intention of quitting the Liberal caucus in Ottawa.

“It really has been quite remarkable,” Wilson-Raybould said Saturday, in her first public remarks since her bombshell testimony.

“I have heard from thousands of people — neighbours, friends, constituents, as well as people from all across Canada.”

The former attorney general said she plans to run for re-election in the fall under the Liberal banner in Vancouver Granville.

“I feel overwhelmed and grateful. In my mind, all I was doing was my job.”

Wilson-Raybould stunned Ottawa last week with three hours of shocking testimony in the SNC-Lavalin affair, saying she was hounded for months to let the Liberal-connected, Quebec-based engineering company off the hook on criminal corruption charges.

Wilson-Raybould said nearly a dozen top power players in the government — including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Finance Minister Bill Morneau and several of Ottawa’s most powerful political staffers and bureaucrats — relentlessly pressured her to give the company a plea-bargain deal, which she refused to do.

She said she faced a “sustained effort” and “veiled threats” to intervene in the case. Trudeau removed her as attorney general in January and she resigned from his cabinet outright on Feb. 12.

“Like Canadians everywhere, I just try to do my job the best I can,” she said, adding she’s been recognized everywhere she goes while messages of support pour in.

“People coming up to me in airports, social media, emails, deliveries to my offices — I’m grateful for all of the support and kind thoughts.”

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

Trudeau has denied he did anything improper in the SNC-Lavalin case and said he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

Since her testimony, she has faced criticism from fellow Liberals for breaking ranks. Liberal MP Jati Sidhu said she was not a “team player” and “couldn’t handle the stress” of her job, calling her testimony “sour grapes.” He later apologized for the remarks.

Despite the backlash, Wilson-Raybould said she has no intention of leaving the Liberals.

“I was elected as the Liberal member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville and I will continue to serve as such,” she said.

Trudeau said last week he had not decided whether Wilson-Raybould will be allowed to remain in the government caucus or to run again for the Liberals.

“I haven’t yet had the opportunity to review her entire testimony,” Trudeau said. “I will do that before making any further decisions.”

But Wilson-Raybould said she’s already secured the Liberal nomination for the October election.

“I was confirmed as the Liberal Party of Canada candidate for Vancouver Granville last year,” she said.

Despite being at the centre of a raging political storm, Wilson-Raybould said she is feeling upbeat and confident.

“I am doing fine,” she said. “The past few weeks have been eventful ones for our country, our system of government, and for myself and family.”

The House of Commons is now on a two-week break. Wilson-Raybould said she returned to Vancouver late Friday and is happy to be home.

“For sure I am looking forward to spending time back here for the next couple of weeks,” she said. “I’m looking forward to reconnecting with my constituents.”

The justice committee, meanwhile, is continuing its investigation of the scandal, while Canada’s independent ethics watchdog, Mario Dion, has launched an investigation of Trudeau’s actions.

The RCMP said it is reviewing complaints that government officials may have broken federal obstruction-of-justice laws.

An expert panel appointed by the federal government has made interim recommendations that look much like the prelude to such a step.

Whether the panel members will actually go that far we’ll know in June, when their final report is due. But the federal NDP has already committed to a national drug program, and the governing Liberals are under pressure to follow suit. We might hear more in the federal budget on Tuesday.

article continues below

The benefits are evident. Prescription medications are not covered under our existing medicare system.

Yet at $34 billion a year, drugs costs are the second largest component of health expenditures (hospitals are first).

One result is that on a regular basis, millions of Canadians sacrifice necessities to afford their medications, and an estimated four million leave prescriptions unfilled because the cost is too high.

While all of the provinces, to one degree or another, offer pharmacare plans, there are huge variations in the drugs covered, deductibles and prices.

That’s hardly surprising. Some jurisdictions have larger revenue bases than others. The Atlantic provinces, for example, cannot provide the range of benefits that Ontario does.

A national plan would — ideally — smooth out these differences and bring medication costs within the reach of all Canadians.

There are, however, formidable difficulties. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that the cost of implementing such a plan would be about $20 billion a year. And even that figure is little better than a guess, since there is no way of knowing in advance what kind of coverage a national plan might offer.

Then again, would the federal government take on such costs, or would it hand them off to the provinces? At a minimum, it appears unlikely that Ottawa could bear all of the strain. It would double the current federal deficit, meaning there might not be another balanced budget for decades.

On the other hand, if the federal government agreed to pay even half the amount involved, provincial treasuries would be hard pressed to come up with the remainder. On a population basis, the B.C. government would be faced with a bill for $1.5 billion. That would almost certainly require deficit financing, again for years to come.

There is an alternative. It has been estimated that a two-point increase in the GST, to seven per cent from five, would cover most of the costs. But that is not an attractive option for politicians facing re-election.

In addition, how likely is it that individual provinces would agree to have their drug coverage settled at the national level? In effect, they would be signing away control over a major budget item.

There is also the complication that at present, many Canadians receive drug insurance from employers as part of their compensation.

The exact figure is not clear, but we do know that of the $34 billion spent on drugs each year, $6 billion comes from private sources.

Some of this amount is employer-funded. A national pharmacare program would let employers off the hook and force governments to make up the difference.

Beyond question, Canada has a dreadful record when it comes to managing pharmaceuticals.

We pay the third-highest amount for medications in the world, and some of that is due to dog-eat-dog behaviour by the provinces.

Each health ministry negotiates its own pricing arrangements with the industry, and signs a non-disclosure agreement that leaves other provinces in the dark. Some of the panel’s recommendations might put a stop to this and other insanities.

But a universal drug plan for all of Canada?

Addressing students who were tackling global issues of climate change and human trafficking at a two-day forum, Mulcair said Canada has failed to live up to its international obligations to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

He said this country has the worst record for greenhouse gases per capita among the world’s G20 economies, and noted that “Canada was the first country in the world to withdraw from Kyoto (Protocol in 1997).”

Mulcair said that successive Canadian governments — both Liberal and Conservative — have failed to deliver on GHG reduction targets.

But Mulcair, who once served as Quebec’s environment minister in the government of Jean Charest, also admitted his generation came up short in thwarting climate change.

“I’ll make an admission to you: My generation has failed. All you have to do is look at the figures for Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions. We have failed. We have failed you and we have failed your kids, and we failed your grandchildren. And we failed the planet.”

Mulcair, who lives in the West Island, said his generation is “passing the torch” to the youth of today. “We’ve got to rely on you to do better than we did.”

Afterward, Mulcair answered questions about the environment from the Montreal Gazette.

Q: You studied ecology at Vanier College in 1971. Your generation was probably one of the most idealistic, but admittedly didn’t get it done. Where did it go wrong? Is corporate pressure just too strong?

A: Corporate pressure is extremely strong. All you have to do is look at the recent firing of a researcher in Quebec City who was trying to tell people that the research into pesticide use in Quebec was being manipulated by the companies that manufacture pesticides. So that’s a concrete example of the physical environment. One of the challenges of global warming and greenhouse gases is it’s ethereal, it’s less palpable, it’s less immediate. We can know we’re getting more floods because we’re getting them here in Pierrefonds.

Q: You were an environment minister and knew these issues inside out. Why did governments fail?

A: I would say the number No. 1 reason is we haven’t set an obligation of result. So I’m very proud to say that when I was the environment minister every year I was able to reduce greenhouse gases in Quebec which is a big place with a large economy. But you have to have a single-minded determination to get to the result. And federally we keep signing agreements like Kyoto, but we were the first country in the world to withdraw. And we’ve consistently missed our targets. We went to Paris in 2015 and (Justin Trudeau) showed a lot of hope for Canada but we still don’t have a plan in place that will allow us to meet our obligations.

So the 1.5 C degree (reduction) hope of the Paris agreement, I think, is lost. The 2 C degree dire scenario of Paris, unfortunately, is going to be a reality. So those young people are the hope for the future. They know how real climate change is. They’ve got to get involved.

Q: Are you worried Canada will fail to meet its international environmental obligations?

A: Well, I’m going on a by case-by-case basis but I’m very worried, for example, about Abitibi-Témiscamingue where there is an Australian mining company that wants to open a lithium mine by the most pristine water in the world, the esker water, which is magnificent spring water. Again, it’s a false argument. They’re going to say its economic activity they’re bringing, but the esker also provides jobs.

With regard to greenhouse gases, you have to have a fixed cap. It’s not negotiable and you couldn’t, for example, in the case of Quebec, approve as the Liberal government did, a cement company in the Gaspé that completely blew the lid off our greenhouse gas emissions. We’re missing our targets because of that one bone-headed decision which has turned out to be an economically bone-headed decision as well.

Q: Are you worried the CAQ government of François Legault will not live up to its environmental obligations?

A: I’m actually more hopeful about the Legault government despite their right-wing bent economically. I’m more hopeful about them environmentally than economically or socially and I’ll tell you why: I know they got a massive number of votes in the 450 area (outside Montreal). These are young families. All you have to do is meet them, as I’ve done over the past few years. They’re very environmentally aware; they’re expecting their government to deliver. This is not negotiable so if Mr. Legault thinks he’s got some sort of mandate to forget about the environment, he’s going to be severely mistaken, and he’ll be surprised at the next election.

OTTAWA: The head of Canada’s federal bureaucracy said on Monday he was quitting over his role in handling a corporate corruption case, dealing another blow to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he battles the biggest political crisis of his tenure.

Polls suggest that Trudeau’s Liberals — who a few months ago looked certain to be re-elected in October — are now at risk of losing power to the official opposition Conservatives.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. avoided a corruption trial.

Top civil servant Michael Wernick told Trudeau he would be retiring in the coming weeks because opposition leaders had lost confidence in him over the scandal. Two high-profile women cabinet ministers and Trudeau’s closest personal aide had already quit over SNC-Lavalin before Monday’s resignation.

Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, is supposed to be non-partisan, like the rest of the federal bureaucracy. But his strong defense of government officials over the SNC-Lavalin affair and his insistence that no one had done anything wrong triggered widespread criticism from opposition legislators that he was siding with the Liberals.

“It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” said Wernick, who was appointed by Trudeau in early 2016.

Clerks have traditionally had an exceptionally close relationship with prime ministers, and the two tended to talk every day. Wernick’s departure leaves Trudeau needing to fill one of the top jobs in Ottawa just months ahead of the election.

Trudeau spokesman Matt Pascuzzo said the prime minister had not asked Wernick to go.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last month that Wernick had put intense pressure on her to help SNC-Lavalin avoid prosecution over allegations it bribed Libyan officials.

The scandal is the most serious faced by the 47-year-old Trudeau since he led the Liberals out of the political wilderness and into power in 2015 on a promise to do politics differently.

The Conservatives, the largest opposition party in parliament, and the left-leaning New Democrats accuse Trudeau of old-style backroom deals and trying to cover up what happened.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Wernick had resigned “in disgrace” and repeated his calls for a full public inquiry, an idea that Trudeau has already ruled out.

“This is like a five-alarm dumpster fire of political cronyism, incompetence and now obstruction. What is the prime minister so afraid of?” New Democrat legislator Charlie Angus said in the House of Commons.

Earlier this month, Trudeau denied he or his officials had interfered in the judicial system, and he offered no apology.

In a surprise move, Trudeau on Monday named Joyce Murray, a 64-year-old Liberal backbencher with no federal cabinet experience, as president of the Treasury Board, where she will be in overall charge of government spending.

Murray replaces Jane Philpott, who quit on March 4 in protest over how the government was handling the crisis.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted in January, resigned from Trudeau’s Cabinet the next month.

SNC-Lavalin is accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011. The firm had strongly lobbied in favor of a deferred prosecution agreement, or out-of-court settlement, instead of going to trial.

In particular, she will be looking at whether the roles of attorney general and minister of justice should be split in light of the accusations by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould of a “consistent and sustained effort” by senior government officials including Trudeau to pressure her into helping SNC-Lavalin escape a criminal trial.

“She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the Cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada.”

McLellan had been scheduled to participate in a Liberal Party fundraiser on March 31 to support getting more women candidates for the party.

A spokesperson for the Liberal Party says she will not longer do so given her appointment.

Her appointment quickly prompted jeers and laughter from the opposition benches, with Conservatives questioning her ability to provide impartial examinations and recommendations given she served with Liberal members who still sit in caucus and in cabinet, including Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale.

“She’s a former Liberal minister that was there during the sponsorship scandal,” said Mark Strahl, Conservative whip.

“This is like a five-alarm dumpster fire,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus.

McLellan is a senior adviser in the Edmonton office of national law firm Bennett Jones LLP.

She became an MP for the riding of Edmonton Northwest in 1993 and was soon after named as minister of natural resources.

She served under former Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien as minister of justice and attorney general from 1997 until 2002, then as minister of health from 2002 to 2003, then lost her seat in 2006 when former prime minister Paul Martin was defeated.

Her appointment came just minutes after Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick announced he will retire early amid questions over his role in the SNC-Lavalin affair and two days after a report by the Globe and Mail that Trudeau and senior officials in his office have retained legal counsel in the controversy.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said last month he was opening an investigation but his office has refused to confirm whether that remains ongoing.

Liberals are expected to send Island voters to the polls as early as this spring, but despite a booming economy the party is likely facing a rough ride.

The smallest province’s economy is on fire – the Conference Board of Canada says it will lead the country in economic growth over the next year.

But the Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs Premier Wade MacLauchlan – a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier – is personally unpopular.

A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released this month suggests the Green party has a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals are in third place, the poll suggests.

CRA president Margaret Brigley said satisfaction with the government has been declining.

“Right now there’s 51-per-cent satisfied. Based on our history, we see when satisfaction falls below 51 per cent it’s not necessarily likely that party will be voted back in. They’re right at the threshold right now,” she said.

The Charlottetown Guardian newspaper said in an editorial this week the Liberal party may have no choice but to switch leaders if it hopes to win the election.

Peter McKenna, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said in an interview there’s a strong desire for change among Island voters.

“What we’re seeing is even though the economy is very strong here on Prince Edward Island, it’s not translating into support for the governing party. More specifically, it’s not translating into support for Wade MacLauchlan as leader of the party and premier,” he said.

McKenna said MacLauchlan’s leadership style is seen as “too top-down, too dictatorial, that the public is not being properly consulted or listened to.”

“I quite frankly don’t think that the Liberals are going to be able to hold onto power in the next election if he’s the leader of the party,” McKenna said.

The current standings in the Island legislature are 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member.

McKenna said that even with a lead in the polls, Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker will have to assemble enough credible candidates in the Island’s 27 ridings if he hopes to have a chance to form Canada’s first Green government.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

“Islanders are desperate for something different. They’re tired of politics as usual. They think the change agent is the Green party and Peter Bevan-Baker,” he said.

The Tories saw a slight bump in the polls after choosing their new leader last month.

Brigley says voters may be looking to give someone else a turn after three terms of Liberal government, starting with then-premier Robert Ghiz 12 years ago.

The government doesn’t have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7, under the province’s fixed-date election provisions, but there have been indications the Liberals want to go early in an effort not to overlap with the federal election this fall.

MacLauchlan and Island cabinet ministers have made a series of funding announcements this month, joined by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several federal ministers.

And this week the provincial government released its third-quarter forecast for 2018-2019, showing a projected surplus of $13.8 million – up from a budgeted surplus of $1.5 million.

By nation I am not referring to Canada but to our nations — Cree, Anishinaabe, Saksika, Nakota and so on.","Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party made two fateful mistakes in the appointment of Jody Wilson-Raybould.

First, they underestimated her commitment to the law and her ethical framework that put the law before political expedience. Second, they didn’t realize that she came to government with an Indigenous agenda that superseded party politics.

Indigenous people have an interesting relationship with party politics; we see it as a means to an end and not an end in itself. We don’t regard political parties as our institutions but as non-Indigenous vehicles that can be used to meet our needs. This drives party hacks up the wall — they regard our party affiliation as shallow and superficial, and you know what? They’re right.

The loyalties of First Nations people extend from family to community and nation. By nation I am not referring to Canada but to our nations — Cree, Anishinaabe, Saksika, Nakota and so on. Anything else follows.

When our people enter the ring of partisan politics, it is usually because they have an agenda and want to make change. This might mean changing parties to accomplish it.

When Wilson-Raybould spoke out about First Nations–Canada relations she was admonished by Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council. He told her it wasn’t government policy. He was the former Deputy Minister of Indigenous Affairs and he had his own unwritten agenda, but that never came out.

To Wilson-Raybould the legal relations between Canada and the First Nations include the constitution, the Crown, the treaties and so on. These are the bedrock legal instruments that define our relationship and don’t need to be policy.

Other of our politicians have switched parties and put their people first.

Joan Beatty was a cabinet minister in the Calvert government in Saskatchewan, holding the posts of youth, culture and recreation and provincial secretary. After two terms in office she ran federally for the Liberals, setting off a firestorm of controversy.

Elijah Harper sat in the provincial legislature in Manitoba and did the famous act of denying unanimous consent to the adoption of the Meech Lake accord. Later he would switch parties and run for the Liberals in his provincial constituency.

Here in Saskatchewan, former FSIN chief Lawrence Joseph has run federally for both the Liberals and the NDP. Last year there was a joke going around that he planned to run as a Conservative so he could say he ran for all three parties.

But over the years our people have supported political parties because of the actions of the party leader or a local politician. For example, Tommy Douglas provided support for the Union of Saskatchewan Indians at their founding convention, a first at the time. He was honoured and supported at the ballot box for his friendship with the leaders in the reserves around Prince Albert. When John Diefenbaker extended the voting franchise and appointed James Gladstone from Alberta to the Senate, his stock in Indian Country soared.

On the other hand, after the Liberals presented the 1969 white paper on Indian Affairs, it took years for them to gain any voting foothold in Indian Country.

Last fall when Andrew Scheer addressed the chiefs at the Assembly of First Nations, he was booed during the question and answer session. Scheer was unable to state how his policies would differ from Harper’s and how he could rebuild trust in Indian Country.

Our elders have counselled us against partisan politics. John Tootoosis, a revered senator and elder, never cast a ballot in a federal or provincial election in his life. He saw partisan politics as a threat to our treaty rights and our sovereignty.

Over the years the position has become more fluid with increased participation at the ballot box, but the issues are much different from the mainstream and often not addressed by the various candidates.

At the conclusion of her testimony to the justice committee, Jody Wilson-Raybould said, “I come from a long line of matriarchs and I am a truth-teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our Big House. This is who I am and who I will always be.”

Vickers made the announcement to a crowd of about 125 party supporters from around the province at a noon launch in his hometown of Miramichi.

Ten sitting Liberal MLAs, several former party MLAs and ministers, former premier Camille Thériault and federal MP Pat Finnigan attended the campaign launch.

With no sitting or former MLAs in the race so far, Vickers's name recognition and support vaults him into the front-runner position.

The 62-year-old Vickers was also credited with bringing calm to the Burnt Church fishing crisis in 1999-2000.

""I bring people together,"" he said. ""That is what I do. That is who I am.""

He was appointed Canada's ambassador to Ireland in the wake of the Ottawa shooting and retired from that position earlier this year.

Vickers is a political neophyte who told CBC News earlier this month that his ideological views are ""all over the map,"" overlapping with those of several political parties.

He said he is a fiscal conservative who also embraces progressive values, and said on environmental issues he is ""more green than the Greens.""

He has never held elective office, and as if to rebut concerns about his inexperience, he laid out what he calls ""five critical areas"" of provincial policy that he said will be his focus.

They are economic development and population growth; fiscal responsibility; education; health care, and what he called ""fact-based, environmentally sound decision-making.""

He also sketched some specific proposals, such as trying to lure immigrants equal to one percent of New Brunswick's population each year.

And he criticized Progressive Conservative Premier Blaine Higgs for cancelling planned upgrades to Route 11 between Shediac and Miramichi. Higgs has denounced the project as unnecessary.

Speaking to reporters, Vickers pledged to work at helping New Brunswickers bridge their divisions, including over language.

In a recent Facebook post, he denounced populist extremism worldwide, though he said Friday that he didn't see any examples of political parties in New Brunswick practising it.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau's 2019 fiscal plan also is expected to introduce measures to help millennials and other first-time homebuyers get into the housing market.

With a fixed election date set for Oct. 21, many of the multi-year funding promises could serve as campaign platform planks.

Here's what to watch for when Morneau rises in the House of Commons to table the budget at 4 p.m. ET.

Deficit down?

The Liberals have long since abandoned their 2015 election campaign promise to return to budgetary balance by 2019, but many Canadians will be closely examining this year's bottom line and looking for a plan to get back to balance.

The deficit projected for the current fiscal year — projected at $18.1 billion — is expected to be smaller than forecast.

Aaron Wudrick, national director of the Canadian Taxpayers' Federation, said that with an election on the horizon and the SNC-Lavalin controversy still making headlines, he's not expecting a belt-tightening budget. Instead, he predicts a new burst of spending with no focus on cutting the deficit or returning to balance.

""I expect they will try to frame further deficit spending as an investment necessary to boost or steady the economy,"" he said.

""The problem with this argument is that they were also running deficits even when the economy was humming along. It can't always be time to run deficits and never time to pay them down. The math doesn't add up.""

Support for seniors

Canadians are living and working longer, and this year's budget is expected to deliver measures to help seniors enjoy dignified and secure retirements, including possible supports for low-income older adults.

The seniors' advocacy group CARP has delivered a budget wish list which includes pension protections and an awareness campaign to combat elder abuse.

The group also has pitched changes to the caregivers program and home renovation credits to make them more senior-friendly.

Universal pharmacare

The Liberal government has promised to bring in a national pharmacare program — but don't expect to see a big-figure budget commitment to finance it this year. Instead, the government is expected to earmark ""foundational"" funding as it awaits a final set of recommendations from the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare.

Linda Silas, a pharmacare advocate and president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, said she hopes the government will make ""start-up"" investments to follow up on the council's interim report. That report recommends creating a national drug agency, developing a comprehensive list of prescription drugs (a national formulary) to harmonize coverage, and obtaining data and information technology systems.

""All of that, the start-up funds, can be done now and then within a year we could have the beginnings of a national pharmacare program,"" Silas said.

She added making seed investments now would have the effect of committing future governments to a pharmacare program.

Skills retraining

Many Canadian employers have complained that they can't find skilled workers to fill their jobs, while many workers have complained they don't have the skills they need to adapt to a changing labour market.

To that end, the budget is expected to bring in measures to help people take time for skills development and retraining while still paying household bills.

CBC News has learned that the budget will introduce personalized accounts to help Canadians pay for lifelong learning and skills development.

Affordable homes for millennials

Hot housing markets have made buying a first home a pipe dream for many millennials, as the cost of home ownership relative to income continues to rise.

In Toronto, the cost of owning a home will be 79 per cent of the median household income of $71,631 by the end of this year, up from about 76 per cent in 2018.

Morneau has promised to make houses more affordable for millennials and other first-time buyers through various policy and regulatory measures affecting supply and demand.

RBC chief economist Craig Wright said he isn't convinced this is a problem demanding a fix. He said while there has been a marked decline in the past decade, the home ownership rate among younger households remains high within Canada and compared to other countries, such as the U.S.",5 things to watch for in the Liberal election budget today,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/morneau-budget-2019-liberal-1.5061044

The Liberal government’s Tuesday budget will target millennials and baby boomers, the two large generations that will shape the outcome of the 2019 federal election.

Language around helping the broad middle class will remain a rhetorical staple, but Finance Minister Bill Morneau is singling out the two politically important demographics for special attention in this year’s budget.

For the first time in decades, baby boomers will no longer be the largest cohort of potential voters when Canadians head to the polls in October. According to Abacus Data, a polling firm that specializes in researching the consumer and voting trends of millennials, the generation of young Canadians will make up about 36 per cent of eligible voters, up sharply from 29 per cent in the previous federal election.

Story continues below advertisement

The polling firm defines millennials as those born between 1980 and 2000, although there are other definitions.

The firm estimates the percentage of eligible millennial voters will be slightly ahead of the 34 per cent of eligible voters who fall into the baby-boomer category.

Whether millennials will come out ahead among those who actually turn out and cast a ballot could be a key factor in determining the shape of Canada’s next Parliament.

Abacus Data pollster David Coletto said young voters were a key source of support for the Liberals in 2015 but that the governing party will need to generate enthusiasm among those younger voters if it hopes to win over that growing demographic in 2019.

“The Liberals need young people to vote for them again,” he said.

An Abacus survey conducted last year for the Canadian Real Estate Association found millennials listed housing affordability as the top issue that should be prioritized by the federal government.

The challenge for Mr. Morneau is that experts disagree over which – if any – of the potential policy options to boost affordability should be considered.

Story continues below advertisement

In his prebudget comments, the Finance Minister has specifically singled out millennials and seniors as groups that will benefit from budget measures. Announcements on housing and skills are expected to benefit younger Canadians. Seniors advocates say they would like to see private pension protection measures, improved support for low-income seniors and policies to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, among other possible announcements.

Liberals are also clearly hoping that this week’s budget will provide a distraction from the weeks-long controversy over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin issue, which has led to the resignation of two of his senior ministers – Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott – and his principal adviser and close friend, Gerald Butts. Another major resignation came Monday when Michael Wernick, a key player in the controversy, announced he is stepping down as Clerk of the Privy Council because he felt he did not have the trust of the opposition parties.

Melissa Lantsman, a former director of communications to Conservative finance minister Joe Oliver and vice-president of public affairs at Hill+Knowlton Strategies, said the government is clearly hoping to shift the public’s focus toward measures that will directly benefit groups that traditionally vote for the Liberals.

“The Liberals have honed in on their voter coalition to make sure that the cheques are in the mail for those that they think are most likely to vote for them,” she said.

However, Ms. Lantsman said the fact that the Liberals have clearly broken a campaign pledge to erase the deficit by 2019 will have lasting negative consequences for the Liberals in areas such as Toronto’s 905 area code where many ridings swing between electing Liberals and Conservatives.

“People in the 905 have some real questions for the Trudeau government,” she said. “It’s about a government that promised you one thing and didn’t deliver.”

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto. Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair. With the resignation of clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick — one of the main protagonists in the controversy — announced just minutes before question period, the focus promptly returned to the topic that has consumed Canadian politics for the past five weeks. Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation. But he may have to wait a few more months — until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign — for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

Article Continued Below

Tuesday’s budget — the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office — marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future. In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Article Continued Below

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda. One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more. But the SNC-Lavalin affair — and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction — has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic. As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue. Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh. The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives. It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage. Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000. On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals. Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner. Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago. Like Clark who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks. In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of NDP MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at 9 per cent, two points ahead of the NDP. The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall. As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

Also on Monday, the Liberals who make up a majority on that committee said publicly that they believe it has done all it can, or should, to investigate the affair.

In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, Wernick said he will retire before this fall’s federal election campaign kicks off. He noted that the clerk is supposed to be “an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference” occurs during the campaign, as part of a new federal watchdog panel, and is also supposed to be ready to help whichever party is elected to form government — two roles he no longer believes he can fulfil.

“It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” Wernick wrote. “I wish to relinquish these roles before the election. It is essential that Canadians continue to see their world-leading public service as non-partisan and there to provide excellent services to Canadians and the governments they elect.”

Wernick, who has served in senior public service roles for nearly 38 years, has been clerk of the Privy Council since 2016, shortly after the Trudeau Liberals assumed office. Government insiders have said he wanted to retire as clerk a year ago but was persuaded to stay on.

Wilson-Raybould has accused Wernick of making “veiled threats” that she’d lose her job as justice minister and attorney general if she didn’t cave in to pressure last fall from Trudeau and his senior staff to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya. She has said they pushed her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Montreal engineering giant, which would have forced the company to pay stiff penalties but let it avoid the risk of a criminal conviction that could threaten its financial viability.

Wernick has denied the accusation and maintained that all concerned acted with the highest standards of integrity.

Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about undue pressure only surfaced publicly after she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle. She resigned from cabinet a month later. Her exit was followed by the departure of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and then the resignation from cabinet of Jane Philpott, who cited loss of confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Wernick’s decision to quit as well proves “this SNC-Lavalin scandal is even bigger than we thought,” said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre.

Trudeau said he intends to name Ian Shugart, currently deputy minister of foreign affairs, to replace Wernick.

On his way into the House of Commons, Trudeau thanked the clerk for his “extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades” and credited his government’s accomplishments “definitely in large part” to Wernick’s leadership of the public service. Trudeau did not respond when asked if he’d sought Wernick’s resignation but his office later said he had not.

Wernick’s letter was released minutes before MPs reconvened for their first question period after a two-week March break, an exchange that proved explosive almost from the get-go.

Opposition members erupted in protest when Trudeau announced he’d appointed former Liberal justice minister Anne McLellan as a special adviser to explore what he called “important questions” about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice, who plays a dual role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

McLellan “will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation, of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,” the prime minister said in a statement. “She will consider whether machinery-of-government or legislative changes may or may not be recommended.”

“Her work will be another important step towards maintaining Canadians’ confidence in their institutions,” he told the Commons.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer mocked the announcement as nothing more than saying “Liberals will investigate Liberals.”

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus ridiculed the idea of a Liberal minister from the era of the sponsorship scandal looking into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which he dubbed “a five-alarm dumpster fire.”

As for Wernick, Angus professed no surprise at his decision to retire.

“I think once we saw how much of an active political player Mr. Wernick was in the SNC scandal, it became impossible for him to carry on his job, which is to have the trust of all parliamentarians on key matters of policy,” he said outside the Commons.

Angus also said Wernick should have “known better” in the way he presented himself before the justice committee, suggesting he was combative, evasive and partisan.

MPs on the committee were taken aback when he prefaced his initial testimony with a diatribe about the deteriorating tenor of political discourse, with incitements to violence that he said made him fear someone will be assassinated during the coming election campaign. He cited the example of a Conservative senator who’d urged truckers in a pipeline protest on Parliament Hill to “roll over every Liberal” in the country.

Wernick engaged in a number of testy exchanges with opposition MPs. In a second appearance, he suggested profane messages he received through the social media “vomitorium” after his first appearance amounted to witness intimidation.

The Liberal-dominated committee is to meet Tuesday to consider opposition demands to recall Wilson-Raybould. She has already testified for nearly four hours but has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation a month later.

But the five Liberals on the justice committee — Edmonton’s Randy Boissonault, Toronto-area MPs Iqra Khalid and Ali Ehassi, B.C.’s Ron McKinnon and Nova Scotia’s Colin Fraser — tipped their hand in an open letter to their fellow Liberal who chairs it, Anthony Housefather.

“The committee has heard from principal witnesses in this matter,” their joint letter says, including Wernick, Wilson-Raybould, and Trudeau’s top aide Gerald Butts. They’ve met for 13 hours of testimony over 11 meetings, it says, and “Canadians can judge for themselves the facts, perspectives and relevant legal principles … As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings.”

McLellan’s work and a separate investigation by the federal ethics commissioner will complete the picture, the letter says.

In the Commons, Trudeau himself likewise argued that the committee has been meeting for five weeks and has heard “all perspectives.” He suggested further inquiry should be left to the federal ethics commissioner.",Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick to quit before election in wake of SNC-Lavalin scandal,Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/national/privy-council-clerk-michael-wernick-retires-in-wake-of-snc-lavalin-scandal

According to the Liberal Party, McLellan ...","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has appointed former Liberal cabinet minister and deputy prime minister Anne McLellan to examine the dual role of justice minister and attorney general in the federal cabinet — and whether the two roles ought to change.

""Significant issues have been raised recently about relations between the former attorney general and justice minister and government. And I am announcing today that Anne McLellan will be appointed to investigate independently,"" Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday. ""As former justice minister and attorney general and deputy PM, she has a unique understanding of the role.""

Trudeau said that McLellan will act as a special adviser, examining whether the cabinet roles of justice minister and attorney general — which are occupied by the same person in Canada — should be reformed in the wake of allegations of political interference in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

McLellan will report her findings to the prime minister and provide recommendations by June 30.

""She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,"" Trudeau said in a statement.

The prime minister first said he intended to appoint someone to look into the dual role on March 7.





""I believe that it is timely and appropriate to examine these questions. I look forward to providing my advice to the prime minister,"" McLellan said in a statement.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general of Canada, told a Commons committee last month that she felt she was improperly pressured by 11 officials in the Prime Minister's Office to allow Quebec-based engineering company SNC-Lavalin avoid bribery and corruption charges providing it met a number of conditions in a potential remediation agreement.

Wilson-Raybould did not allow the firm to enter into such an agreement, but the ensuing political controversy has raised questions about whether it's time to consider dividing her former role into two separate positions — to keep the attorney general free of political pressure.

'It's not that hard'

McLellan, who held the post of justice minister and attorney general from 1997 to 2002 under then-prime minister Jean Chrétien, told CBC earlier this month that she backs the idea of looking at splitting the current role. She also argued that when she served in the post, its dual nature made for better policy.

She said she was often pushed hard to lean toward certain decisions, but that she enjoyed those debates. She said it made for better legislation — but only because everyone knew where the ""red lines"" were.

""It sounds complex, but actually day in, day out, it's not that hard, as long as everybody knows what their roles are. PMO, clerk, colleagues, everybody knows what their role is.""

While McLellan said she supports a study of the dual role, she added that it should wait until after the political tensions surrounding the SNC-Lavalin affair have died down.





The Conservatives were quick to criticize the appointment, noting that McLellan, despite her political experience in the role, is an active member of the Liberal Party who has engaged in party fundraising efforts.

According to the Liberal Party, McLellan, will now no longer host a planned March 31 fundraising event to help female Liberal candidates run federally.

""Well, there you have it, Mr. Speaker. Liberals will investigate Liberals to get to the bottom of this. Former Liberal cabinet minister Anne Mclellan. Maybe Sheila Copps wasn't available,"" Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in the Commons today.

Remaining connected

Last month she said that, even if the roles are split, future attorneys general would have to somehow remain plugged in to the political context of decision-making.

""I don't believe that the attorney general should be isolated from the concerns, the anxieties, the fears, the aspirations of their colleagues,"" she said. ""And when I say colleagues, I mean ministerial, caucus colleagues and opposition colleagues.

""The attorney general cannot be divorced in making decisions around invoking sections of the anti-terrorism or other legislation, cannot be divorced by what is happening in various communities in our country, their fears, their aspirations, how they feel if a prosecution is commenced and a certain sentence is sought.""","Trudeau appoints Anne McLellan to advise PMO on the role of justice minister, attorney general in cabinet",Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trudeau-appoints-anne-mclellan-advise-193835321.html

Another 1,000 shot themselves dead.

By 2018, about 2,000 hanged themselves, while fewer than 600 committed suicide by firearm.

But despite the fact that hanging deaths have doubled and firearms suicides have fallen by almost half, you never hear anyone call for twine control or a long-rope registry. The “experts” and politicians who push for greater gun control (and who claim their only motive is public safety), seem to have very little interest in facts.

Most years, in the whole country, there are between 150 and 200 murders committed with guns and knives. Some years, guns slightly exceed knives as the murder weapon of choice. Most years stabbing murders are more numerous.

Yet you never hear a Liberal politician demand every home chef be forced to hand over his or her paring knives and potato peelers.

Still, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, Bill Blair, the minister of Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continue to hint at a ban on handguns and further restrictions on rifles and shotguns before this fall’s general election.

(I actually think the SNC-Lavalin scandal has made some new form of legislated gun control more likely. The allegations that the Trudeau government may have attempted to subvert Canada’s criminal justice system have begun to eat into core Liberal support. What better way to re-energize the Liberal base than to whip up the “progressive” passion for disarming law-abiding citizens.)

But to justify singling out law-abiding gun owners as the prime target of its anti-crime strategy, a government has to be able to blame legit owners somehow.

“Aha!,” the Liberal lights pop on. “We’ll claim law-abiding gun owners are now the No. 1 source for crime guns in Canada!”

And that is just what the governing party has been doing since the tragic shootings in Toronto’s trendy Danforth neighbourhood last summer – insisting that legit owners are really gun traffickers in disguise.

It’s true that in one year, three years ago, Toronto Police seized more than 500 firearms. The geographic origins of nearly two-thirds could not be determined. However, Toronto Police claimed that of the 200 or so they could pinpoint, the sources where divided roughly equally between the States and Canada.

But that was one year. In one city.

Ottawa police estimate nearly 80% of crime guns in the capital are foreign-sourced. And Hamilton police say smuggled firearms constitute three-quarters of their city’s crime guns.

Still, Liberal ministers persist in the myth that there are 1,200 break-ins every year in Canada to steal firearms, even though StatsCan’s database shows just five “robberies to steal firearms” in 2013, 16 in 2014, 12 in 2015 and 18 each in of 2016 and 2017.

Despite repeated claims by leading Liberals and anti-gun activists, the vast majority of crime guns in Canada are almost certainly not bought legally by a licensed owner here, then lost or sold on the black market.

Moreover, firearms researcher Dennis Young, himself an ex-Mountie, has filed numerous access-to-info requests with the federal government. Young has managed to pry out the fact that neither the RCMP nor StatsCan have ever compiled statistics on the sources of crime guns.

The RCMP admitted to Young they don’t even have a definition of what constitutes a “crime gun.”

Just as the Liberals pushed former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to rig the SNC case for partisan Liberal ends, they seem to be making stuff up about legit gun owners for partisan purposes, too.

“The stars are aligning in ways that as leader of the Green Party I don’t think I thought I’d ever see with the vote on the right-hand side of the (political) spectrum split with a break-away conservative party under Maxime Bernier, the Peoples’ Party,” said Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands), in Winnipeg for a town hall at the Park Theatre on Osborne on Saturday for the 19th stop on her cross-country Community Matters Tour. “We don’t know how well they will do but they will shave votes away from the Conservatives in enough ridings across Canada that the Conservatives won’t have a chance at a majority under Andrew Scheer. I don’t think the Liberals will have a chance for a majority because there’s clearly a bit of tarnish on (Justin Trudeau’s) glow.”

A minority Parliament would open up possibilities for the Greens if they can pick up seats and be in the position to hold what May likes to refer to as a ‘balance of responsibility’ as opposed to a balance of power to supporting the governing party if it stays turn to Green principles.

“Six parties means that it’s very likely that there will be a minority Parliament where we will have to cooperate and that is something we’ve always sought as Greens because we believe in cooperation,” she said, likening it to the mid-1960’s when a minority Liberal government under Lester B. Pearson worked with Tommy Douglas and the NDP and the result was universal health plan, Canada Pension Plan, unemployment insurance and other policies that Canadians now hold dear.

“My only real fear is that young voters who voted for the first time because they believed Justin Trudeau’s promises,” said May. “If they’re very disillusioned, they may feel cynical and that would be a shame. So we have to encourage people to vote no matter what.”

May said she is willing to work with any of the other parties to advance the Green Party agenda. It would be similar to the situation in British Columbia where the provincial Greens have a confidence and supply agreement to support the governing NDP.

“Maybe someone should ask Justin Trudeau if he’s willing to support a Green government,” added May, only half-joking.

In addition to her Winnipeg stop, May held events in Brandon and Portage la Prairie over the last two days. One of her events at Brandon University had to be moved to a bigger venue to accommodate the audience. Despite the party holding only one seat in Parliament and polling less than 4% nationally in the last federal election, May is encouraged by recent events including a strong showing in the federal byelection in Quebec where they polled at 13%.

“Everything I’ve seen in Manitoba is further encouraging me to think that anything could happen in the next election,” said May, who singled out several Manitoba Green candidates at Saturday’s town hall.

The former House of Commons sergeant-at-arms announced today in Newcastle, N.B., that he is seeking the Liberal leadership in New Brunswick.

Vickers is seeking to replace former premier Brian Gallant, who lost power last fall after the Liberals failed to form a minority government in the weeks following the tight Sept. 24 provincial election.

Vickers retired this month as Canada's ambassador to Ireland, and has been travelling New Brunswick over the last two weeks.

He has deep roots in the province. His father, Bill, helped establish the Northumberland co-op dairy decades ago.

Vickers had a long career of public service, including 29 years in the RCMP. He also served as aide-de-camp for the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. He served as sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons between 2006 and 2015.

On Oct. 22, 2014, Vickers was serving as sergeant-at-arms of the Commons when he shot and helped take down a man armed with a .30-30 rifle. Michael Zihaf Bibeau had barged into Centre Block on Parliament Hill after killing honour guard reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo at the National War Memorial.

2 other contenders expected to run

Vickers was appointed ambassador to Ireland in January 2015 by then-prime minister Stephen Harper.

Rene Ephestion, who leads the New Brunswick Liberal Multicultural Inclusion Commission, and Gaetan Pelletier, a businessman from Charlo, have also announced their intention to run for the provincial Liberal leadership.

During a 2008 visit to Canada it is believed that Garda World was hired by SNC-Lavalin to protect Saadi Gadhafi, the former ...","Almost lost in the current media storm surrounding the resignation of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, sparked by allegations that she faced political pressure from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office, is the timeline of events surrounding the original infraction.

Yes, we are all aware that Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was lobbying Trudeau’s inner circle hard in order to secure a deferred prosecution agreement, rather than face a possible criminal conviction for bribery charges.

In turn, Wilson-Raybould has testified before the Commons justice committee that Trudeau’s top aide, Gerald Butts, and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick pressured her on this file. Their argument was that a criminal conviction would preclude SNC-Lavalin from bidding on future federal government tenders. Should that occur, SNC-Lavalin executives had suggested they would fold up their headquarters tent in Montreal, and 9,000 skilled jobs would vanish from the Canadian landscape. This would, of course, not sit well with voters in an election year.

The allegations of political interference in this case have made this a decidedly Liberal Party scandal, with the Conservative opposition circulating petitions urging Trudeau to resign.

Upon closer examination, however, the actual accusations of SNC-Lavalin having bribed their way into lucrative Libyan construction contracts spans the period of 2001 to 2011. During that decade it is alleged that SNC-Lavalin representatives paid an estimated $48 million in bribes to members of the Gadhafi family.

During a 2008 visit to Canada it is believed that Garda World was hired by SNC-Lavalin to protect Saadi Gadhafi, the former Libyan president’s third-eldest son. That protection by Garda is alleged to have included some $30,000 worth of prostitutes and tickets to a Spice Girls concert.

The timeframe also puts this sordid affair back onto the Harper Conservatives. Fast forward to the spring of 2011 and the start of the Libyan uprising. At that juncture, no doubt thanks in part to the $48 million in palm grease paid to the Gadhafi family, SNC-Lavalin had secured billions of dollars’ worth of construction in Libya. Heck, they were even in the process of building a big new jail for the very president we were now labelling as a bloodthirsty despot.

Foreign affairs minister John Baird was among the loudest and most bellicose of western voices demanding that Gadhafi must go.

To help make that happen, Canada was among the first countries to participate in the NATO air campaign aimed at destroying the Gadhafi loyalist forces.

It took a hell of a lot longer than anyone would have imagined for the world’s most sophisticated air armada to defeat a fourth-rate African army, but by early October 2011, the end was clearly nigh. The last of the Gadhafi loyalists were contained alongside their embattled leader in the town of Sirte.

On Oct. 11, 2011, a full nine days before Libyan rebels would capture and murder Gadhafi, Baird made a secret visit into the rebel held Libyan capital of Tripoli. During that whirlwind trip, Baird met with and praised several of the Libyan rebel leaders and he announced Canada’s commitment of $10 million to secure Libyan weapons once the war was finally won.

Travelling with Baird were a number of Canadian business executives, including representatives from SNC-Lavalin, eager to start a new round of lucrative Libyan projects under the new post-Gadhafi leaders. Keep in mind that at this point Gadhafi was still alive and fighting.

So, if we are to believe that paying bribes to corrupt Third World leaders in order to obtain contracts is criminal nature, how do we define using military force to effect regime change, and then bringing in the carpet-baggers to profit from the puppet regime which we installed next?

The only problem with the Libyan caper was that Baird and company failed to listen to ambassador Sandra McCardell. She was with Baird in Tripoli as he used that same visit to reopen our embassy.

Her prophetic statement to the Canadian Press at that time was that getting the guns out of the hands of young, heavily armed rebels would be the best way for Canada to contribute to Libya’s post-Gadhafi reconstruction. That’s right, the best way to help Libya would be for us to disarm the rebels we had armed.

Baird never did say just how his $10 million in pledged funding would actually secure the Libyan arsenals, but suffice it to say whatever he had planned failed miserably.

Once Gadhafi was dead, the various rebel groups, Islamic extremists, human traffickers and tribal thugs began fighting among themselves. Libya quickly plunged into a failed state of violent anarchy, where it remains to this date.

The Trudeau Liberals tried to avert a possible criminal conviction for SNC-Lavalin’s alleged bribery. That’s bad.

""The Conservative Party of Canada needs to call it out, and they need to end any platform for this ...","As the world reels from an attack on two New Zealand mosques that killed 49 people, politicians in Canada are grappling with how best to handle a political landscape that one pollster says is seeing rising concerns of radical white nationalism.

In an interview with CTV Question Period host Evan Solomon, airing Sunday, Angus Reid Institute’s Shachi Kurl said Canadians are both increasingly concerned about the Islamic religion’s role in Canadian society and increasingly awake to a potential threat of white nationalist radicalization.

""On one hand we're still seeing a lot of suspicion towards the Muslim community, at the same time we’re seeing a rise of radical white nationalism that people are growing increasingly alive to,"" Kurl told Solomon.

""It’s starting to become a part of the Canadian political landscape.""

Politicians, meanwhile, are at odds in terms of how best to react to this changing political scene.

Following the mass shooting in New Zealand, political reaction steadily poured in. All party leaders – except for People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier – expressed their condolences at the news and condemned the attack.

However, it didn’t take long before politicians began weighing in on how best to engage with those spreading the kind of hate that Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen told CTV News ""feed[s] into a narrative"" that leads to the kind of violence seen in New Zealand on Friday.

One individual who ended up in the hot seat was Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who both NDP MP Tracey Ramsey and Liberal MP Jennifer O'Connell slammed for attending a pro-pipeline rally that was also attended by Faith Goldy. Goldy is a public figure known for espousing white nationalist views.

""We have a responsibility and we should be calling it out,"" said Ramsey. ""The Conservative Party of Canada needs to call it out, and they need to end any platform for this type of hate in our country.""

O'Connell echoed the concern.

""If you didn’t know that Faith Goldy was at this rally, then you should stand up and condemn it. Andrew Scheer should be a leader,"" she said.

However, Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre took issue with the characterization of the event. He said the event that both Goldy and Scheer attended was a rally in favour of pipelines. He also warned that if politicians suddenly become responsible for the views of every person who attends the same event they're attending, it would require a ""very different approach.""

""We always call out racism, we always oppose any form of hatred, and we absolutely condemn this terrorist attack and the hatred that motivated it,"" he said.

He accused Ramsey and O'Connell of attempting to score political points in raising the Goldy issue.

""It is not about political points to talk about the fact that there is a dialogue of hate,"" O'Connell said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also weighed in on the issue. Like the others, he echoed the importance of condemning and stemming the growth of hate.

""We know that hate is like a fire. Once allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everyone. So we all have a responsibility,"" Singh said.

Singh also pitched a slightly different approach for tackling the spread of hate. He said ""economic insecurity"" is at the heart of growing fear and hatred. The NDP leader suggested tackling that insecurity in order to stop the spread of hatred.

""The fear comes from a lack of hope for the future, and we can do so much better to help people out who are feeling fear,"" Singh said.",Politicians grapple with tackling the spread of hate following N.Z. mosque shootings,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/politicians-grapple-with-tackling-the-spread-of-hate-following-n-z-mosque-shootings-1.4338827

Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen (Portage-Lisgar, Man.) says her party’s cooperation in the Commons will depend on the government’s “transparency” on the SNC-Lavalin scandal, as MPs return to the House with 10 sitting weeks left before the next election campaign starts, and 21 active government bills still in Parliament—nine currently in the House and 12 in the Senate.

Ms. Chagger (Waterloo, Ont.) says the Liberals will try to pass them all, though the Conservative Whip in the Senate, Sen. Don Plett (Landmark, Man.), says he doesn’t think that will happen. At least nine of those 21 bills would make good on Liberal election promises from the last campaign, and that total does not include an implementation bill to bring parts of this year’s federal budget into effect.

The opposition parties in the House “are not going to make it easy for us to advance legislation,” Ms. Chagger said, referring as an example to second reading debate last month on the Indigenous Languages Bill, C-91. The Liberals had wanted to move C-91 to the committee stage after one day of debate so that the bill could more quickly be amended. Natan Obed, the leader of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, was harshly critical of the government’s work on C-91 when it was introduced because it did not include any Inuit-specific content. Ms. Chagger moved time allocation on the second day of debate.

“The fact that I had to use time allocation [on that bill] tells me that, yes, the opposition has a role to play and a very important role at that, but they are not going to make it easy for us to advance legislation even that impacts and benefits Canadians. So we will use the tools that we need to use, and we will make sure that we are delivering on our commitments,” she said.

Ms. Chagger listed several bills as among the government’s priorities in the House, including bills C-91 on Indigenous languages; C-92 on First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children in family services; and C-93 to make it easier for Canadians with marijuana convictions to apply for an receive pardons.

Seven other government bills in Parliament would address election promises made by the government in 2015, including C-58 on access to information reform, C-55 on ocean protection, C-68 on fisheries, C-69 on environmental assessments, C-71 on gun safety, C-75 on criminal justice reform, and C-81 on accessibility.

Ms. Bergen told The Hill Times in an emailed statement that the Conservatives will make their cooperation in the House of Commons contingent on the Liberal government’s “transparency” on the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Last week Liberal members on the House Justice Committee voted to adjourn a committee meeting on the subject after a half-hour, pushing further discussions to an in-camera meeting on the subject the following week, and triggering calls of a coverup from Conservative MPs. The Conservatives want the committee to invite former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould (Vancouver Granville, B.C.) to testify again about alleged pressure from the PMO to intervene in the criminal justice system in favour of SNC-Lavalin.

“As it relates to the management of House business, the level of cooperation from the Opposition will directly relate to the level of openness and transparency the Liberals have in the SNC-Lavalin affair,” Ms. Bergen wrote.

“While key figures close to the prime minister are able to speak freely and fully, Justin Trudeau banned Jody Wilson-Raybould from completing her testimony. This is not right or fair. Ms. Wilson-Raybould must be allowed to speak her full truth. Conservatives are prepared to use every parliamentary tool available to make sure that happens.”

The Conservatives had planned to use an opposition day March 18 to trigger a marathon voting session in the House of Commons and potentially delay the tabling of this year’s budget, but the government blocked their attempt by moving the opposition day to March 20, the CBC reported.

The government likely won’t have an easy time in the Senate either. The minority Conservative opposition in the Senate has been willing and able to disrupt and delay debate in the Senate at times when they were unhappy with the way the government and Independent Senators were dealing with legislation or Conservative proposals in the Chamber or in committee. The Senate will likely be asked to deal with government bills quickly as they are moved up from the House in the next few months, but the Conservatives are making no guarantees that they will agree to do so.

Of the 21 active government bills in Parliament, four are relatively uncontroversial and have generated relatively little debate in either Chamber so far: Bill C-85 to amend the Canada-Israel free trade agreement; Bill S-6 to implement a tax convention between Canada and Madagascar; Bill C-82, on a multilateral anti-tax avoidance agreement; and Bill C-84 on animal cruelty. That leaves up to 17 government bills in the House and Senate that may face stiffer opposition.

“They want us to bring all of this stuff through, and yet they want to say this is the Chamber of sober second thought,” said Sen. Plett. “There is blessed little time to get 17 bills through.”

“You’re not going to get all 17 bills. You’ve got to understand that,” he said.

“If the government is throwing bills at us in the last week, or two weeks, and wants us to deal with them, it may not happen,” he said.

“We are not going to rush bills through for the sake of rising on June 21.”

Sen. Plett said he has been asked by Conservative Senate Leader Larry Smith (Saurel, Que.) to negotiate on behalf of the Senate Conservatives at times with the government’s representative in the Senate, Sen. Peter Harder (Ottawa, Ont.), on when and how legislation moves through the Senate. He said he has not met with the facilitator of the Independent Senators Group—the largest group in the Senate—Sen. Yuen Pau Woo (B.C.), because he does not have the authority to make decisions on behalf of ISG Senators, who are more loosely organized than the other groups in the Senate.

Sen. Woo declined an interview request from The Hill Times. Sen. Harder also declined, sending an emailed statement that “Canadians expect Senators to exercise sober second thought but also to do so in a timely fashion.”

Sen. Plett said the Conservatives will at a minimum push for serious amendments to four of the government bills currently in front of Senate committees: C-71 on gun safety, C-68 on fisheries, C-69 on environmental assessments, and C-48 on a tanker ban on the West Coast. He said he hasn’t yet considered bills still in the House of Commons.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) has also said he wanted to enact changes to the Parliament of Canada Act in order to help entrench the new, multi-group dynamic in the Senate that he helped to create. He has said he wants those changes to the Act made before the next election, and tasked Ms. Chagger with the file. However, the House is waiting on the Senate to first complete a lengthy process to essentially approve of those changes, which may not be completed in time.

Grounded: Three days after an airline crash in Ethiopia raised questions about the safety of one of the world’s most popular aircraft, and days after many countries first grounded their fleets of Boeing 737 Max 8s and 9s—including all of Europe—it was finally Canada’s turn.

Attention has fallen on Transport Minister Marc Garneau‘s delayed decision to order those models of planes to stay on the ground. At Garneau’s press conference, which came just hours before the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority also grounded the planes, the former pilot and astronaut delivered a clinical explanation of the “new data” behind the government’s decision. But, as Shannon Proudfoot writes, while Garneau’s tone was resolutely keep-calm-for-we-are-carrying-on, the facts he laid out were unavoidably the stuff of deep human phobia. (Maclean’s)

‘The Justin committee’: An emergency televised meeting of the justice committee looking into the SNC-Lavalin controversy ended in howls of “cover-up” and “shame” after the Liberal majority on the committee shut it down less than 30 minutes in. Opposition members want to bring former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould back to testify for a second time. The Liberals voted instead to shut down the meeting and wait until a scheduled non-televised meeting to debate Wilson-Raybould’s return on March 19—budget day. During and after the vote opposition MPs unleashed on the Liberals: “Justin Trudeau is transforming the justice committee into the Justin committee,” said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre. (CBC News)

“All alarms” were sounded at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development when Wilson-Raybould testified that she’d felt sustained pressure to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution. Drago Kos, chair of the OECD’s working group on bribery—which said earlier this week it is watching to see how the SNC-Lavalin case unfolds—reiterated that “national economic interest” (Read: 9,000 jobs) should not be considered when prosecutors decide whether to pursue anti-bribery charges: “Only the merits of the case should be taken into consideration and nothing else.” (CBC News)

Despite being at the centre of a raging political storm, Wilson-Raybould said she is ...","Jody Wilson-Raybould says she is “overwhelmed and grateful” about an outpouring of public support since her scorching testimony in the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

And despite a nasty internal backlash after her explosive appearance before the federal justice committee, she has no intention of quitting the Liberal caucus in Ottawa.

“It really has been quite remarkable,” Wilson-Raybould said Saturday, in her first public remarks since her bombshell testimony.

“I have heard from thousands of people — neighbours, friends, constituents, as well as people from all across Canada.”

The former attorney general said she plans to run for re-election in the fall under the Liberal banner in Vancouver Granville.

“I feel overwhelmed and grateful. In my mind, all I was doing was my job.”

Wilson-Raybould stunned Ottawa last week with three hours of shocking testimony in the SNC-Lavalin affair, saying she was hounded for months to let the Liberal-connected, Quebec-based engineering company off the hook on criminal corruption charges.

Wilson-Raybould said nearly a dozen top power players in the government — including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Finance Minister Bill Morneau and several of Ottawa’s most powerful political staffers and bureaucrats — relentlessly pressured her to give the company a plea-bargain deal, which she refused to do.

She said she faced a “sustained effort” and “veiled threats” to intervene in the case. Trudeau removed her as attorney general in January and she resigned from his cabinet outright on Feb. 12.

“Like Canadians everywhere, I just try to do my job the best I can,” she said, adding she’s been recognized everywhere she goes while messages of support pour in.

“People coming up to me in airports, social media, emails, deliveries to my offices — I’m grateful for all of the support and kind thoughts.”

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

Trudeau has denied he did anything improper in the SNC-Lavalin case and said he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

Since her testimony, she has faced criticism from fellow Liberals for breaking ranks. Liberal MP Jati Sidhu said she was not a “team player” and “couldn’t handle the stress” of her job, calling her testimony “sour grapes.” He later apologized for the remarks.

Despite the backlash, Wilson-Raybould said she has no intention of leaving the Liberals.

“I was elected as the Liberal member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville and I will continue to serve as such,” she said.

Trudeau said last week he had not decided whether Wilson-Raybould will be allowed to remain in the government caucus or to run again for the Liberals.

“I haven’t yet had the opportunity to review her entire testimony,” Trudeau said. “I will do that before making any further decisions.”

But Wilson-Raybould said she’s already secured the Liberal nomination for the October election.

“I was confirmed as the Liberal Party of Canada candidate for Vancouver Granville last year,” she said.

Despite being at the centre of a raging political storm, Wilson-Raybould said she is feeling upbeat and confident.

“I am doing fine,” she said. “The past few weeks have been eventful ones for our country, our system of government, and for myself and family.”

The House of Commons is now on a two-week break. Wilson-Raybould said she returned to Vancouver late Friday and is happy to be home.

“For sure I am looking forward to spending time back here for the next couple of weeks,” she said. “I’m looking forward to reconnecting with my constituents.”

The justice committee, meanwhile, is continuing its investigation of the scandal, while Canada’s independent ethics watchdog, Mario Dion, has launched an investigation of Trudeau’s actions.

The RCMP said it is reviewing complaints that government officials may have broken federal obstruction-of-justice laws.

Two Conservative MPs have also cancelled an event on Monday with a British parliamentarian who has been accused of promoting anti-Islamic sentiments “out of respect” for Muslims reeling from the attacks that killed 49 people.

Scheer posted to Twitter and Facebook late Thursday evening in Canada as news of the attacks was reported, saying “freedom has come under attack” and mentioning “peaceful worshippers” and a “despicable act of evil.”

“All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear,” he wrote.

But the statement was condemned quickly online for failing to specify that the attack was on Muslims, during prayers at mosques. Some pointed to the fact he did name Coptic Christians and call out anti-Semitism in previous tweets when killers attacked Egyptian churches in 2017 and a synagogue in Pittsburgh last fall.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims criticized the omission in a statement Friday afternoon.

“While some of our elected leaders sadly choose not to mention ‘Muslim’ or ‘mosque’ while denouncing the Christchurch attacks, the reality is that these horrific shootings and the Quebec City mosque attack on Jan. 29, 2017, have left Canadian Muslim communities — and indeed, Muslims around the world — feeling very vulnerable and unsafe,” wrote the Council’s executive director Ihsaan Gardee. “It is therefore essential that our elected leaders speak out clearly and unequivocally against such attacks and name them for the Islamophobic terrorist attacks that they are.”

The statement does not mention Scheer by name but at that point, he was the only Canadian political leader whose public response to the attacks did not mention either Muslims or mosques.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s statement condemned the attacks as terrorism and said everyone must work to “confront Islamophobia.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that “Islamophobia kills.”

Green Leader Elizabeth May did not mention Muslims in her first Tweet but retweeted several others who did.

Former Conservative Maxime Bernier, now the leader of the People’s Party of Canada, hadn’t posted anything about the attacks at all by late Friday.

Scheer’s office did not respond to an initial query about the statement’s not mentioning Muslims but after being asked about the statement from the National Council of Canadian Muslims, his spokesman responded with a link to a new statement on Scheer’s Facebook page.

“As Canadians are learning the horrific details of last night’s terror attack at two New Zealand mosques, I wish to express both my deep sadness at the tragic loss of innocent life and my profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community,” it said.

It said Conservatives stand with Muslims around the world to “reaffirm our commitment to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together.”

A month ago, Scheer was criticized for sharing a stage on Parliament Hill with a cross-Canada truck convoy mostly protesting Liberal inaction on the energy industry but which included some people promoting hatred. Scheer said he was only there to support the energy workers, not the “other elements that tried to associate themselves with the event.”

Those “elements” were people affiliated with the Canadian Yellow Vest movement, whose Facebook page included some comments celebrating the New Zealand attacks Friday.

Meanwhile, Conservative MP Garnett Genuis tweeted Friday that Monday’s reception with Baroness Caroline Cox, a member of the British House of Lords, has been cancelled.

Genuis, an Edmonton-area MP, and fellow Conservative MP Kelly Block of Saskatchewan were to co-host the reception with Cox, who has shown support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and has said she believes Muslims are trying to destroy Western democracies with Shariah law.

Toronto Liberal MP Judy Sgro pulled out of the event after she found out about Cox’s participation. Genuis initially rejected calls to follow suit, calling it a talk on human rights, and accused Sgro on social media of retreating only after she remembered this is an election year.

He said in a statement Friday that Cox’s views are subject of “some debate, and perhaps some confusion.”

“With that said, our friends in the Muslim community are now reeling from one of the most horrific and appalling terrorist attacks to ever target their community,” he wrote. “Out of respect for them, now is not the time for a conversation that could been (sic) misconstrued to take place on Parliament Hill. As such, the event will not be proceeding as planned.”",Tory leader issues new statement on attacks including mention of Muslims,O Canada,https://o.canada.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/tory-leader-issues-new-statement-on-attacks-including-mention-of-muslims/wcm/abe42706-19a0-4f66-966a-50ce12e58700

When respondents were asked earlier this month to choose the two most important national issues, health care was the most common answer at 23 per cent, followed by the environment, income inequality, corruption, government spending, housing affordability, the economy, energy, immigration and finally taxes, which polled at 10 per cent.

When a similar poll was conducted in early 2016, as the federal Liberals prepared their first budget, Canadians ruled the economy the most important issue. Jobs ranked second. But that doesn’t indicate an end to Canadians’ anxiety. Four-in-10 respondents expect the economy to worsen over the next year. Fifty-five per cent say it’s not a good time to make a big-ticket purchase. Nearly half of respondents were worried that someone in their household could lose their job because of the economy. There is a growing group of Canadians who feel left behind or on the margins, said Stewart Prest, Simon Fraser University political scientist. They are looking for security, he said, and this will manifest in different ways ahead of October’s general election.

“The economy affects people in concrete ways, which varies by personal circumstances a lot,” Prest explained. “We are going to be having multiple, distinct conversations, and it may be harder to have broader national conversations that bring people on the same way.” The budget is expected to address pharmacare, specific jobs training and potentially housing. While Prest said it’s difficult to determine how things will play out, six months ahead of the general election, he speculated the Liberals will double down on issues that resonate with their base, such as immigration or Islamophobia. During Monday’s Question Period in Parliament, Trudeau was vocal about denouncing white supremacy and racism, saying the fight will be “major” but Canada cannot put it off anymore. “I suspect the Liberals will give up on trying to please everyone,” Prest said. “They are going to try to build a winning coalition and won’t necessarily be casting as wide a tent as they did in 2015.”

The issues on Canadians’ minds — including housing affordability, inequality, taxation and spending — “break” in two different directions, according to Shachi Kurl, Angus Reid executive director. “This splits along political lines. Those who would consider voting Conservative Party are more concerned about the latter issues. Those who would consider the Liberals and/or NDP key on the former,” she said in an email.

There are marked provincial differences as well. Respondents in Alberta and Saskatchewan are feeling the most bleak, with nearly half of residents believing their standard of living worsened in the last year. Those regions also have the highest anxiety over potential job losses, with six-in-10 residents concerned for the household. However, Albertans are more likely to expect their standards of living to improve next year, while Saskatchewanians are more likely to believe it will worsen. Meanwhile, poverty in Canada is lower than ever. The Liberal government attributes its decline to the Canada Child Benefit and an increase in the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors, the poll report noted. However, middle-class growth — a key component of the government’s 2015 platform — has largely been stagnant. Recent income-tax data suggests these households have seen little to no increase in income. Meanwhile, unemployment has dropped and the economy has grown relatively steadily, the poll report explained. That’s why the Trudeau government will have to straddle making life more affordable while showing they’re taking deficit spending seriously, Kurl said. From a political standpoint, this is an “absolutely crucial budget,” Kurl said, given the government’s need to change the channel on the contentious SNC-Lavalin affair. “MPs in caucus are likely clamouring for something more to talk about on the doorstep and community events than the PM’s explanation of what happened,” she explained. “They’re getting hammered in the polls and desperate to move on.” The Angus Reid Institute conducted the self-commissioned online survey from March 8 to March 10, polling 1,594 Canadian adults who are members of its forum. The margin of error is +/- 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food, culture and policy. Follow her on Twitter: @mdgmedia

– Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Joyce Murray as President of the Treasury Board. This appointment filled the position left vacant by Jane Philpott. Philpott resigned on March 4, citing a “loss of confidence” in the government following the SNC-Lavalin controversy. Murray will also become the Minister of Digital Government. This is the third time Trudeau has shuffled his cabinet in 2019.

– Following OPEC’s meeting in Azerbaijan over the weekend, oil prices edged up to $67 per barrel on Monday morning. OPEC has cut their oil supply, and may continue to do so for the remainder of the year. Brent crude oil was $67.36 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate rose to $58.57.

– New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her cabinet is “completely unified” to reforming gun legislation following the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15. The terrorist attack killed at least 50 people. A 28-year-old Australian man will face charges in New Zealand.

– Germany’s two largest banks, Deutsche and Commerzbank, are currently negotiating the possibility of merging together. This move would cost as many as 30,000 jobs in the long-term, and is a move that experts regard as making little sense. The Deputy Head of the Left opposition party, Fabio De Masi, said that “two sick turkeys do not make an eagle.”

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

Whether to build them or keep Alberta’s oil in the ground has become arguably the single most galvanizing and politically fraught issue in Canadian politics, and it is almost certain to redraw the country’s political map.

Canada’s inability to get pipelines built and provide Alberta producers an outlet for their oil has resulted in a renewed alienation – something underscored by a recent Angus Reid survey.

When Reid’s company polled western Canadians recently, it found 35% support among respondents for the Western Canada Party – six points higher than the Conservative party scored and twice what the Liberals and NDP garnered.

Those are pretty good numbers for a party that doesn’t exist. There is, of course, no Western Canada Party. Not yet, anyway.

But support for the concept of a western political party speaks to the alienation again being felt in the West toward Ottawa.

Reid writes that “feelings of resentment towards Ottawa are higher than ever, and the potential for change in the electoral map is intensifying.”

What is different today from the east-west enmity of the 1980s is that Western Canada is no longer a region that federal politicians can ignore, Reid argues. Combined, Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan are economic powerhouses. And as Reid pointed out, by 2036, the four western provinces will represent one-third of Canada’s population.

Martha Hall Findlay, president of the Canada West Foundation, said it’s a mistake to consider frustration with the state of resource development in Canada as strictly a western Canadian phenomenon.

She said the frustration is felt across Canada.

“Poll after poll after poll, the majority of Canadians, outside of Quebec, support pipelines,” she said.

Pollster Mario Canseco agreed.

“There is definitely a sense of people getting tired of the stuff getting stuck,” said the Research Co. president. “There is a sentiment of ‘Are we ever going to get unanimity for these things?’ and the answer is no.”

Despite opposition to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from John Horgan’s BC NDP government and federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Canseco said he has noted a marked shift in attitude among NDP supporters.

“What I have seen is more level of support for specific projects coming from the NDP voter and the Liberal voter,” Canseco said.

“We went from a situation where the NDP voter was more likely to say, ‘No, let’s not do this,’ and now we’re going into a situation where the NDP voter is saying, ‘Well, we kind of have to.’”

Nationally, the ally that the Trudeau government had in Alberta with Rachel Notley’s NDP government appears doomed, thanks to the unfinished business of pipelines.

Polling suggests she will lose to Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party. Relations between Alberta and B.C. and Ottawa could become hostile.

Should the Trudeau government fail to build the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, Kenney could punish the Horgan government with new legislation that empowers Alberta to restrict the flow of gasoline and diesel to B.C., to free up pipeline capacity for Alberta crude oil.

B.C. has tried to have the courts declare the bill unconstitutional, but an Alberta court recently dismissed the application as being premature, because the Alberta bill has yet to be officially proclaimed.

In its court application, B.C. revealed just how serious the consequences could be if Alberta were to play hardball.

Its affidavit warned that there is no alternative supply of gasoline and diesel, and that drastic price spikes and supply shortages could cause “civil unrest” in B.C.

Well, after Thursday’s news conference in St. John’s, it’s beginning to look like the same could be said about this province’s New Democratic Party.

Remember, the NDP is a party that came within a hair’s breadth of being the Official Opposition in 2011, before blowing apart when two MHAs defected to the Liberals as a result of dissent over Michael’s leadership.

So, here’s the thumbnail version (be ready — it’s a huge thumbnail): Lorraine Michael steps down as party leader in 2015 and is replaced by Earle McCurdy, who steps down and is replaced on an interim basis by — you guessed it — Lorraine Michael, who steps down again in 2018, when NDP MHA Gerry Rogers runs against Alison Coffin for the leadership and wins.

Alison Coffin

In 2019, Rogers steps down and is replaced by sole leadership candidate and former competition Coffin. Coffin then says she will support former leader Michael’s run for the nomination in Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi against a surprise challenge by St. John’s Deputy Mayor Sheilagh O’Leary.

O’Leary’s challenge gets completely spiked when Michael, who had clearly said she intended to run in the next provincial election, steps down so that Coffin, who had supported Michael’s incipient campaign, suddenly can run in her place. Then, O’Leary announces she's out of the race altogether.

How Michaelavellian.

Confused yet?

Or does this latest shifting of Titanic deck chairs just leave you shrugging your shoulders?

Here’s the problem: we are mere months from a provincial election, an election that may come even sooner if Premier Dwight Ball decides at some point that the stars are properly aligned for a Liberal win.

Sheilagh O'Leary

Remember, the NDP is a party that came within a hair’s breadth of being the Official Opposition in 2011, before blowing apart when two MHAs defected to the Liberals as a result of dissent over Michael’s leadership.

At this point, the NDP should be marshalling whatever election funding it can find, and it should be trying to line up potential star candidates — and yes, the deputy mayor of the province’s capital city would be a star candidate.

Instead, it looks very much like backroom shenanigans to ensure there isn’t a nomination battle in St. John’s-Quidi Vidi, just about the only district in the province that’s even close to being a safe NDP seat.

It is important that the leader of the party has a seat in the House of Assembly. A presence in the front benches of the legislature and in question period gets that leader into virtually every story coming out of the House, and that visibility is critically needed by the third-ranked party.

But, at what is essentially the last electoral minute, we have a party that doesn’t seem to be able to get its basic house in order.

“I am somehow saddened by the demographic replacement of white peoples in their homelands,” Caylan Ford is reported to have written in private Facebook messages. “It’s clear that it will not be a peaceful transition.”

The messages are the focus of an exposé published late Monday by PressProgress.

The myth that white people face “replacement” by immigrants is a favourite talking point among white nationalists. “The Great Replacement” was the title of the screed published by the perpetrator of the recent massacre of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand.

This is not the first time the UCP has been linked to white nationalists and other xenophobic extremists.

Ford, who was running in the Calgary-Mountain View riding, also worried that without “Western peoples,” Western culture would die out.

And she expressed concern that anyone who shared some of the views held by white supremacists was “painted with the same brush,” according to PressProgress.

“You just don’t have the same attempts to separate the violent terrorists from the wider community of belief,” she said.

A star recruit

According to the National Post, Kenney persuaded Ford to run after she corrected his misquote of Edmund Burke at an event. The UCP leader called it “political love at first sight.”

On paper, Ford looked like a star recruit for the UCP, especially as the party faced criticism about its lack of gender balance.

She has a master’s degree in international human rights law from Oxford University and graduated with distinction, according to her UCP candidate webpage.

“Wherever possible, she has sought to integrate her work with an interest in promoting human freedom and dignity around the world,” it says, explaining that she has worked as a senior policy advisor with Global Affairs Canada and represented Canada at the United Nations and the G7.

In an interview with the Calgary Herald last October, Ford acknowledged the intense scrutiny that she would be subject to as a candidate.

But “if good, normal, decent people don’t step forward then you are just ceding that ground to those who seek power for its own sake,” she said.

Not the first time

The Alberta Liberal Party, which currently holds the seat in the Calgary-Mountain View riding, issued a statement late Monday calling for Ford’s removal as a candidate.

“Caylan Ford’s comments are abhorrent. Her support of white supremacist values will sicken decent people across this province. These are not the values of Albertans. These are not the values of the people in Calgary-Mountain View. She is not fit to run as an MLA. UCP Leader Jason Kenney should remove her immediately as his candidate,” Liberal leader David Khan said in a press release.

This is not the first time the UCP has been linked to white nationalists and other xenophobic extremists.

Last fall, a Ricochet investigation exposed links between the far right and the UCP, including an individual named Adam Strashok, who ran the call centre for Kenney’s UCP leadership campaign. Strashok was expelled from the party, and Kenney vowed to screen new members for extreme views, stating, “I reject unequivocally the voices of hatred and bigotry.”

Ford resigns

Late Monday night Ford announced she was resigning as a candidate in order to “avoid becoming a distraction in this campaign.”

In a statement posted to her campaign Facebook page, she claimed the comments attributed to her by PressProgress are “distortions and are not reflective of my views.”

“In the aftermath of the recent massacre targeting the Muslim community in Christchurch, there is no room for equivocation: I strongly denounce extremism, violence, and stand with marginalized communities everywhere,” she said.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims welcomed the news and praised the UCP for taking action.

The Conservative party has been pushing the DND ...,"The Department of National Defence has declined to pay the legal bills for Vice Admiral Mark Norman in his ongoing court case.

But it’s a different story for other government officials, who will find that all their legal bills will be covered by the taxpayer.

The DND will be paying for lawyers for some of those who will be testifying for the Crown at Norman’s trial which is to start in August. Jody Thomas, the department’s deputy minister, has approved the applications to pay the legal fees for six department or Canadian Forces individuals. Sources say some of those are linked to the Norman case.

At the same time Robert Fife and Steve Chase of the Globe and Mail have reported that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and senior officials in his office have retained outside legal counsel in case of an RCMP investigation into allegations of political interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group.

Cameron Ahmad, Trudeau’s communications director, told the journalists that Treasury Board rules allow for outside lawyers to be hired at public expense. “As per the Treasury Board Policy on Legal Assistance and Indemnification, counsel has been retained to advise on the matter in question,” Ahmad confirmed to the Globe, which noted that the rules allow for hiring of outside counsel when government officials are either sued, threatened with a suit, charged with an offence or under threat of being named in a legal action.

But when Vice Admiral Norman applied for the same treatment under the exact same policy the DND turned him down.

The DND rejected Norman’s request for financial assistance in 2017 as it claimed the senior officer was guilty of disclosing confidential information. Government officials reached that stunning conclusion — contained in a Justice Department letter leaked to Postmedia — even though Norman had not been charged at the time and no formal internal investigation was carried out by the Canadian Forces or the DND.

Norman, once the second highest ranking officer in the Canadian military, was charged last year with one count of breach of trust.

Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Jon Vance suspended Norman from his job in January 2017 after the RCMP alleged he tipped off Davie Shipbuilding that the Liberal government was considering delaying a key navy program in which the Quebec firm would convert a commercial ship into a naval supply vessel. Details about the government’s decision were also leaked to journalists, and the resulting embarrassment, along with the financial penalties that would have been imposed, forced the Trudeau government to back down on its plans.

There have been suggestions that officials from the Privy Council Office or the Prime Minister’s Office may have been involved in the decision to decline Norman financial support under the Treasury Board policy. But the DND says that is not the case.

The decision was made by then DND Deputy Minister John Forster. “It was done following consultations with the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Legal Advisor (DND/CF LA), who reports to the Department of Justice,” the DND noted in a statement to Postmedia. “None of our records suggest that the Clerk of the Privy Council and/or PMO were involved or consulted in the decision making process.”

Forster will be appearing as a witness for the Crown when Norman’s trial begins in August.

The Justice Department is involved in the ongoing legal battle with Norman in that it is supposed to coordinating the release of federal government records to the court during the pre-trial hearing. The court has also heard that the Justice Department has offered legal advice to people who have had documents subpoenaed by Norman’s lawyers.

The Conservative party has been pushing the DND to cover Norman’s mounting legal costs as the case against the senior naval officer drags into its second year.

Conservative MP Leona Alleslev asked Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan at the Commons defence committee Feb. 28 about whether he would grant approval for Norman’s legal fees to be covered under the federal program. Sajjan refused to answer, claiming that Norman’s case was before the courts.

But Alleslev countered that her question about whether Norman’s legal bills would be covered had nothing to do with the officer’s criminal trial or the pre-trial hearings that have been underway.

Lawyers observing the case have told Postmedia they estimate the cost at this point for the prosecution to be between $10 million and $15 million.

Norman has two main lawyers but his legal costs are not known. Sources, however, say the significant delays in getting basic documents for his defence is pushing his family into bankruptcy.

A GoFundMe page has been set up by retired Canadian Army officer Lee Hammond to help finance Norman’s legal costs. Hammond had originally set his fundraising goal at $50,000 but has now increased that to $500,000 to cover the increasing legal costs.","Taxpayers cover cost of lawyers for Trudeau, others in SNC Lavalin affair but no help for Vice Adm.

OTTAWA – Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month’s byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection – made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart – ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

“The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,” Singh said. “I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?”

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh’s presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.","NDP’s Jagmeet Singh steps into the House of Commons, making history",Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/exporting-and-importing/ndps-jagmeet-singh-steps-into-the-house-of-commons-making-history-229172/

OTTAWA: The head of Canada’s federal bureaucracy said on Monday he was quitting over his role in handling a corporate corruption case, dealing another blow to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he battles the biggest political crisis of his tenure.

Polls suggest that Trudeau’s Liberals — who a few months ago looked certain to be re-elected in October — are now at risk of losing power to the official opposition Conservatives.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. avoided a corruption trial.

Top civil servant Michael Wernick told Trudeau he would be retiring in the coming weeks because opposition leaders had lost confidence in him over the scandal. Two high-profile women cabinet ministers and Trudeau’s closest personal aide had already quit over SNC-Lavalin before Monday’s resignation.

Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, is supposed to be non-partisan, like the rest of the federal bureaucracy. But his strong defense of government officials over the SNC-Lavalin affair and his insistence that no one had done anything wrong triggered widespread criticism from opposition legislators that he was siding with the Liberals.

“It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” said Wernick, who was appointed by Trudeau in early 2016.

Clerks have traditionally had an exceptionally close relationship with prime ministers, and the two tended to talk every day. Wernick’s departure leaves Trudeau needing to fill one of the top jobs in Ottawa just months ahead of the election.

Trudeau spokesman Matt Pascuzzo said the prime minister had not asked Wernick to go.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last month that Wernick had put intense pressure on her to help SNC-Lavalin avoid prosecution over allegations it bribed Libyan officials.

The scandal is the most serious faced by the 47-year-old Trudeau since he led the Liberals out of the political wilderness and into power in 2015 on a promise to do politics differently.

The Conservatives, the largest opposition party in parliament, and the left-leaning New Democrats accuse Trudeau of old-style backroom deals and trying to cover up what happened.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Wernick had resigned “in disgrace” and repeated his calls for a full public inquiry, an idea that Trudeau has already ruled out.

“This is like a five-alarm dumpster fire of political cronyism, incompetence and now obstruction. What is the prime minister so afraid of?” New Democrat legislator Charlie Angus said in the House of Commons.

Earlier this month, Trudeau denied he or his officials had interfered in the judicial system, and he offered no apology.

In a surprise move, Trudeau on Monday named Joyce Murray, a 64-year-old Liberal backbencher with no federal cabinet experience, as president of the Treasury Board, where she will be in overall charge of government spending.

Murray replaces Jane Philpott, who quit on March 4 in protest over how the government was handling the crisis.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted in January, resigned from Trudeau’s Cabinet the next month.

SNC-Lavalin is accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011. The firm had strongly lobbied in favor of a deferred prosecution agreement, or out-of-court settlement, instead of going to trial.

Philpott ... both inside and outside Canada. Trudeau and his officials allegedly ...,"OTTAWA — Treasury Board president Jane Philpott resigned Monday from the federal cabinet, saying she’s lost confidence in the way the Trudeau government has dealt with the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Her resignation came just less than a month after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet amid allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured her to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

“A minister must always be prepared to defend other ministers publicly, and must speak in support of the government and its policies,” Philpott said in a resignation letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “Given this convention and the current circumstances, it is untenable for me to continue to serve as a cabinet minister.”

Trudeau issued a terse statement accepting Philpott’s resignation and thanking her “for her years of service to Canadians and her dedication.” He named Carla Qualtrough, the minister of public services and procurement, as the acting president of the Treasury Board. He was expected to comment at more length at an event in Toronto on Monday evening.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Philpott’s resignation proves he was correct when he asserted last week that Trudeau has “lost the moral authority to govern.”

“Today, a senior member of his inner circle has come to the same conclusion,” said Scheer, repeating his call for Trudeau to resign and for the RCMP to investigate. “Jane Philpott’s resignation from cabinet clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos, led by a disgraced prime minister consumed with scandal and focused only on his political survival.”

Scheer called on other cabinet ministers to follow Philpott’s example or be seen to be part of the “ethical rot that infects this government.”

New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh reiterated his call for a public inquiry into the affair.

Like Wilson-Raybould, Philpott said she intends to remain a Liberal MP — for Markham-Stouffville outside Toronto, in her case. But unlike Wilson-Raybould, she did not say whether she intends to run for re-election as a Liberal this fall, although she has already been nominated. There has been some speculation in Liberal circles that Philpott might run for leader of the Ontario Liberal party.

Philpott’s resignation was not entirely unexpected among Liberals, who knew she and Wilson-Raybould are close friends. Indeed, when Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet, Philpott tweeted a picture of the pair with their arms around each other.

https://twitter.com/AndrewScheer/status/1102695003229442053

In a tweet praising Philpott’s “constant and unassailable commitment to always doing what is right and best for Canadians,” Wilson-Raybould told her friend: “You are a leader of vision & strength & I look forward to continuing to work alongside you.”

Wilson-Raybould last week delivered bombshell testimony at the House of Commons justice committee, accusing officials of relentlessly pressuring her and even issuing veiled threats to co-operate in helping SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal prosecution. The company is a pillar of Montreal’s business community and a major player in infrastructure projects both inside and outside Canada.

Trudeau and his officials allegedly leaned on Wilson-Raybould to reverse a decision by the director of public prosecutions to proceed with a criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya. Instead, they wanted her to order negotiation of a remediation agreement with the company that would have levied stiff financial penalties but removed the prospect of a criminal conviction that could cripple the company financially and hurt innocent employees, pensioners and suppliers.

Remediation agreements are lawful tools in dealing with corporate corruption. As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould would have been legally entitled to instruct the director of public prosecutions on how to deal with SNC-Lavalin. The controversy hinges on how hard it was acceptable for Trudeau to push her to do so.

While Wilson-Raybould called the pressure tactics inappropriate, she said she did not think they were illegal — a distinction Philpott did not make.

“Unfortunately, the evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former attorney general to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin, and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me,” Philpott wrote.

“The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system. It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our attorney general should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases. Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.”

The next round of testimony on the affair is to come Wednesday. Trudeau’s longtime friend and former principal secretary Gerald Butts, whom Wilson-Raybould tagged as one of the sources of pressure on her, is scheduled to appear before the justice committee at 10 a.m. ET.

The same afternoon, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick and deputy minister of justice Nathalie Drouin are to appear. Both testified earlier at the committee but that was before Wilson-Raybould fingered Wernick as the person who allegedly issued veiled threats and suggested Drouin was a witness to some of the pressure tactics.

New Democrat MP Charlie Angus wrote to Trudeau on Monday, arguing that Wernick’s impartiality as the country’s top public servant had been irreparably compromised and demanding his resignation.

Philpott has been widely seen as one of Trudeau’s most capable ministers. As minister of health, she worked with Wilson-Raybould in legalizing medical assistance in dying. As minister of Indigenous services, she oversaw drastic reductions in the number of long-term advisories on water safety on First Nations reserves.

She was moved to Treasury Board in mid-January in the same shuffle that saw Wilson-Raybould moved out of the justice portfolio into veterans affairs. Treasury Board is a less-visible ministry concerned with the nuts and bolts of government operations but the president effectively holds the government’s purse strings, overseeing all federal spending. Philpott took over the post from Scott Brison, who retired from politics.

Jane Philpott’s resignation from cabinet clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos Andrew Scheer

In Victoria, Border Security Minister Bill Blair said he is “very saddened” by Philpott’s resignation.

“Jane Philpott has done an outstanding job in all of her portfolios and served Canadians exceptionally well,” he said, adding that he’s pleased she intends to remain in the Liberal caucus.

Whether she will is not certain. Trudeau has been pondering whether Wilson-Raybould can stay in caucus and run as a Liberal candidate in this fall’s federal election — a matter on which he said earlier Monday he’s still reflecting. He will now presumably have to add Philpott to his ruminations.

Blair refused to speculate when asked if he thinks more ministers might yet resign. But he reiterated his own support for Trudeau and the government he leads.

“I have great confidence in the team and the leadership of the prime minister.”

But Liberal backbencher Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who announced last week she won’t seek re-election, tweeted her support for Philpott, as she has done repeatedly for Wilson-Raybould since the SNC-Lavalin controversy erupted a month ago.

“When you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised. Thank you @janephilpott for articulating this beautifully,” Caesar-Chavannes wrote.

New Brunswick Liberal MP Wayne Long reiterated his call for a “full and transparent investigation” into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Below is the full text of Philpott’s letter to Trudeau, as she posted it online:

Dear Prime Minister,

It is an enormous privilege to be the Member of Parliament for Markham-Stouffville and to have served as Minister of Health, then Minister of Indigenous Services, then President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government. It has been an honour to play a leading role in progress that has shaped our country: bringing Syrian refugees to Canada; legislating a balanced approach to Medical Assistance in Dying; negotiating a health accord with new resources for mental health and home care; improving infrastructure for First Nations to provide clean water on reserve; and reforming child welfare to reduce the over-apprehension of Indigenous children.

However, I have been considering the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks and after serious reflection, I have concluded that I must resign as a member of Cabinet.

It grieves me to resign from a portfolio where I was at work to deliver an important mandate. I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them. pic.twitter.com/EwO5dtdgG6 — Jane Philpott (@janephilpott) March 4, 2019

In Canada, the constitutional convention of Cabinet solidarity means, among other things, that ministers are expected to defend all Cabinet decisions. A minister must always be prepared to defend other ministers publicly, and must speak in support of the government and its policies. Given this convention and the current circumstances, it is untenable for me to continue to serve as a Cabinet minister.

Unfortunately, the evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former Attorney General to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin, and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me. Those concerns have been augmented by the views expressed by my constituents and other Canadians.

The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system. It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our Attorney General should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases. Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.

It grieves me to leave a portfolio where I was at work to deliver on an important mandate. But I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.

Although I must regretfully resign from Cabinet, I will continue to serve Canadians in every other way that I can. I was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Markham-Stouffville and I intend to continue in that role. I am firmly committed to our crucial platform priorities, especially: justice for Indigenous peoples; and implementing a plan to tackle the existential threat of climate change. Canadians need the assurance that, in all matters, Members of Parliament will act in the best interests of the public. My decision has been made with that spirit and intent.

Sincerely,

The Honourable Jane Philpott MD PC MP","Jane Philpott resigns from Trudeau's cabinet, says she has 'lost confidence' in handling of SNC-Lavalin affair",Windsor Star,https://windsorstar.com/news/politics/jane-philpott-resigns-from-cabinet/wcm/0ef38413-c32e-44ee-b518-a72666df1c4b

He kept detailed diaries about his sex life which were seized when ...,"Margaret Thatcher personally supported one of her MPs who had an alleged “penchant for small boys”, MI5 files disclosed to a public inquiry reveal.

An MI5 lawyer told the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) it was “a matter of regret” that the service considered only the national security implications of allegations of possible child abuse by Peter Morrison, Conservative MP for Chester, and did not pass information to the police.

The witness, who gave evidence anonymously, admitted that memos and a letter from 1986 had discussed claims that Morrison had a “penchant for small boys”.

They added there was nothing to indicate MI5 passed the information in its possession to police.

The inquiry heard that two 1986 memos were written by Eliza Manningham-Buller, who went on to be the director general of MI5 between 2002 and 2007.

Former Liberal leader David Steel admitted he nominated depraved Cyril Smith for a ­knighthood eight years after he confessed to ­sexually abusing children.

The peer said under oath on Wednesday that he had asked Smith in 1979 about claims he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel in the 1960s, while a Labour councillor.

While Steel did not dispute Smith had confessed to abusing boys in the 1960s, he said he did not believe he was still offending when they spoke.

He told the IICSA that he came away from the conversation with Smith “assuming” he had committed the offences because he did not deny them.

Lord Steel said, “He accepted the story was correct. Obviously I disapproved but as far as I was concerned it was past history.”

In 1988, Lord Steel nominated Smith for a knighthood, something he has since said he was “perfectly happy” to do. But giving evidence, he denied “hiding his head in the sand” over the abuse.

In a June 2018 appearance on BBC’s Newsnight programme, Steel described child sex abuse allegations against Smith as ‘tittle-tattle’ and ‘scurrilous hearsay’.

The inquiry was also told about MI5’s investigation into Peter Hayman.

Hayman was high up in MI6. He became high commissioner to Canada and was knighted in Britain.

He kept detailed diaries about his sex life which were seized when his London flat was raided. The director of public prosecutions later granted MI5 access to them.

The security service subsequently interviewed Hayman. The DPP, Hayman told MI5, had given him immunity from prosecution.

Essex cops are guilty of failing victims of abuse

Two police officers who scuppered child abuse investigations have been found guilty of misconduct in a public office.

Essex Police detective constable Lee Pollard was convicted of two counts while his partner detective constable Sharon Patterson was found guilty of one count.

Patterson was found not guilty of one count and the Old Bailey jury was unable to reach verdicts in a further charge against each.

They will be sentenced on 3 May. Thirty officers, some now retired, were investigated and 296 Essex child abuse cases looked at, of which 55 were referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

The defendants were the only ones to face criminal charges, but a third officer was sacked last year.

Five officers resigned or retired when the investigation began and two officers who were found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct left the force before action was taken against them.

Baby formula firms doing deals with NHS

A third of NHS health boards have broken guidelines by accepting payments or sponsorship from baby formula companies.

The marketing of infant formula is regulated to try to halt falling rates of breastfeeding.

Companies are not allowed to advertise or promote formula designed for infants under the age of six months.

The World Health Organisation code of practice says no medical organisation or doctor should accept payments from formula firms.

But 59 out of 195 clinical commissioning groups in England have recorded at least one breach of the WHO code since 2014, an investigation by Channel4’s Dispatches showed.

In Wales, five out of the seven local health boards recorded a breach.

Companies use their specialised formulas such as products for children with allergies to create links with doctors for their normal baby formula products.

So after not having marched from Sunderland, instead of champagne in Mayfair, Farage and Co will hold a rally in Parliament Square. “I’m afraid it will be pinot,” his henchman, Andy Wigmore opined. “Party In Name Only.”

Sick doctor struck off

A gynaecologist has been suspended for three months after jokingly referring to patients as “fallen women” while carrying out terminations at an abortion clinic.

Dr Tim Moriarty worked in Northampton and Milton Keynes.

He left one patient in distress by telling her “not all women are put on this earth to have babies” as she was awaiting a procedure.

Moriarty—who had previously been warned twice about his inappropriate language—added, “Just because Isis try to bomb us back to the dark ages, it doesn’t change anything.

“It’s a woman’s choice and don’t feel guilty.”

He introduced himself to a new recruit, saying, ‘’Hi, I’m Dr Moriarty and I am tasked with looking after all the fallen women.”",Spooks reveal a little of what they knew about VIP abuse,Socialist Worker,https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/48048/Spooks+reveal+a+little+of+what+they+knew+about+VIP+abuse

He added that their previously strained relationship has improved.

""Our relationship was pretty testy, obviously for a while ... Brian and I have buried the hatchet. We see eye to eye on a lot,"" Fildbebrandt said.

News that Jean is giving the party advice came a day after a Calgary city councillor said the former Wildrose leader would be stepping back into politics in time for the spring election.

Jean has sidestepped those rumours.

Fildebrandt was asked Friday how it would be for him to give the leadership of the party he founded to someone else.

A social media frenzy followed, with plenty of speculation over whether or not Jean's hypothetical return could split the conservative vote just one year after two parties united in an attempt to prevent that very outcome.

Premier Rachel Notley has not yet set a date for the election, but Alberta law states it must be held between March 1 and May 31.

Voters will be asked to cast their ballots at a time of controversial government intervention in Alberta’s oil market that has drawn support from some major producers and fierce criticism from others.

The NDP stunned many political commentators when it swept to power in Alberta in 2015 in the midst of the global oil price crash, ending 44 years of conservative rule in the province.

Since then Notley’s government has grappled with shrinking capital investment in the province’s energy sector and persistent budget deficits, and is focused on convincing voters an economic recovery is underway.

“We remain on track to balance the budget by 2023, with the best balance sheet in the country. We are doing this without making reckless cuts to the services all Albertans rely on,” the government said in a speech to the legislature delivered by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Lois Mitchell.

Effective Jan. 1, the Alberta government mandated oil production cuts to help relieve congestion on export pipelines that last year led to a glut of crude building up in storage and the price of Canadian barrels plummeting to record lows.

The move threw a lifeline to oil producers selling their barrels at a loss but has been harshly criticized by integrated companies with refining operations like Suncor Energy and Husky Energy that were benefiting from cheap crude.

On Friday Imperial Oil delayed a C$2.6 billion oil sands project in northern Alberta and laid the blame squarely on the uncertainty generated by government intervention in the market.

The provincial government also plans to lease 4,400 rail cars to transport crude while waiting for long-delayed export pipelines to be built, even though stronger oil prices as a result of curtailments mean rail transportation is no longer economic.

Opposition leader Jason Kenney has promised to rip up those rail contracts if the UCP wins the election, adding to uncertainty in the oil industry.

Notley said her government will continue to manage curtailments and the differential between Canadian and U.S. crude slowly and carefully.

“This is not the long-term solution...Long-term we need more pipelines and more value added in Alberta,” she told a news conference.",Canada's Alberta kicks off final legislature session before election,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKCN1QZ2KG-OCABS

""If you didn’t know ...","As the world reels from an attack on two New Zealand mosques that killed 49 people, politicians in Canada are grappling with how best to handle a political landscape that one pollster says is seeing rising concerns of radical white nationalism.

In an interview with CTV Question Period host Evan Solomon, airing Sunday, Angus Reid Institute’s Shachi Kurl said Canadians are both increasingly concerned about the Islamic religion’s role in Canadian society and increasingly awake to a potential threat of white nationalist radicalization.

""On one hand we're still seeing a lot of suspicion towards the Muslim community, at the same time we’re seeing a rise of radical white nationalism that people are growing increasingly alive to,"" Kurl told Solomon.

""It’s starting to become a part of the Canadian political landscape.""

Politicians, meanwhile, are at odds in terms of how best to react to this changing political scene.

Following the mass shooting in New Zealand, political reaction steadily poured in. All party leaders – except for People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier – expressed their condolences at the news and condemned the attack.

However, it didn’t take long before politicians began weighing in on how best to engage with those spreading the kind of hate that Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen told CTV News ""feed[s] into a narrative"" that leads to the kind of violence seen in New Zealand on Friday.

One individual who ended up in the hot seat was Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who both NDP MP Tracey Ramsey and Liberal MP Jennifer O'Connell slammed for attending a pro-pipeline rally that was also attended by Faith Goldy. Goldy is a public figure known for espousing white nationalist views.

""We have a responsibility and we should be calling it out,"" said Ramsey. ""The Conservative Party of Canada needs to call it out, and they need to end any platform for this type of hate in our country.""

O'Connell echoed the concern.

""If you didn’t know that Faith Goldy was at this rally, then you should stand up and condemn it. Andrew Scheer should be a leader,"" she said.

However, Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre took issue with the characterization of the event. He said the event that both Goldy and Scheer attended was a rally in favour of pipelines. He also warned that if politicians suddenly become responsible for the views of every person who attends the same event they're attending, it would require a ""very different approach.""

""We always call out racism, we always oppose any form of hatred, and we absolutely condemn this terrorist attack and the hatred that motivated it,"" he said.

He accused Ramsey and O'Connell of attempting to score political points in raising the Goldy issue.

""It is not about political points to talk about the fact that there is a dialogue of hate,"" O'Connell said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also weighed in on the issue. Like the others, he echoed the importance of condemning and stemming the growth of hate.

""We know that hate is like a fire. Once allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everyone. So we all have a responsibility,"" Singh said.

Singh also pitched a slightly different approach for tackling the spread of hate. He said ""economic insecurity"" is at the heart of growing fear and hatred. The NDP leader suggested tackling that insecurity in order to stop the spread of hatred.

""The fear comes from a lack of hope for the future, and we can do so much better to help people out who are feeling fear,"" Singh said.",Politicians grapple with tackling the spread of hate following N.Z. mosque shootings,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/politicians-grapple-with-tackling-the-spread-of-hate-following-n-z-mosque-shootings-1.4338827

“The stars are aligning in ways that as leader of the Green Party I don’t think I thought I’d ever see with the vote on the right-hand side of the (political) spectrum split with a break-away conservative party under Maxime Bernier, the Peoples’ Party,” said Elizabeth May (MP, Saanich-Gulf Islands), in Winnipeg for a town hall at the Park Theatre on Osborne on Saturday for the 19th stop on her cross-country Community Matters Tour. “We don’t know how well they will do but they will shave votes away from the Conservatives in enough ridings across Canada that the Conservatives won’t have a chance at a majority under Andrew Scheer. I don’t think the Liberals will have a chance for a majority because there’s clearly a bit of tarnish on (Justin Trudeau’s) glow.”

A minority Parliament would open up possibilities for the Greens if they can pick up seats and be in the position to hold what May likes to refer to as a ‘balance of responsibility’ as opposed to a balance of power to supporting the governing party if it stays turn to Green principles.

“Six parties means that it’s very likely that there will be a minority Parliament where we will have to cooperate and that is something we’ve always sought as Greens because we believe in cooperation,” she said, likening it to the mid-1960’s when a minority Liberal government under Lester B. Pearson worked with Tommy Douglas and the NDP and the result was universal health plan, Canada Pension Plan, unemployment insurance and other policies that Canadians now hold dear.

“My only real fear is that young voters who voted for the first time because they believed Justin Trudeau’s promises,” said May. “If they’re very disillusioned, they may feel cynical and that would be a shame. So we have to encourage people to vote no matter what.”

May said she is willing to work with any of the other parties to advance the Green Party agenda. It would be similar to the situation in British Columbia where the provincial Greens have a confidence and supply agreement to support the governing NDP.

“Maybe someone should ask Justin Trudeau if he’s willing to support a Green government,” added May, only half-joking.

In addition to her Winnipeg stop, May held events in Brandon and Portage la Prairie over the last two days. One of her events at Brandon University had to be moved to a bigger venue to accommodate the audience. Despite the party holding only one seat in Parliament and polling less than 4% nationally in the last federal election, May is encouraged by recent events including a strong showing in the federal byelection in Quebec where they polled at 13%.

“Everything I’ve seen in Manitoba is further encouraging me to think that anything could happen in the next election,” said May, who singled out several Manitoba Green candidates at Saturday’s town hall.

Scheer’s office did not respond to an initial query about the statement’s not mentioning Muslims but ...","OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer issued two statements on the terrorist attacks in New Zealand on Friday — the second after being criticized for not mentioning in the first that the attack was against Muslims at mosques during their Friday prayers.

Two Conservative MPs have also cancelled an event on Monday with a British parliamentarian who has been accused of promoting anti-Islamic sentiments “out of respect” for Muslims reeling from the attacks that killed 49 people.

Scheer posted to Twitter and Facebook late Thursday evening in Canada as news of the attacks was reported, saying “freedom has come under attack” and mentioning “peaceful worshippers” and a “despicable act of evil.”

“All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear,” he wrote.

But the statement was condemned quickly online for failing to specify that the attack was on Muslims, during prayers at mosques. Some pointed to the fact he did name Coptic Christians and call out anti-Semitism in previous tweets when killers attacked Egyptian churches in 2017 and a synagogue in Pittsburgh last fall.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims criticized the omission in a statement Friday afternoon.

“While some of our elected leaders sadly choose not to mention ‘Muslim’ or ‘mosque’ while denouncing the Christchurch attacks, the reality is that these horrific shootings and the Quebec City mosque attack on Jan. 29, 2017, have left Canadian Muslim communities — and indeed, Muslims around the world — feeling very vulnerable and unsafe,” wrote the Council’s executive director Ihsaan Gardee. “It is therefore essential that our elected leaders speak out clearly and unequivocally against such attacks and name them for the Islamophobic terrorist attacks that they are.”

The statement does not mention Scheer by name but at that point, he was the only Canadian political leader whose public response to the attacks did not mention either Muslims or mosques.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s statement condemned the attacks as terrorism and said everyone must work to “confront Islamophobia.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that “Islamophobia kills.”

Green Leader Elizabeth May did not mention Muslims in her first Tweet but retweeted several others who did.

Former Conservative Maxime Bernier, now the leader of the People’s Party of Canada, hadn’t posted anything about the attacks at all by late Friday.

Scheer’s office did not respond to an initial query about the statement’s not mentioning Muslims but after being asked about the statement from the National Council of Canadian Muslims, his spokesman responded with a link to a new statement on Scheer’s Facebook page.

“As Canadians are learning the horrific details of last night’s terror attack at two New Zealand mosques, I wish to express both my deep sadness at the tragic loss of innocent life and my profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community,” it said.

It said Conservatives stand with Muslims around the world to “reaffirm our commitment to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together.”

A month ago, Scheer was criticized for sharing a stage on Parliament Hill with a cross-Canada truck convoy mostly protesting Liberal inaction on the energy industry but which included some people promoting hatred. Scheer said he was only there to support the energy workers, not the “other elements that tried to associate themselves with the event.”

Those “elements” were people affiliated with the Canadian Yellow Vest movement, whose Facebook page included some comments celebrating the New Zealand attacks Friday.

Meanwhile, Conservative MP Garnett Genuis tweeted Friday that Monday’s reception with Baroness Caroline Cox, a member of the British House of Lords, has been cancelled.

Genuis, an Edmonton-area MP, and fellow Conservative MP Kelly Block of Saskatchewan were to co-host the reception with Cox, who has shown support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and has said she believes Muslims are trying to destroy Western democracies with Shariah law.

Toronto Liberal MP Judy Sgro pulled out of the event after she found out about Cox’s participation. Genuis initially rejected calls to follow suit, calling it a talk on human rights, and accused Sgro on social media of retreating only after she remembered this is an election year.

He said in a statement Friday that Cox’s views are subject of “some debate, and perhaps some confusion.”

The increases mean that by June, oil companies will be limited to 3.71 million bpd of production.

Alberta mandated production cuts this year to ease congestion on export pipelines that resulted in crude getting bottlenecked in storage and the discount on Canadian heavy crude widening to record levels.

“This temporary policy has been critical to reducing the oil price differential while we move ahead with our medium-term plan to ship more oil by rail and lead the long-term charge for new pipelines as we fight to get full value for the resources owned by all Albertans,” Premier Rachel Notley said in a statement.

The government said the increase in production limits comes as warmer weather reduces the amount of diluent needed to help oil sands bitumen flow through pipelines, increasing capacity.

Diluent is any ultra-light hydrocarbon mixed with viscous bitumen to enable it to flow.

The government said giving production limits two months in advance gives the energy industry and markets greater certainty when making decisions.

Some producers like MEG Energy (MEG.TO) supported curtailments because the move boosted prices, but it was criticized by integrated producers including Suncor Energy (SU.TO) and Imperial Oil (IMO.TO) whose refining operations were benefiting from cheap crude.

Critics also blasted the government for making crude by rail shipments uneconomic and adding to volatility in the Canadian crude market.

On Friday, Imperial canceled a $2.6 billion oil sands project in northern Alberta, blaming the uncertainty caused by government intervention in the market.

Alberta is leasing 4,400 rail cars to ship 120,000 bpd of crude out of the province and ease pipeline congestion, with the first shipments due to begin in July.

The latest production limit increase comes the same day Alberta opened its final legislature session before a provincial election that polls suggest will see Notley’s left-leaning government cede power to the United Conservative Party.",Canada's Alberta increases crude output limit for May and June,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKCN1R005P-OCABS
86,Politics,2019-03-19T05:48:00.0000000Z,"Three years of Trump, and voter affirmation of the right wing in the Prairies, Ontario and Quebec is ruining Canada. You’d hope the Alberta NDP would be a light shining out of this mess, but no, it’s a thinly-disguised Conservative party anyway ...","Based on what we’ve learned in the past 24 hours, it’s hard to dispute Premier Rachel Notley’s blunt assessment at her nomination meeting in the Edmonton-Strathcona riding yesterday that Opposition Leader Jason Kenney has been coolly lying about the role of his 2017 leadership campaign in the so-called “Kamikaze Mission” to sink his rival to lead the opposition United Conservative Party.

Accusing Mr. Kenney of “a profound absence of integrity,” Premier Notley told more than 1,000 cheering supporters in Old Strathcona’s St. Basil’s Cultural Centre that leaked United Conservative Party documents reported by journalists over the weekend showed Mr. Kenney’s “denials were calm, cool, confident lies. Outright lies.”

“Mr. Kenney owes Albertans a full accounting, not just empty denials,” she stated.

Soon after she accepted the nomination by her son Ethan and addressed the packed meeting, Ms. Notley told reporters “the evidence that has come out and the memos that have come out make it pretty clear that on Friday, when Mr. Kenney … responded very calmly and coolly and confidently to those questions, that he was lying. He was absolutely lying.”

And so, inevitably, the ballot question for many Albertans in the election Ms. Notley will call soon will be, “Can Jason Kenney be trusted?”

Or, perhaps, to spin the same question another way,“What else can he not be trusted about.”

If this is so, it is not the question the UCP’s strategists would have wanted Albertans to be asking themselves.

The documents first reported by the CBC and now in the hands of other news organizations show Mr. Kenney’s victorious 2017 UCP leadership campaign and that of Jeff Callaway, the alleged Kamikaze Candidate, were effectively joined at the hip. The CBC reported that the Kenney crew gave the Callaway camp strategic direction, talking points, speech drafts, videos, and advertisements, “all aimed at undermining Kenney’s main political rival, Brian Jean.”

In her spirited remarks – a campaign speech in all but timing – Premier Notley sharply contrasted her NDP Government’s platform with promises made by Mr. Kenney.

“This election is about who is going to be premier,” she said. “It’s about the kind of province that we leave to our kids. And I say to all of you, that the choice could not be more stark.

“Mr. Kenney believes we are in a race to the bottom. The lowest corporate taxes, the worst environmental regulations, underfunded and overstressed public services, low wages, stressed out families desperately trying to make ends meet. Angry and divisive politics. Two Albertas.

“I believe that we are in a race to the top. I believe that good public schools give our kids the best start in life. I believe that good public health care is the foundation of a decent society. I believe that we can do the hard work of diversification to build an economy that works for everyone. And I believe Alberta is stronger when we stick together and take care of each other.

“Alberta is for all of us. One Alberta. Not just for the few, but for all of us. And, friends, I believe that Alberta’s best days are absolutely ahead, and that the politics of love, and hope, and optimism always trump the politics of anger, division and fear.”

On Mr. Kenney’s plan to cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy, she said: “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.”

On his vow to cut minimum wages for young people: “All work has dignity no matter who does it. There are no second class citizens in Alberta.”

She poked fun at Mr. Kenney’s recent suggestion that male candidates “understand tactical politics a little bit better than women.” She has “an unladylike flair for tactical politics,” she observed, to laughter.

And she mocked the UCP’s vociferous recent demands that she call an election as soon as possible. “We’re getting clearer and clearer insight into why it was that the UCP was so hysterically calling for the writ to be dropped,” she told the reporters after her speech.

Either way, she said, the timing of the election will not be based on the strategic needs of the UCP. “If our election timing was driven by the calendar of investigation into Conservative criminal wrongdoing, then we would never have a campaign.”

Ms. Notley got some support yesterday from an unexpected quarter when former Kenney ally Derek Fildebrandt, a man once touted as the conservative most likely to play the role of the Kamikaze Candidate and now leader of the libertarian Freedom Conservative Party, told the CBC, “not everyone that brings forward an allegation is necessarily credible or telling the truth, but these are now backed up by hard evidence.”

“The documents released last night show clearly that it is not the whistle-blowers that have lied, but Jason Kenney,” he stated.

The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in ...,"OTTAWA—For his first question in the House of Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh asked the prime minister whether he was going to make housing more affordable for Canadians. This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto. Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is recognized in the House of Commons before taking his place before question period on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. The prime minister and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh, Chantal Hébert writes. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair. With the resignation of clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick — one of the main protagonists in the controversy — announced just minutes before question period, the focus promptly returned to the topic that has consumed Canadian politics for the past five weeks. Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation. But he may have to wait a few more months — until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign — for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

Tuesday’s budget — the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office — marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future. In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Article Continued Below

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda. One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more. But the SNC-Lavalin affair — and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction — has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic. As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue. Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh. The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives. It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage. Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000. On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals. Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner. Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago. Like Clark who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks. In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of NDP MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at 9 per cent, two points ahead of the NDP. The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall. As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

Half of Canadians are in favour of an overhaul ...","Metro Vancouver, especially Richmond, is considered as Canada’s epicentre for a booming and unregulated birth tourism industry – many foreign individuals come here for the sole purpose of giving birth to a Canadian baby.

A recent survey conducted by the Angus Reid Institute, a Canadian non-profit independent research organization, showed that most Canadians (60 per cent) think the country’s birthright laws, which stipulate that anyone born in Canada is a citizen, must change.

article continues below

Among the respondents, 64 per cent believe children born to parents who are here on tourist visas should not be granted Canadian citizenship and 24 per cent said they should.

Meanwhile, 55 per cent of respondents said the citizenship should be given to a child if both of the parents are in Canada on work visas, and 40 per cent said kids from parents on student visas should be granted the citizenship.

When asked about the policy overall, 40 per cent said birthright is a good policy and 33 per cent said it is a bad one.

Opinions were also split on how serious this problem is, while 55 per cent said it is a very or quite serious issue and 44 per cent said it is not serious.

“Opponents of changing birthright citizenship rules say doing so is unnecessary because 'birth tourism' – while a phenomenon in some Canadian cities – particularly Richmond in B.C. – is not a serious enough problem nationwide to justify changing Canada’s citizenship rules,” stated the report.

The report added that how concerned people are about birth tourism appears to depend ""heavily"" on their age and political affiliation.

“Generationally, it is older Canadians (over 55 years old) who consider the issue more serious, while those under the age of 55 are evenly divided,” it stated.

""Similarly, two-thirds of Liberal- and NDP-inclined Canadians say that this is not a serious issue, while those considering the CPC (Conservative Party) say it is serious by a ratio of three-to-one.""

Half of Canadians are in favour of an overhaul of the whole system, whereas 28 per cent wanted only specific changes made to birth tourism policies.

A petition hosted by Richmond residents calling for the federal government to end birth tourism collected 11,000 across Canada and was presented in Parliament by Richmond MP Joe Peschisolido last October.

Birthright citizenship has also been a contentious issue in some other countries. The French changed their citizenship laws in 1993 to eliminate birthright citizenship, while Ireland followed suit in 2005 and more recently New Zealand and Australia. In these countries at least one parent must be a citizen for their child to automatically be a citizen.

His books include The Quickening Maze, a finalist for the Booker Prize, and Dream Sequence, which will be published next month.

When the news was finally confirmed, the faces on the screen were exhausted, grey and hesitant. I was already living in Canada and so watched through the evening relatively untired as the presenters and commentators struggled into the early hours of the British morning to explain the now irrevocable fact that the country had voted by a narrow margin to leave the European Union. Nearly three years later, everyone who has followed the fallout day by chaotic day and has laboured to understand what form Brexit might actually take and when and how it will be delivered feels that exhaustion.

No one has been so visibly fatigued and broken down as the Prime Minister, Theresa May, this past Tuesday in the House of Commons. Pale and puffy-eyed, though with the familiar hard, narrow stare that might be withering if she retained any authority, she was sick with a sore throat and barely able to speak in response as her proposed Withdrawal Agreement was defeated by the fourth-largest margin in British parliamentary history. The first time it was voted on, in January, it was defeated by the largest margin ever in British parliamentary history. In normal times, a vote of no confidence would now be passed, triggering a general election, or the Tory party would depose Ms. May. But these are far from normal times. A vote of no confidence would fail because the Conservatives really don’t want an election and quite amazingly, nobody in her party, usually typified by a culture of ruthless self-advancement, wants the job of prime minister. Currently, it seems to offer only the prospect of impotence amid the endless strife of Brexit.

Before Thursday’s vote to extend Article 50, Britain was due to crash out of the EU on March 29 and faced the very real possibility of shortages of foods and medicines. Now, it awaits the decision of the 27 EU member states on whether to grant this request for Britain to keep the impasse as it is and struggle for a solution a while longer. British politics has broken down. Its broad coalitions have splintered. The only majorities that exist are against various proposals, not for any single plausible course of action. In the wider public, those strongly for either Leave or Remain are equally incensed, suspecting imminent betrayal. Those for whom this is all an ugly wash of noise in the background of their lives don’t know why it isn’t over yet and are more disenchanted with politicians than ever. Over recent months, they may well have had the same experience I have of turning on the TV or radio to see journalists unable to answer news anchors’ questions because they have no idea at all what is likely to happen next.

It is easier to say what has happened. In the past few years, I have watched my homeland lose its mind. I’ve watched the grinding collision of the referendum’s direct democracy with a parliamentary system. I’ve watched politicians lie and obfuscate, to themselves and everybody else. I’ve watched anger infect the population and spiking reports of insults and attacks on foreigners and immigrants. I’ve watched Britain lay waste most thoroughly to its reputation for reason and pragmatism. I’ve watched the country convince itself it has no other choice but this prolonged self-harm. Turmoil and paralysis have combined in a most remarkable way, daily convulsions while nothing changes. This state will end soon – time really is running out to come up with a plan or call the whole thing off – but for now, I can look around at the wreckage and simply marvel.

I hadn’t seen it coming – pretty much no one had – but its causes are easy enough to identify. For years, into an increasingly unequal society, a right-wing media, owned mostly by billionaires who are either foreign or keep their money offshore, had poured out outrageous and fact-free stories of European Union interference in British affairs and had stoked anti-immigrant feeling. The accession of Eastern European states into the EU, giving their citizens the right to work and settle anywhere in the union, did produce some very rapid demographic changes in parts of Britain, particularly those suffering from the weak economy and brutal cuts in public services. Polish shops sprang up on their high streets. A disconcerting unfamiliarity had arrived and the media encouraged their British readers to misidentify the causes of their suffering with their new European neighbours. This all existed in a feedback loop of rhetorical escalation with the so-called Euroskeptic wing of the Conservative Party that has long campaigned against further integration of Britain into the European Union and against the result of the first referendum on Britain’s membership in 1975. They have caused serious problems to several Conservative prime ministers. David Cameron, to buy them off, promised a referendum in his manifesto for an election he possibly didn’t think he would win. More likely, he blithely assumed the referendum would be won by reasonableness and Remain, much as people assumed Hillary Clinton’s victory over Donald Trump.

But, like the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the referendum pitted grievance and simplicity against the status quo and complexity. It too was riddled with bad faith, deception, anti-immigrant rhetoric, baseless and manipulative Facebook stories, criminal campaign-finance violations and covert Russian involvement. Indeed, there are some shared personnel between Mr. Trump’s world and the Brexiteers, an affinity of wealthy individuals pretending to be men of the people, with Steve Bannon, Nigel Farage and others shuttling back and forth across the Atlantic. Of course, many people voted to leave in good faith and independent of the campaign’s false prospectus. One of the ways the argument has become toxic subsequently is the insistence of some Remainers that Leavers were all dupes and patsies. That said, I’ve yet to encounter a Leave voter who doesn’t hold a naive and unrealistic vision of national sovereignty in our complicatedly globalized world or who has a realistic plan for Britain’s future trading relationships. Amazingly, Euroskeptic politicians who have spent years obsessing over the subject have come up with no version of Brexit that is both likely to be agreed by the EU and that they can agree on.

There are a number of reasons for the immediate dissipation of visions of Brexit on contact with the blustery air of practical politics. In part, the movement was never truly serious. It was a line of rhetoric, a weapon in a culture war. Its supporters never expected to win. Now that they have, they oppose the versions of Brexit on offer and continue to brandish their image of Britain as it used to be (though never was) and ought to be again. It is perhaps inevitable that British anti-EU feeling is refracted through false memories of the British Empire. Freed from the pesky bureaucratic interference of Brussels, the argument goes, Britain will again bestride the world stage as a great trading country, doing its own deals, particularly with the grateful members of the Commonwealth. What this nonsense overlooks is that imperial Britain never was a great trading country. It was an empire, a network of resource extraction and economic dependence enforced by violence. Britain didn’t overtake India as the great textile-producing country of the 19th century with innovation and the wild self-belief of the Brexiter. It expropriated India’s raw materials, brought them to the cotton mills of the North of England and destroyed India’s weaving industry, literally breaking the hands of Bengali weavers so that they could not compete.

No, the international Britain the Brexiters remember is a nostalgic false memory, a hazy image of the 1950s before significant immigration and while the country enjoyed the afterglow of victory in the Second World War. At least those who voted for Brexit enjoyed that period: They were mostly children at the time, too young to have fought themselves. The Leave vote skewed heavily to the elderly, beneficiaries of the postwar economic order built in part on EU membership. Younger people, with futures to worry about, voted Remain. Even as the fragmentation of the country and its stagnation becomes pathological, I can almost feel grateful for the unsparing way in which Brexit has exposed Britain’s divisions – between the young and the old, the English and the Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish, the wealthy south and the postindustrial north, the university-educated and the educationally deprived. Brexit has always been the wrong answer to the right questions: How can prosperity be shared? How can the political class regain the trust of the electorate? Answers will have to be found.

After the initial vote in 2016, I had friends express their envy that I was now living in Canada. Canadians are, I think, used to hearing liberal Americans threatening to try and move north when the Republicans come to power. This was the first time I’d heard the same fantasy from British people. I’m now a permanent resident here and very happy to be one, but I can’t say that it mitigates my pain and frustration at the situation in Britain. It does, however, sharpen my appreciation for the improved version of Britain that Canada is at is best: liberal, rational, welcoming to immigrants, committed to well-resourced public services and equality of opportunity. Brexit can stand as a warning. Canada, like every democracy, should be vigilant against populist rhetoric offering simple solutions to complex problems, historical amnesia and subversions of the electoral process. A sane political order, a temperate public discourse, even in the mother of all democracies, turns out to be much more fragile than I had thought.",I’m watching my country lose its mind because of Brexit,The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-im-watching-my-country-lose-its-mind-because-of-brexit/

Bill C-85 to amend the Canada-Israel free trade agreement; Bill S-6 to implement a tax convention between Canada and Madagascar; Bill ...","As MPs return from a two-week break on Monday, Government House Leader Bardish Chagger says the Liberals will try to pass 21 active government bills in Parliament before the end of June when the Commons adjourns and the next election campaign begins, but the Conservatives plan to put up a feisty legislative fight.

Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen (Portage-Lisgar, Man.) says her party’s cooperation in the Commons will depend on the government’s “transparency” on the SNC-Lavalin scandal, as MPs return to the House with 10 sitting weeks left before the next election campaign starts, and 21 active government bills still in Parliament—nine currently in the House and 12 in the Senate.

Ms. Chagger (Waterloo, Ont.) says the Liberals will try to pass them all, though the Conservative Whip in the Senate, Sen. Don Plett (Landmark, Man.), says he doesn’t think that will happen. At least nine of those 21 bills would make good on Liberal election promises from the last campaign, and that total does not include an implementation bill to bring parts of this year’s federal budget into effect.

The opposition parties in the House “are not going to make it easy for us to advance legislation,” Ms. Chagger said, referring as an example to second reading debate last month on the Indigenous Languages Bill, C-91. The Liberals had wanted to move C-91 to the committee stage after one day of debate so that the bill could more quickly be amended. Natan Obed, the leader of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, was harshly critical of the government’s work on C-91 when it was introduced because it did not include any Inuit-specific content. Ms. Chagger moved time allocation on the second day of debate.

“The fact that I had to use time allocation [on that bill] tells me that, yes, the opposition has a role to play and a very important role at that, but they are not going to make it easy for us to advance legislation even that impacts and benefits Canadians. So we will use the tools that we need to use, and we will make sure that we are delivering on our commitments,” she said.

Ms. Chagger listed several bills as among the government’s priorities in the House, including bills C-91 on Indigenous languages; C-92 on First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children in family services; and C-93 to make it easier for Canadians with marijuana convictions to apply for an receive pardons.

Seven other government bills in Parliament would address election promises made by the government in 2015, including C-58 on access to information reform, C-55 on ocean protection, C-68 on fisheries, C-69 on environmental assessments, C-71 on gun safety, C-75 on criminal justice reform, and C-81 on accessibility.

Ms. Bergen told The Hill Times in an emailed statement that the Conservatives will make their cooperation in the House of Commons contingent on the Liberal government’s “transparency” on the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Last week Liberal members on the House Justice Committee voted to adjourn a committee meeting on the subject after a half-hour, pushing further discussions to an in-camera meeting on the subject the following week, and triggering calls of a coverup from Conservative MPs. The Conservatives want the committee to invite former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould (Vancouver Granville, B.C.) to testify again about alleged pressure from the PMO to intervene in the criminal justice system in favour of SNC-Lavalin.

“As it relates to the management of House business, the level of cooperation from the Opposition will directly relate to the level of openness and transparency the Liberals have in the SNC-Lavalin affair,” Ms. Bergen wrote.

“While key figures close to the prime minister are able to speak freely and fully, Justin Trudeau banned Jody Wilson-Raybould from completing her testimony. This is not right or fair. Ms. Wilson-Raybould must be allowed to speak her full truth. Conservatives are prepared to use every parliamentary tool available to make sure that happens.”

The Conservatives had planned to use an opposition day March 18 to trigger a marathon voting session in the House of Commons and potentially delay the tabling of this year’s budget, but the government blocked their attempt by moving the opposition day to March 20, the CBC reported.

The government likely won’t have an easy time in the Senate either. The minority Conservative opposition in the Senate has been willing and able to disrupt and delay debate in the Senate at times when they were unhappy with the way the government and Independent Senators were dealing with legislation or Conservative proposals in the Chamber or in committee. The Senate will likely be asked to deal with government bills quickly as they are moved up from the House in the next few months, but the Conservatives are making no guarantees that they will agree to do so.

Of the 21 active government bills in Parliament, four are relatively uncontroversial and have generated relatively little debate in either Chamber so far: Bill C-85 to amend the Canada-Israel free trade agreement; Bill S-6 to implement a tax convention between Canada and Madagascar; Bill C-82, on a multilateral anti-tax avoidance agreement; and Bill C-84 on animal cruelty. That leaves up to 17 government bills in the House and Senate that may face stiffer opposition.

“They want us to bring all of this stuff through, and yet they want to say this is the Chamber of sober second thought,” said Sen. Plett. “There is blessed little time to get 17 bills through.”

“You’re not going to get all 17 bills. You’ve got to understand that,” he said.

“If the government is throwing bills at us in the last week, or two weeks, and wants us to deal with them, it may not happen,” he said.

“We are not going to rush bills through for the sake of rising on June 21.”

Sen. Plett said he has been asked by Conservative Senate Leader Larry Smith (Saurel, Que.) to negotiate on behalf of the Senate Conservatives at times with the government’s representative in the Senate, Sen. Peter Harder (Ottawa, Ont.), on when and how legislation moves through the Senate. He said he has not met with the facilitator of the Independent Senators Group—the largest group in the Senate—Sen. Yuen Pau Woo (B.C.), because he does not have the authority to make decisions on behalf of ISG Senators, who are more loosely organized than the other groups in the Senate.

Sen. Woo declined an interview request from The Hill Times. Sen. Harder also declined, sending an emailed statement that “Canadians expect Senators to exercise sober second thought but also to do so in a timely fashion.”

Sen. Plett said the Conservatives will at a minimum push for serious amendments to four of the government bills currently in front of Senate committees: C-71 on gun safety, C-68 on fisheries, C-69 on environmental assessments, and C-48 on a tanker ban on the West Coast. He said he hasn’t yet considered bills still in the House of Commons.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) has also said he wanted to enact changes to the Parliament of Canada Act in order to help entrench the new, multi-group dynamic in the Senate that he helped to create. He has said he wants those changes to the Act made before the next election, and tasked Ms. Chagger with the file.

When respondents were asked earlier this month to choose the two most important national issues, health care was the most common answer at 23 per cent, followed by the environment, income inequality, corruption, government spending, housing affordability, the economy, energy, immigration and finally taxes, which polled at 10 per cent.

When a similar poll was conducted in early 2016, as the federal Liberals prepared their first budget, Canadians ruled the economy the most important issue. Jobs ranked second. But that doesn’t indicate an end to Canadians’ anxiety. Four-in-10 respondents expect the economy to worsen over the next year. Fifty-five per cent say it’s not a good time to make a big-ticket purchase. Nearly half of respondents were worried that someone in their household could lose their job because of the economy. There is a growing group of Canadians who feel left behind or on the margins, said Stewart Prest, Simon Fraser University political scientist. They are looking for security, he said, and this will manifest in different ways ahead of October’s general election.

“The economy affects people in concrete ways, which varies by personal circumstances a lot,” Prest explained. “We are going to be having multiple, distinct conversations, and it may be harder to have broader national conversations that bring people on the same way.” The budget is expected to address pharmacare, specific jobs training and potentially housing. While Prest said it’s difficult to determine how things will play out, six months ahead of the general election, he speculated the Liberals will double down on issues that resonate with their base, such as immigration or Islamophobia. During Monday’s Question Period in Parliament, Trudeau was vocal about denouncing white supremacy and racism, saying the fight will be “major” but Canada cannot put it off anymore. “I suspect the Liberals will give up on trying to please everyone,” Prest said. “They are going to try to build a winning coalition and won’t necessarily be casting as wide a tent as they did in 2015.”

The issues on Canadians’ minds — including housing affordability, inequality, taxation and spending — “break” in two different directions, according to Shachi Kurl, Angus Reid executive director. “This splits along political lines. Those who would consider voting Conservative Party are more concerned about the latter issues. Those who would consider the Liberals and/or NDP key on the former,” she said in an email.

There are marked provincial differences as well. Respondents in Alberta and Saskatchewan are feeling the most bleak, with nearly half of residents believing their standard of living worsened in the last year. Those regions also have the highest anxiety over potential job losses, with six-in-10 residents concerned for the household. However, Albertans are more likely to expect their standards of living to improve next year, while Saskatchewanians are more likely to believe it will worsen. Meanwhile, poverty in Canada is lower than ever. The Liberal government attributes its decline to the Canada Child Benefit and an increase in the Guaranteed Income Supplement for seniors, the poll report noted. However, middle-class growth — a key component of the government’s 2015 platform — has largely been stagnant. Recent income-tax data suggests these households have seen little to no increase in income. Meanwhile, unemployment has dropped and the economy has grown relatively steadily, the poll report explained. That’s why the Trudeau government will have to straddle making life more affordable while showing they’re taking deficit spending seriously, Kurl said. From a political standpoint, this is an “absolutely crucial budget,” Kurl said, given the government’s need to change the channel on the contentious SNC-Lavalin affair. “MPs in caucus are likely clamouring for something more to talk about on the doorstep and community events than the PM’s explanation of what happened,” she explained. “They’re getting hammered in the polls and desperate to move on.” The Angus Reid Institute conducted the self-commissioned online survey from March 8 to March 10, polling 1,594 Canadian adults who are members of its forum. The margin of error is +/- 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food, culture and policy. Follow her on Twitter: @mdgmedia

Jagmeet Singh, Leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada and newly elected Member of Parliament for Burnaby South, made the following statement on Sunday as he made history as the first racialized leader of a party to be swornin tothe House of Commons:

“If you had asked me when I was a kid, I would’ve never imagined being here today. I would’ve never imagined that someone who looks like me could ever run to be prime minister.

I’m honoured to be here to take my seat in the House of Commons. I’m so thankful to the people of Burnaby South for putting their trust in me. Standing here today, I hope it sends a message to young Canadians that yes – yes you can.

Canadians across the country feel let down. People are working hard, they’re trying to make ends meet but, they’re finding it tougher than ever to afford a place to call home, to care for ageing family members or to buy the medication they desperately need.

We’re not here by chance, we’re here because of failures of consecutive Conservative and Liberal governments. My friends, for too long we’ve been forced to choose between bad and worse and it’s not right. Canadians deserve better. Now more than ever before. And as the new MP for Burnaby South, that’s what I commit to.

93,Politics,2019-03-19T08:47:00.0000000Z,The Conservative party has been pushing the DND to cover Norman’s mounting legal costs as the case against the senior naval officer drags into its second year. Conservative MP Leona Alleslev ...,"The Department of National Defence has declined to pay the legal bills for Vice Admiral Mark Norman in his ongoing court case.

But it’s a different story for other government officials, who will find that all their legal bills will be covered by the taxpayer.

The DND will be paying for lawyers for some of those who will be testifying for the Crown at Norman’s trial which is to start in August. Jody Thomas, the department’s deputy minister, has approved the applications to pay the legal fees for six department or Canadian Forces individuals. Sources say some of those are linked to the Norman case.

At the same time Robert Fife and Steve Chase of the Globe and Mail have reported that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and senior officials in his office have retained outside legal counsel in case of an RCMP investigation into allegations of political interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group.

Cameron Ahmad, Trudeau’s communications director, told the journalists that Treasury Board rules allow for outside lawyers to be hired at public expense. “As per the Treasury Board Policy on Legal Assistance and Indemnification, counsel has been retained to advise on the matter in question,” Ahmad confirmed to the Globe, which noted that the rules allow for hiring of outside counsel when government officials are either sued, threatened with a suit, charged with an offence or under threat of being named in a legal action.

But when Vice Admiral Norman applied for the same treatment under the exact same policy the DND turned him down.

The DND rejected Norman’s request for financial assistance in 2017 as it claimed the senior officer was guilty of disclosing confidential information. Government officials reached that stunning conclusion — contained in a Justice Department letter leaked to Postmedia — even though Norman had not been charged at the time and no formal internal investigation was carried out by the Canadian Forces or the DND.

Norman, once the second highest ranking officer in the Canadian military, was charged last year with one count of breach of trust.

Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Jon Vance suspended Norman from his job in January 2017 after the RCMP alleged he tipped off Davie Shipbuilding that the Liberal government was considering delaying a key navy program in which the Quebec firm would convert a commercial ship into a naval supply vessel. Details about the government’s decision were also leaked to journalists, and the resulting embarrassment, along with the financial penalties that would have been imposed, forced the Trudeau government to back down on its plans.

There have been suggestions that officials from the Privy Council Office or the Prime Minister’s Office may have been involved in the decision to decline Norman financial support under the Treasury Board policy. But the DND says that is not the case.

The decision was made by then DND Deputy Minister John Forster. “It was done following consultations with the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Legal Advisor (DND/CF LA), who reports to the Department of Justice,” the DND noted in a statement to Postmedia. “None of our records suggest that the Clerk of the Privy Council and/or PMO were involved or consulted in the decision making process.”

Forster will be appearing as a witness for the Crown when Norman’s trial begins in August.

The Justice Department is involved in the ongoing legal battle with Norman in that it is supposed to coordinating the release of federal government records to the court during the pre-trial hearing. The court has also heard that the Justice Department has offered legal advice to people who have had documents subpoenaed by Norman’s lawyers.

The Conservative party has been pushing the DND to cover Norman’s mounting legal costs as the case against the senior naval officer drags into its second year.

Conservative MP Leona Alleslev asked Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan at the Commons defence committee Feb. 28 about whether he would grant approval for Norman’s legal fees to be covered under the federal program. Sajjan refused to answer, claiming that Norman’s case was before the courts.

But Alleslev countered that her question about whether Norman’s legal bills would be covered had nothing to do with the officer’s criminal trial or the pre-trial hearings that have been underway.

Lawyers observing the case have told Postmedia they estimate the cost at this point for the prosecution to be between $10 million and $15 million.

Norman has two main lawyers but his legal costs are not known. Sources, however, say the significant delays in getting basic documents for his defence is pushing his family into bankruptcy.

A GoFundMe page has been set up by retired Canadian Army officer Lee Hammond to help finance Norman’s legal costs. Hammond had originally set his fundraising goal at $50,000 but has now increased that to $500,000 to cover the increasing legal costs.","Taxpayers cover cost of lawyers for Trudeau, others in SNC Lavalin affair but no help for Vice Adm.

A big part of her election strategy will mean ...","TORONTO — Elizabeth May is on a bus that's 45 minutes from Regina, thinking about fellow travellers.

""I've got my earphones on so that I don't disturb other passengers,"" she says quietly. ""I'll try to talk softly.""

It's been a heady time for the 64-year-old leader of the Green Party of Canada, a role she has held since 2006.

In recent weeks, May scored a rare standing ovation from opposition MPs in the House of Commons by calling for Canada's top public servant to be fired for his role in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

She grilled the prime minister's former principal secretary at committee for proof that 9,000 jobs at the Quebec engineering giant were truly at stake in the messy saga that has dominated political headlines.

Now on a March break from Parliament, she's touring Western Canada by bus and rail to encourage anyone who will listen that her party is worth a closer look.

'We are the tortoise, not the hare'

May has good reason to feel ""buoyed up"" lately, with record fundraising and a string of pretty good polls she says reflect a steady build that has been largely ignored.

""We are the tortoise, not the hare,"" May says. ""But people don't often notice the tortoise until the tortoise is suddenly in the lead.""

Plucky provincial cousins are getting noticed more and more these days.

Three Green MLAs in British Columbia basically hold the balance of power in that legislature. Ontario Green Leader Mike Schreiner punched his ticket to Queen's Park in June, while three Greens were elected in New Brunswick last fall.

The sole Green MP in the House, May has represented B.C.'s Saanich-Gulf Islands since 2011. She is confident that ""multiple seats"" are in her party's future after Canadians head to the polls in October.

The road to that milestone might well cut through Canada's smallest province.

John Morris/CP Prince Edward Island Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker speaks during a televised debate in Summerside, P.E.I., on April 27, 2015.

In Prince Edward Island, where an election must also be held by early October but is expected this spring, Greens are leading the polls and knocking on the door of history.

P.E.I. was the first province to have a premier of non-European descent. The first to be led by a woman. The first with an openly gay male premier.

A Green win in P.E.I. would show Canadians the party can be trusted to govern, May says, which is precisely the message she's been delivering all these years.

Just don't tell her the Greens are having a ""moment"" right now. Moments are fleeting. ""We've been feeling the winds in our sails for some time.""

All that momentum has put some extra pressure on Peter Bevan-Baker.

The Scottish-born former dentist was acclaimed as P.E.I. Green leader in 2012 and, three years later, won his party's first seat. He had lost nine other times before then, in elections in both Ontario and P.E.I.

Bevan-Baker's caucus doubled in November 2017 when Greens won a byelection on the Island.

His party has money in the bank — ""nothing at all to compare with the war chests of the big parties,"" he says — but enough to compete in a campaign that for all intents and purposes has begun.

""We're all aware that people are watching what's going on here because we're breaking new ground,"" he says.

He sees the growing support for Greens on the Island as a local expression of a global phenomenon that has voters disillusioned with ""conventional politics and unimaginative politicians.""

While that itch is sometimes scratched by choosing ""the Donald Trumps or the (Doug) Fords of the world,"" he says, that's just not in the character of P.E.I. The Greens represent a comfortable, credible choice for those fleeing politics as usual.

But if P.E.I. is a testing ground for a larger movement, Bevan-Baker has lessons about the hurdles May will face, too. Chief among them: beating back that lingering idea that Greens are a single-issue advocacy group, a one-chord band singing only about the environment.

Watch: Elizabeth May delivers impassioned speech during climate debate

Bevan-Baker says his team has overcome all that by dint of hard work, articulating clear policies on issues such as education, health, and economic development. It all amounts to a delicate balancing act.

""We can't expect to have a prosperous economy or strong communities or healthy people if we don't have good soil and water and healthy air. The fundamental things that underpin societies,"" he says.

""So, it's not that we've abandoned our green roots or the belief that the environment is absolutely foundational to everything else.""

May believes Canadians are more ready for those conversations on the national scale than ever before, that the stars are aligning for a federal breakthrough thanks in part to her seatmate in the House.

Tucked in the corner of the Commons, May can sometimes be found facepalming or shaking her head when People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier rails against supply management or a non-binding UN migration pact.

""We're the ultimate odd couple, there's no question about that,"" she says of Bernier, who bailed on the Tories last August to start the populist party.

""We do not agree on a single matter of public policy but we do agree that it's better to be collegial. And I think we both celebrate, in our own way, that he will split the conservative vote.""

A big part of her election strategy will mean telling people: look over there to your right. With Bernier pledging to run candidates in every riding, May thinks enough votes will be siphoned away from Conservatives to keep Andrew Scheer from becoming prime minister.

Graham Hughes/CP People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier speaks during a candidate nomination event for the upcoming federal byelection in the riding of Outremont in Montreal on Jan. 27, 2019.

Would-be supporters can vote Green without worrying they are helping Conservatives, she says. May blames strategic voting from progressives focused on booting out Stephen Harper's government for her party's disappointing results in the 2015 election.

""Fear-based voting isn't healthy in a democracy and fear-based voting is exactly why I went back to Parliament by myself,"" she says.

A crowded field of six major parties competing for votes (including the regional Bloc Québécois), has May envisioning a minority Parliament where Greens can play a more meaningful role.

If the results of three federal byelections last month are any indication, the People's Party has work ahead of them. Though the party cleared 10 per cent of the vote in B.C.'s Burnaby South riding, where a controversial former Christian talk-show host carried the flag, Bernier's crew was a non-factor in Ontario's York-Simcoe and Quebec's Outremont.

If you are going to ask me to run a pipeline from British Columbia to Alberta to deliver quality red wine, we have no problem. Elizabeth May

And in Outremont, held for more than a decade by former NDP leader Tom Mulcair and reclaimed by Liberals despite the SNC-Lavalin scandal, Greens outperformed the Tories and the Bloc.

The B.C. byelection also shifted the political landscape when NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won a federal seat.

May announced last summer that she would not put up a Green candidate against Singh because of the so-called ""leader's courtesy,"" an informal parliamentary tradition in which a leader without a seat gets an easier path to the House. Liberals and Tories did not extend the same gesture.

Singh will be sworn in Sunday and enter the House next week to some needed fanfare. May doesn't appear to be sweating what his heightened presence might mean to Green prospects.

""I don't know the measure of the man yet,"" she says of Singh. ""I don't know what really matters to him and I think it's important for Canadians to know that, which is why the leader's courtesy tradition exists.""

Like May, Singh opposes the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. The Green leader was arrested almost a year ago protesting the project in Burnaby.

May says Greens have nothing against pipelines. The issue is the product inside them.

""If you are going to ask me to run a pipeline from British Columbia to Alberta to deliver quality red wine, we have no problem.""

But Singh has raised some eyebrows from his own candidates by supporting a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline project in northern B.C., spurring his predecessor to muse on TV that progressives ""looking for a home on environmental issues"" may gravitate to May.

""We are opposed to the destruction of life on Earth, therefore we oppose any new fossil fuel developments,"" May says when asked about her view on the LNG project.

""We advocate for a rapid reduction of Canada's fossil fuel production so we're able to ensure a livable world for our kids. And that's the bottom line.""

May speaking with such urgency is resonating among Canadians who are growing more concerned about climate change, Abacus Data CEO David Coletto suggests.

""It seems to me that the opportunity for the Greens has probably never been better than it is today and headed into the 2019 election,"" Coletto says, pointing not only to an uptick in support but an increase in the number of Canadians who say they are open to voting Green.

His firm released numbers this week suggesting May is outperforming Singh by three points on the question of which party leader Canadians prefer to become prime minister after the next election.

Abacus Data A graph from an Abacus Data poll released on March 10, 2019.

Coletto says that's as much a reflection on May's popularity as Singh's struggles to connect. More than one-third of NDP supporters tell his firm that the Greens are their second choice.

He is also paying close attention to what a potential Green government in P.E.I. could mean for May.

Though it wouldn't be on the same level as Greens taking B.C. or Alberta, Coletto says, a win could have other voters saying to themselves: ""Well, if people in P.E.I. feel comfortable electing a Green government, then why shouldn't I?""

It also remains to be seen what kind of lasting damage the SNC-Lavalin affair will have on Trudeau and whether there's still room for things to be accomplished in the final months of Parliament before the election.

Though Trudeau has faced Conservative calls to resign, May doesn't believe the ongoing controversy will prevent legislation from moving through Parliament. The ""real work"" in Ottawa is largely done in empty rooms, she says, not in the glare of question period.

She stands by her support for a full public inquiry into allegations from former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould that she faced inappropriate political pressure from Trudeau and other officials to help SNC-Lavalin secure a deal to avoid a trial on corruption charges.

Watch: Trudeau shares his side of SNC-Lavalin affair

Trudeau is ""battered and bloodied"" right now, May says, but a full investigation can go a long way to ensure a steady ship of state.

""I don't think he understands it was wrong,"" May says of Trudeau, who has denied Wilson-Raybould's version of events while copping to an ""erosion of trust"" between her and his office.

""I don't think he understands it all, frankly, because he doesn't have a legal background. I think the people he had around him, in whom he had trust to give him good legal advice, gave him bad legal advice.""

She's even recommending an out-of-the-box play for Trudeau: admit to having been ""completely wrong-footed"" and convince Wilson-Raybould to return to cabinet as minister of justice.

""She's a person of deep ethics, deep integrity. And if I were in her shoes and knew that I could continue to contribute to the life of my country and protect the rule of law, then I would do it.""

'All bets are off'

Facing her fourth federal election as leader, May won't say if this will be her last.

""Who knows? If I become prime minister through a series of unimaginable flukes, that might be hard to turn down,"" she says with a laugh.

""This is the kind of election where, honestly, I think all bets are off and anything is possible.""

Saskatchewan had the ...","Education, poverty and the environment are high on the list of budget priorities for Canadian high school students.

That’s according to the 2019 Student Budget Consultation, an annual survey of Canadian students conducted by CIVIX, a non-partisan charity dedicated to building political engagement among young adults. More than 8,000 high school students took part in this year’s survey, including 45 from the Prince Albert area.

Crime and fiscal responsibility rounded out the list of top five major concerns, but education was by far the one item students wanted to see supported in the federal budget, especially post-secondary education.

CIVIX content director Dan Allan said most students remain confident they’ll be able to find a job when they graduate. However, not all think they’ll be able to pay for the training and education needed to get one.

“Education is one of the results that we see really strongly this year, as an area that students think the government can really help them,” Allan explained. “Whether it’s lowering the cost of school or making debt a more manageable thing, (education) is a top thing which, for the group that’s taking the survey, makes a lot of sense.”

A total of 93 per cent of all students surveyed want the government to either increase spending on post-secondary education, or spend at least the same amount. Almost half of students, 48 per cent, say making student debt more manageable is the best thing the federal government could do to help young Canadians enter the workforce.

Post-secondary costs also topped the list of concerns when CIVIX asked about what steps the federal government should take to assist families. Roughly 35 per cent of students surveyed said the government should make post-secondary education more affordable and accessible. Lowering personal income taxes was the second highest response, with 27 per cent of students picking that option.

Although students are concerned about the need for more accessible education, most don’t want the government to break the bank to do it. Allan said students are very conscious of the Canadian debt, and are worried it‘s getting out of control. In fact, 72 per cent of students surveyed wanted the government to prioritize lowering the federal debt as much as possible.

“One of the things that students have told us is that they’re worried about is the amount of debt the government is taking on, that will have to be paid back when their older,” Allan said. “There is very much a mixture of concerns. They’re hoping the government spends now to help them, as well as wanting the government to be mindful of what they spend.”

While 92 per cent of students said they wanted the federal government to either spend the same or increase spending when it came to the environment, they remain fairly neutral on one of Canada’s most controversial issues: the federal carbon tax. Roughly 47 per cent of students surveyed said they are neutral about the federal government’s plan to implement the tax, with 35 per cent supporting it and 18 per cent opposing.

Students were also uncommitted about federal government support for struggling private media companies, with 49 per cent saying they’re neutral. Another Roughly 28 per cent say they oppose the federal government giving support to media organizations, while 22 per cent agree.

Roughly 400 Saskatchewan students responded to the survey, representing 43 of the province’s schools.

Saskatchewan and Alberta students were the most likely to support Canada’s oil and gas industry, however Saskatchewan students were also the most likely to agree with the statement “wealthy people have a greater financial obligation than everyone else to help those who are in need.”

The federal Conservatives and NDP were the parties Canadian students were most likely to support, with each party getting 31 per cent of the vote. The Liberals were next with 24 per cent of the vote, followed by eight per cent supporting the Green Party and five per cent supporting the People’s Party of Canada.

Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta were bastions of Conservative support, with students in all three provinces favouring them. Saskatchewan had the highest rate, with just under 50 per cent of students agreeing with the Conservatives. Students in B.C. gave by the strongest vote of confidence to the NDP, while students in Ontario and Atlantic Canada were more evenly divided across party lines.

Allan said there’s an assumption that most young people are less conservative than their parents, however this survey shows that’s not true on the prairies.

“It’s not really a surprise,” he said. “We never want to have any preconceived notions about where students are going to fall, but … what we find over the years is that nine times out of 10, students in a given area will vote along the same lines as adults do. We’ve done votes in Saskatchewan, both for the 2016 provincial election and the 2015 federal vote, and the results of students who took part pretty much lined up exactly (with the actual vote) in those cases, so it doesn’t surprise us that the results in these cases pretty much line up.”",Post-secondary costs highlight list of concerns in 2019 CIVIX Student Budget Consultation,Prince Albert Daily Herald,http://paherald.sk.ca/2019/03/18/post-secondary-costs-highlight-list-of-concerns-in-2019-civix-student-budget-consultation/

OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered an emotional clarion call Monday as he urged people of all political stripes to turn the page on hateful ideology and condemn the sort of intolerance that fuelled the brutal killing of 50 Muslims in New Zealand.

A visibly angry Trudeau denounced the ""small, toxic segments"" of society that peddle the belief diversity is a weakness, spewing hatred and inciting brutality.

""We see it here in Canada -- in online harassment, anonymous letters, defaced places of worship, acts of violence and even murder,"" he told the House of Commons as party leaders expressed solidarity with the victims in Christchurch and their families.

""When we fail to denounce hatred with total conviction, we empower those people and legitimize their violence.""

Trudeau expressed sorrow at the many attacks in recent years that have taken the lives of defenceless people at mosques, temples, churches, synagogues, concerts, schools and malls.

""I'm sick and tired of extending our thoughts and our prayers. People around the world are exhausted by the carnage,"" he said.

""We have to chase out this hatred from our parties, fight it online, denounce it at town halls, push back when it reaches our front door.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer joined Trudeau in stressing the need to condemn all racist ideologies and doctrines of prejudice.

Canada has, from its inception, been a country built on values that transcend religious, ethnic and linguistic divides, Scheer said. ""This is who we are, and this is who we will always be. Those who think otherwise have no place in our democracy.""

In his maiden speech to the Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the use of dehumanizing language and making immigration out to be a threat can breed fear and fuel hatred.

""Let's open our hearts and replace the ignorance, the lack of knowledge with understanding, which will create the climate for compassion, so we care for one another,"" he said.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale suggested Friday's deadly mass shooting, which killed 50 people and wounded 50 more as they gathered at a pair of Christchurch mosques, will spur parliamentarians to take a careful look at Canada's gun laws.

The massacre has sparked a global sense of concern that will prompt Canadian politicians to make some timely decisions, Goodale said Monday after appearing before a Senate committee.

Goodale said cabinet colleague Bill Blair will deliver recommendations soon, having been asked last August by Trudeau to study the possibility of a full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada.

A visibly galvanized Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's prime minister, said her government plans to announce gun-law reforms within days.

A bill already before Canada's Senate would, among other things, expand the scope of background checks on those who want to acquire guns here.

The bill would also require gun retailers keep records of firearms inventory and sales, and ensure the purchaser of a hunting rifle or shotgun presents a firearms licence, while the seller would have to verify it.","PM condemns hateful, 'toxic segments' of society after New Zealand shooting",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/pm-condemns-hateful-toxic-segments-of-society-after-new-zealand-shooting-1.4341064

Yes, we are all aware that Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was lobbying Trudeau’s inner circle hard in order to secure a deferred prosecution agreement, rather than face a possible criminal conviction for bribery charges.

In turn, Wilson-Raybould has testified before the Commons justice committee that Trudeau’s top aide, Gerald Butts, and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick pressured her on this file. Their argument was that a criminal conviction would preclude SNC-Lavalin from bidding on future federal government tenders. Should that occur, SNC-Lavalin executives had suggested they would fold up their headquarters tent in Montreal, and 9,000 skilled jobs would vanish from the Canadian landscape. This would, of course, not sit well with voters in an election year.

The allegations of political interference in this case have made this a decidedly Liberal Party scandal, with the Conservative opposition circulating petitions urging Trudeau to resign.

Upon closer examination, however, the actual accusations of SNC-Lavalin having bribed their way into lucrative Libyan construction contracts spans the period of 2001 to 2011. During that decade it is alleged that SNC-Lavalin representatives paid an estimated $48 million in bribes to members of the Gadhafi family.

During a 2008 visit to Canada it is believed that Garda World was hired by SNC-Lavalin to protect Saadi Gadhafi, the former Libyan president’s third-eldest son. That protection by Garda is alleged to have included some $30,000 worth of prostitutes and tickets to a Spice Girls concert.

The timeframe also puts this sordid affair back onto the Harper Conservatives. Fast forward to the spring of 2011 and the start of the Libyan uprising. At that juncture, no doubt thanks in part to the $48 million in palm grease paid to the Gadhafi family, SNC-Lavalin had secured billions of dollars’ worth of construction in Libya. Heck, they were even in the process of building a big new jail for the very president we were now labelling as a bloodthirsty despot.

Foreign affairs minister John Baird was among the loudest and most bellicose of western voices demanding that Gadhafi must go.

To help make that happen, Canada was among the first countries to participate in the NATO air campaign aimed at destroying the Gadhafi loyalist forces.

It took a hell of a lot longer than anyone would have imagined for the world’s most sophisticated air armada to defeat a fourth-rate African army, but by early October 2011, the end was clearly nigh. The last of the Gadhafi loyalists were contained alongside their embattled leader in the town of Sirte.

On Oct. 11, 2011, a full nine days before Libyan rebels would capture and murder Gadhafi, Baird made a secret visit into the rebel held Libyan capital of Tripoli. During that whirlwind trip, Baird met with and praised several of the Libyan rebel leaders and he announced Canada’s commitment of $10 million to secure Libyan weapons once the war was finally won.

Travelling with Baird were a number of Canadian business executives, including representatives from SNC-Lavalin, eager to start a new round of lucrative Libyan projects under the new post-Gadhafi leaders. Keep in mind that at this point Gadhafi was still alive and fighting.

So, if we are to believe that paying bribes to corrupt Third World leaders in order to obtain contracts is criminal nature, how do we define using military force to effect regime change, and then bringing in the carpet-baggers to profit from the puppet regime which we installed next?

The only problem with the Libyan caper was that Baird and company failed to listen to ambassador Sandra McCardell. She was with Baird in Tripoli as he used that same visit to reopen our embassy.

Her prophetic statement to the Canadian Press at that time was that getting the guns out of the hands of young, heavily armed rebels would be the best way for Canada to contribute to Libya’s post-Gadhafi reconstruction. That’s right, the best way to help Libya would be for us to disarm the rebels we had armed.

Baird never did say just how his $10 million in pledged funding would actually secure the Libyan arsenals, but suffice it to say whatever he had planned failed miserably.

Once Gadhafi was dead, the various rebel groups, Islamic extremists, human traffickers and tribal thugs began fighting among themselves. Libya quickly plunged into a failed state of violent anarchy, where it remains to this date.

The Trudeau Liberals tried to avert a possible criminal conviction for SNC-Lavalin’s alleged bribery. That’s bad.

The conflict emerged in 2004 when the plaintiff decided to run for the Conservative Party in the federal election in Newmarket, York-Simcoe, Mississauga, Brampton, Richmond Hill or Barrie.","The common law in Ontario has proven relatively adept at developing new torts, in particular in the area of privacy law, to change and adapt to relatively stagnant or unsatisfactory statutory developments.

Although the tort of intimidation has long been recognized as giving rise to a cause of action, as affirmed in cases such as Tran v. University of Western Ontario, the status of the tort of harassment has been much more divided.

The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed in the 1981 decision of Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology v. Bhadauria that human rights legislation are the more appropriate venue for pursuing claims of harassment related to those grounds. Outside of developments in post-secondary education law since, this rationale does not necessarily extend to claims of bullying or harassment where indicia of human rights are not present, or where it falls outside of the scope of the Human Rights Code. In an era where society is increasingly struggling with the rise of cyberbullying and harassment online, some have looked again to this tort as a potential remedy.

One of the earliest cases to lay out the elements of the tort of harassment is in the 2006 B.C. case of Mainland Sawmills Ltd. et al v. IWA – Canada et al, where the plaintiffs set out to base the tort on the basis of the American tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, which would contain the following elements:

1. outrageous conduct by the defendant;

2. the defendant’s intention of causing or reckless disregard of causing emotional distress;

3. the plaintiff’s suffering of severe or extreme emotional distress; and,

4. the actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct.

The court in this case did declined to determine whether the tort existed, and instead continued to assess whether the plaintiff’s claim was made out, which the decided in the negative. They did however distinguish this American-derived tort from the Canadian tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering (also known as IIMS, or as intentional infliction of nervous shock) on the basis that the latter requires some proof of a visible and proveable illness, whereas the former could be demonstrated by proof of severe or extreme emotional distress.

Since this case, there have been divided opinions across Canada as to whether this tort exists, what its constituent elements should be, or opinions that refuse to distinguish it from the existing tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering.

This week, the Ontario Court of Appeal released its decision in Merrifield v The Attorney General, reversing the 2017 decision of Justice Mary E. Vallee of the Superior Court of Justice that had reviewed some of the relevant case law and had concluded that the tort of harassment did exist.

The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge had erred by recognizing the tort of harassment, and in applying the test for the intentional infliction of mental suffering. This is the first case of a Canadian appellate court to determine if this tort exists, and it therefore has important implications for the future.

The claim emerged from allegations of harassment and bullying by managers within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) towards a junior Constable assigned to the Threat Assessment Group (TAG), who was later promoted. Part of the TAG role included providing protective services to politicians, carrying out threat assessments, and monitoring criminal, extremist, and terrorist groups.

The conflict emerged in 2004 when the plaintiff decided to run for the Conservative Party in the federal election in Newmarket, York-Simcoe, Mississauga, Brampton, Richmond Hill or Barrie. He was in a potential conflict of interest given the investigation into a death threat against Belinda Stronach, Member of Parliament for Newmarket—Aurora, who had crossed the floor to leave the Conservatives for the Liberals.

As part of his political aspirations, the plaintiff had appeared in the media as a “terrorism consultant,” discussing various terrorist threats against Canada. However, he apparently did not comply with the applicable RCMP policies regarding these media appearances, and he was transferred to a different department.

The RCMP had never had a member run for political office, but it did have applicable rules and policies if a member wanted to do so. The clarity of these policies were in dispute, so in 2005 one of his managers sent a memo about his political campaign, potential conflicts, and media appearances.

The following year, a formal investigation was launched under Part IV of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act over the plaintiff’s use of a corporate credit card. This card was a special card that was “covertly backstopped” to prevent it from being linked to the RCMP, and therefore being able to identify the user as such. Although the investigation concluded that the plaintiff had contravened the RCMP Code of Conduct for failing to pay a small balance on this card, the plaintiff attributed this to various moves in his life and his belief that the appropriate paperwork had already been filled out.

The plaintiff’s interpretation of the conduct of the agency was that he was being punished and bullied for his political and media activities. There was an inaccurate media article that characterized him as being demoted, whereas he really was transferred laterally. This transfer was still interpreted by him as intended to be punitive in nature. All of these actions, in conjunction with threats he claimed by senior officers, had an affect on his health.

The Court of Appeal emphasized that although the common law does change, it does so slowly and incrementally. The creation of a new common law duty is justified where it flows from existing principles and underpin and inform existing common law rules, and responds to societal needs in a way that provides a basis to the reasonable expectation of parties without creating undue adverse effects.

The development of privacy torts was therefore described and interpreted as emerging from a growing acceptance of privacy claims, the culmination of a number of related legal developments, and specific facts that cried for a remedy.

In contrast, the tort of harassment was much more controversial, especially since the foundation case in Mainland Sawmills and those following it had already presumed the tort to exist without any analysis. Instead, the Court of Appeal focused on whether the court should create the tort in this case,

[39] At the outset, it is important to recognize that this is not a case like Tsige, which, as we have said, is best understood as a culmination of a number of related legal developments. As we have explained, current Canadian legal authority does not support the recognition of a tort of harassment. [40] We were not provided with any foreign judicial authority that would support the recognition of a new tort. Nor were we provided with any academic authority or compelling policy rationale for recognizing a new tort and its requisite elements. [41] This is not a case whose facts cry out for the creation of a novel legal remedy, as in Tsige… [42] That is not this case. In this case, there are legal remedies available to redress conduct that is alleged to constitute harassment. The tort of IIMS is one of these remedies…

The Court of Appeal analyzed the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering, and concluded it also did not apply here. They also found several factual errors that they characterized as palpable and overriding that would preclude a conclusion that harassment occur, even if the tort of harassment did exist.

Central to these errors of fact was the characterization of the plaintiff’s political involvement. The Court of Appeal did not find that the involvement in nomination meetings where the plaintiff was seeking a candidacy were sufficiently “private” event to party members as to excuse him the RCMP regulations regarding political involvement. They also found that the actual conflict began in 2005, over the plaintiff’s continued political involvement without properly apprising his supervisors.

The basis of the plaintiff’s discipline, transfer and investigation, especially around the conflict of interest, was challenged by the Court of Appeal. The manager in question had consulted and followed the advice of internal RCMP resources over potential conflicts before making the transfer, which substantiated a bona fide belief that a potential conflict could exist.

Although this conclusion by the first appellate court in Canada to discuss the tort of harassment may leave some disappointed about another potential tool to fight cyberbullying and online harassment, it is not fatal to those possibilities in the future. The extensive focus by the Court of Appeal on the factual errors in this case illustrate that this was not the right facts that would compel a court to develop or recognize a new tort.

Framed appropriately, including the difficulties in developing statutory remedies for online harassment, and by drawing parallel developments in case law likely in the areas of privacy torts, another case on another day may in fact be able to convince an appellate court to recognize this new tort. The requirement for “outrageous conduct” in particular will need to be particularly compelling to justify this development.

Until that day though, no such tort of harassment will likely exist anywhere in Canada.",No Tort of Harassment for You!,slaw.ca,http://www.slaw.ca/2019/03/17/no-tort-of-harassment-for-you/

THUNDER BAY – The Liberal Party will need to find a new candidate in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding for the upcoming federal election that is a little more than seven months away.

Don Rusnak, MP for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, has withdrawn his name as the Liberal Party candidate in the 2019 federal election.

The announcement was made on Sunday in letter released by Rusnak, which cites family commitments, including raising two young sons, as the reason for deciding not to seek re-election.

“Though I try to spend as much time with them as I can when I am home in our riding, I’ve missed close to half of their young lives,” Rusnak said.

“I want to be there more, for my young family. That’s why, after much contemplation, I have decided to withdraw my name as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the upcoming 2019 election. I will no longer be running in this year’s federal election.”

In the 2015 federal election, Rusnak earned 44 per cent of the vote to win his seat, defeating NPD’s John Rafferty, Conservative Moe Comuzzi, and Green Party candidate, Christy Radbourne.

During his time in parliament, Rusnak served on the standing committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs, as well as being named the chair of the Indigenous Caucus, and director at large Canada-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group. Last September, Rusnak stepped down from his role as Parlimentary Secretary to the minster of Indigenous Services, citing family committments for his departure.

“I am proud of all we have achieved in our region these past few years,” Rusnak said. “We have seen major investments in Confederation College, Seven Generations and Lakehead University, as well as major infrastructure projects like the construction of the Rainy-River Baudette Bridge and the upgrades to Thunder Bay’s transit system.”

In November 2018, Rusnak was acclaimed as the Liberal Party candidate to run in the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding. At that time, he said his top priorities were improving life for seniors and Indigenous people in the region.

Last month, former Thunder Bay city councilor, Linda Rydholm, was named the Conservative candidate for the Thunder Bay-Rainy River Riding. No other parties have named a candidate yet.

In October 2018, Liberal MP, Patty Hajdu in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding announced she would be seeking re-election.

Council to blame for LRT cost overruns

RE: LRT

I am extremely upset with Hamilton council's reaction to cost increases for LRT. There is no mystery here. It is just simple math that since this project has been delayed due to numerous motions by past councils, the price for building it has now increased over time.

At some point momentum was lost, the province likely got fed up, and the Conservatives continue to withhold finances necessary to obtain property for the LRT route. I think the councillors responsible should acknowledge their role in what could already be the first signs of derailment of this public works project, rather than playing the victim.

It is truly stunning to think that some feel that full capital funding for LRT is actually not enough. Now it's also Doug Ford's government that must pony up for cost overages which have materialized strictly because of council's endless dithering on the matter? How Hamilton pays for LRT is a problem to be solved, not fodder for another game of chicken with the province as we demonstrate a warped sense of entitlement.

It is past clear that the Liberals should never have agreed to pay the full cost of LRT. This has left Hamilton council free to hold both the province and city hostage for years with threats of pulling out of a project they themselves wanted, as a tremendous amount of other people's money is being spent.

What is wrong with asking for a second opinion when 9,000 employees will lose their jobs?

Trudeau was clear he regrets the entire process as it has unfolded and, moving forward, changes will be made. He identified the lack of direct and clear communication between himself and the Attorney General and admitted he had learned a hard lesson.

Care workers not valued

RE: Why be a care worker? (Feb. 28)

How true this article is. My daughter, a social worker, admitted a client to a lodging home. The rent for this room was $746 a month to share with two other people (presumably strangers), and laundry is extra.

The client had missed lunch so was given a baloney sandwich and a cup of Jell-O. The lodge home is receiving $1,492 a month for this room.

My daughter is a kind, caring person, but this job is challenging — time spent at court, reviving an overdose and hours in hospital waiting for a client to be treated. If a client is incarcerated (often for mental illness) or hospitalized because of a street beating, they lose their home placement. How unfair!

My daughter fights hard for her clients and feels good when a placement is successful. This job is not 9-5, the pay is low, but social workers try to do their best in spite of the odds.

Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson. Singh's first words as an elected ...","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made history Monday as he asked his first questions to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons.

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

He said the Canadian government will work closely with that of New Zealand “to take action against violent extremism.”

“To move forward as a world, we need to recognize diversity as a source of strength, and not a threat,” he said. “Last night’s victims were fathers, mothers and children.

“There are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred,” he said in a tweet. “I am praying for peace for the families of those lost and recovery for those injured.”

“There is no room for extremism in our societies; there is no room for intolerance,” he said. “We will not allow violence to take root in our democratic societies.”

Quebec Muslims devastated

Among the Quebec Muslim community, the New Zealand terrorist attack exacerbated wounds that still haven't healed. Boufeldja Benabdallah, head of the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre where Bissonnette carried out his attack, said his thoughts are with the grieving families. He added that members of his own community are in indescribable pain and called for lawmakers to legislate against extremism.

""Imagine the children of those families here in Quebec who are hearing it on the radio and will watch their mothers cry and ask 'Why are you crying?'"" he said. ""The mothers will remember the 29th, when they ran to get husbands who were killed by Alexandre Bissonnette.

""We must get back to work once again to explain, to tell these extremists of all stripes who politicize religion, like extremists who use race as a basis for discrimination, that we must change. The world cannot continue like this.""

Samer Majzoub, President of the Canadian Muslim Forum, said he was speechless when he heard what had happened.

""The pain was severe, I tried to hold my dears back, I had my children in front of me,"" he said. ""It's something that's beyond horrible and terrible to see, such atrocity being again and again performed against peaceful people in a mosque, for no other reason than their faith.""

Majzoub said he feared that such an attack could again happen in Quebec, calling the current atmosphere for Muslims ""toxic.""

""It's been escalating recently, since the last elections,"" he said. ""The normalization of hate that is coming from the top, through the media and social media, it will certainly lead to terrorim the way we've seen in Quebec and we saw yesterday. Again and again we express our voices very loudly to say we are all concerned. I don't think it's just the Muslim community that's concerned, I believe it should be the whole society in Quebec and Canada to share this kind of grievances and concerns.""

Dorval Mosque Imam Mehmet Deger said he believes the vast majority of people are horrified by the attacks but that the few who carry them out ""get all the traction.""

""It's very sad what happened in Quebec, but 0.001 per cent of the population is doing these acts. The majority of people are very nice people in Quebec or New Zealand, but some minorities like this get all the traction and they want this massacre to go on all over the world. They videotape it and broadcast it to the whole world. This is very sad.""

Bissonnette issues statement

In a statement released through his lawyers, Bissonnette said he was ""troubled"" to have his name connected with the attack.

""Mr. Bissonnette does not seek at any time to be imitated or to serve as a model for anyone who wishes to perpetrate an act of violence or would like to follow in his footsteps,"" read the statement. ""Mr. Bissonnette deeply regrets the actions he committed and wants everyone with problems or difficulties to talk about it and seek help, something he had not been able to adequately do. There is no justification for committing such acts of violence against others.""

On Feb. 8, Bissonnette was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years. Both the Crown and Bissonnette's defence team have announced plans to appeal the sentence.

“I am somehow saddened by the demographic replacement of white peoples in their homelands,” Caylan Ford is reported to have written in private Facebook messages. “It’s clear that it will not be a peaceful transition.”

The messages are the focus of an exposé published late Monday by PressProgress.

The myth that white people face “replacement” by immigrants is a favourite talking point among white nationalists. “The Great Replacement” was the title of the screed published by the perpetrator of the recent massacre of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand.

This is not the first time the UCP has been linked to white nationalists and other xenophobic extremists.

Ford, who was running in the Calgary-Mountain View riding, also worried that without “Western peoples,” Western culture would die out.

And she expressed concern that anyone who shared some of the views held by white supremacists was “painted with the same brush,” according to PressProgress.

“You just don’t have the same attempts to separate the violent terrorists from the wider community of belief,” she said.

A star recruit

According to the National Post, Kenney persuaded Ford to run after she corrected his misquote of Edmund Burke at an event. The UCP leader called it “political love at first sight.”

On paper, Ford looked like a star recruit for the UCP, especially as the party faced criticism about its lack of gender balance.

She has a master’s degree in international human rights law from Oxford University and graduated with distinction, according to her UCP candidate webpage.

“Wherever possible, she has sought to integrate her work with an interest in promoting human freedom and dignity around the world,” it says, explaining that she has worked as a senior policy advisor with Global Affairs Canada and represented Canada at the United Nations and the G7.

In an interview with the Calgary Herald last October, Ford acknowledged the intense scrutiny that she would be subject to as a candidate.

But “if good, normal, decent people don’t step forward then you are just ceding that ground to those who seek power for its own sake,” she said.

Not the first time

The Alberta Liberal Party, which currently holds the seat in the Calgary-Mountain View riding, issued a statement late Monday calling for Ford’s removal as a candidate.

“Caylan Ford’s comments are abhorrent. Her support of white supremacist values will sicken decent people across this province. These are not the values of Albertans. These are not the values of the people in Calgary-Mountain View. She is not fit to run as an MLA. UCP Leader Jason Kenney should remove her immediately as his candidate,” Liberal leader David Khan said in a press release.

This is not the first time the UCP has been linked to white nationalists and other xenophobic extremists.

Last fall, a Ricochet investigation exposed links between the far right and the UCP, including an individual named Adam Strashok, who ran the call centre for Kenney’s UCP leadership campaign. Strashok was expelled from the party, and Kenney vowed to screen new members for extreme views, stating, “I reject unequivocally the voices of hatred and bigotry.”

Ford resigns

Late Monday night Ford announced she was resigning as a candidate in order to “avoid becoming a distraction in this campaign.”

In a statement posted to her campaign Facebook page, she claimed the comments attributed to her by PressProgress are “distortions and are not reflective of my views.”

“In the aftermath of the recent massacre targeting the Muslim community in Christchurch, there is no room for equivocation: I strongly denounce extremism, violence, and stand with marginalized communities everywhere,” she said.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims welcomed the news and praised the UCP for taking action.

The NCCM welcomes Caylan Ford's resignation as @Alberta_UCP's candidate for Calgary-Mountain View.

104,Politics,2019-03-19T01:52:00.0000000Z,"“If Trudeau had been a Conservative, I suspect Michael Wernick ... governments of whatever political stripe … An opposition party has to feel like, ‘If we took over tomorrow, we could ...","It’s time to talk about the clerk of the Privy Council. Not Michael Wernick in particular, though it’s his Monday resignation and the events that led up to it that make the subject particularly timely, according to one expert.

What ought to happen now, said leading public administration scholar Donald Savoie, is a debate about what the role of the clerk should look like. Not only is the clerk the head of the federal public service. He or she is also secretary to the cabinet, and deputy minister to the prime minister.

“I think what we’ve seen since 1992 is clerks walking around with three hats,” said Savoie. “And I think the role of the clerk has been tilted in more recent years to that of deputy minister to the prime minister. Not in a politically partisan way, but in a partisan way of favouring the position of prime minister, and I think that’s the issue.”

Thus, Savoie explained, you get a situation such as the SNC-Lavalin Affair.

The director of public prosecutions, “a career public servant,” decides against pursuing a deferred prosecution agreement for embattled Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Rather than supporting the director’s decision, as Savoie believes Wernick should have done, the clerk and officials from the prime minister’s office repeatedly raised the potentially negative consequences of this course of action with then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.

“The head of the public service represents the values and the views of the public service and I think it’s incumbent upon the clerk to tell the prime minister what he ought to do for the good of the country, what he ought to do for the good of criminal justice, the rule of law, for the economy,” said Savoie. As he sees it, Wernick did not fulfil this responsibility, though he notes his belief that the clerk was not driven by political partisanship to his self-described “lawful advocacy” in support of a DPA.

“If Trudeau had been a Conservative, I suspect Michael Wernick would have done the same thing.”

What the clerk appeared to influenced by, according to Savoie, was the third hat — “the hat that says you’re deputy minster to the prime minister, and … go around and fix things for the prime minister.”

This, then, appears a particularly appropriate time to have a conversation about the clerk’s tripartite roles, he said.

Karl Salgo, executive director of public governance and institutions at the Institute on Governance, also noted that Wernick’s decision to resign underscores the significance of his position’s retaining political neutrality.

“When the clerk becomes the subject of partisan controversy, it makes it very challenging for him to serve in his role,” Salgo explained. Rather than an admission of wrongdoing or partisanship, the resignation was the logical consequence of a breakdown in trust between the leader of the non-partisan public service and the opposition parties who may end up having to work with the clerk during a transition to government following the fall election, said Salgo.

“The idea of a politically-neutral public service is that you have to be able to serve successive governments of whatever political stripe … An opposition party has to feel like, ‘If we took over tomorrow, we could be credibly served by the public service because it doesn’t have partisan sentiments.’ Once there’s that kind of accusatory environment where mutual trust and respect is lost, those circumstances … have been compromised.”

Chris Aylward, the Public Service Alliance of Canada’s national president, said it’s up to Canadians to decide whether Wernick’s role in the SNC-Lavalin affair has tarnished the reputation of the federal public service as professional and non-partisan.

“I watched it, and I don’t think so,” said Aylward. Wernick has had a long public service career, he noted, “and I think if he feels it’s time to retire, then I wish him all the best.”

What Aylward did mention, however, was a past clash between the union and the clerk over then-auditor general Michael Ferguson’s characterization last summer that the public service was suffering from a broken culture, laid bare by the Phoenix pay system disaster. The clerk vehemently rejected the AG’s position, and PSAC, “totally disagreed with the clerk on that issue,” said Aylward.

“I’m hopeful that the replacement, the new clerk will understand that his role as the top public servant in the country is to make sure that the public service is served well by the government.”

Savoie, for his part, was enthusiastic about the prime minster’s replacement for Wernick — deputy minister of foreign affairs Ian Shugart. “He’s a career public servant. Stays away from politics. I’ve only heard good things about him,” Savoie said.

His appointment will serve as a signal to bureaucrats “that the government values the professional, non-partisan public service — because Ian represents precisely those values.”

""Significant issues have been raised recently about relations between the former attorney general and justice minister and government. And I am announcing today that Anne McLellan will be appointed to investigate independently,"" Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday. ""As former justice minister and attorney general and deputy PM, she has a unique understanding of the role.""

Trudeau said that McLellan will act as a special adviser, examining whether the cabinet roles of justice minister and attorney general — which are occupied by the same person in Canada — should be reformed in the wake of allegations of political interference in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

McLellan will report her findings to the prime minister and provide recommendations by June 30.

""She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,"" Trudeau said in a statement.

The prime minister first said he intended to appoint someone to look into the dual role on March 7.





""I believe that it is timely and appropriate to examine these questions. I look forward to providing my advice to the prime minister,"" McLellan said in a statement.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general of Canada, told a Commons committee last month that she felt she was improperly pressured by 11 officials in the Prime Minister's Office to allow Quebec-based engineering company SNC-Lavalin avoid bribery and corruption charges providing it met a number of conditions in a potential remediation agreement.

Wilson-Raybould did not allow the firm to enter into such an agreement, but the ensuing political controversy has raised questions about whether it's time to consider dividing her former role into two separate positions — to keep the attorney general free of political pressure.

'It's not that hard'

McLellan, who held the post of justice minister and attorney general from 1997 to 2002 under then-prime minister Jean Chrétien, told CBC earlier this month that she backs the idea of looking at splitting the current role. She also argued that when she served in the post, its dual nature made for better policy.

She said she was often pushed hard to lean toward certain decisions, but that she enjoyed those debates. She said it made for better legislation — but only because everyone knew where the ""red lines"" were.

""It sounds complex, but actually day in, day out, it's not that hard, as long as everybody knows what their roles are. PMO, clerk, colleagues, everybody knows what their role is.""

While McLellan said she supports a study of the dual role, she added that it should wait until after the political tensions surrounding the SNC-Lavalin affair have died down.





The Conservatives were quick to criticize the appointment, noting that McLellan, despite her political experience in the role, is an active member of the Liberal Party who has engaged in party fundraising efforts.

According to the Liberal Party, McLellan, will now no longer host a planned March 31 fundraising event to help female Liberal candidates run federally.

""Well, there you have it, Mr. Speaker. Liberals will investigate Liberals to get to the bottom of this. Former Liberal cabinet minister Anne Mclellan. Maybe Sheila Copps wasn't available,"" Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in the Commons today.

Remaining connected

Last month she said that, even if the roles are split, future attorneys general would have to somehow remain plugged in to the political context of decision-making.

""I don't believe that the attorney general should be isolated from the concerns, the anxieties, the fears, the aspirations of their colleagues,"" she said. ""And when I say colleagues, I mean ministerial, caucus colleagues and opposition colleagues.

""The attorney general cannot be divorced in making decisions around invoking sections of the anti-terrorism or other legislation, cannot be divorced by what is happening in various communities in our country, their fears, their aspirations, how they feel if a prosecution is commenced and a certain sentence is sought.""","Trudeau appoints Anne McLellan to advise PMO on the role of justice minister, attorney general in cabinet",Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trudeau-appoints-anne-mclellan-advise-193835321.html

Moe said all members of his government ...,"Question period turned personal on Monday during a debate about cabinet ministers attending yellow vest rallies.

It was likely the first time the arrest history of two party leaders was ever raised in a debate in the same question period.

NDP Leader Ryan Meili said there was a ""dark link"" between the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand which left 50 people dead and views shared by some in the yellow vest movement. Specifically, an opposition to the UN migration compact.

""The shooter used terminology, on his rifle he'd written 'here's your UN migration compact',"" Meili said.

The pact outlines objectives for treating global migrants humanely and efficiently.

Meili asked Premier Scott Moe for his position on the migration pact. The Minister of Energy Bronwyn Eyre turned the debate towards Meili's history as a protester himself.

""That day back in 2001, he [Meili] joined forces with the Sierra Club, the International Socialists Union. None other than Cuban dictator Fidel Castro sent a special note of support to the protesters,"" Eyre said.

""You can be sure that if Facebook existed back then there would be some pretty far out posts.""

Eyre said Meili presents everyone who has attended a pro-oil rally ""as a racist.""

Meili countered by raising the drinking and driving arrests of government MLAs, including the premier. Moe was convicted of drunk driving in 1992.

""I will happily stand up for having been arrested for standing up for my convictions rather than having been convicted for not being able to stand and trying to drive.""

Meili said he was protesting at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City over concerns of climate change and clean water. He spent one day in jail.

""We're getting far too personal. It's got no business in this chamber,"" said Speaker Mark Docherty.

Premier condemns Islamophobia, Meili denounces yellow vest movement

Before the personal attacks, Meili asked Moe if he still supported his caucus attending rallies ""with even the loosest association with any form of hate speech.""

Meili said the yellow vest movement in Canada has promoted an anti-immigration message at rallies and online.

CBC More

Moe said all members of his government ""condemn any violence against any community in this province or abroad no matter their faith or creed. We also condemn any form of Islamophobia.""

Earlier this year, the Minister of Rural and Remote Health Greg Ottenbreit attended a yellow vest rally in his constituency in Yorkton. Minister of Highways Lori Carr attended a similar rally in her constituency of Estevan.





Moe said both were hearing their constituent's concerns about the energy industry.

Moe and Meili took questions from reporters following the heated debate.

On the yellow vest movement Moe said, ""we should not paint all of these people with the same brush.""

He said at the rallies his cabinet ministers attended people were concerned about their jobs in the energy industry.

Moe also defended the government's record on immigration. He said 108,000 immigrants from 190 countries have moved to Saskatchewan over the last decade.

Moe said he had not visited Facebook to read comments or posts by people supporting the terrorist attack in New Zealand.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Wernick ...","Canada’s top civil servant to quit as scandal’s toll on Trudeau mounts

OTTAWA: The head of Canada’s federal bureaucracy said on Monday he was quitting over his role in handling a corporate corruption case, dealing another blow to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he battles the biggest political crisis of his tenure.

Polls suggest that Trudeau’s Liberals — who a few months ago looked certain to be re-elected in October — are now at risk of losing power to the official opposition Conservatives.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. avoided a corruption trial.

Top civil servant Michael Wernick told Trudeau he would be retiring in the coming weeks because opposition leaders had lost confidence in him over the scandal. Two high-profile women cabinet ministers and Trudeau’s closest personal aide had already quit over SNC-Lavalin before Monday’s resignation.

Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, is supposed to be non-partisan, like the rest of the federal bureaucracy. But his strong defense of government officials over the SNC-Lavalin affair and his insistence that no one had done anything wrong triggered widespread criticism from opposition legislators that he was siding with the Liberals.

“It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the opposition parties,” said Wernick, who was appointed by Trudeau in early 2016.

Clerks have traditionally had an exceptionally close relationship with prime ministers, and the two tended to talk every day. Wernick’s departure leaves Trudeau needing to fill one of the top jobs in Ottawa just months ahead of the election.

Trudeau spokesman Matt Pascuzzo said the prime minister had not asked Wernick to go.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last month that Wernick had put intense pressure on her to help SNC-Lavalin avoid prosecution over allegations it bribed Libyan officials.

The scandal is the most serious faced by the 47-year-old Trudeau since he led the Liberals out of the political wilderness and into power in 2015 on a promise to do politics differently.

The Conservatives, the largest opposition party in parliament, and the left-leaning New Democrats accuse Trudeau of old-style backroom deals and trying to cover up what happened.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Wernick had resigned “in disgrace” and repeated his calls for a full public inquiry, an idea that Trudeau has already ruled out.

“This is like a five-alarm dumpster fire of political cronyism, incompetence and now obstruction. What is the prime minister so afraid of?” New Democrat legislator Charlie Angus said in the House of Commons.

Earlier this month, Trudeau denied he or his officials had interfered in the judicial system, and he offered no apology.

In a surprise move, Trudeau on Monday named Joyce Murray, a 64-year-old Liberal backbencher with no federal cabinet experience, as president of the Treasury Board, where she will be in overall charge of government spending.

Murray replaces Jane Philpott, who quit on March 4 in protest over how the government was handling the crisis.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted in January, resigned from Trudeau’s Cabinet the next month.

SNC-Lavalin is accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011. The firm had strongly lobbied in favor of a deferred prosecution agreement, or out-of-court settlement, instead of going to trial.

But the former Ukip leader may have to apply ...,"Margaret Thatcher personally supported one of her MPs who had an alleged “penchant for small boys”, MI5 files disclosed to a public inquiry reveal.

An MI5 lawyer told the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) it was “a matter of regret” that the service considered only the national security implications of allegations of possible child abuse by Peter Morrison, Conservative MP for Chester, and did not pass information to the police.

The witness, who gave evidence anonymously, admitted that memos and a letter from 1986 had discussed claims that Morrison had a “penchant for small boys”.

They added there was nothing to indicate MI5 passed the information in its possession to police.

The inquiry heard that two 1986 memos were written by Eliza Manningham-Buller, who went on to be the director general of MI5 between 2002 and 2007.

Former Liberal leader David Steel admitted he nominated depraved Cyril Smith for a ­knighthood eight years after he confessed to ­sexually abusing children.

The peer said under oath on Wednesday that he had asked Smith in 1979 about claims he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel in the 1960s, while a Labour councillor.

While Steel did not dispute Smith had confessed to abusing boys in the 1960s, he said he did not believe he was still offending when they spoke.

He told the IICSA that he came away from the conversation with Smith “assuming” he had committed the offences because he did not deny them.

Lord Steel said, “He accepted the story was correct. Obviously I disapproved but as far as I was concerned it was past history.”

In 1988, Lord Steel nominated Smith for a knighthood, something he has since said he was “perfectly happy” to do. But giving evidence, he denied “hiding his head in the sand” over the abuse.

In a June 2018 appearance on BBC’s Newsnight programme, Steel described child sex abuse allegations against Smith as ‘tittle-tattle’ and ‘scurrilous hearsay’.

The inquiry was also told about MI5’s investigation into Peter Hayman.

Hayman was high up in MI6. He became high commissioner to Canada and was knighted in Britain.

He kept detailed diaries about his sex life which were seized when his London flat was raided. The director of public prosecutions later granted MI5 access to them.

The security service subsequently interviewed Hayman. The DPP, Hayman told MI5, had given him immunity from prosecution.

Essex cops are guilty of failing victims of abuse

Two police officers who scuppered child abuse investigations have been found guilty of misconduct in a public office.

Essex Police detective constable Lee Pollard was convicted of two counts while his partner detective constable Sharon Patterson was found guilty of one count.

Patterson was found not guilty of one count and the Old Bailey jury was unable to reach verdicts in a further charge against each.

They will be sentenced on 3 May. Thirty officers, some now retired, were investigated and 296 Essex child abuse cases looked at, of which 55 were referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

The defendants were the only ones to face criminal charges, but a third officer was sacked last year.

Five officers resigned or retired when the investigation began and two officers who were found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct left the force before action was taken against them.

Baby formula firms doing deals with NHS

A third of NHS health boards have broken guidelines by accepting payments or sponsorship from baby formula companies.

The marketing of infant formula is regulated to try to halt falling rates of breastfeeding.

Companies are not allowed to advertise or promote formula designed for infants under the age of six months.

The World Health Organisation code of practice says no medical organisation or doctor should accept payments from formula firms.

But 59 out of 195 clinical commissioning groups in England have recorded at least one breach of the WHO code since 2014, an investigation by Channel4’s Dispatches showed.

In Wales, five out of the seven local health boards recorded a breach.

Companies use their specialised formulas such as products for children with allergies to create links with doctors for their normal baby formula products.

Moriarty—who had previously been warned twice about his inappropriate language—added, “Just because Isis try to bomb us back to the dark ages, it doesn’t change anything.

“It’s a woman’s choice and don’t feel guilty.”

All but one of those MPs did not vote to take the catastrophic scenario ...,"JOHN Maclean has featured prominently in the National with various articles highlighting his achievements.

However, there has been little mention of his role in exposing an adulterated meat racket here in Scotland.

Maclean had read Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle, with its graphic account of conditions in the tinned beef factories of Chicago.

But he had heard of a scandal closer to home – in Greenock!

There was a slaughterhouse there on Crown Street. It was owned by the town council and managed by a committee.

Prior to April 1907, the committee employed a Mr Ballantine to inspect all the carcasses taken out of the premises. However, he often let out diseased ones. Indeed, diseased entrails were sent on to Glasgow in bags labelled “tripe”.

The council did nothing. Bailie Andrew, convener of the Slaughterhouse Committee, only visited the premises six or seven times during his long period in office.

Maclean points out, so lax were inspection methods, that in time Greenock became a dumping ground for “old, dead and dying cows within a radius of 20 miles”.

Maclean was so appalled by what he had heard that he wrote a pamphlet, The Greenock Jungle, exposing the slaughterhouse practices and the trade in diseased meats.

In the pamphlet, first published in 1907, Maclean also condemned the treatment meted out to a whistleblower, a Mr Houston, who had been forced out of work and blacklisted after talking about what he had seen in the slaughterhouse. Maclean appealed to the people of Greenock to help find Mr Houston alternative employment.

And Maclean’s pamphlet did actually result in positive changes, including the appointment of a new government inspector!

I AM in complete agreement with George M Mitchell’s letter (March 14) praising Ian Blackford. In doing so, I would point out that I am not a member of the SNP, never have been and never will be. I am a socialist (of sorts) and have spent my entire adult life detesting the lousy, rotten capitalist system, and will continue to do so.

Yes, Ian Blackford and his equally excellent comrades have certainly fought Scotland’s corner with a tenacity and a patriotic passion that compels me to applaud and greatly appreciate their endeavours on our nation’s behalf.

I READ with interest recent letters regarding the viability of Scotland revoking the 1707 Treaty of Union and wondered if perhaps the judgment of Lord Cooper in the 1953 case of MacCormick v Lord Advocate may be worth taking into account.

I am no expert, but it seems to me that the Lord President expressed a lawful opinion that while the Union effectively extinguished the parliaments of Scotland and England and replaced them with a United Kingdom Parliament, there was no reason why this parliament should have followed the English template rather than the Scottish model. I believe this to be a clear and legal indication that both parties to the Union are to be equally respected.

Furthermore, he noted that the concept of unlimited parliamentary sovereignty was”distinctively English and lacking a Scottish counterpart”. In my view, this is a rich endorsement of the continuing of sovereignty of Scottish people. With this in mind, surely any democratic event resulting in a majority vote by the Scottish people for re-establishing our independence would be sufficient grounds for revoking the Union.

AFTER her second trouncing on the withdrawal agreement, the sound bites about the “will of the British people must be delivered” are being repeated ad nauseam by the government, sections of the media and others.

But the will of the “British” people is now harder to divine! At the referendum, Scots and Northern Irish voted to remain, despite the DUP and its red lines written in “blood”. England and Wales voted to leave and in Gibraltar about 97% voted to remain!

The returns from recent polls show overall that a majority in the country could now support remaining. Shifting times, indeed.

The British state is coming apart, diverging as old ideas and old myths disappear from consciousness. A generational shift is also under way and no doubt this will accelerate when the present deference to Windsorian dynasty recedes as its long-standing figurehead gives way to the next heir apparent.

The chaos witnessed in the UK Parliament can only reinforce the structural decay and endemic paralysis there. It goes beyond the current UK Government – the official opposition is split and its leader Jeremy Corbyn is bumbling at times.

As the boasts and wildcat promises from the Brexiteers have turned out to be chimeras, the UK body politic as represented by the Anglo-duopoly and LibDems is fossilised beyond repair!

Rule Britannia ... that squeak from a distant Empire when it was then in the early stages of terminal decline, which the likes of Boris Johnson tried to reignite with his faux panacea of Global Britain, cannot even rule itself from within, and the world looks on!

I THINK most people would agree that carers fulfill an important role in our society, looking after those who need additional support. It is good news that the Scottish Government plans to increase the carers’ allowance by around £460 per year. What is disappointing was that one party voted against this increase – and surprisingly it wasn’t the Tories this time!

Twenty Labour MSPs – including Renfrewshire-based Neil Bibby and Mary Fee – decided that carers shouldn’t get an increase in their allowance. When even the Tories provide more support to carers than Labour MSPs then you know that the Labour Party is heading for oblivion.

Lately, Neil Bibby MSP has been demanding that the Scottish Government spend millions of pounds on a dodgy tram train link to Glasgow Airport, yet he doesn’t offer a single penny extra to carers – we know where his priorities lie!

WHAT a spectacular own goal Jackson Carlaw MSP scored at First Minister’s Questions, while the record of his Scottish Conservative MPs at Westminster was ringing in our ears.

All but one of those MPs did not vote to take the catastrophic scenario of a no-deal Brexit off the table, and even worse, the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell abstained, yet he remains in the Cabinet, clearly demonstrating the authority of government no longer exists!

Mr Carlaw should have come to Holyrood and apologised to the people of Scotland for the complete meltdown of parliamentary democracy at Westminster and for a Prime Minister who has lost all authority.

IT was probably predictable to note that the United States dropped the term “occupation” from the occupied Palestinian territories and the Syrian Golan Heights on Wednesday.

The US decision to drop the status of occupation from the Palestinian territories and the Syrian Golan Heights is a continuation of the hostile approach of the American administration toward the Palestinian people and is contrary to all UN resolutions. These American titles will not change the fact that the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 and the occupied Arab Golan are territories under Israeli occupation in accordance with UN resolutions and international law. This last decision falls within the American scheme to pass the so-called “Deal of the Century” to liquidate the Palestinian cause. But regardless of the attempts and conspiracies, the Palestinian people will remain steadfast and adhere to their rights until they reach an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

The US dropped from its annual report on the human rights situation any reference to the Palestinian territories or the Syrian Golan Heights as “occupied territories” as it used to be mentioned in former reports. The Palestinian Authority has been boycotting the US administration since December 2017 when US President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and then moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May 2018.

The US Trump administration’s undeniable support for its fellow right-wing Israeli government has prompted the Palestinians to cut communication with the US and declared it unfit to be a mediator during the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Just another example of the complete wretchedness of the Trump administration.

IT is generally agreed that Brexit is not going to be good for Scotland and a no-deal Brexit would be a catastrophe.

Our high-quality food producers would be severely disadvantaged by cheap imports from countries with low animal welfare standards and GM crops, etc.

Loss of EU workers will create great problems for the food and tourism sectors and the health service.

On BBC Radio Scotland last week, with the topic of a delay to the Brexit deadline, Steven Jardine had an interview with Tim Martin aka Mr Wetherspoon.

Mr Martin is very pro-Brexit. He is totally behind immigration control. He enthused over trade deals with countries such as Canada, New Zealand and America. (Omitting that we already trade with them as a member state of the EU.) Unlike interviews with Scottish independence supporters, Mr Martin was allowed to express his views almost totally uninterrupted.

I would have loved Mr Jardine to have asked Mr Martin if, after Brexit, he was to offer a minimum wage of £30,000 to his employees – to fulfil immigration requirements when he has a shortfall in staffing his premises.

Also, importantly, what his thoughts were regarding chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef.

Mr Martin has promised to reduce the price of beer if there is a no-deal Brexit.

No doubt the beer will be drunk to wash down the Hormone Beef Burger or Chlorinated Chicken Tikka Masala.

(Not quite “let them eat cake”, which is probably too European to be appropriate, but along the same line of thought.)

113,World,2019-03-17T20:57:00.0000000Z,A new Gallup poll found “liberal Democrats ... of Turning Point USA urge blacks to divorce themselves from the Democratic Party. She calls this movement “Blexit.” Can we expect a similar ...,"Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., denies that anti-Semitism is “on the rise” within the Democratic Party.

He’s right.

This is not a recent phenomenon. Anti-Semitism within the Democratic Party has been on the rise for some time.

Democrats failed to pass a resolution specifically condemning freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a Muslim and naturalized citizen from Somalia, who recently made several comments considered anti-Semitic. She tweeted that American politicians support Israel because “it’s all about the Benjamins,” meaning Jews essentially offer bribes for political support.

She accused politicians who support Israel of dual loyalty. In 2012, she tweeted, “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”

Following the “Benjamins” tweet, the Anti-Defamation League’s national director and CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, issued the following statement: “As Americans and Jews, we expect our politicians to condemn bigotry, not to fuel it. Words matter. At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise in the U.S. and abroad, Rep. Omar is promoting the ugly, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews have an outsized influence over politics. The notion that wealthy Jews are controlling the government is a longstanding anti-Semitic trope and one of the pillars of modern anti-Semitism, a retread of ideas spread by bigots from David Duke to Louis Farrakhan.”

Omar, fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., are the only members of Congress to publicly support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which “works to end international support for Israel’s oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law.”

Criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism are, of course, not necessarily the same thing. But Omar pushes a stereotype that Jews have a dark, even sinister effect on the political process.

Jewish bigotry from black liberals — and Omar is black — has long been an unspoken problem among Democrats.

According to an annual survey commissioned by the ADL, their latest 2017 report found that blacks, who vote 90% for Democrats, were 2.3 times more likely than whites to be anti-Semitic. By contrast, polls show that Jews, among various demographic groups, are the least likely to be racist against blacks.

Consider: Rev. Jesse Jackson, when running for president in 1984, referred to Jews as “Hymie” and New York City as “Hymietown.”

Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, who once posed with then-Sen. Barack Obama in a photograph (helpfully not released until after President Obama left office), called Judaism a “gutter religion,” praised Hitler as “a great man” and recently said: “When they call me an anti-Semite — stop it. I’m anti-termite.”

Rev. Al Sharpton, whose endorsement is being sought by 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, referred to Jews as “diamond merchants” and helped fuel a 1991 riot between blacks and Jews in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn.

Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., a critic of American support of Israel, served two stints in Congress, from 1997 to 2003 and then from 2005 to 2007. Her father, a state representative for Atlanta, was asked on television, days before his daughter was defeated in a 2002 primary, why she faced such intense opposition. He said: “That ain’t nothing. Jews have bought everybody. Jews. J. E. W. S.”

Even Jews who do not support many Israeli policies nevertheless support the state of Israel.

A recent poll by the Jewish Electorate Institute found 92% of American Jews are “generally pro-Israel,” even as 59% say they are comfortable supporting Israel and also criticizing its government. But support for Israel is down among Democrats, particularly young Democrats.

A new Gallup poll found “liberal Democrats are only party/ideology group not partial to Israel” in the Mideast conflict. Young liberal Democrats are about as likely to support the Palestinians as they are Israel, with black support for Israel even lower.

A recent Economist/YouGov poll that asked whether Israel is an American “ally” found that only 19% of blacks and 22% of Hispanics agreed.

Young blacks like Candace Owens of Turning Point USA urge blacks to divorce themselves from the Democratic Party. She calls this movement “Blexit.”

Can we expect a similar movement in which Jewish voters reconsider their traditional 70% support for the Democratic Party?

Some call it Jexodus.

Eight New Mexico Democrats crossed party lines Thursday to sink a bill aimed at codifying the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, handing a win to the pro-life movement and a stinging defeat to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on one of her signature issues.

The New Mexico Senate voted 24-18 against H.B. 51, a month after the House approved the measure by a vote of 40-29. Six House Democrats voted against it.

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, called the outcome “a stunning victory for pro-lifers,” and praised Democrats who “dealt one of the most significant blows of the year to the extreme abortion camp.”

“New Mexico’s bill was supposed to be a slam dunk. But after New York, nothing on abortion is a sure thing — not anymore,” said Mr. Perkins in a Friday post.

New Mexico Democrats had viewed 2018 as the year to expand abortion rights after a November election sweep that saw them pick up seats in the legislature and replace term-limited Republican Gov. Susana Martinez with the Democrat Grisham.

The pro-choice legislation was billed as nothing more than a repeal of a dormant 1969 law making it a felony to perform abortions except in certain cases, which supporters said could become enforceable if President Trump’s judicial picks overturn Roe.

Foes saw the measure as far more radical, threatening to remove the state’s conscience protection for medical professionals who object to performing or participating in abortions, and enshrining into law the state’s no-limits status quo.

New Mexico Alliance for Life executive director Elisa Martinez characterized H.B. 51 as “the most extreme abortion up to birth bill in the country.”

Still, the measure was expected to coast to victory until the events in New York and Virginia. A New York bill clearing the path for late-term abortion was signed in January as supporters cheered, a widely publicized scene decried as ghoulish.

The Virginia legislation was derailed after the sponsor admitted that it would allow abortion during labor. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, a former pediatric surgeon, inflamed the outcry by appearing to suggest afterward that babies who survived abortions could be left to die.

“Quite frankly, I think the backlash has been tremendous,” said Ms. Martinez. “I think this has awakened a sleeping giant in the wake of the Virginia and New York abortion bills. Finally, it’s shedding light on what’s going on here in New Mexico.”

One of the Democrats who voted against the New Mexico bill, state Sen. Gabriel Ramos, said it was “one of the toughest decisions any of us will ever have to make.”

In the end, however, “I stand unified against legislation that weakens the defense of life and threatens the dignity of the human being,” said Mr. Ramos in the Albuquerque Journal.

Ms. Grisham was stunned by the bill’s defeat. “Health care decisions are the sole province of an individual, her family, her doctor and her faith. Fear of the law has no place in the equation,” she said in a statement after the Senate vote.

“This old, outdated statute criminalizing health care providers is an embarrassment,” the governor continued. “That removing it was even a debate, much less a difficult vote for some senators, is inexplicable to me.”

Well done, New Mexico.

Planned Parenthood Votes New Mexico called the defeat “heartbreaking,” but pledged “to keep fighting, because we know that New Mexicans overwhelmingly support access to safe and legal abortion care across the state.”

In addition to Mr. Ramos, the eight Senate Democrats who voted against H.B. 51 are state Sens. Pete Campos, Carlos Cisneros, Richard Martinez, George Munoz, Mary Kay Papen, Clemente Sanchez, and John Arthur Smith.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, praised “the eight courageous Democrats who stood up to party leaders both in New Mexico and across the nation.”

“We rejoice with the people of New Mexico for this decisive pro-life victory,” said Ms. Dannenfelser. “The modern Democratic Party’s agenda of abortion on demand through the moment of birth and even beyond is deeply unpopular with the majority of Americans, including rank and file Democrats.”

Other bills aimed at codifying the Roe decision are pending in Illinois, Rhode Island and Vermont.

National leaders, NGOs and others discussed, among other things, how to create more “sustainable patterns of consumption and production.” What really struck me in Nairobi, though, was what wasn’t discussed: the Green New Deal being pushed by Democratic Party politicians in the U.S.

This is surprising, in a way: It was the United Nations Environment Programme that first called for a “Global Green New Deal” in 2009, hoping to revive the world economy through investment in climate change-related sectors.

That extra word, “global,” suggests why international players today aren’t terribly enthused by the Democrats’ plan. The program -- or what little of it can be adduced from what’s now largely a slogan -- is focused entirely on green investment in the U.S. The basic notion that climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution seems to have been forgotten.

Don’t get me wrong: De-carbonizing the U.S. economy would be a big deal. A lot of good work can be and is being done. The Beyond Coal campaign supported by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News) has already helped shut down 285 of the country’s 500-plus coal-fired power plants and is aiming to close the rest by 2030. And getting climate change back onto the political agenda is important in and of itself. Nor should Republicans be allowed to use concerns about the growth of emissions in the developing world to stymie work on carbon mitigation at home.

Yet, fawning coverage of the Green New Deal rubs many in the developing world the wrong way. We’ve long known that an economy transitioning to a low-carbon growth path will both require investment and create jobs. But, the New Deal of the 1930s is simply not the right analogy. Then, economies across the world had enormous amounts of unused capacity that just needed to be put to work.

By contrast, a global low-carbon transition will require laying claim to resources that are productively employed in carbon-intensive sectors of the economy. It will be expensive. It will require sacrifice. And resources will need to flow more freely across national borders.

The New Deal framing and rhetoric is merely an extension of what the left of the Democratic Party has long argued about multiple other policy issues -- that special interests beholden to the one percent are holding back changes that would benefit all. This may well be true and the answer may indeed be greater and fairer redistribution. The original New Deal argued correctly that redistribution of resources would spur growth under the specific conditions of the Depression.

But, that hardly means that something similar is possible today -- that simply redistributing resources within the U.S. economy, through a program managed by the U.S. government, would be sufficient to address climate change as well as create general prosperity. Someone needs to remind the Democrats that when it comes to global problems such as climate change, much of the U.S. is itself the one percent. (In 2012, economist Branko Milanovic estimated that an average income of over $34,000 put you in into the global one percent.)

This group will have to sacrifice something if climate change is to be stopped. The truth is that the resources that Democrats want the U.S. government to appropriate and use domestically need instead to flow elsewhere in the world. That valuable finance and capacity is needed to help the developing world pay for cities that don’t stress the planet, to protect those who are losing livelihoods and homes because of climate change, and to ensure that everyone in the world has access to reliable, affordable and clean energy.

The good news is that much of this financing can actually pay for itself in the long run. Since Americans seem addicted to mid-century references, what we need isn’t a Green New Deal, but a Green Marshall Plan.

Meanwhile, the global one percent will have to adjust its expectations. Yes, people in America will have to eat fewer hamburgers. Yes, people in France and elsewhere will have to pay more for their petrol. Politicians who do not frankly tell the truth about the sacrifices these changes entail, about what will be lost and not just what will be gained, are no better than the older generation they loudly disdain.

1 of 2 2 of 2

One of the presidential hopefuls in the crowded Democratic Party field is generating some buzz with ideas not normally promoted by mainstream U.S. politicians.

Andrew Yang has made the rise of robots in the workplace a cornerstone of his campaign.

He says that automation has already destroyed more than four million American jobs. And he predicts that millions more will be eliminated in the next five to 10 years.

So in response, he's proposed a 10 percent value-added tax targeting digital giants like Amazon and Google.

""Once I understood the magnitude of this problem, and that even our most forward-thinking politicians were not going to take the steps necessary to stem the tide, I had no choice but to act,"" Yang states on his website. ""I’m the father of two young boys. I know the country my sons will grow up in is going to be very different than the one I grew up in, and I want to look back at my life knowing I did everything in my power to create the kind of future our children deserve—an America of opportunity, freedom, equality, and abundance.""

He told MSNBC that the digital giants won't leave America because other countries have value-added taxes with higher rates than what he's suggested.

Yang has also proposed a universal basic income in response to the rise of automation.

Yang's ""freedom dividend"" would give every American $1,000 per month, free and clear.

You can hear more about this idea in the video below.

Video of Running for president on a universal basic income platform Watch Andrew Yang speak about a universal basic income for all Americans.

Yang was born in upstate New York as the son of Taiwanese immigrants who met in grad school.

After studying economics and law, he worked for a while as a corporate lawyer before becoming an entrepreneur.

He founded Venture for America, which promotes entrepreneurialism in cities facing tough economic times.

Since 2014, the mayor of New York has been the communist Bill de Blasio, who methodically injects socialism into the city.","The final result of this study was the calculation of the burden borne by taxpayers in these American cities. The formula is simple: the financial balance of the city (positive or negative) is divided by the number of inhabitants. The result is a good assessment of how effectively the city authorities work, depending on the positive or negative financial balance of the city per capita.

Recently, non-government organization Truth in Accounting published a report about the financial condition of the 75 largest cities of America. As it turns out, 63 out of 75 cities in America were not able to pay bills at the end of the fiscal year of 2017.

Let us start with the most financially strong cities.

Historically, in the city of Irvine (California), both Democrats and Republicans came to power in City Hall. The last time a Democrat was elected mayor of Irvine was in 2012. In Charlotte, North Carolina, Democratic mayors have been elected since 2009, and before that, Republicans dominated the mayor's office. In the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C., all the mayors of the post-WW2 years have been Democrats. In the city of Lincoln (Nebraska), Democrats and Republicans alternated in power. Fresno (California) closes the top five of the most financially sound cities in America, in which only Republican mayors have been elected since the beginning of the 21st century.

In other words, for many years, at the helm of these cities with a brilliant financial future were fiscal conservatives, who (occasionally) could be found among representatives of the Democratic Party and representatives of the Republican Party. Moreover, those who earned a pension by working for the city have nothing to worry about, either — the pension funds of these cities are in good shape.

If we turn to the cities at the bottom of the list, the picture is quite different.

First, it is easy to see that the negative balance of cities at the bottom of a financial abyss exceeds the positive balance of those cities at the top of financial well-being by an order of magnitude. Secondly, the political preferences of the inhabitants of these cities are quite unambiguous: they prefer almost exclusively Democrats.

For example, in San Francisco (California), the last Republican mayor was elected in 1964, in Honolulu (Hawaii) in 1994, in Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) in 1954, and in Chicago (Illinois) in 1931. In New York, America's city in the most dramatic financial hole, the last real Republican mayor left the office in 2001. Republican Rudy Giuliani was replaced by pseudo-Republican Michael Bloomberg, who eventually left the Republican Party. Since 2014, the mayor of New York has been the communist Bill de Blasio, who methodically injects socialism into the city.

The financial results of the Democrats' reign are such that the financial debt of Chicago and Philadelphia is about 30,000 dollars per resident. New York has fallen into a financial abyss, with more than 60,000 dollars for each resident of the city.

The financial capital of the world is naturally moving toward bankruptcy. By some estimates, this bankruptcy is inevitable. Pensioners of American cities, where Democratic mayors are traditionally elected, should be prepared for the fact that pension funds of such cities will stop paying out at the most unexpected moment. Nobody expects cardinal replenishment of budgets in these cities.

Millionaires, billionaires, and ordinary citizens are leaving such financially disadvantaged cities in droves. With the departure of the rich, jobs leave, too, and with the departure of ordinary citizens, so too departs the skilled workforce. Recently, under pressure from leftists, one of the largest companies in the world, Amazon, had to abandon its plans to relocate to New York City.

It should be noted that in addition to financial collapse, socialists, communists, social democrats, and democratic socialists of New York City chose an additional (and unusual) method of self-extinction and losing political control over the city. As it is known, abortion is allowed in New York City until the very moment of birth. Also, many young people who have gone through schools of political indoctrination (formerly known as ""colleges"" and ""universities"") refuse to have children because of ""fear of the consequences of global warming."" They are not aware of the wise statement of Margaret Thatcher: ""The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.""

What soon will remain in New York City? There will be a dump of a politically correct and ideologically progressive electorate voting strictly for Democrats — without any money.

In a statement Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referenced the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting in which six people were killed, saying “Canada remembers too well the sorrow” of that event.

He said the Canadian government will work closely with that of New Zealand “to take action against violent extremism.”

“To move forward as a world, we need to recognize diversity as a source of strength, and not a threat,” he said. “Last night’s victims were fathers, mothers and children. They were neighbours, friends and family members. As with every life taken too soon, the full measure of their loss will never be known.”

The name of the Quebec City shooter, Alexandre Bissonnette, was found written on equipment used by the Christchurch killer.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called the attack an attack on freedom.

“There are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred,” he said in a tweet. “I am praying for peace for the families of those lost and recovery for those injured.”

“My heart goes out to the families of the murdered and all those impacted by this act of terror,” he said. “Islamophobia kills and has no place anywhere in the world.”

Quebec Premier Francois Legault also referenced the Quebec City mosque shooting, saying he “fully understands” the emotions of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

“There is no room for extremism in our societies; there is no room for intolerance,” he said. “We will not allow violence to take root in our democratic societies.”

Quebec Muslims devastated

Among the Quebec Muslim community, the New Zealand terrorist attack exacerbated wounds that still haven't healed. Boufeldja Benabdallah, head of the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre where Bissonnette carried out his attack, said his thoughts are with the grieving families. He added that members of his own community are in indescribable pain and called for lawmakers to legislate against extremism.

""Imagine the children of those families here in Quebec who are hearing it on the radio and will watch their mothers cry and ask 'Why are you crying?'"" he said. ""The mothers will remember the 29th, when they ran to get husbands who were killed by Alexandre Bissonnette.

""We must get back to work once again to explain, to tell these extremists of all stripes who politicize religion, like extremists who use race as a basis for discrimination, that we must change. The world cannot continue like this.""

Samer Majzoub, President of the Canadian Muslim Forum, said he was speechless when he heard what had happened.

""The pain was severe, I tried to hold my dears back, I had my children in front of me,"" he said. ""It's something that's beyond horrible and terrible to see, such atrocity being again and again performed against peaceful people in a mosque, for no other reason than their faith.""

Majzoub said he feared that such an attack could again happen in Quebec, calling the current atmosphere for Muslims ""toxic.""

""It's been escalating recently, since the last elections,"" he said. ""The normalization of hate that is coming from the top, through the media and social media, it will certainly lead to terrorim the way we've seen in Quebec and we saw yesterday. Again and again we express our voices very loudly to say we are all concerned. I don't think it's just the Muslim community that's concerned, I believe it should be the whole society in Quebec and Canada to share this kind of grievances and concerns.""

Dorval Mosque Imam Mehmet Deger said he believes the vast majority of people are horrified by the attacks but that the few who carry them out ""get all the traction.""

""It's very sad what happened in Quebec, but 0.001 per cent of the population is doing these acts. The majority of people are very nice people in Quebec or New Zealand, but some minorities like this get all the traction and they want this massacre to go on all over the world. They videotape it and broadcast it to the whole world. This is very sad.""

Bissonnette issues statement

In a statement released through his lawyers, Bissonnette said he was ""troubled"" to have his name connected with the attack.

""Mr. Bissonnette does not seek at any time to be imitated or to serve as a model for anyone who wishes to perpetrate an act of violence or would like to follow in his footsteps,"" read the statement. ""Mr. Bissonnette deeply regrets the actions he committed and wants everyone with problems or difficulties to talk about it and seek help, something he had not been able to adequately do. There is no justification for committing such acts of violence against others.""

On Feb. 8, Bissonnette was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years. Both the Crown and Bissonnette's defence team have announced plans to appeal the sentence.

Other resolutions that affected the constitution ...,"Francistown — Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) deputy secretary general, Mr Shaw Kgathi, has appealed to democrats to fight for unity within the party.

With general elections looming, Mr Kgathi said unity would be an important catalyst to victory.

""There is a political penalty that we need to score and I appeal to you to unite"", said Mr Kgathi, adding that the party was bigger than any individual.

Mr Kgathi advised those who lost in the primary elections and appeals to learn to forgive and forget.

He said it was imperative that the BDP must win more seats in the general elections, a feat only possible if they put aside political differences and interests.

He pleaded with democrats not to let the opposition increase its representation in Parliament.

""I am appealing to you not to assist the opposition have more seats in Parliament,"" he added.

He said those who lost in the party's primary elections should support those who won for the sake of the party's progress.

He praised Francistown region for being a model for other regions adding that after the party congress, a strategy would be laid down to strive to win all the five constituencies in the region.

The contituencies are; Francistown West represented by Mr Ignatius Moswaane, Francistown East represented by Mr Buti Billy, Francistown South represented by Mr Modiri Lucas, Tati East by Mr Samson Guma and Tonota by Mr Thapelo Olopeng.

The regional chairperson, Mr Baemedi Medupi, said Francistown West did exceptionally well in the previous general elections, winning all six council wards but later lost Moselewapula after a bye election. Mr Medupi said other constituencies such as Francistown East, Tati East and Tonota also did well even though they lost several council wards to the opposition.

He said there was need to work hard in the Francistown South constituency, which had always been in the hands of opposition.

The region also endorsed President Dr Mokgweetsi Masisi as the party president but did not agree on the resolution that the national executive committee elections be held after the general elections.

The congress also adopted a motion by Mr Moswaane who asked the central committee to give Francistown region a green light to source its own funds in order to build new party offices in Francistown.

Other resolutions that affected the constitution of the BDP were deferred until further notice.

Still smarting from their Wisconsin gubernatorial loss, Scott Walker’s chief publicist/polemicist, Christian Schneider, advanced an Op-Ed last week in the Washington Post in response to the Democratic Party’s Milwaukee placement of their 2020 convention. The Op-Ed reads like an attempt to position Walker for a political comeback. Milwaukee’s convention threatens Walker’s political future, because despite Milwaukee’s failings, many parts of the city are presently thriving. Walker built his political brand attacking Milwaukee’s progressive past and blowing hard into his dog whistle that called racist voters to his side. John Dean, Richard Nixon’s former chief counsel has called Scott Walker “more Nixonian than Nixon.” A humorless man bereft of the vices that make people interesting, Walker only knows and cares about the algebra of power. It is clear his only goal is to recapture political office. Having only barely lost the 2018 gubernatorial contest by 30k votes, he sees his return readily within reach. The Democrats’ convention will counter his narrative of a city taking the rest of the state down that Walker has disgracefully crafted in the past. Thus, last week, in a typical Nixonian move, Schneider was given the task of taking down the convention, thus leaving Walker above the fray to smile and declare the news of the convention good for the city.

Scheider’s Washington Post Op-Ed attacking Milwaukee and the convention presented 3 themes: 1) Wisconsin leans conservative, not progressive, therefore don’t expect this convention to do the Democrats any favors for the 2020 Presidential contest. 2) Governor Walker delivered a set of policy victories that show progressive policies will be unpopular in Wisconsin. 3) That Scott Walker should take the victory lap for landing the Dems’ 2020 convention, since he supported funding construction of the conference venue.

First, Schneider declared the common wisdom on why Dems lost Wisconsin is wrong (i.e., Hillary Rodham Clinton’s failure to visit WI during the campaign), even while being half right for reasons he does not understand. It’s not that Wisconsinites dislike ‘progressive’ Clinton. It is that they dislike ‘third-way’ DNC establishment Hillary. It’s possible that visits to Wisconsin by HRC’s Hamptons and Hollywood campaign during the general election might not have pushed her to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue via a Wisconsin win. Schneider, however, fails to mention that HRC visited Wisconsin in the primary campaign, only saying she failed to visit in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. It’s the kind of language parsing Walker’s people rely on to construct false narratives, yet maintain plausibility in being able to later deny. The reason HRC’s visit during the general election might not have helped win Wisconsin, however, is because she was indeed unpopular in WI, where Bernie Sanders beat her by a whopping 13% in the primary. Moreover, Jill Stein (considered by many to the left of HRC, regardless of whether one likes her or not) took enough votes from Clinton in the general election to allow Trump’s victory. In short, Wisconsin is strongly “progressive” (contra Schneider’s assertion) even if also strongly conservative. In Wisconsin, it is the political center that is weak. Clinton failed the day in 2016 not because she was considered progressive, as Schneider hints, but because she was considered not progressive at all.

Second, Schneider argues that Wisconsinites unlikely support a progressive agenda, given Governor Walker’s policy “successes.” Schneider asserts Wisconsinites will not support progressive policies, such as Medicare for All, because such a high number of Wisconsinites already have healthcare. Scheider’s alchemy, however, looks to spin gold out of his soggy wool. The reason so many Wisconsinites are covered by private health insurance is because the state was dead last (50th of 50 states) in new business startups Walker. New businesses often lack resources to insure workers. Wisconsin relies disproportionately on old industries for employment, thus a greater percentage of Wisconsin’s workforce in its entrepreneurially starved economy still have private health insurance as they work for legacy industries. But, as businesses continue shedding costs, who knows how long health insurance will be provided by these older industries? The ‘known known’ is that co-pays and other costs keep rising and healthcare keeps getting less affordable. In short, the private health insurance model has been broken for decades and needs to be dispatched in favor of public provisioned healthcare.

Schneider also blames decades long socialist leadership of Milwaukee as having delivered only hardships to the city. First, under genuinely progressive leadership, Milwaukee re-elected socialist mayor Frank Zeidler by 72% in 1952. In 1958 Fortune Magazine labeled Milwaukee as the 2nd best run city (1st would have been too immodest for Wisconsinites) under socialist rule and wages remained 30% above the national mean even in 1970. Schneider blames progressive “regulation” for Milwaukee’s decline in the 1980s, when in fact the chief hit the city’s economy took was was when Ronald Reagan moved to halt stagflation with a massive restriction of the money supply. This revalued the dollar upward, thus dealing a devastating blow to Milwaukee’s export-based industries, rendering them uncompetitive on global markets. Moreover, the GOP has been in charge of Wisconsin from the 1980s to present for much of that time, including with Scott Walker as former Milwaukee County Executive where he left a fiscal mess of deferred maintenance costs and slashed budgets for parks, workers and the needy.

Schneider also declares Walker delivered the stadium (the 2020 proposed DNC conference venue) making the Dem’s convention possible. While true that Walker never saw a giveaway to big business (e.g., Foxconn) or big contractors he did not like, the partially public-financed Milwaukee Bucks’ Fiserv Forum had bipartisan support, even if progressives (such as the authors) opposed this massive deployment of public cash for a privately owned building.

By several metrics, Milwaukee is making a comeback, even though its return has not yet reached many of its minority communities and its white working class. Governor Scott Walker and the Wisconsin GOP built their brand attacking Milwaukee and people of color. Controlling the narrative of the past and present is essential for their hoped for return to power. Walker and Schneider need to paint Milwaukee as a failed progressive city governed by socialists. Milwaukee’s recovery challenges that narrative, as what people will find if they learn about Milwaukee’s true progressive past (its socialist period).

Meanwhile, cheers to Milwaukee’s socialist past with cautious hope it might return.

Plenty of mainstream Democrats got riled when Chelsea Clinton went to a vigil for the victims of the New Zealand mosque massacre and a Bernie Sanders supporter got in her face and blamed ...,"Plenty of mainstream Democrats got riled when Chelsea Clinton went to a vigil for the victims of the New Zealand mosque massacre and a Bernie Sanders supporter got in her face and blamed her for the tragedy. Sure thing, and Sam Cooke’s responsible for giving us Maroon Five.

These Democrats were excited about the three “fresh faces” of diversity who were elected to Congress in the midterm elections—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib—but they’ve remained conspicuously silent on the Chelsea Clinton incident, which indicates tacit approval for her ambush. These naive mainstream Democrats don't understand that when the fresh faces got elected it would move the party in a direction where a Democrat could be partially blamed for a massacre of 50 worshipping Muslims halfway across the world and it wouldn't be universally condemned within the leadership of the party.

It's not as if there's a gray area that would give pause to anyone thinking of commenting on the sucker-punching of the former First Daughter. Leen Dweik, an international relations and Middle Eastern and Islamic studies student at NYU told her, during a screechy, spittle-flecked rant, ""I want you to feel that deep inside. Forty-nine people died because of the rhetoric you put out there.” The mass murderer has released a lengthy manifesto containing Chelsea Clinton's name zero times.

The rhetoric the unhinged female student was referring to was when Chelsea took to Twitter last month to chastise Ilhan Omar for her allegedly anti-Semitic comments. Only the weakest of minds could find a direct connection between that one tweet, which didn't even mention Muslims, and a slaughter of such magnitude, so the likely explanation is that BDS supporter Dweik cynically took advantage of the situation to bring attention to herself as a call-out culture hero. “We took our chance to speak truth to power,” Dweik told ABC News.

Except she left the truth part out in favor of self-aggrandizing posturing, which hardly mattered to her target audience. It was all about the performance of a dark-skinned Muslim woman full of self-righteous fury slaying a white benefactor of privilege while the camera's running.

You know something's off when Donald Trump Jr. comes to the defense of the daughter of Crooked Hillary while people on the left pummeled her. In an article that Dweik and her fellow pro-Palestine activist Rose Asaf wrote for BuzzFeed that's pure propaganda, the authors puff themselves up by claiming that Clinton hurt their fight against white supremacy by standing up to the “petty weaponizers of Anti-Semitism.”

Chelsea Clinton, a victim of anti-Clintonism since she was a child (John McCain once said she was “so ugly” because Janet Reno was her her “father”) is a bad person because she showed “no regard for Rep. Omar and the hatred being directed at her,” even though Clinton hasn't indicated any such callousness. Dweik and Asaf didn't back down on the slanderous claim that Clinton helped incite a mass murder, further accentuating their dishonesty. They cast a net for anti-Muslim bigotry so wide that anyone daring to disagree with them can be caught. That's intentional—the purpose is to silence people.

The Democrats who were thrilled by the fresh faces now find themselves in the position of being potentially labeled as Islamophobes themselves because they've come to Chelsea Clinton's defense. There's now a serious rift in a party that had shown tolerance for anti-Semitism as long as it comes from the Left.

It's ironic, yet predictable, that people like Leen Dweik, who jump to irresponsible conclusions when one of their own’s called an anti-Semite are so liberal with their charges of Islamophobia. A prominent member of this group is “progressive” activist Linda Sarsour, who shortly after the attack on Clinton tweeted that she was “triggered by those who piled on representative Ilhan Omar and incited a hate mob against her until she got assassination threats.” These people, she said, “contribute to Islamophobia.” The implication is that people should care about about what happens to “trigger” Sarsour, who's a key part of the leadership team of the Women's March that's come under fire for anti-Semitism.

This controversy's good news for Donald Trump's prospects in 2020. Though beleaguered, he can take comfort in having to go up against a Party that's so adept at dividing itself. Democrats are now prone to judge people by their gender, skin color, and religion, as opposed to their beliefs. The result is that Dweik, who has three full intersectionality points as a brown, Muslim woman, can make a reprehensible charge against someone who's always stood against bigotry and progressives don't unanimously condemn it.

While Chelsea Clinton should be entitled to one intersectionality point as a woman, her prominent position in the oppressive power structure means that, effectively, she's treated like a white male, the lowliest member of the “progressive stack.” Republicans, not burdened with such convoluted nonsense, have to feel good about this one, and there's plenty more to come.",Democratic Rift Widens,Splice Today,https://www.splicetoday.com/politics-and-media/democratic-rift-widens

Today it’s not just the Democratic President performing sneaky, debatable policy maneuvers to Israel’s disadvantage—or the “unspeakable ...","Are Jewish Democrats Committed Enough to Protect Israel from Their Own Party?

Dear Friend of FLAME:

Many Jewish Democrats pay lip service to support of Israel, but when it comes to opposing acts hostile to Israel —or supporting acts helpful to Israel—they often abandon the Jewish homeland. Israel is apparently often not as important as party loyalty.

Two examples: When Barack Obama engineered and ratified the Iran Deal, we at FLAME criticized the President roundly—because it was a bad deal for the U.S. and for Israel.

When, in December 2016, the Obama administration allowed the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution denying Jewish connection and rights to Jerusalem, we criticized the President again—because it was a lie . . . and a betrayal of Israel .

In both cases, we received blowback from Jewish Democrats—FLAME supporters—who were angry that we criticized “their guy.” One such supporter warned us against attacking President Obama because, “you don’t understand, we love him .”

The problem was not FLAME’s failure to understand. It was that our higher principle is support of Israel above unqualified support of any politician or party.

Likewise, when we praised Donald Trump for getting the U.S. out of the Iran Deal and moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, Jewish Democrats warned us against supporting this “evil man” and warning us against dire consequences when Democrats returned to the White House.

They meant that supporting good deeds for Israel by Trump—no matter how righteous they might be—would mark us for punishment for disloyalty from ascendant Democrats.

Today, Jewish Democrats face new, even more troubling challenges to their loyalty to the Democratic Party.

Today it’s not just the Democratic President performing sneaky, debatable policy maneuvers to Israel’s disadvantage—or the “unspeakable” Republican supporting Israel. Rather, it’s Democratic Congressional representatives voicing plainly anti-Semitic sentiments to delegitimize Israel and Israel’s supporters.

What’s more, Nancy Pelosi’s Democrat-controlled House refused to condemn specifically those anti-Semitic profanities or censure Rep. Ilhan Omar, who uttered them.

Where are the Israel supporters in the Democratic Party when we need them? Where is the outrage of Democrat supporters of Israel and the Jewish people when we need them?

Don’t misunderstand: Democrats don’t have to become Republicans . . . or even to vote for Republicans. That’s a different choice. But Democrats who truly support Israel should raise a ruckus in their party—demand an immediate, unequivocal end to anti-Semitic calumnies among their members.

Put it another way: If you’re a Democrat who doesn’t vocally disavow Rep. Ilhan Omar and her evil, anti-Semitic sister, Rep. Rashida Tlaib—if you don’t write a protest letter to the editor or to your state’s Democratic chairperson— you can’t honestly say you support Israel.

This is a question of personal integrity. FLAME does not support political parties because we “like” them or “love” their Presidential candidate. We support politicians who support the causes and values most sacred to us.

When a party abandons your sacred causes, it’s your moral duty to threaten to leave —or to actually leave—that party. If you’re a Jewish American, you should insist your party support Israel. That’s good for the United States, the Jewish people and the Jewish homeland.

In short, it’s high time that all Jewish Democrats—and all Democrats of integrity—forcefully condemn the growing antagonism of increasing numbers of Democrat politicians against Jewish Americans and the Jewish state.

Contact House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and your favorite Presidential candidate. Let them know where you stand on anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. Tell them the heart of the Party is at stake . If they fail to condemn anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, that is a failure of moral integrity—undeserving of your support.

In talking with friends, family and colleagues, I urge you to focus not on party or politicians, but on the issues of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. If the party or a politician supports the Jewish people and the Jewish state, it’s important that we support them vocally for that (no matter which party, no matter whom we end up voting for).

I hope you’ll also quickly visit FLAME’s lively new Facebook page and review the P.S. immediately below. It describes FLAME’s most recent hasbarah campaign—on whitewashing misrepresentations made by the media and, alarmingly, by some politicians, about the insidious Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.

The courts have emerged as a lightning rod during the Trump administration for the Democratic Party’s resurgent base, which remains deeply bitter over Senate Majority Leader’s decision to block, President Obama’s final Supreme Court nominee.Supporters argue that sweeping reforms, including expanding the number of justices, are needed to counteract Trump and McConnell, who they say have “packed” the judicial system with conservative judges — including two Supreme Court justices and a record number of influential appeals court picks.Chris Kang, the chief counsel for Demand Justice, said that the intra-party debate being driven by the party’s 2020 race made it an “incredibly important and central time to be having this discussion” and that waiting until 2021 to lay the groundwork would “be too late.”“I think the question is whether or not they’re out of touch with just how partisan and illegitimate this Supreme Court has become in its willingness to throw out precedent and sort of the way its undermining the rule of law.

Democrats announced in December that they would not agree to an end-of-the-Congress deal on Trump’s court picks.Meanwhile, Republicans nixed the 60-vote filibuster in 2017 to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia, in what many Democrats view as a stolen seat., Trump’s second pick, was confirmed by the narrowest margin in the Senate for a Supreme Court nominee since 1881 amid allegations of sexual assault and fears by progressives that he would tip the balance of the court to the right for decades.“I think the Kavanaugh nomination has put a fire under progressives when it comes to the Supreme Court. It’s a recognition of the enormous impact the court has on our lives, the capacity to undermine key progressive victories like voting rights, controlling money in politics, reproductive rights and so forth,” said Caroline Fredrickson, the president of the progressive American Constitution Society.She added that it’s “not written in stone that the court has nine seats.”A growing number of the party’s 2020 candidates are showing an openness, if not an outright commitment, to expanding the Supreme Court or making other judicial reforms if they win the White House in 2020.South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke have both signaled they could support expanding the court.“This central objective that is to prevent the Supreme Court from continuing on this trajectory to become basically ruined by being a nakedly political institution,” Buttigieg said during an interview with Pod Save America. “This idea of adding justices is one way to do it.”One idea, talked up by both O’Rourke and Buttigieg, would reform the court so that Republicans appointed five justices and Democrats appointed five justices. The 10 justices would then mutually agree on an additional five, bringing the total number on the court to 15.Republicans have lashed out at talk of expanding the courts.

Justin Amash scolded his own party on Sunday after its official Twitter account tweeted a mugshot of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke from his 1998 drunken driving arrest.

The Republican National Committee celebrated St. Patrick’s Day by tweeting a Photoshopped version of the mugshot that showed Mr. O’Rouke wearing a cartoon leprechaun hat and holding a placard with the message: “Please Drink Responsibly.”

“On this St. Paddy’s Day, a special message from noted Irishman Robert Francis O’Rourke,” the @GOP’s tweet read.

The tweet sparked a wave of backlash by users who slammed the party for dredging up a decades-old arrest when Republicans have had their own share of similar legal troubles. For instance, former President George W. Bush and his former vice president, Dick Cheney, were both arrested for drunken driving before their political careers.

Mr. Amash, a founding libertarian member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, joined the pile-on in slamming the tweet.

“Do better, @GOP. Be better,” the congressman tweeted.

Mr. O’Rourke, who has publicly apologized for his DWI arrest in the past, also addressed the tweet Sunday, saying voters aren’t interested in “pettiness” and “personal attacks.”

“They wanted us to be defined by our ambitions, our aspirations, the work that we’re willing to do to pull this very deeply-divided country together,” the former Democratic congressman told reporters, The Hill reported.

The RNC continued its criticism of Mr. O’Rourke despite the backlash, this time attacking his “far-left liberal record” as a congressman.

UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations on Monday urged the Democratic Republic of Congo's new President Felix Tshisekedi to quickly form a new government, warning that voters had ""huge expectations"" from the leadership change and should not be let down.

Tshisekedi's party is working to cobble together a coalition government with the party of former president Joseph Kabila, which won a majority of seats in parliamentary elections.

""We hope that the new government will soon be formed and operational,"" UN envoy Leila Zerrougui told the Security Council.

""The Congolese people's expectations are huge and it is crucial that they not be left waiting for too long, or be disappointed,"" she warned.

Tshisekedi was declared the winner of a presidential election that turned the page on Kabila's nearly two decades in power in Kinshasa.

The election result, which marked the first peaceful handover of power since the DRC's independence from Belgium in 1960, has been greeted with cautious optimism.

The formation of the new government is being closely watched for signs that Kabila will continue to hold sway in the nation's politics if many top cabinet posts are filled by his supporters.

The two camps have yet to agree on the appointment of a prime minister.

The council is weighing a recommendation from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to draw down the large 16,000-strong peacekeeping mission in the DRC, known as Monusco.

Guterres has proposed cutting 1,600 troops, 35 police officers and one formed police unit (about 140 police) along with a 30% reduction in the number of military observers.

President Donald Trump played down any threat posed by white nationalism after the gunman accused of the New Zealand mosque massacre called the president “a symbol of renewed white identity.”

Trump, whose own previous responses to the movement have drawn scrutiny, expressed sympathy for the victims who died at “places of worship turned into scenes of evil killing.” But he declined to join expressions of mounting concern about white nationalism. When asked whether he thought it was a rising threat around the world, he responded, “I don’t really.”

“I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess,” Trump said Friday. “If you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that’s the case. I don’t know enough about it yet. But it’s certainly a terrible thing.”

Story continues below advertisement

Trump was asked about white nationalism and the shooting deaths of 49 people at mosques in Christchurch after he formally vetoed Congress’ resolution to block his declaration of a national emergency at the Mexico border. His veto, aimed at freeing money to build more miles of a border wall against illegal immigration, is expected to survive any congressional effort to overturn it.

Questioned about the accused gunman’s reference to him, Trump professed ignorance.

“I didn’t see it. I didn’t see it,” he said. “But I think it’s a horrible event … a horrible, disgraceful thing and a horrible act.”

The man accused of the shootings left behind a lengthy document outlining his motivations. He proudly stated that he was a 28-year-old Australian white nationalist who hates immigrants and was set off by attacks in Europe that were perpetrated by Muslims. He mentioned the U.S. president in a single reference.

“Were/are you a supporter of Donald Trump?” was one of the questions he posed to himself. His answer: “As a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure. As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no.”

The White House immediately denounced the connection. But the mention from the suspect, who embraced Nazi imagery and voiced support for fascism, nonetheless cast an uncomfortable light on the way the president has been embraced by some on the far right.

Trump, who as a candidate proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, has drawn criticism as being slow to condemn white supremacy and related violence. After a 2017 clash between white nationalists and anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one demonstrator dead, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides” of the confrontation. He also did not immediately reject the support of David Duke, a former KKK Grand Wizard, during his presidential campaign.

Some of the Democrats who are campaigning for the right to challenge Trump in 2020 criticized his response to the New Zealand attack.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar told Iowa voters Saturday that “it’s our job to stand up against” white supremacism. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who is also seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, accused Trump of taking “rank with those who want to spread fear and division across the world.”

Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who entered the Democratic race this week, said, “We must call out this hatred, this Islamophobia, this intolerance, and the violence that predictably follows from the rhetoric that we use.”

The White House rejected any link to Trump.

“It’s outrageous to even make that connection between this deranged individual that committed this evil crime to the president who has repeatedly condemned bigotry, racism and made it very clear that this is a terrorist attack,” Mercedes Schlapp, the White House’s director of strategic communication, told reporters on Friday. “We are there to support and stand with the people of New Zealand.”

Trump telephoned New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, offering condolences, prayers and any help the U.S. might be able to provide. She told reporters she answered, “My message was: to offer sympathy and love to all Muslim communities.”

Trump’s hardline immigration rhetoric and calls to return America to its traditional past have been embraced by many on the conservative fringes, including some who troll online with racist imagery, as well as white supremacists who have looked to engage in violence.

In Florida, Cesar Sayoc, who had decorated his van with Trump propaganda, was accused of mailing explosives last fall to Democratic Party officials and media members, many of whom had been criticized by the president. The president said Sayoc had been “insane” long before he became a Trump fan.

Last month, a former Coast Guard official was accused of stockpiling weapons in a plot to kill media figures and liberal politicians as part of a plan to transform the U.S. into a white ethno-state. It took more than a week for Trump to respond to the plot, which he deemed “a shame.”

Many experts who track violent extremists have identified white nationalism as a growing threat in the U.S. and abroad. In January, for example, the New York-based Anti-Defamation League said domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S. in 2018, up from 37 in 2017, and said, “White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case.”

Some critics have accused U.S. authorities of not dedicating adequate resources to stem a threat of domestic terrorism. However, The Washington Post reported last week that internal FBI data showed more domestic terror suspects were arrested last year than those allegedly inspired by international terror groups.","In wake of New Zealand shootings, Trump says he doesn’t see a rising threat in white nationalism",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-wake-of-new-zealand-shootings-trump-says-he-doesnt-see-a-rising/

Or was it just another slip of the tongue by the former vice-president with a reputation for veering off script?

In a keynote speech at a dinner for the Delaware Democratic Party, Biden boasted Saturday that he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.” The only problem is that Biden hasn’t announced whether he will launch a third run for the White House, despite repeatedly teasing the possibility.

He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then adding “I didn’t mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.

Although Biden has been known to go off script, his remark is likely to be viewed as a Washington-style gaffe — a case of accidentally telling the truth.

During the rest of his speech he sounded very much like a candidate-in-waiting. He repeatedly attacked President Donald Trump, accusing him of stoking division and anger, and bemoaned that the ascendant “new left” of his own party has criticized him for being cordial toward Republicans.

“The only thing strong enough to tear America apart is America itself and we’ve seen its start,” Biden said.

This, as former President ...","Every country has its own political language. These terms and phrases that have developed over time give distinctive meanings that may not be fully understood by outsiders. Unless we learn them, we may miss critical information about how politics really works.

Our new dictionary of African politics reveals the witty and insightful political terminology that people in different African countries use to speak truth to power and discuss everyday developments.

It shows the importance of language for understanding politics and the varied experience of different nations.

The dictionary serves three key purposes. First, it provides clear and concise overviews of hundreds of key personalities, events and institutions from the colonial period to the present day. These range from Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to former South African leader Jacob Zuma, through the late Kenyan environmentalist and Nobel Laureate Wangari Mathaai, and Aja Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, a leading gender activist and the vice president of Gambia.

Second, it explains a rich set of theoretical terms that emerged out of the research on Africa over the last 70 years. These include neo-patrimonialism and extraversion, which have become important for global debates about power and the way it’s exercised.

Third - and much more significantly - it allows for a better understanding of the contributions that the continent has made to the practice and understanding of everyday politics. It also makes it possible to share the perceptive and shrewd ways that people speak truth to power in various countries: this is the real reason that the world needs a new dictionary of African politics.

Crowd-sourcing

To access this wealth of “kona” knowledge (street corner wisdom in Kiswahili), we crowd sourced suggestions for the most relevant and insightful terms using social media. The hundreds of responses we received mean that the dictionary is packed full of fascinating terms from across the continent. These come from a variety of languages including Kiswahili, Chibemba, Kikuyu, Wolof, isiZulu and isiXhosa. There are also Africanised versions of English, French and Portuguese words.

An illustrative example is the wealth of English vocabulary that has emerged from the interaction between local political norms and democratic institutions. This includes the Kenyan model of negotiated democracy — the sharing of political positions between different communities in advance of an election to avoid conflict.

Another is the Nigerian practice of “zoning”, which was set up to try and ensure that the presidency of Africa’s most populous country alternates between northerners and southerners. That way, no community is permanently excluded from power.

Clothing-related expressions have also emerged in countries like Kenya and Ghana to show voting behaviours. “Three-piece suit voting” refers to supporting the same party for all elected positions. On the contrary, “skirt-and-blouse voting” eans to vote for different parties for presidential and legislative elections.







A series of evocative expressions describe a politician’s move from one party to another – usually from the opposition to the governing party following an inducement. Terms such as floor-crossing or cross-carpeting are inspired by the parliament’s settings, or nomadic traditions - examples are transhumance and “nomadisme politique”.

Ingenuity and humour

The ingredients that shape these terms are decades, if not centuries old. They thus provide an insight into a collective memory that goes back to well before colonial rule. But, language also evolves to keep up with the times. In French, for example, glissement means to slide. But, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the word recently took on a whole new meaning. This, as former President Joseph Kabila repeatedly postponed scheduled elections that would see him stand down. Congolese citizens started using the term to refer to the act of deliberately “sliding” past the official election date to retain power indefinitely.

Similarly, in Francophone Africa the term “alternance”, used as the demand for a transfer of power, shows a passionate commitment to the liberal-democratic norm of putting limits on the number of terms a president may serve. This has no equivalent in Europe and North America.

While the use of words such as glissement hint at the world-weary cynicism many ordinary people feel towards their leaders, other terms revel in the joy of wordplay. One of our favourites is “watermelon politics”. It refers to an individual that professes to support one political party but in reality belongs to another.

It was coined in Zambia, where activists from the opposition United Party of National Development, (whose colour was then red), pretended to support the governing party, the Patriotic Front, (whose colour was green), to avoid reprisals. They were thus depicted as “green on the outside, but red on the inside”.

Such expressions show the ingenuity and humour with which citizens evade despotism and exercise their democratic rights. They also show how much researchers and journalists miss when they don’t pay attention to African ideas and concepts. Thus, the best reason to read this dictionary is to learn about the political ingenuity of African citizens and to gain insights into local political ideas and frames of reference.

The dictionary is also about much more than that. It includes one of the most thorough timelines of African political events ever compiled, with direct links to entries that put critical events into context. It also provides useful overviews of the topics that are of most interest to students. These range from from HIV/Aids to gender quotas, and from the anti-apartheid struggle to the Rwandan genocide.

Our hope is that it does justice to the efforts of the many people who took time to send in the suggestions that have enriched it, and that everyone who takes a look learns something new.

""I think people in our party tie themselves up in pretzels trying to be more electable."" He fields questions differently from most ...","Pete Buttigieg - the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is likely to become a presidential candidate - won't wear his dress jacket, not when he appears on national television for a town hall meeting, not for photo shoots, not even at a fundraiser here in a Russian-themed bar where he's mingling with such celebrities as comedian Billy Eichner and Olympic diver Greg Louganis.

""There's a side controversy over that question,"" Buttigieg said in an interview. No less a figure than David Axelrod, the top strategist for the past two winning Democratic presidential campaigns, has been privately urging the 37-year-old to look more grown-up by wearing a jacket on the campaign trail.

""I don't know,"" Buttigieg said, hesitating as if embarrassed by how contrived his next thought might sound. ""I just feel more comfortable with my sleeves rolled up.""

The Navy veteran with a hard-to-pronounce name, from a city small enough to fit every resident in a college football stadium, seems to be winning the argument at the moment. Weeks after declaring his interest in challenging President Donald Trump, he has become, if not exactly well-known, a subject of interest for many Democratic voters, buoyed by a breakout performance at a CNN town hall on March 10.

His moment came just days before another youthful candidate, former congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, grabbed the spotlight by announcing his entrance into the race.

Buttigieg downplayed the impact of a rival fresh face joining the fray, joking that he has the ""white Episcopalian gay veteran"" lane to himself.

""It's not worth the energy and effort to try to game out what the others are doing,"" Buttigieg said. ""Maybe if there were like three people running. But when there's like 20, you're not running against any one of them. You're running against the house. Especially me.""

Buttigieg has trouble even breaking into many polls, so his rise should not be overstated. But the buzz that's surrounding him, at least for now, reflects how fluid, unpredictable and fractured the Democratic race has become, without a clear leader and with various candidates attracting attention at different times and for different reasons.

Even in a Democratic field full of nontraditional candidates, Buttigieg stands out in many ways. A military veteran who deployed to Afghanistan, he is openly gay, and his husband, Chasten, maintains a lively Twitter presence. He would be the youngest president in history. No mayor has ever ascended directly to the presidency, let alone from a city of about 102,000.

Buttigieg is also one of the few Democratic hopefuls from a state carried by Trump. Central to his message is the case that he knows how to appeal to Republican voters who, he says, Democrats have too often ignored in the past.

The CNN town hall attracted 22,000 donors to his undeclared campaign in 24 hours, his staff said. On Saturday, his campaign announced it had cleared the 65,000-donor threshold necessary to earn a spot in the Democratic debates scheduled to start in June. Two prominent Democratic donors, whom his campaign declines to name, reached out as well, advisers said.

He plans to double his campaign staff from 20 to 40 ""in a matter of days,"" and his team is narrowing down options for a bigger South Bend headquarters - perhaps an entire floor of a downtown high rise.

""In some ways it seems fantastical that a 37-year-old, openly gay mayor from South Bend can even be in this conversation,"" said Axelrod, who is a neutral adviser in the Democratic primary race. ""These donor types are pretty flinty eyed, but they want to be passionate about their choices.""

Many Democrats praised the way Buttigieg went after Vice President Mike Pence, a vocal religious conservative, describing him on CNN as ""the cheerleader of the porn star presidency.""

""Is it that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump?"" Buttigieg asked.

The mayor says he claims no artifice. ""I am not skilled enough or energetic enough to craft a persona. I just have to be who I am and hope people like it,"" Buttigieg said. ""I think people in our party tie themselves up in pretzels trying to be more electable.""

He fields questions differently from most other candidates, leaning on numbers and context and maintaining a noteworthy willingness to answer ""yes"" or ""no.""

Buttigieg also shows a facility with Twitter. When Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks chief executive who's considering an independent run for president, said he'd spent more time with the military than anyone running, Buttigieg was quick with a facetious response highlighting his time in the Afghanistan war zone.

""I remember a Green Beans Coffee at the exchange at Bagram, and a decent espresso machine run by the Italian NATO element at ISAF HQ,"" he tweeted, referring to the Afghanistan mission. ""But I don't recall seeing any Starbucks over there."" Schultz apologized.

In his recent memoir, Buttigieg credits his rhetorical approach partly to his education, including four years at Harvard University and two at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar.

""In the community of people running around Harvard in suits with handkerchief scarves, he was definitely not in that category,"" said Massachusetts Democratic state Sen. Eric Lesser, a Harvard classmate and longtime friend. ""He always had a fairly understated style. He wasn't a table banger.""

Some of Buttigieg's ideas are unorthodox, though he's not alone in the Democratic field in that regard. He is outspoken about his desire to abolish the electoral college, for example, and has suggested a Supreme Court composed of 15 justices, including five who would be appointed by the other 10. Both ideas would likely require a constitutional amendment.

Buttigieg often argues Democrats should not cede the word ""freedom"" to Republicans, citing his marriage as a way the government gave him freedom to pursue his rights.

""He says things that I'm thinking, that no one else is doing,"" said Carrie Clifford, a 47-year-old actor and writer who lives in Los Angeles. ""I'm like, 'Oh, that makes a lot of sense. Why aren't we doing that?' I haven't felt that way in a while.""

Some of Buttigieg's positions are more in line with other Democrats. He supports the Green New Deal promoted by liberals in Congress, saying it's a good start in tackling the climate crisis. He backs a single-payer health-care system, though he says private insurance companies should play a role. He opposes the Trump administration's tough approach to immigration.","Pete Buttigieg, the young and openly gay Midwest mayor, finds a voice in crowded Democratic presidential field",Chicago Tribune,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-pete-buttigieg-democratic-candidate-20190317-story.html

Getty Images Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announces her presidential bid in front of a crowd gathered at Boom Island Park on Feb. 10, 2019, in Minneapolis.

Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said President Donald Trump's rhetoric exacerbated tensions and called for him to condemn bigotry against Muslims.

""I don't think you can actually take each of the murderous acts and say what role Donald Trump played, but I can tell you this: his rhetoric doesn't help,"" Klobuchar said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""And many of these people, whether it was the person who tried to bomb Barack Obama or this murderer in New Zealand, have cited Donald Trump along the way.""

Klobuchar spoke with CNN from Iowa as she vies for her party's presidential nomination to challenge Trump next year. She said after the recent attack on Muslims in New Zealand, it was ""on all of us to condemn this hate,"" including Trump.

""He, at the very least, should be giving strong statements, public speeches, defending Muslims in this world,"" Klobuchar said.

Trump said on Friday after the shooting he had called New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but when asked about white nationalism, he said he did not regard it as a growing threat.

Available data suggest white nationalism is a rising, violent threat in the United States, as CNN noted in a fact check on Trump's comments.

In Sunday's interview, Klobuchar also defended the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, who Trump attacked on Twitter over the weekend. Klobuchar called the tweets ""outrageous"" and invoked McCain's memory as she called for unity in the wake of the New Zealand massacre.

""John believed, as I believe, that when a tragedy happens like in New Zealand, you do all you can to reach out to that country and you do all you can to stand up for the simple belief that people are different in our country, but we were all part of a greater America,"" Klobuchar said.",Klobuchar after New Zealand attack: Trump's 'rhetoric doesn't help',channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/klobuchar-after-new-zealand-attack-trumps-rhetoric-doesnt-help/1060178778

Doubts the army will truly give up power were heightened last month when a new pro-military party nominated junta chief and prime ...","BANGKOK--Thailand's oldest political party is heading into an election on Sunday with leader Abhisit Vejjajiva facing tough choices in the first polls since the military seized power in a 2014 coup.

Will Abhisit's pro-business, pro-establishment Democrat Party join with a new pro-military party in a coalition after the vote, likely extending the army's dominance of power?

Or will the Democrats band together with a ""pro-democracy front"" to keep the army out of government--but at the price of working with its bitter foe for 15 years: parties loyal to ousted populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

Or is there a third option, as Abhisit argues? One scenario could return Oxford-educated Abhisit to the prime minister's office, which he held from 2008 to 2011 after a court dissolved a pro-Thaksin government.

""We will be the alternative in leading Thailand out of the last decade of troubles,"" Abhisit, 54, told Reuters in an interview.

Prominent Democrats have been at the center of Thailand's turbulent politics since 2005, with some party members leading anti-Thaksin ""Yellow Shirt"" protests against corruption that led to two military coups in a decade.

Sunday's election has been billed by the military government as returning Southeast Asia's second-largest economy to civilian, democratic rule. But critics say a new Constitution, overseen by the generals, enshrines military influence over politics.

Doubts the army will truly give up power were heightened last month when a new pro-military party nominated junta chief and prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the 2014 coup, as its prime ministerial candidate.

Abhisit this month said in a campaign video he would not support Prayuth's staying on as prime minister, which he said would ""breed conflict and is against the Democrat party's principle that the people have the power.""

At the same time, Abhisit made clear he would be loath to work with the main pro-Thaksin party, Pheu Thai. The Democrats have long decried the Thaksin movement as corrupt and a threat to independent democratic institutions.

""I don't want dictatorship and I don't want corrupt people,” Abhisit said. ""Corrupt politicians provided the pretexts for the military to stage all the coups in the last 20 years.""

COMPROMISE PM?

Thaksin lives in self-exile to avoid a 2008 graft conviction he said was politically motivated but he retains widespread support, especially in the north and northeast.

The Democrats have traditionally drawn support from the Bangkok middle class and the south.

Abhisit's hopes for a third way could come to nothing in an election increasingly defined by the face-off between pro-military parties, which have Prayuth as their candidate for prime minister and electoral rules that give them an advantage, and an anti-military bloc with Thaksin's loyalists at its core.

While Abhisit has rejected Prayuth as prime minister, he has not ruled out a coalition with Palang Pracharat, the party that has nominated the junta leader.

Such a deal might see a ""compromise"" premier, perhaps Abhisit himself or another outside candidate.

The target for political parties is 376 seats in parliament--50 percent plus one of the combined 250-seat Upper House Senate and the 500-seat Lower House of Representatives.

But with the junta appointing all 250 members of the Senate, no single party is likely to secure the 376 magic number on its own.

Given that the pro-military Palang Pracharat can count on the support of the Senate, it needs to win only 126 Lower House seats to form a government.

By contrast, the parties opposed to a military role in government must win 376 seats in the Lower House, three-quarters of the seats, to block the military from retaining control.

Still, most polls indicate Palang Pracharat won't win enough seats on its own, meaning it would need coalition partners, with the Democrats a likely choice.

‘NOT BLACK AND WHITE’

The Democrats have come second to pro-Thaksin parties in every election since 2001, including the last one in 2011, when they got 35 percent of the vote to Pheu Thai's 48 percent.

Opinion polls tend to show the Democrats coming second or third. The party will be competing for the anti-Thaksin vote with other parties, including Palang Pracharat.

The Democrat Party was founded in 1947 as a conservative, royalist movement, and has portrayed itself as a champion of civilian rule in a country that has seen 13 successful coups, even if at times it worked with military governments.

In 1992, the Democrats sided with anti-army demonstrators in an uprising that led to a bloody crackdown. The party won an election later that year but it was blamed for mishandling the wrenching fall-out of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which paved the way for the rise of telecoms tycoon Thaksin.

Amid polarization in the 2000s, the Democrats benefited from the military's opposition to Thaksin, and at times called for military intervention to oust pro-Thaksin governments.

Abhisit has rejected efforts by Thaksin's loyalists to portray the election as a two-way fight between democracy and military-dominated rule.

""This election is not black and white, the country has more choices,"" he told Reuters.

Anti-junta parties, however, argue there is no neutrality or third way in the election.

""Abhisit says he will not join with Pheu Thai, but does that mean he will join with Palang Pracharat?"" asked Sudarat Keyuraphan, Pheu Thai's top prime ministerial candidate.

""There are only two sides,"" she said. ""So he must choose.""",Thailand party may be king-maker after vote to set military role,asahi,http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201903190054.html

The Democratic Party said Tuesday that it has no immediate plans to withdraw a March 13 statement by spokesman Lee Hae-sik, who attacked the reporter by name over a September article whose headline described Moon as acting as the “top spokesman” of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the U.N. General Assembly.

Lee the next day also attacked a New York Times article published last October that said Moon was serving as Kim’s “agent” while advocating diplomacy with North Korea. Lee tried to discredit the Times story by bringing up its South Korean author’s nationality, saying it was “merely an article written by a black-haired wire reporter,” but didn’t call out the writer by his name.

Moon’s office has refused to answer multiple requests for comment. Lee’s statements came in response to a parliamentary speech last Tuesday by conservative lawmaker Na Kyung-won, who borrowed the Bloomberg headline to criticize Moon’s diplomacy with Pyongyang following the collapse of last month’s summit between Kim and President Donald Trump.

The Asian American Journalists Association said it expresses “deep concerns” about the treatment of the Bloomberg journalist, saying that her safety was under threat “simply for doing her job.”

“That she is being targeted by members of the South Korean government is also troubling,” the AAJA said. “Threatening or intimidating journalists is unacceptable. Such activities have a chilling effect and undermine the freedom of the press for all journalists working in Korea.”

AAJA-Asia and its Seoul subchapter, as well as the Seoul Foreign Correspondents’ Club, have also issued statements expressing concern over the Democratic Party’s statement, which the SFCC described as a “form of censorship and journalistically chilling.”

“Questions or complaints regarding an article should be raised with the publication in question rather than personally and publicly targeting a reporter,” the SFCC said.

The presidential Blue House had responded sharply to Na’s comments, calling them an insult to both Moon and South Koreans wanting peace. During her parliamentary speech, Na said, “Please ensure that we never again hear the embarrassing talk that the president of the Republic of Korea is the top spokesman of Kim Jong Un,” referring to South Korea by its former name, as Democratic Party lawmakers began shouting at her.

While criticizing Na, Lee described the Bloomberg reporter’s article as “borderline treacherous content that insulted the head of state while wearing the cloak of a U.S. wire service.”",South Korean ruling party's treatment of Bloomberg reporter stokes press freedom concerns,The Japan Times,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/?post_type=news&p=1831195

May’s spokesman told reporters he was not yet in a position to comment on the statement, when John Bercow said the government would have to bring a different proposition to parliament if it wanted to stage another Brexit vote.

Bercow move saw the pound shed half a per cent with investors saying it had hurt May’s chances of getting her EU withdrawal agreement approved before Britain’s departure on March 29.

“Now the government will have to come back with substantial changes (which is literally impossible) in relation to the deal otherwise it means a prolonged Brexit delay,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at retail broker Think Forex.

“The chances of the UK crashing out of the EU have increased once again because the EU needs a clear plan and a strategy before they grant an extension,” he added.

Other analysts, however, said the pound could enjoy gains this week.

“This move by parliament could simply increase the chances of a substantial delay to Brexit and if that happens the risks of a second referendum or general election go up substantially,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank.

May is still trying to salvage her Brexit deal by winning over doubtful lawmakers including the Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party.

Her spokesman said on Monday that Bercow did not forewarn the government about his statement.

After Bercow spoke, the pound hit the day’s low of $1.3183, and was down nearly one percent. It also weakened against the euro to a three-day low of 85.93 pence.

Prospects are worsening for May and she suffered a further setback on Monday when Boris Johnson, the pro-Brexit former foreign secretary, refused to back her agreement unless she secured changes to the Irish backstop — designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.

“It should no doubt have a moderately positive effect on the British currency,” he added.

And then there was one more. And maybe one more still to come?

The large crop of Democrats who want to be president grew, technically, when New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand changed her status Sunday from exploring a 2020 White House run to becoming a full-fledged candidate. She'd spent more than a month visiting states to gauge support for a campaign, so voters likely considered her already in the race.

Not yet in, but perhaps tantalizingly close is former Vice-President Joe Biden, who told Delaware Democrats in a speech Saturday night that he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.” He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then added, “I didn't mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.

Biden has been known to go off script, so it not clear whether his remark could turn out to be a case of accidentally telling the truth.

But on Sunday, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who was at the Delaware Democrats' dinner, told ABC's “This Week,” ”Well, I'm very optimistic that Joe Biden will soonformally announce his campaign for the presidency.“

One hopeful, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, said he has met a fundraising threshold to participate in this summer's debates. He said he has received donations from more than 65,000 individual donors.

The Democratic National Committee said last month up to 20 candidates can qualify for the debates by collecting donations from at least 65,000 individuals, with at least 200 unique donors in at least 20 states. They also can qualify by reaching 1 per cent support in at least three national or early primary state polls.

In an email to supporters, Buttigieg said “we weren't even close” to 65,000 donors when the party announced the requirement, but that more than 76,000 people have now donated.

The debates will be held in June and July.

8:55 p.m.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren supports a new flag for Mississippi, which is the only state to have Confederate imagery on it.

Warren made the comment Monday at a CNN town hall broadcast from Jackson, the state’s capital, in the middle of a three-day swing through the South. The Mississippi state flag’s use of a Confederate battle emblem was legally challenged in 2017, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

The Massachusetts senator gave a succinct answer to the appreciative crowd in Mississippi when asked about the state flag: “Yes,” Warren said, the state should choose a new one.

8:35 p.m.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is embracing a congressional proposal to study a framework for reparations to African-Americans hurt by the legacy of slavery as the best way to begin a “national, full-blown conversation” on the issue.

Warren first voiced support for reparations last month, becoming one of three 2020 Democratic candidates to do so. But her comments about a study on reparations, made Monday night during a CNN town hall broadcast from Mississippi, mark a keener focus from the Massachusetts senator on her preferred route to tackle the thorny question of how best to deal with systemic racial inequality.

The Democratic field’s ongoing debate over reparations comes as African-American voters are poised to exert significant influence over the selection of the party’s nominee to take on President Donald Trump.

The party released a vision document before its launch. Activist Shehla Rashid was among the people who joined the party on Sunday.

The vision document said the party will pursue a “peaceful resolution of the Kashmir problem as per the will and aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir”. The manifesto said the party will attempt to bring about “sustainable peace” in the state by “making the people politically empowered, economically prosperous, socially emancipated, ethically evolved, culturally enlightened and environmentally conscious”.

The party’s slogan is “hawa badlegi” (winds of time will change), IANS reported. “I believed that by providing roads, electricity and safe drinking water, we could change the lives of the people,” Faesal said. “But I have understood that as long as the youth in Kashmir live in a state of constant fear, as long as our mothers and sisters face the prospect of losing their dignity and dear ones, nothing will work here.”

Faesal said Kashmiri politicians were living in a state of mental siege and slavery. “This all-pervading mentality of siege has to go,” he said.

“It is natural for many to discredit a new idea and understate a revolution, when they see one in the making,” he added. “Some say we are agents of the army. I am ready to face all criticism, but our pursuit to usher in a new tomorrow will continue undeterred.”

The party said it will seek to protect the special status granted to the state under the Indian Constitution. It added that it will seek “adequate political representation for under-represented communities like Buddhists, Sikhs, Christians and Kashmiri Pandits”. The Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Movement also promised to revive neglected traditions like Dogra community art, Buddhist heritage and other folk traditions.

“The party shall focus on job creation to end the unemployment of educated people, skill development of youth and ensure transparency in the recruitment process,” the document added. It also said that the party will ensure equitable development of all regions in the state.

“The party shall promote a culture of tolerance and people to people contact between people of Jammu and Kashmir and rest of the country,” the manifesto said. “The party shall seek to build an environment of justice and reconciliation in the state of Jammu and Kashmir by addressing the aspirations of all regions and communities.”

The party said it will campaign against the “evil influence of money power and muscle power in the democratic process”. “The party is committed to the task of building a developed democratic Jammu and Kashmir state based on principles of equal opportunity to all citizens,” it added.

And so, ladies and gentlemen, here are your Granite State Democratic Party “Starting Five:”

#1 Bernie Sanders

Position: U.S. Senator

Age: 77

Hometown: Burlington, VT

Coach’s comment: “Can’t take the guy who was the leading scorer last season off the court for the season opener – but this aging superstar could lose his spot in the lineup as the season plays out.”

#2 Joe Biden

Position: Former Vice President of the United States

Age: 76

We also asked our committee of political coaches to fill two more slots:

ON THE BENCH: The one candidate who’s just not playing well right now and needs to be benched until he/she can re-focus and get back in the game.

Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand were among those mentioned, but the candidate sent to the bench by the most coaches was…

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

Coach’s comment: “Every first-round draft class has a flame-out and she could be it.”

THE CINDERELLA STORY: The one candidate who isn’t in the starting five, but is impressing you with her/his unexpectedly solid performance. You wouldn’t be surprised to see them on the court in the future.

And there was an overwhelming consensus that the Cinderella story right now is…

Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, IN

EDMONTON — The staffer at the centre of a spreading scandal over Alberta's United Conservative leadership race says party leader Jason Kenney's team did not direct and prop up a bogus candidate to attack Kenney's main rival.

In a letter obtained by The Canadian Press, Matt Wolf says that when he worked on Kenney's campaign, he shared policy and research ideas with the campaign of Jeff Callaway — but Callaway was his own boss.

""To be clear, this was not a 'puppet'-type operation,"" Wolf wrote in an email to the UCP caucus Sunday morning.

""Mr. Callaway made his own decisions for his own reasons. And while communicating with the Callaway campaign was hardly my preoccupation during the leadership (race), I did, at times push things like research materials to Mr. Callaway's team.""

Wolf also said he is not aware of anyone on Kenney's team illicitly funding Callaway's campaign.

Such funding would violate Alberta's election finance laws. Alberta's elections commissioner has already fined one UCP member for making such an illegal contribution to the Callaway campaign, and the CBC has reported that the RCMP has now taken over the funding aspect of the investigation.

""Our leadership campaign did not in any way funnel donations to the Callaway camp — an act that would clearly be in violation of the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosure Act,"" wrote Wolf, who is currently Kenney's deputy chief of staff for the UCP caucus.

""I am very confident that even a suggestion of doing so would firmly be rejected by our campaign's leadership team at the time, and rightly so.""

Wolf could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday.

He wrote the letter just hours after CBC published a story and supporting documents late Saturday night detailing communications between the two campaigns.

In those documents, later obtained by The Canadian Press, Wolf is shown in emails and other exchanges giving Callaway's organizers talking points, speech and policy advice on attacking Kenney's main rival in the race, Brian Jean.

One piece of correspondence discussed when Callaway should drop out of the race — something he eventually did three weeks before voting day on Oct. 28, 2017, throwing his support to Kenney.

Callaway was one of three rivals for the UCP leadership. The party was created after Kenney's Progressive Conservatives and Brian Jean's Wildrose party voted to merge.

Jean was seen as Kenney's main rival in the race. Kenney defeated Jean and candidate Doug Schweitzer handily, with 61 per cent of the vote. Jean garnered 32 per cent.

Callaway, who had worked with Jean in the Wildrose party, repeatedly attacked Jean during the campaign in speeches, events and media scrums, questioning his policy ideas and financial management of the Wildrose.

Callaway could not be reached for comment.

The UCP did not make Kenney available Sunday, but the party's executive director, Janice Harrington released a statement.

It read: ""Communication between leadership campaigns is perfectly normal in a preferential ballot election and was within the rules of the 2017 UCP leadership election.""

Kenney and Callaway have previously denied that their campaigns worked together, and Wolf said in his letter that while his emails may look ""unflattering,"" the correspondence is normal practice among rival camps in politics.

Premier Rachel Notley, in a speech to supporters on Sunday, said Kenney already showed questionable judgment recently when his staff staked out and filmed a political opponent.

""But an alleged conspiracy to torpedo an opponent's leadership campaign takes it to a whole other level,"" Notley told supporters at her Edmonton-Strathcona nomination meeting.

""Mr. Kenney owes Albertans a full accounting, not just empty denials.... Mr. Kenney has demonstrated a profound absence of integrity, and Albertans deserve better.""

She later told reporters that it appeared more was going on than just communication between campaigns.

""It appears to me like people in Mr. Kenney's campaign were essentially running the other campaign,"" Notley said.

Derek Fildebrandt, a former UCP legislature member now running against Kenney as the head of the new Freedom Conservative party, said in a statement the documents show Kenney's ""willingness to do or say anything to obtain power; to corrupt and abuse the grassroots democratic promise to achieve his own ends.""

The allegations come at a super-heated time in Alberta politics.

Politicians return to the legislature Monday for a throne speech to begin a new session. The session could end at any time when Premier Rachel Notley decides to call the election.

By law, the 28-day campaign and vote must be held before June 1.

But critics say a new constitution, overseen by the generals, enshrines ...","Thailand's oldest party may be king-maker after vote to determine military role

By Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's oldest political party is heading into an election on Sunday with leader Abhisit Vejjajiva facing tough choices in the first polls since the military seized power in a 2014 coup.

Will Abhisit's pro-business, pro-establishment Democrat Party join with a new pro-military party in a coalition after the vote, likely extending the army's dominance of power?

Or will the Democrats band together with a ""pro-democracy front"" to keep the army out of government - but at the price of working with its bitter foe for 15 years: parties loyal to ousted populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

Or is there a third option, as Abhisit argues? One scenario could return Oxford-educated Abhisit to the prime minister's office, which he held from 2008 to 2011 after a court dissolved a pro-Thaksin government.

""We will be the alternative in leading Thailand out of the last decade of troubles,"" Abhisit, 54, told Reuters in an interview.

Prominent Democrats have been at the centre of Thailand's turbulent politics since 2005, with some party members leading anti-Thaksin ""Yellow Shirt"" protests against corruption that led to two military coups in a decade.

Sunday's election has been billed by the military government as returning Southeast Asia's second-largest economy to civilian, democratic rule. But critics say a new constitution, overseen by the generals, enshrines military influence over politics.

Doubts the army will truly give up power were heightened last month when a new pro-military party nominated junta chief and prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the 2014 coup, as its prime ministerial candidate.

Abhisit this month said in a campaign video he would not support Prayuth's staying on as prime minister, which he said would ""breed conflict and is against the Democrat party's principle that the people have the power"".

At the same time, Abhisit made clear he would be loath to work with the main pro-Thaksin party, Pheu Thai. The Democrats have long decried the Thaksin movement as corrupt and a threat to independent democratic institutions.

""I don't want dictatorship and I don't want corrupt people,” Abhisit said. ""Corrupt politicians provided the pretexts for the military to stage all the coups in the last 20 years.""

COMPROMISE PM?

Thaksin lives in self-exile to avoid a 2008 graft conviction he said was politically motivated but he retains widespread support, especially in the north and northeast.

The Democrats have traditionally drawn support from the Bangkok middle class and the south.

Abhisit's hopes for a third way could come to nothing in an election increasingly defined by the face-off between pro-military parties, which have Prayuth as their candidate for prime minister and electoral rules that give them an advantage, and an anti-military bloc with Thaksin's loyalists at its core.

While Abhisit has rejected Prayuth as prime minister, he has not ruled out a coalition with Palang Pracharat, the party that has nominated the junta leader.

Such a deal might see a ""compromise"" premier, perhaps Abhisit himself or another outside candidate.

The target for political parties is 376 seats in parliament - 50 percent plus one of the combined 250-seat upper house Senate and the 500-seat lower House of Representatives.

But with the junta appointing all 250 members of the Senate, no single party is likely to secure the 376 magic number on its own.

Given that the pro-military Palang Pracharat can count on the support of the Senate, it needs to win only 126 lower house seats to form a government.

By contrast, the parties opposed to a military role in government must win 376 seats in the lower house, three-quarters of the seats, to block the military from retaining control.

Still, most polls indicate Palang Pracharat won't win enough seats on its own meaning it would need coalition partners, with the Democrats a likely choice.

'NOT BLACK AND WHITE'

The Democrats have come second to pro-Thaksin parties in every election since 2001, including the last one in 2011, when they got 35 percent of the vote to Pheu Thai's 48 percent.

Opinion polls tend to show the Democrats coming second or third. The party will be competing for the anti-Thaksin vote with other parties, including Palang Pracharat.

The Democrat Party was founded in 1947 as a conservative, royalist movement, and has portrayed itself as a champion of civilian rule in a country that has seen 13 successful coups, even if at times it worked with military governments.

In 1992, the Democrats sided with anti-army demonstrators in an uprising that led to a bloody crackdown. The party won an election later that year but it was blamed for mishandling the wrenching fall-out of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which paved the way for the rise of telecoms tycoon Thaksin.

Amid polarisation in the 2000s, the Democrats benefited from the military's opposition to Thaksin, and at times called for military intervention to oust pro-Thaksin governments.

Abhisit has rejected efforts by Thaksin's loyalists to portray the election as a two-way fight between democracy and military-dominated rule.

""This election is not black and white, the country has more choices,"" he told Reuters.

Anti-junta parties, however, argue there is no neutrality or third way in the election.

""Abhisit says he will not join with Pheu Thai, but does that mean he will join with Palang Pracharat?"" asked Sudarat Keyuraphan, Pheu Thai's top prime ministerial candidate.

""There are only two sides,"" she said. ""So he must choose.""

She supports the ""Green New Deal,"" a Democratic plan proposed ...","The race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 is underway and wide open. Those who have filed paperwork or announced presidential bids include senators, House members and former lawmakers.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday joined the growing group of Democrats jostling to be president and positioned herself as the most prominent Midwestern candidate in the field, as her party tries to win back voters in a region that helped put Donald Trump in the White House.

""For every American, I'm running for you,"" she told an exuberant crowd gathered on a freezing, snowy afternoon at a park along the Mississippi River with the Minneapolis skyline in the background.

""And I promise you this: As your president, I will look you in the eye. I will tell you what I think. I will focus on getting things done. That's what I've done my whole life. And no matter what, I'll lead from the heart,"" the three-term senator said.

Klobuchar, who has prided herself for achieving results through bipartisan cooperation, did not utter Trump's name during her kickoff speech. But she did bemoan the conduct of ""foreign policy by tweet"" and said Americans must ""stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate. ... We all live in the same country of shared dreams."" And she said that on first day as president, she would have the U.S. rejoin an international climate agreement that Trump has withdrawn from.

Klobuchar Presses Barr on Government Shutdown

The Minnesota senator called the government shutdown an 'outrage,' and asked Barr what he would say to furloughed Justice Dept. employees. (Published Tuesday, Jan. 15, 2019)

Trump responded to Klobuchar's announcement with a tweet mocking her stance on global warming, a phenomenon he has disputed in the past. He wrote that Klobuchar talked proudly ""of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!"" Trump often overlooks evidence of record global warming and conflates cold spells and other incidents of weather with climate, which is long-term.

Klobuchar also spoke of the need to ""heal the heart of our democracy and renew our commitment to the common good.""

Asserting Midwestern values, she told a crowd warmed by hot chocolate, apple cider, heat lamps and bonfires: ""I don't have a political machine. I don't come from money. But what I do have is this: I have grit.""

Klobuchar, who easily won a third-term last year, has pointed to her broad appeal across Minnesota as she has discussed a 2020 run. She has drawn support from voters in urban, suburban and rural areas, including in dozens of counties Trump won in 2016.

She has said that success could translate to other Midwestern states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, reliably Democratic in presidential races for decades until Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton.

She said the country's ""sense of community is fracturing"" today, ""worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics. We are all tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, the gridlock and the grandstanding.""

Sen. Klobuchar to GOP Colleagues: ‘Where Is the Bravery In This Room?’

Senator Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., asks Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee why there is a rush to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court without a reopened FBI background investigation. (Published Friday, Sept. 28, 2018)

The list of Democrats already in the race features several better-known senators with the ability to raise huge amounts of money — Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

The field soon could expand to include prominent Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden of Delaware and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll conducted by Selzer & Company in December found that Klobuchar was largely unfamiliar to likely Iowa caucus-goers, with 54 percent saying they didn't know enough about her to have an opinion, while 38 percent had a favorable opinion and 8 percent had an unfavorable opinion.

""She starts out perhaps with a better understanding of Midwestern voters, but I think she faces the same hurdles every one of them face, which is: Are Iowans going to find them either the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump or the candidate that most aligns with their ideologies and issues?"" said John Norris, a longtime Iowa-based Democratic strategist. ""I don't know that coming from Minnesota gives her any advantage with Iowans.""

Klobuchar, 58, is known as a straight-shooting, pragmatist willing to work with Republicans, making her one of the Senate's most productive members at passing legislation.

The rally took place not far from the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi. The span was built after the previous bridge collapsed in 2007, killing 13 people. Klobuchar had worked with then Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., to help fund the new bridge and get it completed at a faster-than-usual pace.

Trump Doesn't See White Nationalism as a Rising Threat

President Donald Trump on Friday declined to join expressions of concern about white nationalism, saying ""I don't, really"" when asked whether he thought it was a rising threat around the world. (Published Friday, March 15, 2019)

""We worked across the aisle to get the federal funding and we rebuilt that I-35W bridge — in just over a year. That's community. That's a shared story. That's ordinary people doing extraordinary things,"" she said.

Klobuchar's focus in recent months has included prescription drug prices, a new farm bill and election security. She supports the ""Green New Deal,"" a Democratic plan proposed this past week to combat climate change and create thousands of jobs in renewable energy.

But her legislative record has drawn criticism from both the GOP and some fellow Democrats. Some Republicans say Klobuchar is able to get things done because she pushes smaller issues. Some progressives say she lacks the kind of fire and bold ideas needed to bring significant change and excite voters.

Klobuchar on Sunday also responded to reports in BuzzFeed and HuffPost that she has mistreated staff, saying she ""can be tough"" but has many staff members who've worked for her for many years.

""I can push people. I know that,"" she told reporters after the event. ""I have I'd say high expectations for myself, I have high expectations for the people who work for me, but I have high expectations for this country. And that's what we need. We need someone who is focused on getting things done for this country.""

Klobuchar, a lawyer and the former prosecutor in Minnesota's largest county, raised her national profile during a Senate Judiciary Committee last fall for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman when they were both in high school.

CAIR Leader Calls for Trump to More Clearly Condemn Anti-Muslim Terrorism

Niwad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, responded Friday to the terrorist attacks on mosques in New Zealand. He called on President Donald Trump to “condemn this, not only as a hate crime, but as a white supremacist terrorist attack.” (Published Friday, March 15, 2019)

When Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh whether he ever had had so much to drink that he didn't remember what happened, he turned the question around. He asked Klobuchar, ""Have you?""

Unruffled, Klobuchar continued as Kavanaugh asked again. Kavanaugh later apologized to Klobuchar, whose father is an alcoholic.

""When you have a parent who's an alcoholic, you're pretty careful about drinking,"" she said. ""I was truly trying to get to the bottom of the facts and the evidence.""

Among the other Midwestern lawmakers who could also seek the nomination are Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who has been visiting early voting states, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who established an exploratory committee last month.

Klobuchar campaigned with Democrats in Iowa last fall, and in December spoke to progressive farmers and activists about the importance of bridging the divide between urban and rural areas. She said the lesson learned after the 2016 election was ""we are not going to leave the Midwest behind.""

""This is the moment for the Midwest,"" she said, ""and we don't want to be forgotten again in a national election.""

Outside Parliament there is — the Social Democratic Party, which is growing rapidly and ticks all those boxes I mentioned above. I joined them recently. But otherwise we have a House of Commons ...","THERE are krill, living in the darkest reaches of the Atlantic Ocean, that would have made a better job of managing Brexit than our politicians.

I don’t think there has been a more intellectually challenged regime in the world since the famous — and fictitious — Dermot The F***wit presided over part of Ireland in the 12th century.

HOC/JESSICA TAYLOR 6 The party divides in the House of Commons do not remotely match the divide which exists in our country

I suspect the death knell has sounded for Brexit. I always reckoned they — our betters — would never let it happen. Yes, it’s a betrayal of democracy and we should be angry. We should march and stuff.

But it won’t do much good. Because this is what happens when you have a House of Commons, House of Lords, Civil Service and broadcast media all massively in favour of Remain, against the wishes of the majority of the people.

There are ten parties in the House of Commons, if you count Sinn Fein (who don’t take their seats). Nine are by a majority in favour of Remain.

Recently, a new group of so-called Independents formed, drawn from the Labour and Conservative parties. They are even MORE in favour of Remain. So a proper Brexit was never going to get through.

But it’s not just Brexit. On loads of other issues, the party divides in the House of Commons do not remotely match the divide which exists in our country. That’s because all of the parties in Parliament are basically liberal, except for the tiny DUP.

So, take immigration. All of them are in favour of the vast numbers entering the country each year. While more than 80 per cent of the British people want an end to untrammelled immigration.

POLITICS MUST CHANGE

It’s a Conservative government which is insisting that junior school kids be taught about transgenderism, same-sex partnerships and so on. None of the major parties will stick up for the traditional family — which often offers the best outcomes for children.

But all of the major parties will stick up for Islam, despite the sincere reservations many of the rest of us harbour. They are scared of taking tough action against jihadis who return here from Syria. Most of us would like them booted out of the country, right now.

And they act like this because they are liberals — a dying political creed which is on the run across Europe and the USA and South America. And which has never been very popular in Asia.

I think we need to spend more money on stuff like the NHS, housing and regional development. I think there’s a corrosive divide in the UK between North and South and between the haves and have- nots. I like the idea of our railways being in state hands. That should make me a Labour supporter.

Getty Images - Getty 6 I cannot support Labour because of their generosity in handing out taxpayers’ money to the perpetually idle

But I cannot abide that anti-Semitic rabble, their loathing of the UK and the nation state — and their support for every form of victimhood which raises its screeching head. Or their support for anti-Western, racist terrorists and failed communist states. Nor, indeed, their generosity in handing out taxpayers’ money to the perpetually idle. My rule is, if you don’t give, you don’t get.

My guess is a lot of people feel the same way. But in the House of Commons there is no party to vote for which squares that circle. Outside Parliament there is — the Social Democratic Party, which is growing rapidly and ticks all those boxes I mentioned above. I joined them recently.

But otherwise we have a House of Commons which, on a whole bunch of crucial issues, does not reflect the opinion of the majority of the country.

If this Brexit catastrophe tells us anything, it’s that our politics MUST change. The people must be given a voice.

Crowded island AIR pollution in the UK causes more deaths every year than smoking, according to a new report. And nine million people in the world die every year as a consequence of global air pollution. These are pretty shocking statistics. But two thoughts occur. First, almost everything we’ve done to reduce air pollution hasn’t worked. For example, we tried to force everyone to drive diesel cars. Then discovered they were even worse than petrol engines. Second, isn’t it simply because there are more and more of us on this crowded island and on this crowded planet?

All the goblin latest

NEWS just in from Africa. Evil goblins have apparently been terrorising a village in Zimbabwe.

Getty - Contributor 6 This column is often accused of failing to cover news concerning both Africa and goblins

Residents of Ziqaweni awake each morning to find their children have been eaten, their crops destroyed and their livestock slaughtered.

They can be complete b******s, these goblins, apparently.

One villager, who wished to remain anonymous in case the goblins got him, said: “Right now we don’t know how we will be helped because we believe these goblins can be killed but later on come back in full force.”

Well, indeed, it’s a tricky one.

The villagers are clubbing together to hire a “tsikamutanda” – a witch doctor – to cleanse the area.

A few months ago in Zimbabwe, goblins – possibly the same goblins – reportedly “took over” a maternity clinic in Lupaka and had sex with everybody in it, as they do.

This column is often accused of failing to cover news concerning both Africa and, indeed, goblins. I hope that this item has helped to redress the balance.

Russkies a waste of time RUSSKI scientists reckon they’ve made the world’s first time machine. It’s all a bit hard to explain but involves tiny subatomic particles behaving weirdly. But then tiny subatomic particles ALWAYS behave weirdly. So I wouldn’t get your hopes up yet that you’ll be able to swan back in time to say hello to Cleopatra, or watch Millwall hammer West Ham 4-1 on March 21, 2004 (and it should have been SIX). When some bloke in a strange silver suit comes up to me and says he’s from the year 2525 and he’s not actually from the local loony bin, I’ll believe in time travel. Because, as nobody, ever, has visited us from the future, that’s a pretty good clue that it’s impossible, no?

It is believed that the emergence of India ...","The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), founded by Ram Vilas Paswan, faces an uphill task of reasserting its political standing in the Lok Sabha elections, after the party chief has virtually passed on the baton to his son Chirag Paswan.

Serving his eighth term as the MP from Hajipur Lok Sabha seat, which Ram Vilas Paswan has won with record margins on more than one occasion, the septuagenarian leader has made it clear that he will not be contesting the polls and would seek re-entry into Parliament through the Rajya Sabha.

His party, however, will be contesting six out of the 40 seats in Bihar, the same number the LJP had won in 2014 in alliance with the BJP and chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United).

The success of his party in these six seats which include brother Ram Chandra Paswan’s Samastipur, and Jamui represented by Chirag Paswan would show the esteem in which people still hold the legacy of the union minister, whose frequent change of loyalties has earned him the colourful sobriquet ‘mausam vaigyanik’, meaning a weatherman who has the uncanny knack of sensing which way the wind blows.

The party had come into being in 2000 following a bitter feud with Sharad Yadav, the veteran socialist leader, who at that time headed the JD(U) with which Paswan was aligned.

Since 2002, Paswan has changed his loyalties, meeting with successes and failures, like his own defeat in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.

The JD(U)’s exit from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2013 made the BJP look for new allies and the opportunity was seized by Paswan.

It is believed that the emergence of India as a new economic power under Modi’s plank of development became an obvious justification for Paswan’s realignment in the larger interest of the people.

If voters re-endorse this plank of the NDA, ‘mausam’ (weather) would turn out to be favourable for the LJP too.

Okorocha, who was suspended by the Adams Oshiomhole-led APC National Working Committee, NWC, over anti-party activities, may be removed as the Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, despite his tenure ending less than 2 months from now.

Reports revealed that Governors under the aegis of Progressives Governors Forum, PGF, are allegedly plotting his removal as the Forum’s Chairman, as questions continue to grow on his moral right to paddle the Leadership of the Forum, following his suspension in February from the APC; and also, as a ploy to further punish the Governor.

It was gathered that the Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, is likely to take the position from the embattled Imo State Governor, if the Forum eventually sacks him at its next meeting.

According to the report, Okorocha, whose tenure ends on May 29, may find himself in the cesspool of mess, for his role in the Imo State APC crisis, which eventually led to the emergence of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the State Governorship election.

The unnamed source said: “Yes, there are attempts to remove him as Chairman of the APC Governors Forum. Those behind the plot are claiming that it is unlawful for him to preside over anything that has to do with the APC, having been suspended from the party.

“We have made it clear to them that suspension is different from expulsion. Until he is expelled from the party, the Governor remains a bonafide member of the party.

“Besides, the Governor has even rejected his suspension, saying the National Chairman lacks the power to suspend him, as a foundation member of APC.

“They are just trying all they could do to rubbish him before his tenure expires, in May. First, they dabbled into the Governorship primary of APC in Imo, and denied his favoured Candidate, Uche Nwosu, the ticket. The party paid dearly for it, as PDP reaped from the crisis.

“Later, they claimed he has been suspended from the party. Not done, they connived with INEC to deny him his Certificate of Return, as the duly elected Senator for Imo-West. Now, they are plotting to remove him as Chairman of APC Governors’ Forum, when he has just less than two months to handover.”

However, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Okorocha, Sam Onwuemeodo, laughed off the impeachment plot, adding that, his principal’s suspension by the APC NWC, does not affect his Leadership of the party’s Governorship Forum.

Onwuemeodo said: “I have not heard about it. This is my first time of hearing about it. He is presently the Chairman of the APC Governors Forum, and until anything to the contrary happens, he has no problem with the APC Governors. He has been working well with them, and they are on the same page on issues.”

But when did she take office and what did she say about the recent terror attacks on mosques? Here's everything you need to know.

Associated Press 1 New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaking to representatives of the Muslim community in Christchurch a day after the mass shootings at two mosques in the city

Who is Jacinda Ardern?

Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern was born on 26 July 1980 in Hamilton, New Zealand, the daughter of a police officer and a school catering assistant.

She joined New Zealand's Labour Party and became an active member in the Young Labour movement at an early stage in her life.

When she graduated from the University of Waikato with a degree in politics and public relations, Ardern moved to London to work as a senior policy adviser to Tony Blair.

She returned to New Zealand to become the youngest MP in its parliament in 2008 where she quickly rose through the ranks to become leader of the opposition by August 2017.

Although the National party won the highest share of the vote in the 2017 general election, it did not have enough seats to govern alone.

Instead, a coalition was established between New Zealand First and the Labour Party, naming Jacinda Ardern Prime Minister on October 26, 2017.

She is the third female prime minister of New Zealand and in June 2018 she became the second elected head of government in history to give birth while in office.

Ardern's political views have been described as progressive, social democratic and feminist.

Although she was raised a Mormon, she left the church in 2005 because it conflicted with her support for gay rights.

Ardern has been in a relationship with broadcaster Clarke Gayford since 2013, but the couple are not married.

What did she say about the terrorist attacks?

On March 15, white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, 28, stormed two mosques in Christchurch and massacred defenceless Muslim worshippers inside.

So far 50 people have died as a result of the attack and a further 50 were wounded in the rampage — part of which was livestreamed on Facebook.

Speaking shortly after the shooting, Ardern said: ""I'm advised that there were five guns used by the primary perpetrator.

""There were two semiautomatic weapons and two shotguns.

""The offender was in possession of a gun licence — I'm advised this was acquired in November of 2017.

""A lever-action firearm was also found.

""While work is being done as to the chain of events that led to both the holding of this gun licence and the possession of these weapons, I can tell you one thing right now: our gun laws will change.""

This spring, Ryerson University’s Faculty of Arts is launching the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson ...","× Expand John Garrison Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson Instructors believe the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson is an opportunity to elevate historically underrepresented groups.

In Canada, there are 338 members of parliament, 751 members of provincial and territorial legislatures and some 25,000 municipal councillors and mayors. Add to that the number of people who ran for office but were not elected, and Max Cameron, the director of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI), says there are currently more than 75,000 people across the country who are actively thinking about entering politics.

But Cameron believes that number could be higher, and its cohort more diverse, if only Canadians had a better understanding of the entry points and inner-workings of politics.

“There are so many good people who would never go into politics because they don’t find it appealing. They’re deterred by the idea of living in a fish bowl where everyone is looking at you or not wanting to deal with the attacks,” says Cameron. “But without those good people, it’s affecting the way our institutions are functioning.”

With this in mind, through the CSDI, the University of British Columbia launched a non-partisan “boot camp” in 2013 that teaches participants about the day-to-day life of Canadian politicians at the federal, provincial and city level, as well as experimenting with new concepts to improve our democratic institutions.

This spring, Ryerson University’s Faculty of Arts is launching the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson (IFLR), a program modelled after CSDI’s boot camp. Applications are now open and are due by April 1. The program, which costs $1,200, runs over three weekends in May and June and is open to anyone.

Unlike most professions, there’s no concrete training for politicians. The boot camp prepares the participants for the real world of politics, from learning the basics of parliamentary practices and procedures, to how to answer media questions, to how to pass legislation and work with other political parties. The participants also get advice from elected officials, scholars and political journalists who offer mentorship and share their experiences. So far, former NDP MP Peggy Nash and journalist Martin Regg Cohn are confirmed for the Ryerson program.

During the final weekend, participants will head to Ottawa for a mock parliamentary session at the House of Commons. The students will break into political parties, run caucus meetings and try to pass legislation, while also keeping up to date on breaking news and fielding questions from journalists.

Although some of the UBC program’s alumni have gone onto become politicians – like Heather Sweet who was elected to Alberta’s legislature, and Allison Patton, who is on Surrey’s city council – others have gone onto become elected officials in unions or as civil servants. “Whether a participant decides to run afterwards or not, they’ll know much better what the job of a parliamentarian entails,” says Cameron.

Hailey Graham participated in the UBC program in 2013 with political aspirations. “Politics is definitely for me and I think the Institute helped me realize it’s not for me right now, but one day,” says Graham, who is currently in law school in Vancouver.

One of the most enlightening experiences for Graham was learning how to become more self-reflective, something that’s prompted by the instructors throughout the program.

“One of my passions is to have more women in politics, so part of the reflective piece for me was thinking, ‘Who’s taking up space?’ or ‘Who is putting themselves forward into leadership positions right away?’ and ‘How do those people end up getting elected?’” says Graham. “The boot camp highlights those inconsistencies [between different groups of people].”

Cameron says integrating the self-reflective element – something the CSDI picked up from UBC’s medical school – is a way for participants to become better politicians. “It gives them the tools to listen, be more empathetic, find common ground and be able to work with people across party lines,” he says.

Instructors at both Ryerson and UBC’s programs believe that the boot camp is also an opportunity to help elevate groups who have historically been underrepresented in politics, like women, people of colour and LGBTQ- communities.

“For people who haven’t had a political voice or have been marginalized, [IFLR] helps them find ways in which they can articulate their own concerns and do it in the legislature,” says Pamela Sugiman, dean of Ryerson’s Faculty of Arts.

Cameron agrees.

“If you don’t encourage the people who are underrepresented to acquire the skills to be effective statespeople, then politics will be dominated by the same families and social classes as always. Part of our hope for the boot camp is to encourage more inclusion.”

Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images

WASHINGTON - Top Democrats are urging the FBI to investigate a Trump campaign donor who is the founder and onetime owner of a spa that has been implicated in a human-trafficking ring.

In a Friday letter to the FBI, Democrats on the House and Senate judiciary and intelligence panels wrote that reports about Li Yang ""raise serious counterintelligence concerns."" Yang’s company claimed it could provide Chinese clients with a chance to mingle and take photos with President Donald Trump, along with access to his private club in Palm Beach.

The Democrats said China has “frequently used non-traditional intelligence collectors and businesspersons to compromise targets” and asked for investigations into potential human trafficking, unlawful lobbying or campaign finance violations.

“Although Ms. Yang’s activities may only be those of an unscrupulous actor allegedly selling access to politicians for profit, her activities also could permit adversary governments or their agents access to these same politicians to acquire potential material for blackmail or even more nefarious purposes,” the Democrats wrote.

The Democrats asked the FBI to investigate whether authorities were previously aware of Yang’s activities, to what extent she has interacted with Trump and how she was invited to a Super Bowl party at his West Palm Beach country club, among other matters. Signing on to the letter were House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrats on the Senate intelligence and Judiciary panels.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York endorsed the request for an investigation in a joint statement, saying “the facts in this situation are very concerning.”

An FBI spokesperson said the agency has no comment on the letter.

The Miami Herald last week published a photo of Yang with Trump at the Super Bowl party and reported on the link between Yang and the spa where New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution. Kraft was charged in late February and has pleaded not guilty.

Yang, a former owner of the spa, wasn’t charged in a multiagency anti-human-trafficking operation that resulted in 25 arrests, including Kraft’s, and shut down 10 Asian day spas in South Florida last month. None of the spas is registered to Yang or her family.

A company Yang registered in 2017, GY US Investments LLC, “provides public relations services to assist businesses in America to establish and expand their brand image in the modern Chinese marketplace,” according to a translation of the company’s now-defunct website, which is mostly in Chinese.

That has included, the website claims, access to presidential dinners and roundtables, White House events, photo opportunities and “VIP” activities including the “opportunity to interact with the president, the Minister of Commerce and other political figures.”

The site also featured numerous photographs, including a picture of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club and photographs of Yang with Trump. Yang is described on the website as the company’s “Founder CEO,” as well as a member of a “Presidential Fundraising Committee” and a “Presidential club member.”

The FBI request comes as House Democrats have launched investigations into all aspects of Trump’s White House, businesses and foreign financial dealings. Also Monday, a deadline passed for 81 people, businesses and organizations to respond to a broad document request issued by Nadler’s Judiciary panel earlier this month.

Without naming names, Nadler said in a statement that the committee has already received “tens of thousands” of documents from “a large number” of recipients. He said some have requested a subpoena before they are comfortable complying.

“It is my hope that we will receive cooperation from the remainder of the list, and will be working to find an appropriate accommodation with any individual who may be reluctant to cooperate with our investigation,” Nadler said.

157,,2019-03-19T09:58:00.0000000Z,"NEW YORK (AP) - President Donald Trump played down any threat ... was accused of mailing explosives last fall to Democratic Party officials and media members, many of whom had been criticized by the president. The president said Sayoc had been ""insane ...","President Donald Trump played down any threat posed by racist white nationalism after the gunman accused of the New Zealand mosque massacre called the president ""a symbol of renewed white identity.""

Trump, whose own previous responses to the movement have drawn scrutiny, expressed sympathy for the victims who died at ""places of worship turned into scenes of evil killing."" But he declined to join expressions of mounting concern about white nationalism, When asked whether he thought it was a rising threat around the world, he responded, ""I don't really.""

""I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess,"" Trump said. ""If you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case. I don't know enough about it yet. But it's certainly a terrible thing.""

Trump was asked about white nationalism and the shooting deaths of 49 people at mosques in Christchurch after he formally vetoed Congress' resolution to block his declaration of a national emergency at the Mexico border. His veto, aimed at freeing money to build more miles of a border wall against illegal immigration, is expected to survive any congressional effort to overturn it.

Questioned about the accused gunman's reference to him, Trump professed ignorance.

""I didn't see it. I didn't see it,"" he said. ""But I think it's a horrible event ... a horrible, disgraceful thing and a horrible act.""

The man accused of the shootings, whose name was not immediately released, left behind a lengthy document that outlined his motivations. He proudly stated that he was a 28-year-old Australian white nationalist who hates immigrants and was set off by attacks in Europe that were perpetrated by Muslims. In a single reference, he mentioned the U.S. president.

""Were/are you a supporter of Donald Trump?"" was one of the questions he posed to himself. His answer: ""As a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure. As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no.""

The White House immediately denounced the connection. But the mention from the suspect, who embraced Nazi imagery and voiced support for fascism, nonetheless cast an uncomfortable light on the way that the president has been embraced by some on the far right.

Trump, who as a candidate proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, has drawn criticism as being slow to condemn white supremacy and related violence. After a 2017 clash between white nationalists and anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one demonstrator dead, Trump said there were ""very fine people on both sides"" of the confrontation. He also did not immediately reject the support of David Duke, a former KKK Grand Wizard, during his presidential campaign.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., tied Trump's inflammatory language to the violence half a world away.

""Words have consequences like saying we have an invasion on our border and talking about people as though they were different in some fatal way,"" Blumenthal said on CNN. ""I think that the public discourse from the president on down is a factor in some of these actions.""

Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who declared his Democratic candidacy for president this week, said, ""We must call out this hatred, this Islamophobia, this intolerance, and the violence that predictably follows from the rhetoric that we use.""

The White House, in comments before those remarks, rejected any link to Trump.

""It's outrageous to even make that connection between this deranged individual that committed this evil crime to the president who has repeatedly condemned bigotry, racism and made it very clear that this is a terrorist attack,"" Mercedes Schlapp, the White House's director of strategic communication, told reporters. ""We are there to support and stand with the people of New Zealand.""

Trump himself telephoned New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, offering condolences, prayers and any help the U.S. might be able to provide. She told reporters she answered, ""My message was: to offer sympathy and love to all Muslim communities.""

Trump's hardline immigration rhetoric and calls to return America to its traditional past have been embraced by many on the conservative fringes, including some who troll online with racist imagery, as well as white supremacists who have looked to engage in violence.

In Florida, Cesar Sayoc, who had decorated his van with Trump propaganda, was accused of mailing explosives last fall to Democratic Party officials and media members, many of whom had been criticized by the president. The president said Sayoc had been ""insane"" long before he became a Trump fan.

Last month, a former Coast Guard official was accused of stockpiling weapons in a plot to kill media members and liberal politicians as part of a plan to transform the U.S. into a white ethno-state. It took more than a week for Trump to respond to the plot, which he deemed ""a shame.""

Many experts who track violent extremists have identified white nationalism as a growing threat in the U.S. and abroad. In January, for example, the New York-based Anti-Defamation League said that domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S. in 2018, up from 37 in 2017, and said, ""White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case.""

Some critics have accused U.S. authorities of not dedicating adequate resources to stem a threat of domestic terrorism. However, The Washington Post reported last week that internal FBI data showed more domestic terror suspects were arrested last year than those allegedly inspired by international terror groups.

May is due attend what could be her last summit as leader of an EU member-state. The UK is due to leave the EU on March 29, but even if the agreement is passed next week, the exit date will need to be extended to allow time to pass the necessary legislation.

Seeking an ‘honourable compromise’, May on Sunday told rebel MPs that failure to pass the agreement next week would mean the UK not leaving the European Union “for many months, if ever”. Ministers said the agreement may not be re-introduced if minds do not change soon.

Chancellor Philip Hammond said Sunday morning that even if the agreement musters a majority, a short extension will be needed: “It is physically impossible to leave on 29 March, but we would be able to leave very soon”.

“But if we are unable to do that - if we are unable to bring a majority together to support what in my view is a very good deal for Britain - then we will have to look at a longer extension and we are in uncharted territory,” he told BBC.

Asked if a vote would be sought on the agreement next week, he said it would depend on the growth in support from among the MPs who voted against it in January and last week, including the Democratic Unionist Party that is propping up the minority May government.

“We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues and the DUP are prepared to support it so we can get it through Parliament. We are not just going to keep presenting it if we haven’t moved the dial,” Hammond added.

Holding the prospect of Brexit not happening at all, May has been meeting groups of MPs and used an article in The Sunday Telegraph to try and change minds. Some rebels have indicated they would now support the agreement by “holding the nose”, if only to ensure the UK leaves the EU on the due date of March 29.

The opposition Labour has been working to seek support for the idea that the agreement could be supported subject to a new ‘confirmatory referendum’.

May wrote that it would be a “potent symbol of Parliament’s collective political failure” if a delay to Brexit meant the UK was forced to take part in elections to the European Parliament in May, nearly three years after voting to leave the EU.

May admitted that she had more to do to convince rebel MPs in her party and outside to support the agreement, including the DUP: “I am convinced that the time to define ourselves by how we voted in 2016 must now end”.

“We can only put those old labels aside if we stand together as democrats and patriots, pragmatically making the honourable compromises necessary to heal division and move forward.”

She said she faced pressure from 11 people, including the prime minister and his staff, to intervene after SNC-Lavalin was not offered a deal to avoid a criminal trial.

“For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere … in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin,” she said.

The company is facing fraud and corruption charges related to its past operations in Libya.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday cited an ""erosion of trust"" and a breakdown in communications between his office and a former Cabinet minister for the eruption of a brewing scandal seven months ahead of national elections.

Defending himself and his government in a controversy that could threaten his and his Liberal Party's political future, Trudeau acknowledged improvements can be made in how officials communicate and foster openness.

""There was no breakdown of our systems, of our rule of law, of the integrity of our institutions,"" he told reporters in Ottawa.

Trudeau's former minister of justice and attorney general has said she was pressured to help a Quebec-based construction company to settle a pending criminal case amid allegations it bribed officials in Libya for government contracts, The Globe and Mail reported last month.

The official, Jody Wilson-Raybould, later alleged in testimony before the House Justice Committee that she faced ""veiled threats"" and ""sustained"" pressure to help Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin. If convicted, the company -- with 9,000 employees in Canada and thousands more worldwide -- would be barred for a decade from getting government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould resigned in February from Trudeau's Cabinet. Trudeau's top aide, Gerald Butts, also resigned last month, denying accusations he pressured Wilson-Raybould. Another Cabinet member, Jane Philpott, resigned this week, saying she'd lost confidence in the government's inquiry into the allegations of pressure.

Trudeau on Thursday described an apparent disconnect between his office and Wilson-Raybould, though he said he was unaware of any problem at the time. Officials need to ""feel comfortable coming to me"" with concerns, he said.

""In regards to standing up for jobs and defending the integrity of the rule of law, I continue to say there was no inappropriate pressure,"" the Prime Minister said.

Trudeau called the issue involving SNC-Lavalin ""a tough one."" He said he's fighting to protect Canadian jobs but also noted the company is facing criminal charges and his country could face job losses.

""They directly or indirectly put food on the table for countless families as one of Canada's major employers,"" Trudeau said. ""But they are also a company facing serious criminal charges.""

Such situations, he said, ""make governing a challenge. And when there's an erosion of trust within the people involved, it further complicates what is already a difficult decision for the attorney general.""

Trudeau said his team and everyone in his government has been focused on protecting jobs, and he stressed that ""the rule of law remains fully intact.""

Saying he has taken many lessons from the recent ""tough"" weeks, Trudeau announced the administration will seek external expert opinions on the issues raised. Measures will be put in place ""to improve the way my office works"" when it interacts with ministers and caucus members, he said.

Murray, a Vancouver MP, is a former provincial cabinet minister and has been parliamentary secretary to the Treasury Board president for several years. Her appointment maintains the Trudeau cabinet's gender balance.

Murray, who also was named the new minister of Digital Government, is one of 34 Liberal MPs who survived the party's rout in the 2011 election.

Philpott quit cabinet at the beginning of the month, citing a loss of confidence in how the government has responded to the SNC-Lavalin affair. Former attorney general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould alleges she was inappropriately pressured to help the Quebec-based engineering firm secure a special legal agreement on charges of bribery and fraud.

This cabinet change — Trudeau's third in three months — was driven by a series of resignations, starting with former Treasury Board president Scott Brison, then Wilson-Raybould from her new posting at Veterans Affairs, then Philpott. Brison has retired from federal politics, while Philpott and Wilson-Raybould have expressed their intention to stay in the Liberal caucus despite leaving Trudeau's top team.

Speaking to reporters after her swearing-in ceremony, Murray said it's ""great"" Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are remaining in caucus.

""They're part of our team, and I hope that will continue to be the case.""

Backs Trudeau on TMX

Murray, who was opposed to the government's decision to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, said Monday it's her job to represent the views of her constituents, while it's the job of cabinet and the prime minister to consider the best interests of the country.

""I will never accept that the pipeline is negative for climate change, because in fact it brought Alberta into the pan-Canadian framework, taking significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so that we can meet our objectives as a country,"" she said.

Murray said the two key areas of concern with Trans Mountain — marine environment protection and consultation with Indigenous groups — are now being addressed.

Trudeau did not answer questions from reporters at Rideau Hall. He welcomed Murray to cabinet on Twitter, calling her a ""trusted voice for her community"" and noting she has spent 25 years as a successful businesswoman and environmental advocate.

On March 5, the day after Philpott resigned, Murray issued an open letter to her constituents expressing ""absolute confidence"" in the integrity of the prime minister. She praised the work the Liberal caucus is doing on climate action, poverty alleviation, housing affordability and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, among other issues.

“Canadians expect and deserve to have faith in their institutions and the people who serve within them.

“She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the Cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada.”

McLellan had been scheduled to participate in a Liberal Party fundraiser on March 31 to support getting more women candidates for the party.

A spokesperson for the Liberal Party says she will not longer do so given her appointment.

Her appointment quickly prompted jeers and laughter from the opposition benches, with Conservatives questioning her ability to provide impartial examinations and recommendations given she served with Liberal members who still sit in caucus and in cabinet, including Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale.

“She’s a former Liberal minister that was there during the sponsorship scandal,” said Mark Strahl, Conservative whip.

“This is like a five-alarm dumpster fire,” said NDP MP Charlie Angus.

McLellan is a senior adviser in the Edmonton office of national law firm Bennett Jones LLP.

She became an MP for the riding of Edmonton Northwest in 1993 and was soon after named as minister of natural resources.

She served under former Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien as minister of justice and attorney general from 1997 until 2002, then as minister of health from 2002 to 2003, then lost her seat in 2006 when former prime minister Paul Martin was defeated.

Her appointment came just minutes after Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick announced he will retire early amid questions over his role in the SNC-Lavalin affair and two days after a report by the Globe and Mail that Trudeau and senior officials in his office have retained legal counsel in the controversy.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is calling on people of all political stripes to turn the page on hateful ideology by condemning intolerance following the killing of 50 Muslims in New Zealand.

A visibly angry Trudeau denounced the “small, toxic segments” of society that peddle the belief diversity is a weakness, spewing hatred and inciting violence.

Hate groups “are alive in Canada,” Trudeau told the House of Commons on Monday as party leaders expressed solidarity with the victims in Christchurch and their families.

Trudeau expressed sorrow at the many attacks in recent years that have taken the lives of defenceless people at temples, churches, synagogues, concerts, schools and malls.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale suggested the deadly mass shooting in New Zealand will spur parliamentarians to take a careful look at Canada’s gun laws.

The massacre has sparked a global sense of concern that will prompt Canadian politicians to make some timely decisions, Goodale said Monday after appearing before a Senate committee.

Goodale said his cabinet colleague Bill Blair will deliver recommendations soon, after having been asked last August to study a full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada.

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, says gun-law reforms will be announced within days in that country.

A bill already before Canada’s Senate would, among other things, expand the scope of background checks on those who want to acquire guns here.

165,Canada,2019-03-18T20:59:00.0000000Z,OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's newest cabinet minister says she wants to move on from the controversy that has resulted in her appointment to president of the Treasury Board.,"

Mike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau turned Monday to erstwhile leadership rival Joyce Murray to fill the second void in his cabinet triggered by the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In his third shuffle in two months, Trudeau elevated the veteran Vancouver MP to president of the Treasury Board, a cabinet slot vacated two weeks ago by Jane Philpott.

Philpott resigned in solidarity with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit last month amid allegations she was improperly pressured by Trudeau, his staff and others to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on bribery and corruption charges related to contracts in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould's departure came one month after she was moved out of the prestigious justice portfolio and into Veterans Affairs in a small mid-January shuffle prompted by Scott Brison's retirement from politics. Her exit precipitated another small shuffle on Mar. 1, but then Philpott resigned a few days later, saying she no longer had confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

Had Trudeau named Murray to Brison's vacated spot at Treasury Board back in January, it's likely the entire controversy over the Montreal engineering giant would have been avoided.

Murray, who finished a distant second behind Trudeau in the Liberal party's 2013 leadership race, said it's time to move on from the controversy and focus on the government's efforts to reduce poverty, tackle climate change and create jobs.

“The past few weeks have been difficult, and I have expressed my confidence in our prime minister and our support for the work we are doing on behalf of Canadians,” she said following a swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall.

“We all want to work together to further that agenda over the coming months until the October election.”

Murray said she looks forward to having Philpott and Wilson-Raybould continue in the Liberal caucus under Trudeau's leadership, if that's their choice. But she said she doesn't need to hear any more from Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin issue.

The prime minister has been clear there was “a failure of communication,” said Murray. “He will be leading our team in looking at how we can do better.”

Wilson-Raybould, who testified at the House of Commons justice committee for nearly four hours, has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period after she was moved to Veterans Affairs, which was not covered by a waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality. However, the Liberals are so far using their majority to try to shut the matter down, blocking opposition parties' efforts to recall Wilson-Raybould at committee.

Murray, 64, was first elected in 2008 in Vancouver Quadra. She had served previously as a minister in British Columbia's provincial government. Her appointment to cabinet is a promotion from her role as parliamentary secretary to the president of the Treasury Board. It also allows Trudeau to maintain gender balance around the cabinet table.

Treasury Board is a less visible ministry concerned with the nuts and bolts of government operations, but it has the potential for scandal if it falters in its stewardship of federal spending.

Last month, Murray and her family dealt with a personal ordeal when her son had to be medically evacuated from Mexico to Vancouver after suffering severe injuries during his honeymoon in Cancun. Erik Brinkman fell from a height and underwent extensive surgery in Mexico to stabilize multiple fractures.

Murray said Monday her son is continuing his recovery in Vancouver General Hospital: “He's healing well; he's in great spirits.”

Conservatives and New Democrats were less than impressed when Justin Trudeau rolled out three big steps on Monday to address the damage of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

So the test of Trudeau’s fix-it measures isn’t whether they placate the critics, but whether they help bring Liberals back to the fold in the days ahead. That in fact may be a theme of the week — or even this entire election year.

Disaffected Liberals — and former minister Jody Wilson-Raybould in particular — are clearly the top-of-mind concern for the prime minister in this new repair effort he’s launched.

The departure of Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick is significant. As testimony has unfolded at the Commons justice committee, it became evident that much of the “undue pressure” on Wilson-Raybould came from Wernick himself.

All of that came from Wilson-Raybould’s own, searing testimony a few weeks ago.

It was Wernick who had multiple conversations with Wilson-Raybould on subjects ranging from the prime minister’s mood, to the looming Quebec election, to SNC-Lavalin’s economic worries. It was Wernick who took a call from SNC-Lavalin board chair (and former clerk) Kevin Lynch at one point last fall and who talked to Wilson-Raybould about the need to consider an upcoming board meeting at SNC-Lavalin and possible relocation of headquarters if she failed to give the Quebec firm a plea deal on corruption charges.

Wernick talked in his exit statement on Monday about how the opposition had lost confidence in him — which is true. It’s also true that he needed the opposition parties’ confidence to do his job on election oversight later this year.

But if Trudeau is interested in keeping Wilson-Raybould in caucus, Wernick’s departure could be reassuring, if not a price for regaining her confidence in the prime minister.

Then there’s the appointment of McLellan, who also served as a long-time justice minister in past Liberal governments. Conservatives and New Democrats mocked this measure as “Liberals judging Liberals,” but McLellan has been appointed to address a concern that has arisen in this whole SNC-Lavalin saga — one that Wilson-Raybould has addressed herself.

This is, namely, the question of whether it’s time to separate the jobs of justice minister and attorney-general, to eliminate any blurring of lines between legal and political functions.

McLellan has already served the Trudeau government as lead adviser on introducing cannabis legalization — which went well, despite predictions of chaos or reefer madness in the streets.

Moreover, it’s precisely her connection to past Liberal governments that could prove to be an asset for Trudeau, much criticized for keeping veteran Liberals at arms’ length from his government. Bringing McLellan into the SNC-Lavalin repair effort signals to diehard Liberals that voices of the past aren’t being totally discounted by the Trudeau team, as is often alleged.

That brings us to the cabinet shuffle on Monday as well.

Many Liberals were surprised, even disappointed when Trudeau failed to put Vancouver MP Joyce Murray into his first cabinet in 2015. Murray ran a strong second to Trudeau in his leadership race and it’s customary for prime ministers to include former rivals in the cabinet. (The exception was Paul Martin, who expelled Sheila Copps from the ministry when he was sworn into office in 2003.)

Murray has been a team player, even as Trudeau turned his back on democratic reform — one of her big issues in the leadership. She also made it clear that she disagreed with the Liberal government’s purchase of the Trans-Mountain pipeline.

Murray isn’t the only Liberal disappointed in these decisions; she in fact symbolizes some disenchantment that has set in within Liberal ranks about the way that Trudeau in office has failed to live up to the promise of Trudeau on the campaign trail.

By putting Murray in cabinet, Trudeau is again sending a signal to Liberals: you can disagree with the PMO and stay in the fold; that the Liberal caucus and government is big enough to handle disparate views. And yes, that includes differences that Wilson-Raybould has expressed — or those expressed by former minister Jane Philpott, another casualty of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

On Wednesday, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould will be at the big Liberal caucus meeting, and one item on the agenda is whether they can remain in caucus after expressing dissent with the PM’s leadership.

The wider question, though, is whether Trudeau has replied to that dissent — and wider disenchantment that has set into Liberal ranks because of the SNC-Lavalin saga.

The measures rolled out on Monday are that reply. Trudeau may have had his eyes on the opposition on Monday when he talked in the Commons about addressing the SNC-Lavalin concerns, but his words and repair efforts were aimed at Liberals sitting beside and behind him.

Sometimes, the devil is in the details.

Less than a week ago, I wrote a tongue-in-cheek article in which Lucifer himself offered political advice to Justin Trudeau to deal with the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

Foremost was a recommendation to dump the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick, who was deeply involved in this political mess.

The devil told Trudeau that he had to fire Wernick for this scandal to die down.

""The public wants a corpse,"" Lucifer said, ""and for you to show that you realize what you did was wrong.""

Today, Trudeau declared that Wernick had announced his ""upcoming retirement following nearly 38 years of distinguished public service"".

So no, Canada's top civil servant wasn't fired. He just chose to take his pension voluntarily in the midst of the biggest headache of Trudeau's political career.

The incoming clerk of the Privy Council will be Ian Shugart.

Trudeau also appointed Vancouver Quadra MP Joyce Murray to cabinet today.

Coincidentally, she also came up in the devil's conversation with Trudeau.

Justin Trudeau overlooked Joyce Murray when he chose his first cabinet, but now she's made it into the inner circle. Stephen Hui

Lucifer told Trudeau last week that he had appointed too many featherweights to his inner circle.

""Who should I have put in cabinet?"" Trudeau asked.

""David McGuinty. Judy Sgro. Wayne Easter. Arif Virani. Joyce Murray. Adam Vaughan. Anthony Housefather,"" Lucifer responded. ""I could give you more names if you like.""

""No. That's enough,"" Trudeau replied.

So far, the prime minister still hasn't followed up on some of the devil's other tips, such as being photographed with skater Patrick Chan and former Liberal cabinet minister Herb Dhaliwal.

Nor has Trudeau reappointed Jody Wilson-Raybould as attorney general, despite a suggestion to do this by Straight contributor Martyn Brown.

But the Liberal head honcho took one step closer to doing this by naming a former justice minister and attorney general, Anne McLellan, to review whether those offices should be separated.

Wilson-Raybould’s departure came one month after she was moved out of the prestigious justice portfolio and into Veterans Affairs in a small mid-January shuffle prompted by Scott Brison’s retirement from politics. Her exit precipitated another small shuffle on Mar. 1, but then Philpott resigned a few days later, saying she no longer had confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

Had Trudeau named Murray to Brison’s vacated spot at Treasury Board back in January, it’s likely the entire controversy over the Montreal engineering giant would have been avoided.

Murray, who finished a distant second behind Trudeau in the Liberal party’s 2013 leadership race, said it’s time to move on from the controversy and focus on the government’s efforts to reduce poverty, tackle climate change and create jobs.

“The past few weeks have been difficult, and I have expressed my confidence in our prime minister and our support for the work we are doing on behalf of Canadians,” she said following a swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall.

“We all want to work together to further that agenda over the coming months until the October election.”

Murray said she looks forward to having Philpott and Wilson-Raybould continue in the Liberal caucus under Trudeau’s leadership, if that’s their choice. But she said she doesn’t need to hear any more from Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin issue.

The prime minister has been clear there was “a failure of communication,” said Murray. “He will be leading our team in looking at how we can do better.”

Wilson-Raybould, who testified at the House of Commons justice committee for nearly four hours, has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period after she was moved to Veterans Affairs, which was not covered by a waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality. However, the Liberals are so far using their majority to try to shut the matter down, blocking opposition parties’ efforts to recall Wilson-Raybould at committee.

Murray, 64, was first elected in 2008 in Vancouver Quadra. She had served previously as a minister in British Columbia’s provincial government. Her appointment to cabinet is a promotion from her role as parliamentary secretary to the president of the Treasury Board. It also allows Trudeau to maintain gender balance around the cabinet table.

Treasury Board is a less visible ministry concerned with the nuts and bolts of government operations, but it has the potential for scandal if it falters in its stewardship of federal spending.

Last month, Murray and her family dealt with a personal ordeal when her son had to be medically evacuated from Mexico to Vancouver after suffering severe injuries during his honeymoon in Cancun. Erik Brinkman fell from a height and underwent extensive surgery in Mexico to stabilize multiple fractures.

Murray said Monday her son is continuing his recovery in Vancouver General Hospital: “He’s healing well; he’s in great spirits.”

The move to promote Murray comes after Ontario MP Jane Philpott quit the cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

Murray, 64, was elected in 2008 and served previously as a minister in B.C.’s provincial government. She was also one of a handful of MPs to make a run for the Liberal party leadership in 2012.

In January, Trudeau moved Jody Wilson-Raybould to Veterans Affairs from the justice portfolio, which went to David Lametti, in a medium-sized shuffle sparked by minister Scott Brison’s retirement from politics.

Then the prime minister made changes to fill the void left by Wilson-Raybould after she quit cabinet and said she had been pressured to stop the trial of SNC-Lavalin on bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya.

A few days after that mini-shuffle, Philpott resigned as Treasury Board president, saying she had lost confidence in Trudeau’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Trudeau cabinet shuffle puts Joyce Murray in top Treasury Board spot; Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick announces retirement

Story continues below advertisement

For the third time in three months, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has shuffled his cabinet, naming Vancouver MP Joyce Murray as Treasury Board President. Ms. Murray was previously the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury Board President and the Minister of Digital Government – the dual portfolio she will now oversee as minister. She replaces Jane Philpott, who resigned earlier this month, saying she had lost confidence in the Liberal cabinet (for subscribers) over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In the shuffle that saw Ms. Philpott replace Scott Brison at Treasury Board, Jody Wilson-Raybold was moved from the justice portfolio and the attorney-general role to veterans affairs, in what many saw as a demotion. As The Globe and Mail first reported last month, the Prime Minister’s Office had tried to press Ms. Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the bribery and fraud prosecution of SNC-Lavalin (for subscribers). She later testified to the House justice committee that she faced “consistent and sustained” political pressure from the Prime Minister and his top officials, including “veiled threats.”

Separately today, Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, one of the figures at the centre of the SNC-Lavalin affair, announced his retirement from public service, citing “recent events” that left him unable to serve during the 2019 federal election. He will be replaced by Ian Shugart, currently the deputy minister of foreign affairs.

As for Ms. Philpott, those close to her say she will be assessing her role in the federal Liberal Party over the next few months (for subscribers).

In the wake of the SNC-Lavalin affair, Mr. Trudeau announced in the House of Commons today that he has named former justice minister Anne McLellan as a special adviser on whether to divide the roles of justice minister and attorney-general.

Vice-Admiral Mark Norman’s defence team says Justice Department tweeted ‘inaccurate’ information about case

Story continues below advertisement

In an Ottawa court today, Vice-Admiral Mark Norman’s defence team accused the Department of Justice of tweeting inaccurate information about the court’s proceedings.

Defence lawyer Marie Henein said at a pretrial hearing that after some back and forth between her office and the department, the tweets had been deleted and changes had been made to fact sheets the department included in the tweets.

She said she wanted to put it on the record and that while she won’t say more now, the defence takes issue with the statements posted, and questioned why they would be posted in the first place.

Vice-Adm. Norman was suspended as the military’s second-in-command on Jan. 16, 2017, and charged last year with breach of trust for allegedly leaking government secrets in an attempt to influence cabinet’s decision on a $700-million shipbuilding contract with Quebec’s Davie shipyard. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Dutch police arrest man suspected of killing three, injuring five on Utrecht tram

Dutch police have made an arrest in a shooting that killed three people and wounded five on a tram in the Dutch city of Utrecht. They say 37-year-old Gokmen Tanis had been taken into custody after an hours-long manhunt and had earlier run-ins with authorities in the Netherlands.

The city was put into lockdown after the shooting, which authorities initially said was an apparent terrorist attack. But hours after the shooting, the gunman’s motive remained unclear. A prosecutor said it could be for “family reasons,” and Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency, quoting relatives of the gunman, said he had fired at a relative on the tram and had then shot at others who tried to help her.

Brian Mulroney apologizes for referring to Ontario MPP Amanda Simard as a ‘little girl’

He was defending his daughter Caroline Mulroney, Ontario’s Attorney-General and Francophone Affairs Minister, on a Radio Canada program yesterday, and without naming Ms. Simard, referred to “the little girl who resigned.”

LONG READS FOR A LONG COMMUTE

How exercise may help keep food cravings in check

If you’re worried about gaining weight, exercise may help – and not just by burning calories. Exercise may strengthen your brain’s ability to resist high-calorie foods in favour of more healthful options. It’s an idea being explored by Cassandra Lowe, a postdoctoral fellow of the University of Western Ontario’s BrainSCAN program: How to tackle obesity by improving the brain’s dietary decision-making.

In a recent review article, published in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Dr. Lowe and her colleagues examined the relationship between obesity and the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain involved in planning and inhibitory control. That relationship, they reported, appears to be reciprocal; people who have reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex are more likely to overeat highly processed, calorie-dense foods. In turn, overeating these foods changes their brains to increase the likelihood of overeating.

To disrupt this cycle, she is among a number of scientists who are looking at ways to boost activity in the prefrontal cortex to regulate food consumption, from exercise to brain-training activities to brain stimulation. Their research suggests the future of treating and preventing obesity may include targeting the brain, not just the stomach. Read Wency Leung’s full story here.

Saskatchewan sculptor Joe Fafard’s work inspired generations of visual artists

Joe Fafard, the acclaimed Canadian sculptor and painter who made art inspired by the Prairie landscape, its people and animals – most famously its cows – died on Saturday. He was 76.

Fafard is considered one of Canada’s leading visual artists, bringing his technical facility and unique, often whimsical, approach to his work. His sculptures were the kind that could be instantly recognizable, whether their subjects were livestock, wildlife – or people. They included his neighbours and family, famous politicians, such as Pierre Trudeau and John Diefenbaker, and artists including Vincent van Gogh and Pablo Picasso.

Among his best-known works are the public installations Running Horses outside the National Gallery of Canada (NGC) in Ottawa (a modified all-weather version replaced the original in 2017) and The Pasture – seven life-sized bronze cows on the plaza of the Toronto-Dominion Centre in downtown Toronto. Read Marsh Lederman’s full story here.

171,Politics,2019-03-18T22:05:00.0000000Z,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has appointed former Liberal cabinet minister and deputy prime minister Anne McLellan to examine the dual role of justice minister and attorney general in the federal cabinet — and whether the two roles ought to change.,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has appointed former Liberal cabinet minister and deputy prime minister Anne McLellan to examine the dual role of justice minister and attorney general in the federal cabinet — and whether the two roles ought to change.

""Significant issues have been raised recently about relations between the former attorney general and justice minister and government. And I am announcing today that Anne McLellan will be appointed to investigate independently,"" Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday. ""As former justice minister and attorney general and deputy PM, she has a unique understanding of the role.""

Trudeau said that McLellan will act as a special adviser, examining whether the cabinet roles of justice minister and attorney general — which are occupied by the same person in Canada — should be reformed in the wake of allegations of political interference in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

McLellan will report her findings to the prime minister and provide recommendations by June 30.

""She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,"" Trudeau said in a statement.

The prime minister first said he intended to appoint someone to look into the dual role on March 7.





""I believe that it is timely and appropriate to examine these questions. I look forward to providing my advice to the prime minister,"" McLellan said in a statement.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general of Canada, told a Commons committee last month that she felt she was improperly pressured by 11 officials in the Prime Minister's Office to allow Quebec-based engineering company SNC-Lavalin avoid bribery and corruption charges providing it met a number of conditions in a potential remediation agreement.

Wilson-Raybould did not allow the firm to enter into such an agreement, but the ensuing political controversy has raised questions about whether it's time to consider dividing her former role into two separate positions — to keep the attorney general free of political pressure.

'It's not that hard'

McLellan, who held the post of justice minister and attorney general from 1997 to 2002 under then-prime minister Jean Chrétien, told CBC earlier this month that she backs the idea of looking at splitting the current role. She also argued that when she served in the post, its dual nature made for better policy.

She said she was often pushed hard to lean toward certain decisions, but that she enjoyed those debates. She said it made for better legislation — but only because everyone knew where the ""red lines"" were.

""It sounds complex, but actually day in, day out, it's not that hard, as long as everybody knows what their roles are. PMO, clerk, colleagues, everybody knows what their role is.""

While McLellan said she supports a study of the dual role, she added that it should wait until after the political tensions surrounding the SNC-Lavalin affair have died down.





The Conservatives were quick to criticize the appointment, noting that McLellan, despite her political experience in the role, is an active member of the Liberal Party who has engaged in party fundraising efforts.

According to the Liberal Party, McLellan, will now no longer host a planned March 31 fundraising event to help female Liberal candidates run federally.

""Well, there you have it, Mr. Speaker. Liberals will investigate Liberals to get to the bottom of this. Former Liberal cabinet minister Anne Mclellan. Maybe Sheila Copps wasn't available,"" Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in the Commons today.

Remaining connected

Last month she said that, even if the roles are split, future attorneys general would have to somehow remain plugged in to the political context of decision-making.

""I don't believe that the attorney general should be isolated from the concerns, the anxieties, the fears, the aspirations of their colleagues,"" she said. ""And when I say colleagues, I mean ministerial, caucus colleagues and opposition colleagues.

""The attorney general cannot be divorced in making decisions around invoking sections of the anti-terrorism or other legislation, cannot be divorced by what is happening in various communities in our country, their fears, their aspirations, how they feel if a prosecution is commenced and a certain sentence is sought.""","Trudeau appoints Anne McLellan to advise PMO on the role of justice minister, attorney general in cabinet",Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trudeau-appoints-anne-mclellan-advise-193835321.html

Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau’s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.

None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.

“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.

The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of C$18.1 billion ($13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totaling C$76.8 billion.

The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labor market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.

Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 percent of gross domestic product.

“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by C$10 billion, to C$7.7 billion, and fall to C$12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.

Skills Training

Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modeled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”

That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly-skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”

On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”

She was named Treasury Board President and Minister of Digital government ...","Murray's ascension to cabinet marked the third cabinet shuffle in three months for the Liberal government, and came the same day that Canada's top public servant Michael Wernick — accused by the opposition of pro-Liberal testimony in his denials of wrongdoing in the SNC-Lavalin affair — announced he will resign as clerk of the Privy Council.

The latest cabinet move comes after Trudeau's first Treasury Board president, Nova Scotia MP Scott Brison, announced in January that he would leave politics to spend more time with family. In response, Trudeau moved Jody Wilson-Raybould to veterans affairs from her post as justice minister and attorney general. Montreal MP David Lametti replaced her in that position, while three other MPs were sworn into new positions at the Liberal cabinet table.

But weeks later, in the wake of the first report of the SNC-Lavalin controversy Feb. 7, Wilson-Raybould abruptly resigned from cabinet, forcing Trudeau to make further changes. On March 1, the prime minister shuffled his cabinet again, naming longtime Liberal MP Lawrence MacAuley as veterans affairs minister, moving Marie-Claude Bibeau to agriculture, and adding the international development portfolio to status of women minister Maryam Monsef.

Philpott created the latest cabinet vacancy by resigning just three days later. She said in a statement at the time that it was ""untenable"" for her to stay in cabinet because she had ""serious concerns"" about Wilson-Raybould's allegation that Trudeau and officials in the PMO and finance minister's office inappropriately pressured her to drop a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin last fall.

Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, have denied Wilson-Raybould's allegations and have repeatedly said the prime minister and his officials have done nothing wrong. Trudeau has pointed to the almost 9,000 Canadians employed by SNC-Lavalin, and said discussions about stopping the criminal case against the company last fall were over concern about the economic impact of a conviction.

Such a result could bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on federal contracts for 10 years. The company reaped 31 per cent of its global revenue from Canada in 2017, according to its latest annual report, but will not say what share of that comes from government contracts.

The company has pushed for a ""deferred prosecution agreement,"" a new legal tool created by the Trudeau government last year to allow corporations accused of crimes to admit wrongdoing, pay fines and agree to co-operate with authorities.

In the wake of Wilson-Raybould's testimony, Trudeau admitted there was a breakdown in communications that may have led to the former attorney general feeling pressured to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement last fall.

Murray told reporters Monday that she has no outstanding questions about the controversy and that she supports Trudeau in his pledge to work on improving communication within the Liberal caucus.

""I have expressed my confidence in our prime minister and my support for the work that we are doing,"" she said.

Trudeau still seeks to reconcile opposing visions for ...","Despite repeated claims that Canada is a fully engaged player in diplomacy, development, defence and trade, the Trudeau government’s foreign policy record is weak, fraught with scandal and far more conservative than voters appreciate. Canada is falling behind in competitiveness because our foreign policy has focused on the dominance of an established power at the expense of building relationships with emerging markets, supporting a sustainable multilateral presence and showing real leadership on the global stage.

These are the findings of our most recent Report Card on the Trudeau government’s foreign policy agenda. The Report Card evaluates the government on three criteria: progress in meeting election promises, overall performance and accountability. The Report Card gives the Trudeau government a C+ overall, which is by far the worst grade since we began evaluating the Liberal record in 2015.

Canada’s conservative diplomacy is best exemplified by Chrystia Freeland’s appointment as foreign minister. Under her tutelage, Canada’s foreign policy no longer conveys a clear commitment to multilateralism, nor for that matter quiet, constructive diplomacy. It has become instead a series of improvised, ad hoc efforts to publicly isolate, chastise and bandwagon against those states caught up in America’s geopolitical struggles. In many ways, Canada is in lock-step with Donald Trump’s agenda.

While our Canadian Forces maintain one of the highest operational tempos in decades, the current government has shown disinterest in investing for the future despite a willingness to freely spend elsewhere. Canada’s air force is aging and our navy is hardly seaworthy. Though Minister of Defence Harjit Sajjan has taken an innovative approach to peacekeeping through “Smart Pledges,” the Trudeau government has yet to organize its priorities to ensure our defence remains strong.

If top bureaucrat Michael Wernick’s alarmist comments presented to the House of Commons Justice Committee early in 2019 are taken at face value, Canada is less secure today than it was four years ago. The world has fundamentally changed and the Liberals find themselves adrift without a plan for steering us to safety. While the government has found small victories in bringing light to clandestine activity, reforming our intelligence community and preparing for the future of cyber security, the Liberals have failed the larger tests. Our Arctic remains unattended to, foreign fighters are returning home without consequence, and now we find ourselves in the middle of a geopolitical battle between China and the United States with no exit strategy.

With respect to foreign aid, the Trudeau government has simultaneously underperformed and oversold its “progressive agenda.” Our Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP) remains underfunded and disorganized. The launch of FIAP was really a shuffling of old money under a new brand. Most surprisingly, it still does not have a framework for the Canadian public to gauge its success. The focus on supporting women in developing countries is commendable, but it is not a sharp departure from the past. Disappointingly, FIAP appears to be more of a ploy for galvanizing a progressive domestic base than a real transformation.

In terms of Canada’s ability to uphold and advance human rights, the Trudeau government falls short. A recent example is the government’s support for an unelected leader of Venezuela. While Minister Freeland has pushed for an investigation by the International Criminal Court to try to remove sitting president Nicolás Maduro, the recent SNC-Lavalin scandal brings into question whether our government should be instructing other countries on the rule of law. Claims of political interference have caught up to the Trudeau government on the world stage. The OECD Working Group on bribery is now closely monitoring allegations of widespread Canadian corruption.

The recent SNC-Lavalin scandal brings into question whether our government should be instructing other countries on the rule of law.

The increasing gap between rhetoric and reality doesn’t stop there. The heady days of the Paris Climate Agreement, when Justin Trudeau hoped to establish himself as the global climate leader, are long gone. Trudeau still seeks to reconcile opposing visions for Canada while at the same time appeasing environmentalists, Indigenous groups, and the West. His government champions a transition to a low-carbon economy whilst purchasing new pipelines. He supports empowering Indigenous groups, until those pipelines he bought cross their territory. He promises “new leadership” but struggles with those provinces resistant to his federal carbon tax.

On immigration and refugees, the Liberal government prefers virtue-signalling and photo-ops with recently landed immigrants, but can’t seem to disarm the fear and controversy surrounding irregular border crossings. These shortcomings at home undermine Canada’s performance on the global stage, where the Liberals call for a revamped global refugee support system.

Though foreign policy rarely weighs heavily on the minds of Canadian voters come election day, this year may be different. Accusations of political interference and inappropriate pressure hover over the Liberal government’s political fortunes. It’s likely that by mid-campaign this government could find itself embroiled in two criminal investigations. Regardless of the outcome, the Liberal promise of offering Canadians a new way of doing politics is clearly broken.

OTTAWA – Longtime Liberal MP Joyce Murray has been tapped by Prime Minister Justin ...,"OTTAWA – Longtime Liberal MP Joyce Murray has been tapped by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to join cabinet as the new Treasury Board President and Minister of Digital Government.

Trudeau appointed the Vancouver-Quadra, B.C. MP and one-time leadership contender to the role in a single-person shuffle at Rideau Hall on Monday.

This is Trudeau's third shuffle in as many months. Murray has held the position as parliamentary secretary to the Treasury Board throughout the current government's mandate.

""Murray will help advance the priorities of the Government of Canada and deliver its commitments to Canadians,"" the PMO said in a statement about her cabinet appointment.

She will take on overseeing the federal public service and intergovernmental spending as part of the Treasury Board file. This position also touches on the management of government departments.

Murray was first elected to represent her current riding in a 2008 by-election. Prior to federal politics, Murray was a B.C. cabinet minister.

Speaking with reporters following her swearing-in ceremony, Murray said that despite the turnover in who leads the Treasury Board, work at the department has continued.

""There's a lot to do and I am going to be focused on … continuing and completing the agenda that has been set out and building on the really good work of previous Treasury Board presidents,"" Murray said.

Trudeau, who did not take questions following the shuffle, tweeted that Murray ""has long been a trusted voice for her community, after spending 25 years as a successful businesswoman and environmental advocate.""

Adding a woman allowed Trudeau to maintain gender balance while filling the vacancy left by Jane Philpott's resignation from cabinet. Philpott resigned earlier this month saying she had lost confidence in the way the government was handling the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Since Philpott resigned, Public Services and Procurement and Accessibility Minister Carla Qualtrough had been temporarily acting in the Treasury Board position.

This slight front bench rejigging follows February's cabinet shuffle in which Trudeau filled the vacancy left by Jody Wilson-Raybould when she resigned from veterans affairs after allegations emerged that she felt pressured by senior PMO officials to interfere in a criminal prosecution against the Quebec engineering giant.

In February's shuffle, Trudeau moved around three existing cabinet ministers, giving one — Maryam Monsef — an additional portfolio to cover off all cabinet responsibilities.

Philpott had only been in the Treasury Board positon for a few months. She was shuffled into that role in January, in response to Scott Brison's departure. It was that shuffle that saw Wilson-Raybould replaced as justice minister and attorney general by David Lametti. During that visit to Rideau Hall, Trudeau shuffled three ministers into new roles, and appointed two rookies.

Trudeau's former top adviser Gerald Butts cited the January shuffle as the flashpoint for the months-long ongoing SNC-Lavalin controversy, citing, as Trudeau has put it, an ""erosion of trust"" between Wilson-Raybould and the PMO after they sought to shuffle her into Philpott's old job as Indigenous services minister and she turned it down.

In tweets, both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould congratulated Murray on her new job.

""Congratulations… You will be great. Félicitations!"" said Philpott.

During her post-shuffle media availability, Murray acknowledged that it has been a ""challenging few weeks,"" but said the caucus is united and she does not have any outstanding questions about the scandal.

In a statement to her constituents earlier this month, Murray offered her perspective on the SNC-Lavalin affair, saying she had ""absolute confidence"" in Trudeau and the work the Liberal government is doing.

Murray has at times been outspoken and critical about some key Trudeau policy moves. She had been pushing for electoral reform since her leadership bid — which she lost to Trudeau — and said it was ""difficult"" to see that it was a promise the Liberals would not be following through on. She has also said that cabinet's decision to approve the Trans Mountain expansion disappointing, and has voiced concerns from her constituents that tax dollars are being spent to purchase the project from Kinder Morgan.

Reacting to her appointment, Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen tweeted that Murray’s appointment means ""Another anti-pipeline Minister at the Liberal cabinet table. Another assault on our oil industry.""

In her personal life, Murray and her husband have been seized with assisting one of their sons who was seriously injured in a fall while honeymooning in Cancun.

""I am happy to say that he is healing well, he is in great spirits. He is still in Vancouver General Hospital but we hope that he will be home soon for convalesces and eventually rehabilitation of his injuries,"" she said.

A visibly angry Trudeau denounced the ""small, toxic segments"" of society that peddle the belief diversity is a weakness, spewing hatred and inciting violence.

Hate groups ""are alive in Canada,"" Trudeau told the House of Commons on Monday as party leaders expressed solidarity with the victims in Christchurch and their families.

Trudeau expressed sorrow at the many attacks in recent years that have taken the lives of defenceless people at temples, churches, synagogues, concerts, schools and malls.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale suggested the deadly mass shooting in New Zealand will spur parliamentarians to take a careful look at Canada's gun laws.

The massacre has sparked a global sense of concern that will prompt Canadian politicians to make some timely decisions, Goodale said Monday after appearing before a Senate committee.

Goodale said his cabinet colleague Bill Blair will deliver recommendations soon, after having been asked last August to study a full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada.

New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, says gun-law reforms will be announced within days in that country.

A bill already before Canada's Senate would, among other things, expand the scope of background checks on those who want to acquire guns here.

""I'm sick and tired of extending our thoughts and our prayers. People around the world are exhausted by the carnage,"" Trudeau said. ""We must counter this hatred, and together we will.""","Trudeau condemns hateful, ‘toxic segments’ of society after New Zealand shootings",The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9228272-trudeau-condemns-hateful-toxic-segments-of-society-after-new-zealand-shootings/

White supremacists, neo-Nazis ...","White supremacists, neo-Nazis, far-right extremists — they’re in Canada, too, and they are active. And in a speech to the House of Commons Monday, Trudeau called out the hypocrisy of politicians who send “thoughts and prayers” when Jews and Muslims are murdered in their place of worship, but do nothing to combat the hatred underlying those attacks.

OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a clarion call for Canadian politicians to combat, not court, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim anger in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand.

A manifesto, believed to be authored by the gunman, repeatedly referenced far-right conspiracy theories that flourish in some of the Internet’s darkest corners.

Trudeau was addressing the House of Commons in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack in Christchurch last week. A 28-year-old Australian man killed at least 50 people and injured many more when he opened fire in two mosques.

“As politicians we stand around and offer our condolences, and we say nice things in the aftermath. We say that we will do better. We will say that never again will such hatred be allowed to fester unchallenged. Then, when the flames die down and the smoke clears, we look the other way. We revert back to politicking, figuring out how we can tap into that powerful rage to harness a few more votes,” said Trudeau, at times visibly angry.

Trudeau did not name names. But there are plenty of examples among Western nations — from U.S. President Donald Trump saying there are “good people” on both sides of a white supremacist rally and counterprotest, to anti-immigrant rhetoric in the lead-up to the Brexit referendum, to an openly anti-refugee government in Italy.

In Canada, none of the three major parties — Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats — are advocating for building walls or sharply reducing the number of immigrants.

But there has been a heated debate between the governing Liberals and opposition Conservatives over immigration issues, especially over the issue of irregular migration at the Canada-U.S. border and refugee claimants. Immigration is expected to be one of the major issues in the upcoming federal election.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who was criticized last week when his initial statement on Christchurch neglected to mention Muslims or the mosques that were targeted, echoed Trudeau’s call to combat racism.

“Evil is real, and it takes many forms. Bigotry, hatred, racism and violence are among them,” Scheer said.

“These forces must be met with both our finest virtue and our fiercest resolve. Hatred must be met with truth, cowardice with courage, bigotry with tolerance, violence with justice.”

“I say to my colleagues in all parties, we certainly have our differences on important policy matters that deserve rigorous and spirited debate,” Scheer added. “But on this, the very passion and humanity of our Canadian society, there can be no debate.”

Just before the speeches, the House of Commons unanimously approved a motion condemning the Christchurch attack, expressed solidarity with the people of New Zealand and the Muslim communities in Canada, and affirmed the “need to confront hatred, Islamophobia and white supremacy in all their forms.”

Maxime Bernier, the leader of the upstart People’s Party of Canada who has made criticism of immigration and “extreme multiculturalism” his main focus, told the Star Monday night that he was present for the motion, which passed without debate.

The motion was put forward by Joël Lightbound, the Liberal MP whose Quebec City riding includes the Centre Islamique Culturel de Quebec where Alexandre Bissonnette killed six Muslim men at evening prayers in 2016.

Bissonnette was one of the scrawled names across a rifle magazine purported to be used by the Christchurch shooter, identified as 28-year old Australian Brenton Harrison Tarrant. He was also one of the most recent, and most deadly, manifestations of anti-immigrant violence that statistics suggest have been on the rise in recent years.

Earlier this week, the Liberal government committed funding to research far-right extremism in Canada. Barbara Perry, the researcher who will conduct the study, told the Star she believes as many as 300 far-right extremist, white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups are currently active in Canada, up from roughly 100 in 2015.

New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh called on politicians to be careful with their language to make sure their words and policies aren’t taken as tacit approval of those groups’ hate-fuelled ideas and actions.

“The language of calling someone ‘illegal’ dehumanizes the worth and value of another human being. When we use words like ‘barbaric’ to describe another human being, again the purpose is to dehumanize and then once we dehumanize it leads to fear and hatred,” Singh said.

“We know that words can fuel white supremacy. Words can fuel hatred. We have to call out those words and call out those policies.”

In issuing a call to action in the wake of the Christchurch attack, Trudeau appears to have anticipated criticism that he was politicizing the tragedy. He had an answer ready.

“After tragedies like these, politicians often say that it is not a time to talk politics … I think that is a farce,” Trudeau said.

“I think this is exactly the time to talk politics, because the best way to support people is to acknowledge that there is a problem and take concrete steps to fix it.”

But it’s a different story for other government officials, who will find that all their legal bills will be covered by the taxpayer.

The DND will be paying for lawyers for some of those who will be testifying for the Crown at Norman’s trial which is to start in August. Jody Thomas, the department’s deputy minister, has approved the applications to pay the legal fees for six department or Canadian Forces individuals. Sources say some of those are linked to the Norman case.

At the same time Robert Fife and Steve Chase of the Globe and Mail have reported that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and senior officials in his office have retained outside legal counsel in case of an RCMP investigation into allegations of political interference in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group.

Cameron Ahmad, Trudeau’s communications director, told the journalists that Treasury Board rules allow for outside lawyers to be hired at public expense. “As per the Treasury Board Policy on Legal Assistance and Indemnification, counsel has been retained to advise on the matter in question,” Ahmad confirmed to the Globe, which noted that the rules allow for hiring of outside counsel when government officials are either sued, threatened with a suit, charged with an offence or under threat of being named in a legal action.

But when Vice Admiral Norman applied for the same treatment under the exact same policy the DND turned him down.

The DND rejected Norman’s request for financial assistance in 2017 as it claimed the senior officer was guilty of disclosing confidential information. Government officials reached that stunning conclusion — contained in a Justice Department letter leaked to Postmedia — even though Norman had not been charged at the time and no formal internal investigation was carried out by the Canadian Forces or the DND.

Norman, once the second highest ranking officer in the Canadian military, was charged last year with one count of breach of trust.

Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Jon Vance suspended Norman from his job in January 2017 after the RCMP alleged he tipped off Davie Shipbuilding that the Liberal government was considering delaying a key navy program in which the Quebec firm would convert a commercial ship into a naval supply vessel. Details about the government’s decision were also leaked to journalists, and the resulting embarrassment, along with the financial penalties that would have been imposed, forced the Trudeau government to back down on its plans.

There have been suggestions that officials from the Privy Council Office or the Prime Minister’s Office may have been involved in the decision to decline Norman financial support under the Treasury Board policy. But the DND says that is not the case.

The decision was made by then DND Deputy Minister John Forster. “It was done following consultations with the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Legal Advisor (DND/CF LA), who reports to the Department of Justice,” the DND noted in a statement to Postmedia. “None of our records suggest that the Clerk of the Privy Council and/or PMO were involved or consulted in the decision making process.”

Forster will be appearing as a witness for the Crown when Norman’s trial begins in August.

The Justice Department is involved in the ongoing legal battle with Norman in that it is supposed to coordinating the release of federal government records to the court during the pre-trial hearing. The court has also heard that the Justice Department has offered legal advice to people who have had documents subpoenaed by Norman’s lawyers.

The Conservative party has been pushing the DND to cover Norman’s mounting legal costs as the case against the senior naval officer drags into its second year.

Conservative MP Leona Alleslev asked Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan at the Commons defence committee Feb. 28 about whether he would grant approval for Norman’s legal fees to be covered under the federal program. Sajjan refused to answer, claiming that Norman’s case was before the courts.

But Alleslev countered that her question about whether Norman’s legal bills would be covered had nothing to do with the officer’s criminal trial or the pre-trial hearings that have been underway.

Lawyers observing the case have told Postmedia they estimate the cost at this point for the prosecution to be between $10 million and $15 million.

Norman has two main lawyers but his legal costs are not known. Sources, however, say the significant delays in getting basic documents for his defence is pushing his family into bankruptcy.

A GoFundMe page has been set up by retired Canadian Army officer Lee Hammond to help finance Norman’s legal costs. Hammond had originally set his fundraising goal at $50,000 but has now increased that to $500,000 to cover the increasing legal costs.","Taxpayers cover cost of lawyers for Trudeau, others in SNC Lavalin affair but no help for Vice Adm.

The President of the Treasury plays a powerful and key role in the cabinet, reviewing and approving any spending decisions made by the government.

Murray, 64, who comes from a business background and has deep environmental ties, ran a forest management company in B.C. before entering provincial politics in 2000, where she eventually became Minister of Water, Land and Air Protection. In 2008, she won the Vancouver Quadra seat for the Liberals and has been in government ever since. In her tenure in government, she has criticized the Liberal government for its decision to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline but has always supported Trudeau.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

Trudeau is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting with Thunder-Bay Superior North MP Patty Hajdu and Thunder Bay-Rainy River MP Don Rusnak at the CJ Sanders Fieldhouse on Lakehead University campus on Friday, according to an event posting on Hajdu's parliamentary website.

According to the event posting, doors will open starting at 5 p.m with the 90-minute event beginning at 7 p.m.

The prime minister most recently visited Thunder Bay in April 2016, where he made an announcement about federal funding for mass transit projects across the country.

The visit will come days after Rusnak announced he will not be seeking a second term in the House of Commons, despite being nominated as the riding's Liberal candidate last November.

The move to promote Murray comes after Ontario MP Jane Philpott quit the cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

Murray was elected in 2008 and served previously as a minister in B.C.’s provincial government.

In January, Trudeau moved Jody Wilson-Raybould to Veterans Affairs from the justice portfolio, which went to David Lametti.

The prime minister made changes to fill the void left by Wilson-Raybould after she quit cabinet and said she had been pressured to stop the trial of SNC-Lavalin on bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya.

A few days after that mini-shuffle, Philpott resigned as Treasury Board president, saying she had lost confidence in Trudeau’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""The prime minister ...","OTTAWA — Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection — made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart — ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

Watch:

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.","Jagmeet Singh Makes History With Parliamentary Debut, Presses Trudeau On Housing",HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/18/jagmeet-singh-house-of-commons_a_23695227/

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government will roll out a multi-year plan in the federal budget to give all Canadians access to high-speed internet by 2030, CBC News has learned. Finance Minister Bill Morneau will outline the specifics in the budget on Tuesday. But a government source said the plan will be paid for with new federal spending and will also rely on the private sector.

CBC News says a second unnamed government source says the broadband investments plan to close the gap on the growing urban-rural divide. The overall goal is to allow people who live in rural areas outside to also “participate in the modern economy”.

Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) data for 2018 showed “84% of those who work from home say that high-quality internet access is important, with 55% saying it is critically important.”

In February, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the upcoming budget would include “next steps in our plan to ensure middle-class optimism and an economy that works for all Canadians.”







Last week, Bell, Xplornet and the federal government announced plans to bring faster internet and 5G to Prince Edward Island, as part of a government initiative from Ottawa.

The CRTC is currently mulling the creation of an Internet Code for Canadians, which service providers would need to abide by.

According to the CIRA, 86% of Canadians have a broadband internet connection at home, while laptops, smartphones and tablets are the most popular devices used to access the internet.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

OTTAWA – Vice-Admiral Mark Norman’s lawyer Marie Henein is calling out the federal Department of Justice for making what she says are “inaccurate” public statements about her client’s high-profile case.

Those statements came earlier this month in the form of several Twitter posts and public fact-sheets in which the department said it wanted to “clarify” Henein’s requests for records held by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other top officials.

They appeared aimed at rebutting questions Henein has raised about the amount of time it has taken for the government to provide those records as well as thousands of other documents related to Norman’s trial on a breach-of-trust charge.

The tweets have since been deleted and Henein told the court during a pre-trial hearing this morning that the department amended the fact sheets after complaints from her office, but that they were nonetheless of concern.

The court also heard that a hearing that was scheduled for next week in which Henein was expected to argue that the case against Norman be tossed will be delayed because she still doesn’t have the requested documents.

Norman previously served as the military’s second-in-command and was charged last year with breach of trust for allegedly leaking government secrets. He has denied any wrongdoing and his actual trial is scheduled to start in August.

At one point during the event in Kitchener, Ont. last night, a member of the audience rose to ask Scheer a two-minute question touching on several subjects, including immigration funding and international aid. He then linked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the mythical conspiracy known as ""pizzagate,"" which gained traction around the 2016 United States presidential election.

""Trudeau gave $600 million to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation is part of child trafficking and child sacrifice, if you study it. It's in the pizzagate,"" he said.

""The PM, if he knows about the foundation, should he be in jail for that one? Also, he needs to pay back the $600 million plus his trips to the Canadians.""

Watch the townhall exchange

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was asked about the government's contribution to the Clinton Foundation during a townhall. He later said he didn't hear a reference to ""pizzagate."" 5:12

The conspiracy theory accuses Clinton and her team of running a child sex ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza shop in Washington, D.C.

Pizzagate is often cited in discussions about the real-life dangers of false news online. In 2016, a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside the restaurant as he attempted to ""self-investigate"" the unfounded internet rumours about Democrats hiding child sex slaves there.

While no one was injured in that incident, a U.S. judge told gunman Edgar Welch that his actions ""literally left psychological wreckage."" Welch was sentenced to four years in prison.

Pizzagate — which the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has called ""a fictitious online conspiracy theory"" — is largely believed to have gained momentum after WikiLeaks released emails from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, mentioning pizza parties and a fundraiser at the Comet restaurant. Some online communities theorized it was code for something more heinous.

In his response to the town hall questioner, Scheer did not say the pizzagate theory was false — although he did pick up on the Clinton Foundation angle to talk about Trudeau spending taxpayers' money on what he called ""personal projects.""

""Yes. Well, I appreciate your concerns on this,"" he replied.

""I can assure you that when you look at where Justin Trudeau has spent money, it's clear that a huge sum of the dollars that he is taken from Canadian taxpayers has gone to his own personal projects.

""You mentioned that the Clinton Foundation ... there are other examples where Justin Trudeau's government has given grants to hire people for groups that are, you know, advocating for their own particular ideology, specifically fighting against things like pipelines and building our infrastructure to be able to get our energy to international markets.""

When asked why he didn't confront the conspiracy theory at the time, Scheer said he didn't hear that part of the question.

""I heard the question was related to the government's, Justin Trudeau's decision to give a grant to the Clinton Foundation. That was what I answered. I didn't hear anything about the other aspect that you just mentioned,"" he told reporters during a stop in Rosser, Man. today.

""I didn't hear that. I heard the Clinton Foundation part of the question, I heard other parts of the question, but I certainly didn't hear that.""​

Watch: Scheer said he didn't hear pizzagate question

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

The Liberal government has pledged $20 million over five years to the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which is affiliated with the foundation.

According to the Global Affairs website, the money is helping the initiative improve access to sexual and reproductive health services for women and girls in Nigeria.

A quick tally of the numbers posted to the government's website shows the previous Conservative government, of which Scheer was a part, actually contributed more to the initiative.

Going back to 2013, the Harper government spent nearly $19 million to help the initiative deliver vaccinations, $14 million on diarrhea treatment and about $460,000 to a fund tuberculosis research project on miners in African countries.

Scheer 'does not keep up with paranoid' theories

A spokesperson for Trudeau accused Scheer of promoting falsehoods, citing his attacks on the federal government's embrace of the UN Global Compact on Migration. Scheer has said he fears the document could exert an influence over Canada's immigration system — even though it is not a treaty and is not binding on the nations that support it.

Spokesperson Eleanore Catenaro also criticized Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" at the recent United We Roll protest with Faith Goldy, a former Rebel Media commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

(Jessica Gresko/Associated Press)

""It's no surprise Andrew Scheer refused to condemn this, given his clear history of promoting conspiracy theories and spreading misleading information, including his comments on the UN migration compact,"" said Catenaro. ""He has also refused to condemn the hateful language at recent events on Parliament Hill at which he shared the stage with far-right groups.""

Scheer's press secretary told CBC News today the Conservative leader ""does not keep up with paranoid, American alt-right conspiracy theories and as such was not familiar with the term until it came up in the questioning today.""

""Since learning about the pizzagate conspiracy, Mr. Scheer obviously believes it is ridiculous and dangerous, and that such conspiracies have no place in our political debate,"" said Daniel Schow in an email.

Trudeau also has been confronted with false allegations during his town hall tours.

Other leaders, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Premier Doug Ford all made specific mention to the victims being Muslim or at prayer in a mosque.

But Scheer’s initial statement suggested it was “freedom” under attack. “Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely without fear,” Scheer wrote Thursday night, adding “there are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred.” The statement was widely criticized on social media and by anti-racism advocates, who pointed to the Conservative party’s past policies — such as the proposed niqab ban and the “barbaric practices” tip line — as well as Scheer’s failing to specifically mention the terrorist attack clearly targeted Muslims.

“Houses of worship, like the two mosques attacked last night, should be places where all people can meet freely and without fear,” a quote attributed to Scheer read. “We stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters to ensure that they remain this way. We must condemn, in the strongest terms possible, the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil.”

Article Continued Below

Bernie Farber, the head of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, pointed out that it took 15 hours of criticism before Scheer updated his statement. “I don’t want to sound at all political, because the Canadian AntiHate Network is not (political). What we do is we concentrate and we look at … what are the ingredients where hate can develop, and terrorism can develop,” Farber told the Star. “When he puts out a statement that won’t even acknowledge that the people murdered in New Zealand were New Zealand Muslims, when he speaks to a crowd that has a large number of racist and bigots and anti-immigration individuals (at a recent “yellow vest” protest on Parliament Hill) and says not a word? That’s what lets hatred grow.

Details about the Christchurch terrorist’s suspected motivations were available almost immediately, through a number of posts on 8chan, an online message board used by racists and bigots. A “manifesto” attributed to the shooter referenced a number of white supremacist and neo-Nazi tropes. Pictures believed to be of the terrorist’s rifles and ammunition show common far-right ideas and names of killers, including Alexandre Bissonnette, the Quebec City man who killed six Muslim men while at evening prayers in 2017. Scheer faced similar criticism last month for addressing a protest outside Parliament Hill that was also addressed by white nationalist Faith Goldy, a former television personality. The “United We Roll” protest convoy was initially associated with the Canadian version of the “yellow vest” protest movement — which mixes anger over economic challenges facing the oil and gas sector with outright Islamophobia. Organizers downplayed the association after facing media scrutiny. Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @alexboutilier

Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer issued two statements on the terrorist attacks in New Zealand on Friday -- the second after being criticized for not mentioning in the first that the attack was against Muslims at mosques during their Friday prayers.

Two Conservative MPs have also cancelled an event on Monday with a British parliamentarian who has been accused of promoting anti-Islamic sentiments ""out of respect"" for Muslims reeling from the attacks that killed 49 people.

Scheer posted to Twitter and Facebook late Thursday evening in Canada as news of the attacks was reported, saying ""freedom has come under attack"" and mentioning ""peaceful worshippers"" and a ""despicable act of evil.""

""All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear,"" he wrote.

But the statement was condemned quickly online for failing to specify that the attack was on Muslims, during prayers at mosques. Some pointed to the fact he did name Coptic Christians and call out anti-Semitism in previous tweets when killers attacked Egyptian churches in 2017 and a synagogue in Pittsburgh last fall.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims criticized the omission in a statement Friday afternoon.

""While some of our elected leaders sadly choose not to mention `Muslim' or `mosque' while denouncing the Christchurch attacks, the reality is that these horrific shootings and the Quebec City mosque attack on Jan. 29, 2017, have left Canadian Muslim communities -- and indeed, Muslims around the world -- feeling very vulnerable and unsafe,"" wrote the Council's executive director Ihsaan Gardee. ""It is therefore essential that our elected leaders speak out clearly and unequivocally against such attacks and name them for the Islamophobic terrorist attacks that they are.""

The statement does not mention Scheer by name but at that point, he was the only Canadian political leader whose public response to the attacks did not mention either Muslims or mosques.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement condemned the attacks as terrorism and said everyone must work to ""confront Islamophobia.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that ""Islamophobia kills.""

Green Leader Elizabeth May did not mention Muslims in her first Tweet but retweeted several others who did.

Former Conservative Maxime Bernier, now the leader of the People's Party of Canada, hadn't posted anything about the attacks at all by late Friday.

Scheer's office did not respond to an initial query about the statement's not mentioning Muslims but after being asked about the statement from the National Council of Canadian Muslims, his spokesman responded with a link to a new statement on Scheer's Facebook page.

""As Canadians are learning the horrific details of last night's terror attack at two New Zealand mosques, I wish to express both my deep sadness at the tragic loss of innocent life and my profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community,"" it said.

It said Conservatives stand with Muslims around the world to ""reaffirm our commitment to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together.""

A month ago, Scheer was criticized for sharing a stage on Parliament Hill with a cross-Canada truck convoy mostly protesting Liberal inaction on the energy industry but which included some people promoting hatred. Scheer said he was only there to support the energy workers, not the ""other elements that tried to associate themselves with the event.""

Those ""elements"" were people affiliated with the Canadian Yellow Vest movement, whose Facebook page included some comments celebrating the New Zealand attacks Friday.

Meanwhile, Conservative MP Garnett Genuis tweeted Friday that Monday's reception with Baroness Caroline Cox, a member of the British House of Lords, has been cancelled.

Genuis, an Edmonton-area MP, and fellow Conservative MP Kelly Block of Saskatchewan were to co-host the reception with Cox, who has shown support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and has said she believes Muslims are trying to destroy Western democracies with Shariah law.

Toronto Liberal MP Judy Sgro pulled out of the event after she found out about Cox's participation. Genuis initially rejected calls to follow suit, calling it a talk on human rights, and accused Sgro on social media of retreating only after she remembered this is an election year.

He said in a statement Friday that Cox's views are subject of ""some debate, and perhaps some confusion.""

""With that said, our friends in the Muslim community are now reeling from one of the most horrific and appalling terrorist attacks to ever target their community,"" he wrote.

“There are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred. I am praying for peace for the families of those lost and recovery for those injured,” it continued.

Canada’s immigration minister, Ahmed Hussen, took the opportunity at a candlelight vigil held in Toronto commemorating the victims of the attack to take a veiled swipe at Scheer.

“We should never be afraid to name the victims and to name the religion and to name the places of worship that people are targeted in,” Hussen said.

The minister also told the crowd the Trudeau government will stand shoulder to shoulder with them.

Scheer released a second statement just a few hours later, expressing sadness at the lives lost in the attack and “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community.”

“Houses of worship, like the two mosques attacked last night, should be places where all people can meet freely and without fear. We stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters to ensure that they remain this way. We must condemn, in the strongest terms possible, the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil,” the second statement read.

The attack on two mosques in the Christchurch and Canterbury areas of New Zealand on Thursday evening left 49 dead, including children, and injured over 40 others.

The gunman is believed to have killed 41 people at the Al Noor mosque before driving about five kilometres across town and attacking the Linwood mosque, where he killed seven more people. One person died later in a hospital.

The tragedy marks the deadliest mass shooting in New Zealand’s modern history.

""The justice file has been completely bungled"" quoted Angus, who accused Wilson-Raybould of all sorts of malevolence.

But of course that was then. To hear Angus tell it now, Wilson-Raybould is a person of great integrity who put her job on the line over principle and has suffered the consequences of her courage. At a guess, Angus's amended position is that Wilson-Raybould's demotion in January was a bloody travesty.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt, in 2016, accused Wilson-Raybould of ""spewing lies"" in the House of Commons. Now, though, she dotingly believes every word Wilson-Raybould utters. After Wilson-Raybould rose in the Commons to say she wanted to speak ""her truth,"" Opposition members erupted in a standing ovation. Wilson-Raybould, says Raitt, wisely warned us all that we must ""speak truth to power."" (Yes, a former minister in Stephen Harper's government actually said that).

Oh, and that new law allowing negotiated settlements rather than prosecutions of companies like SNC Lavalin? The one Opposition MPs accuse the government of sneakily burying in last year's budget so they could help their corporate pals? An amendment to it was referred to the Commons justice committee last November after it had become law.

The proposal was examined and passed unanimously by the Commons justice committee. Unanimously. No party raised any objection to the concept of allowing negotiated settlements with corporations in the first place. In fact, Conservative MP Rob Nicholson declared his party's satisfaction with the law as he voted for the amendment, which dealt with the question of whether or not to make the agreements public:

""I think it is an excellent suggestion here to do this,"" he said of the amendment. ""I think it remedies any of the issues that arose when this was initially proposed. We're completely supportive of it.""

But most of this flippity-floppity stuff goes largely unreported. The respect and admiration of opposition MPs for Wilson-Raybould, and their deep suspicion of the underhanded government decision to let big companies escape rule of law is the new ""narrative,"" to use that awful, hackneyed word.

Why? Because, well, they're opposition MPs, and inconsistency is their parliamentary privilege. They operate in an expectation-free zone. There is no supposition that they will show temperance, nuance, forbearance or shame. They can yell whatever they like and reporters will report it, because democracy, etc.

Angus's opinion of Wilson-Raybould has obviously changed since December, writes Neil Macdonald. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)

Publicly, former Liberal leader John Turner used to say that ""the job of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition is to oppose."" Privately, though, he had a better term for Question Period and other televised political venues: ""Bullshit Theatre.""

He always got a laugh, but it was more than a joke. Turner was acknowledging that the opposition, with its constant, unstinting indignation about everything the government says or does, is a caricature.

For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is their struggle for a share of ink and airtime in the news media, opposition politicians behave like a pack of scent hounds. They have no shame because they know the system is unkind to anyone who does. Their rhetoric is both predictable and extreme; they believe it must be so, in order to make headlines, and they may be right. Still, anyone else who talked the way they do would be regarded as a crank.

Right now, the most humid performance is that of Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.

Appeal to the RCMP

In Scheer's estimation, the prime minister is ""disgraced,"" up to ""something sinister,"" running a coverup, and corrupt in the manner of a Third World despot. Trudeau, Scheer tells us, pressures, harasses, subverts the law and gags elected MPs. And he should be investigated for what are clearly crimes, something Scheer has written to the RCMP demanding.

Now, Trudeau might not be a particularly inspiring, or even articulate fellow. His gurgly moralizing is aggravating. But a sinister, disgraced, subversive, corrupt criminal? Because he tried to get his justice minister to change her decision about a prosecution, to persuade her to use a new law the Conservatives supported, then eventually accepted her decision, and then moved her to Veterans Affairs, an assignment she herself, truth-teller that she is, said at the time was not a demotion?

(Not only did Wilson-Raybould declare that reassigning cabinet ministers is the absolute prerogative of the prime minister, she added: ""I would say that I can think of no world in which I would consider working for our veterans in Canada as a demotion."")

And yet, crime, corrupt, sinister, coverup, criminal, disgraced, bad, rotten, lawbreaker.

One suspects Andrew Scheer doesn't actually believe that, but he's the opposition leader, and doesn't have to.

In Scheer's estimation, the prime minister is ""disgraced"" and up to ""something sinister."" (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

With Scheer heading the opposition, we are supposed to forget that the government his party formed under Stephen Harper happily imposed its will on Canada's judiciary, using minimum-sentencing legislation to interfere with judicial discretion.

Or that Harper's Conservatives, having denounced Belinda Stronach for crossing the floor to join the Liberal government in 2005 (a betrayal of her constituents, we were told) happily received Liberal David Emerson, who crossed to join Harper's government in 2006, and then booted Conservative MP Garth Turner from the caucus after he protested (speaking truth to power, really) that Emerson should seek a new mandate from his constituents, the way the party had argued Stronach should have.

To be clear, Trudeau's mob is no different. They went from screeching that the Mike Duffy affair was proof of utterly corrupt government, and declaring that the Canadian people demand transparency and answers from Harper, to running an administration at least as opaque and secretive, once in power.

(""The Canadian people,"" incidentally, is probably the most-quoted entity in the opposition benches. The opposition by definition was rejected by voters, yet Scheer apparently consults them every day, and knows their heart intimately).

Top-down control

If Scheer ever does achieve power, it's a safe bet he'll exercise the same sort of top down control every other prime minister does. Does anyone believe he won't? That he wouldn't, perhaps, order Tory MPs on the justice committee to abruptly adjourn rather than take more political damage? I humbly suggest he would.

But back to Bullshit Theatre.

It's tempting to think that things have gone downhill, that there was once a gravitas and comity that has disappeared.

Says David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa who has just authored the beautifully-titled book Too Dumb For Democracy: ""If you were to put Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer, and Jagmeet Singh beside Bob Stanfield, Pierre Trudeau and … Ed Broadbent, I know what team I'd pay attention to.""

But, says Moscrop, it's never really been much better.

""There's no golden age. The introduction of television cameras has amplified the nonsense, and caused politicians to lean into the theatrics. And social media has exacerbated it further.""

Only technique has changed, he says. Now, whenever the opposition (or the governing party) has a fit of outrage, they do two things:

""They immediately send out a fundraising request expressing the outrage and asking for five dollars, and they create a data-mining site.""

Example: LetHerSpeak.Ca, the website set up by the Conservatives (although you have to go right to the end of the page, and examine the shaded fine print, to find out who's behind it, which is sort of a tacit acknowledgement of opposition credibility).

The nominal purpose of the site is to help The Canadian People demand that Trudeau un-gag Wilson-Raybould, because, you know, she really hasn't had a chance to speak much. Coincidentally, the site gives voters a chance to disclose their names, email addresses and postal codes. If they haven't read the shaded fine print at the bottom, and don't know they're supplying data to Conservative election campaign managers, well, they should buy reading glasses.

""It's the new frontier of bullshit,"" says Moscrop.

And we journalists are all just theatre critics.

Responding to the horrific massacre of Muslims at prayer in New Zealand, the Conservative leader issued a statement Friday afternoon expressing his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community” along with “the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil.” He added: “To the Muslim community around the world and here at home in Canada, we stand with you.”

It was spot on: straightforward, fitting and right. It was also about 15 hours too late, coming as it did only after Scheer had come under intense criticism for the inadequacy of his first response, which spoke vaguely of an attack on “freedom” and unspecified “worshippers.” The appositeness of the second only highlighted the strange, withholding coldness of the first.

Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear. 1/2 — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) March 15, 2019

We cannot know exactly what explains that initial, catastrophic choice of words. But neither is Scheer automatically entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Politicians are in the business of being politic, of saying the right thing at the right time, and nothing goes out over their name without a great deal of thought, not to say calculation.

Other party leaders managed to name the victims — Muslims — and the beliefs — white supremacism, Islamophobia, the familiar, toxic mix of racism, xenophobia and hatred that so often finds Muslims as its target — involved in what was self-evidently an act of terrorism. Why on earth couldn’t Scheer?

The suspicion that this was no accident is not unreasonable, given Scheer’s past statements and actions. Perhaps he truly did not hear the questioner at a recent town hall who invoked “pizzagate,” the lunatic conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was connected to a child sex ring supposedly operating out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria.

But nothing required him to speak at last month’s “United We Roll” rally on Parliament Hill, whose stated purpose — to protest federal environmental policies on behalf of unemployed workers in the oil industry — may have been legitimate, but which had clearly been infiltrated by anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant elements. At the very least, he might have taken the opportunity of his appearance to denounce these views. He did not.

Just as disturbing was Scheer’s recent endorsement of conspiracy-minded interpretations of a United Nations document called the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, an unenforceable statement of good intentions with regard to the handling of immigrants and refugees to which most of the world’s nations agreed last year.

This, on top of his party’s unceasing alarmism on the subject of the asylum seekers entering Canada illegally via our southern border — a legitimate issue, to be sure, and one on which the government may deserve criticism, but nothing like the existential “crisis” of so much Conservative rhetoric.

And before that there was the hysteria over M-103, a non-binding motion — not a bill — condemning Islamophobia that was somehow elevated, via the panic mills of the populist right, into an assault on freedom of speech worthy of a police state. The motion passed two years ago. Not one person has since been carted off for criticizing Islam or faced sanctions of any kind because of M-103.

And before that there was the gratuitous ban on face-coverings at citizenship ceremonies. And the “barbaric practices” snitch line. The federal Conservatives are not by any means the only party to pander to racial and religious intolerance — Dalton McGuinty’s Liberals won an election in Ontario in 2007 on a coded anti-Muslim fear campaign, while the government of Quebec’s baiting of the province’s religious minorities enjoys near all-party support — but they are surely the most consistent. Or were, until Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party came along.

And it seems to be growing worse: as xenophobic and anti-Muslim rhetoric is normalized by repetition on social media and other online sites — most notoriously The Rebel — so a certain section of the public has been radicalized, persuaded that only “globalists” and other elites could oppose such disgraceful sentiments. Exploiting public fears of immigrants and minorities has a long and dishonourable tradition in this country. But exactly what kind of voter did Scheer worry would be put off by explicitly naming the sole victims and declared targets of a mass murderer?

That all of this is happening in the wake of the 2017 murders at a Quebec City mosque — the New Zealand attacker cited it as a model — makes this winking indulgence of the worst elements of the populist right particularly reprehensible.

Obviously neither Scheer nor The Rebel is responsible, in themselves, for the actions of terrorists. But they can be held to account for their part in creating the climate of opinion in which extremists flourish and madmen find inspiration. After Christchurch, after Quebec City, after Brevik and other atrocities, this is hardly a theoretical concern.

None of this is to justify further limits on free speech: we lack the kind of certainty about cause and effect that would even begin to make a case for legal restrictions, and we know from long experience how such laws can be abused. But all of us are morally responsible for the things we say, or do not say. Each of us is part of a moral order it is our duty to sustain — political leaders most of all.

This isn’t about censorship, or political correctness. It’s about judgment, and choices.

He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

Imagine you’re a politician.

Even better, you’re the leader of a political party. The leader of the main opposition party, even. And yet, most Canadians wouldn’t know you if they tripped over you in the tool aisle of the local Canadian Tire.

What to do?

Especially when the Prime Minister—your target—is blessed with a famous name and the considerable advantages of incumbency. How do you shift his spotlight your way?

Short of lighting yourself on fire or dancing nude in the streets—or doing both together, I suppose—there isn’t much any opposition leader can do to up their profile in between election cycles. No, the life of an opposition leader is an endless cycle of low-impact rubber chicken dinners, bingo hall grip and grins, and sessions spent asking the Prime Minister questions he never ever answers.

So Andrew Scheer should count himself blessed that Justin Trudeau has lit himself on fire—an exquisitely engineered fire—over SNC-Lavalin. After all, it’s not every day a sitting Prime Minister cripples himself to the point where even Jagmeet Singh risks becoming competitive.

With Canadians now tuning into politics en masse, SNC is the chance for Scheer to demonstrate he has the royal jelly. When Mike Duffy started giving Stephen Harper nightmares, it was Thomas Mulcair who checked into the public’s imagination, keeping the issue alive with his prosecutorial performances in the House of Commons. And while Mulcair didn’t end up taking the big prize, he did put an afterthought party into pole position by the start of the election.

That is the size of the opportunity now before Scheer.

But if Canadians are impressed by what they’ve seen from Scheer personally in response to SNC, they’re doing a pretty good job of hiding it. While Conservative support has now surpassed that of Trudeau’s Liberals, Scheer’s personal numbers remain below Trudeau’s.

The differential in polling outcomes likely exists because people identify Trudeau much more strongly with his party than Scheer with his, and because the SNC debacle has, to date, been driven more by Trudeau’s missteps than Scheer’s interventions.

To wit, Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation (checks calendar) 12 days ago and Trudeau is (checks pm.gc.ca) still Prime Minister. Canadians will have noticed the misfire.

To be fair, several pundits matched Scheer’s premature call for Trudeau’s ouster, including some not overtly hostile to the Prime Minister, such was the shock of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony at the justice committee. But it’s one thing to get excited to sell papers; it’s another to lose your head in the rush for the head of the country’s government to lose theirs.

The call for Trudeau to go, absent all sides of the story being aired, will have smacked many as opportunism, something for the benefit of Scheer’s party, not his country. Yes, what Wilson-Raybould disclosed was deadly serious, but it wasn’t close to the full story. That Trudeau was—and remains—unwilling to offer a serious response to Wilson-Raybould, or let her speak about the circumstances surrounding her resignation, is the story. Trudeau is hiding something about his intrusion into the justice system.

Looked at through a more practical lens: when Trudeau goes is not even Scheer’s call to make in a majority Parliament. Absent a revolt from the Liberal caucus, or perhaps some criminal charges, Trudeau will be Prime Minister come this fall’s federal election. And while Trudeau’s head would be a helluva trophy, it might be better for a severely tainted Trudeau to lead his troops into that fight. Scheer should focus on inflicting a thousand cuts, not trying to land the killer blow.

What the SNC situation now calls for is a calm and systematic destruction of Trudeau’s arguments, such as he’s made them. The people who don’t follow politics need to see a robust defence of Canada’s institutions and constitutional conventions, along with clear reminders of what will be lost should Trudeau be allowed to skate away from the mess he’s made. Thankfully, the federal court and the OECD are already helping on these fronts; there is no need for Conservatives to over-egg the pudding.

And to Scheer’s credit, he’s showing signs of a recalibration. The Tories now appear ready to savour Trudeau’s pain like a fine wine, not like a beer in a frat house.

A sober and serious opinion piece under Scheer’s name has now appeared in the Toronto Sun, outlining how Trudeau’s deeds belie his words on SNC. The Conservative HQ Twitter feed is also smartly ramping up calls for Trudeau to allow Wilson-Raybould to testify to her resignation from Cabinet (something Wilson-Raybould herself has called for), pushing on an open door for women who now have serious questions about Trudeau’s feminist bonafides. The trick will be to keep up the tone.

With the Liberals now desperate to push the conversation to “pizzagate” and other elements of Michael Wernick’s vaunted social media “vomitorium,” the entire Conservative caucus needs to act like a government in waiting. No matter how good or clever that gut punch on Twitter might feel, the Tories should now heed to their better angels. Let Maxime Bernier’s crowd bray for blood; the SNC earthquake has opened up a deep seam of middle-of-the-road voters. Now it’s time to mine.

With the Prime Minister’s jobs claims now in dispute, the legal arguments for offering a DPA in tatters, and his strategy now to stay quiet and suppress all further testimony from either Wilson-Raybould or his staff, Trudeau has painted himself into an ugly corner. Scheer must satisfy himself with keeping Trudeau in that corner and hemming him in even further, not pushing for an outcome he can’t deliver.

In short, Canadians need to look at Scheer and see a Prime Minister in waiting. Someone with their interests at heart, and not his own, even if the two intersect.

It’s an overreach, to be sure. But let’s grant Scheer a little latitude for his inflated rhetoric. As opposition leader, he has a duty to focus public attention squarely on the misdeeds of the government of the day.

Mission accomplished.

But eventually, when enough blows have been inflicted on the ruling party to ensure its alleged offences have been exposed and that reforms are being robustly debated, we should step back momentarily — even as the pummelling continues — and reflect on the credibility of the chief pummeller and his party, especially with regards to the intersection of politics and the law.

Recent Conservative history isn’t reassuring on this front. Though he spent time as Speaker of the House of Commons, Scheer was a member of the Stephen Harper government that waged a decade-long battle to bend Canada’s judiciary to the will of a Charter-averse, tough-on-crime Conservative party. The sins of the mentor aren’t his to bear, but Scheer does have to square his accusations about Liberals’ contempt for law with his own party’s record.

(Andrew) Scheer does have to square his accusations about Liberals’ contempt for law with his own party’s record.

And respect for the rule of law — its letter, its spirit, its institutions — was not a strong suit of Harper’s decade-long run as prime minister. He and his lock-step justice ministers oversaw numerous attempts to craft legislation with provisions that clearly violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

To Harper and his allies, it was a brave bid to reassert the dominance of Parliament over what they viewed as an excessively Charter-driven, Liberal-moulded justice system. To critics, it was a Conservative war on the rule of law and core Canadian values.

Remember the name Edgar Schmidt? He was the federal lawyer who took the Harper government to court because the alarms he and his fellow legal experts kept ringing — that planned Conservative legislation on sentencing, prostitution, fighting terrorism and more often failed basic Charter tests — were simply ignored.

There was, under Harper, an unprecedented partisan effort to transform the process for appointing judges — at all levels — to ensure that as many like-minded jurists as possible presided over Canada’s courts.

Remember the name Marc Nadon? He was Harper’s tough-on-crime appointee to a Quebec slot on the Supreme Court in 2013. But Nadon was not truly the senior Quebec jurist required for the appointment in question, as stipulated in the Constitution, as confirmed by the Supreme Court.

Beverley McLachlin, the now-retired chief justice of Canada, had the temerity to try to warn Harper (in line with her responsibilities) that the Nadon appointment was potentially out of order. Harper issued an unprecedented statement accusing the unimpeachable McLachlin of “inappropriate” behaviour — and was roundly condemned by the Canadian legal community for what appeared to be a deliberate attempt to undermine the independence and integrity of the country’s judiciary.

Harper biographer John Ibbitson described the incident as the “nadir” of the former Conservative prime minister’s decade in office: “Not only did he lose the fight; he tarnished his reputation and damaged what should be the sacrosanct separation of powers between executive and judiciary.”

In 2014, when he was Speaker, Scheer was interviewed about the forthcoming 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta and recalled that he’d been gifted a framed copy of the landmark English legal charter when he graduated from high school. It was a great reminder, he observed, of the deep roots of “the separation of powers from the executive to the judiciary.”

We’ve all heard Scheer’s vociferous defence of the rule of law in the context of alleged Liberal wrongdoing. As he seeks the prime ministership, he should be asked pointedly to explain his own party’s past actions and future plans on that front.

He should be asked, too, if he possesses framed copies of the Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Scheer ended his statement with a message for Muslim communities in Canada and internationally. The Conservative party is committed ""to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together,"" he said.

Other Tories quicker to denounce violence toward Muslims

Attacks on freedom is political rhetoric that has been embraced by fringe conservative groups to amplify anti-globalist and anti-immigrant messages. In Canada, these viewpoints have been notably represented by Yellow Vests Canada, a spinoff group inspired from the French anti-government movement.

Yellow Vests Canada members have spread messages advocating violence against politicians and hatred toward Muslims. The group was associated with last month's United We Roll convoy, which culminated with a rally on Parliament Hill. Scheer and People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier were invited speakers who addressed the crown on the main stage.

White nationalist Faith Goldy was also at the rally, but did not address the crowd from the main stage. She briefly gave some remarks from a scissor lift which served as an impromptu stage set on a flatbed truck parked on the street.

Some of the Scheer's federal conservative peers, such as Ontario Premier Doug Ford and former federal leadership candidates Michael Chong and Lisa Raitt, chose more explicit language off the bat.

'Muslims suffer unimaginable loss and pain' in places of worship: PM

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement Friday condemning the terrorist attack on two Christchurch mosques.

The gunman, whose identity has yet to be confirmed by police, reportedly had Quebec mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette's name written on a magazine clip, suggesting inspiration from the Canadian tragedy that killed six people and left 19 injured.

""Far too often, Muslims suffer unimaginable loss and pain in the places where they should feel safest,"" Trudeau said. ""Canada remembers too well the sorrow we felt when a senseless attack on the Centre culturel islamique de Québec in Ste-Foy claimed the lives of many innocent people gathered in prayer.""

Trudeau continued to state how Canada will continue to work with New Zealand to ""take action against violent extremism.""

""Hate has no place anywhere,"" he said. ""We must all confront Islamophobia and work to create a world in which all people—no matter their faith, where they live, or where they were born—can feel safe and secure.""

Article ...,"MONTREAL—With only months to go to the federal campaign Justin Trudeau’s re-election hangs on an increasingly frayed Quebec thread. The prime minister’s home province has long been front and centre in his electoral calculations. Absent gains in Quebec to make up for predictable losses in Alberta and Atlantic Canada next fall, the Liberals can almost certainly kiss hopes for a second majority goodbye. And were Trudeau to fail to hold his ground in the province all would likely be lost for his party.

( Jacques Boissinot / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Until the SNC-Lavalin affair, the possibility of Liberal losses in Quebec next fall looked remote. The party enjoyed a double-digit lead on the competition. But over the past month the crisis over the federal government’s handling of the engineering giant’s judicial file has taken a toll. Léger Marketing’s most recent poll — published at mid-week — showed a significant narrowing of the gap between the leading Liberals and the second-place Conservatives. Their lead has shrunk from 18 points in early February to just nine points this month. Andrew Scheer’s Conservative party has been the main beneficiary of the Liberal drop — a sign that further confirms the damage to Trudeau’s brand.

When voters start to seriously question a prime minister’s competence, they tend to turn to the most likely alternative on offer and, at this juncture, no one sees an NDP government in-the-making in the poll numbers. There is more support for the prime minister’s SNC-Lavalin narrative in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada but as in the rest of the country, an overwhelming majority feel Trudeau has not been up to the challenge of managing the crisis. That being said, the Conservatives would be prudent not to count their Quebec eggs before they hatch. Their path to doing well in Quebec in the election is strewn with major obstacles. On SNC-Lavalin, they are treading on slippery ground. None of their key arguments is winning the day in public opinion. One in two Quebecers disagrees with Scheer’s contention that Trudeau should resign. Twenty-nine per cent agree. That’s almost the same proportion that would have voted for the Conservatives in an election held this month. There is not much juice to be had from continuing to squeeze the resignation lemon.

Fifty-nine per cent believe the engineering firm should be offered a remediation agreement rather than be exposed to the risk of a criminal conviction and a 10-year ban on bidding on federal contracts. And a majority feels that Quebec-bashing is in play in the heated rhetoric that has attended the affair outside the province.

The SNC-Lavalin matter also finds the Conservatives at odds with Quebec’s political class. Coalition Avenir Québec Premier François Legault is the leading champion of the notion that SNC-Lavalin should be offered a negotiated plea. The developments of the past month have not altered his determination to ensure the firm maintains its head office in Montreal. A decade and a half ago the sponsorship scandal almost killed the federal Liberal brand in Quebec. By comparison, the impact of the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair on the ruling party could be ephemeral. Chances are the showdown between the prime minister and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will not have a lot of traction in Quebec in next fall’s election or at least a lot less than the issue that is shaping up to turn into the real ballot box question. On Friday, tens of thousands of young Quebecers took to the streets to ask for more action on climate change. This is not a movement akin to the 2012 so-called maple spring that paralyzed the province’s campuses for months on end. The protests are not about any specific government or party policy…yet. But it would not take much to transform this youth movement into a larger populist one. Legault for one is scrambling to avoid becoming the target of such a movement. He has already traded the rookie he had initially appointed as his environment minister for a more politically savvy one. The environment will be a main theme at the first post-victory CAQ convention later this spring. Scheer, on the other hand, has promised that the first act in office of a Conservative government would be to revoke the Liberal carbon-pricing policy. He is touting himself as a pipeline champion. He has yet to confirm that he would — as prime minister — honour Canada’s signature on the Paris accord on climate change. All of the above will be a hard sell in the province whose voters — according to polls — are the most likely to rank the environment as a top priority. In next fall’s election, Scheer may have a harder time getting a pass from Quebecers for the Conservative missing-in-action approach to climate change than Trudeau for his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair Chantal Hébert is a columnist based in Ottawa covering politics.

Muslim advocates said the guest speaker, Baroness Caroline Cox, promotes hate against Muslims, and she has also been accused of supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Mr. Genuis said in a statement posted on Twitter that Lady Cox’s views and humanitarian work on international religious freedom “have been the subject of some debate, and perhaps some confusion, in the lead-up to an event with her about women’s rights, democracy, and freedom.”

Story continues below advertisement

“Organizers, including me, have been in the process of engaging members of the public in dialogue about this event, and about Baroness Cox’s work and legacy,” he said.

“With that said, our friends in the Muslim community are now reeling from one of the most horrific and appalling terrorist attacks to ever target their community. Out of respect for them, now is not the time for a conversation that could [be] misconstrued to take place on Parliament Hill. As such, the event will not be proceeding as planned.”

Amira Elghawaby of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network said she is relieved it has been cancelled, but said it should not have been scheduled in the first place.

“I know many people had reached out to Conservative Party, to Garnett, to talk to him about this event and he was not really listening, and I’m relieved that he finally heard from the community and actually took their concerns to heart,” Ms. Elghawaby said.

“But why did it take the death of 49 people for him to understand that the way communities are feeling right now, even before this tragedy, that we are being maligned and scapegoated and stereotyped by various groups and this Baroness was part of those who are promoting fear, bigotry and racism against our communities. Regardless of what happened in New Zealand, this event should never have been scheduled in the first place,” she said.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said his organization wrote to both Mr. Genuis and co-host Conservative MP Kelly Block to ask them to reconsider holding the event, calling it “deeply concerning” when politicians associate with figures who espouse Islamophobic views, lending legitimacy to them.

Liberal MP Omar Alghabra told The Globe and Mail he is “relieved” by Mr. Genuis’s decision. Mr. Alghabra said he listened to audio recordings of Lady Cox espousing conspiratorial messages about Muslims trying to achieve global domination.

Story continues below advertisement

“It instills suspicions and hate against an identifiable group. It’s telling people who are listening to her ‘don’t trust Muslims.’"" Mr. Alghabra said he read that Lady Cox visited Syria and denied that Mr. al-Assad used chemical weapons. “Everyone knows he is a violent dictator,” he said.

According to Lady Cox’s website, she visited Syria in 2018, writing that the day before her trip, the United States, the U.K. and France announced their intention to launch missile attacks “in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government in Dhouma,"" and she warned against a regime change in Syria.

In 2010, far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders screened his anti-Islam film at the House of Lords at the invitation of Lady Cox and one of her colleagues.

Mr. Alghabra said he pleaded politely, but firmly, with Mr. Genuis to withdraw from the event, and until now, he refused.

Mr. Genuis was not the only Conservative to shift positions on Friday after criticism. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer issued a lengthy statement about the New Zealand terrorism attacks after initially tweeting messages that did not mention that the victims were Muslim.

Late Thursday, Mr. Scheer tweeted, “Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear. … There are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred. I am praying for peace for the families of those lost and recovery for those injured.""

That response was met by swift criticism online, including from Andrew MacDougall, a former spokesman for prime minister Stephen Harper, who tweeted, “Delete and try again. Name the place of worship. Name their religion. Put your arms around them. Condemn the specific pathology that drove their killer(s).”

Ms. Elghawaby said some people wonder why Mr. Scheer didn’t call out the Islamophobia underlying the attack immediately. She said people are looking to the Conservative Party and wondering: “Is this party going to stand up for the rights of everyone?""

By Friday afternoon, Mr. Scheer issued a new statement, saying he wished to express “both my deep sadness at the tragic loss of innocent life and my profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community.

“Houses of worship, like the two mosques attacked last night, should be places where all people can meet freely and without fear.

My concern is not that the Conservatives wish to return tax money to taxpayers hands, my concern is with how they intend to do it. Scheer says ...","It seems the Conservatives in Canada got their heads together and made several significant policy announcements – significant not in the sense that, when isolated, these policy changes will affect anyone much, but significant because of the signal they send as to which direction Conservatives want to take Canada. The Manitoba Pallister government announced that it will be reducing the PST by 1% and it will not charge PST of the Federal Carbon tax. Andrew Scheer announced that a federal Conservative government will return the GST collected on home heating.

My concern is not that the Conservatives wish to return tax money to taxpayers hands, my concern is with how they intend to do it. Scheer says “Heating your home in winter isn’t a luxury for Canadians. It is a necessity. We don’t tax other basic necessities like groceries and we shouldn’t be taxing home heating.” Of course Scheer is correct when he says heating our homes in the Canadian winter is not a luxury, but it does not follow that the appropriate response is to reimburse Canadians for the cost of heating.

We all know that there are many ways of lowering our energy bill. We can lower the thermostat and wear a sweater, we can add insulation to the house, we can choose to live in a smaller house, we can choose to share living space in some way, we can install a high efficiency furnace, we can heat with a renewable energy source – and our government can give us a rebate on the energy we buy. The difference between the first options listed and the government rebate is that the first options actually result in greater energy efficiency, the result is real savings, whereas the latter, the government rebate, simply transfers money from the government pocket to the homeowner pocket. The government rebate does not result in a real saving.

But it is worse than that. The proposed rebate on the tax paid on heating expense is really a counter incentive.

To the family looking for help purchasing basic human needs such as groceries and home heating, it does not matter whether the extra $100 or $200 comes as a rebate on heating costs or as a reduction on income tax.

The reduction in income tax is not likely to create any incentive to modify behaviour. In terms of behavioural change, so a reduction in income tax is a neutral. It will put more money into the hands of the ordinary person, but that rebate money is unlikely to change his behaviour. However high heating costs will encourage a change in behaviour. Families facing high heating costs will look for ways of reducing their energy consumption. This is a good thing.

Furthermore, the heating tax rebate will, in effect, penalize those who have already done the right thing and reduced their heating cost. A homeowner who has expended the capital cost and built a net zero house, a house where all heat energy is generated from solar, will get no government rebate becasue he has bought no fuel.

Granted, $100 or $200 per year is not enough money to produce much of an incentive. A true incentive would need to be more substantial. This is why we have, in previous columns, criticized the Liberal Carbon Tax as being too timid. But this recent announcement from Mr. Scheer seems to be indicating which direction the Conservatives are moving.

While criticizing the Liberal Carbon Tax, Mr. Scheer has been unwilling to tell Canadians how Conservatives will deal with carbon emissions. If this recent announcement is an indication of what to expect from the Federal Conservatives, we and our children are in big trouble indeed. Nature does not negotiate.

Canada is facing a moral and ethical crisis of leadership.

Canadians do not expect their prime ministers to be perfect, but they do expect them to be honest.

They expect their prime ministers to be fair. To be in command of their office. To be accountable for their actions. To know right from wrong. To recognize corrupt special interests and to summon both the courage to stand up to them and the strength to shut them down.

What Canadians have seen from Justin Trudeau over the last month — since the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal broke and consumed his entire government — is a prime minister who possesses none of these abilities.

The accusations against him are severe.

He stands accused of the kind of corruption more common in third-world dictatorships than in countries like Canada where the rule of law is supposed to be supreme.

He has used the power of his office to subvert the law and secure special treatment for a well-connected company.

Here are the facts:

First, Justin Trudeau led a government-wide campaign — involving his highest-ranking officials and advisors — to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution on corruption charges.

Second, he did so by pressuring, harassing and threatening former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould into using her power to stop the prosecution and get SNC-Lavalin off the hook.

And third, when Ms. Wilson-Raybould refused to back down, he fired her.

In attempting to contain the damage, the real Justin Trudeau has emerged. Not the model of openness, transparency, feminism and reconciliation he pitched to Canadians during the 2015 election. Canadians now know that was a carefully scripted and choreographed performance to win votes.

The real Justin Trudeau avoids accountability, shifts blame, suppresses dissent, pushes falsehoods and rationalizes corruption.

Over the past four weeks, Trudeau has refused to take the stand at the Justice committee to answer questions under oath and blocked attempts from MPs to call on other key witnesses from his office.

He has accused Ms. Wilson-Raybould for not alerting him to his own office’s bullying and intimidation — though she did on several occasions.

He continues to censor Ms. Wilson-Raybould, refusing to waive the full solicitor-client privilege that prevents her from telling her side of the story.

He continues to push a debunked argument that thousands of Canadian jobs would disappear if SNC’s prosecution is allowed to continue.

And he has described the sustained, coordinated and politically motivated harassment of Ms. Wilson-Raybould to stop SNC’s prosecution as his government “doing our job.”

I appreciate that the legalities of the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal are layered and complex. But the moral implications are obvious.

I believe that Canada must be a country where the powerful and politically connected are held to the same standards and laws as everybody else.

I believe Canadians deserve a government that refuses to be manipulated by high-priced lobbyists and corporate executives trying to escape punishment under the law.

And I believe Canada needs a prime minister who rejects the idea that political interference in the justice system is simply routine government business.

As the scandal has rocked the government, leading to two high-profile cabinet ministers resigning, and grinding the government to a halt, Trudeau hides behind one excuse after another.

He has also used his power to block attempts to shine the light of day on this sordid affair. He has shut down attempts for a public inquiry and used his majority on the Justice committee to prevent key witnesses from testifying.

And he continues to prevent Ms. Wilson-Raybould to fully disclose details about key conversations and meetings after she was fired as attorney-general. On Wednesday, the Justice committee will meet to decide whether or not to invite Ms. Wilson-Raybould to testify for a second time.

We know Ms. Wilson-Raybould was threatened. Who made those threats and what were they? We know she was fired as attorney general. What reason was she given? We know she then resigned from cabinet. Why?

She testified there were important details that are key to this case that happened during the portion of her time in cabinet that Trudeau has not allowed her to divulge. What are they?

Only she can answer these questions. Right now, she can’t.

If Justin Trudeau truly has nothing to hide, he must allow Ms. Wilson-Raybould to speak again. He must waive the privilege and cabinet confidence that is protecting him from the full truth coming out.

We have launched a new website — www.LetHerSpeak.ca — where Canadians can tell Justin Trudeau to lift his gag order.

In his crisis of leadership, it’s the least he can do.

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered an emotional clarion call Monday as he urged people of all political stripes to turn the page on hateful ideology and condemn the sort of intolerance that fuelled the brutal killing of 50 Muslims in New Zealand.

A visibly angry Trudeau denounced the ""small, toxic segments"" of society that peddle the belief diversity is a weakness, spewing hatred and inciting brutality.

""We see it here in Canada -- in online harassment, anonymous letters, defaced places of worship, acts of violence and even murder,"" he told the House of Commons as party leaders expressed solidarity with the victims in Christchurch and their families.

""When we fail to denounce hatred with total conviction, we empower those people and legitimize their violence.""

Trudeau expressed sorrow at the many attacks in recent years that have taken the lives of defenceless people at mosques, temples, churches, synagogues, concerts, schools and malls.

""I'm sick and tired of extending our thoughts and our prayers. People around the world are exhausted by the carnage,"" he said.

""We have to chase out this hatred from our parties, fight it online, denounce it at town halls, push back when it reaches our front door.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer joined Trudeau in stressing the need to condemn all racist ideologies and doctrines of prejudice.

Canada has, from its inception, been a country built on values that transcend religious, ethnic and linguistic divides, Scheer said. ""This is who we are, and this is who we will always be. Those who think otherwise have no place in our democracy.""

In his maiden speech to the Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the use of dehumanizing language and making immigration out to be a threat can breed fear and fuel hatred.

""Let's open our hearts and replace the ignorance, the lack of knowledge with understanding, which will create the climate for compassion, so we care for one another,"" he said.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale suggested Friday's deadly mass shooting, which killed 50 people and wounded 50 more as they gathered at a pair of Christchurch mosques, will spur parliamentarians to take a careful look at Canada's gun laws.

The massacre has sparked a global sense of concern that will prompt Canadian politicians to make some timely decisions, Goodale said Monday after appearing before a Senate committee.

Goodale said cabinet colleague Bill Blair will deliver recommendations soon, having been asked last August by Trudeau to study the possibility of a full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada.

A visibly galvanized Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's prime minister, said her government plans to announce gun-law reforms within days.

A bill already before Canada's Senate would, among other things, expand the scope of background checks on those who want to acquire guns here.

The bill would also require gun retailers keep records of firearms inventory and sales, and ensure the purchaser of a hunting rifle or shotgun presents a firearms licence, while the seller would have to verify it.","PM condemns hateful, 'toxic segments' of society after New Zealand shooting",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/pm-condemns-hateful-toxic-segments-of-society-after-new-zealand-shooting-1.4341064

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection — made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart — ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.","Singh makes history, steps into the Commons",The Canadian Press on MSN.ca,https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/politics/singh-makes-history-steps-into-the-commons/ar-BBUVKgL?li=AAggXBV&OCID=ansmsnnews11

This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto. Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair. With the resignation of clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick — one of the main protagonists in the controversy — announced just minutes before question period, the focus promptly returned to the topic that has consumed Canadian politics for the past five weeks. Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation. But he may have to wait a few more months — until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign — for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

Article Continued Below

Tuesday’s budget — the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office — marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future. In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Article Continued Below

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda. One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more. But the SNC-Lavalin affair — and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction — has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic. As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue. Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh. The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives. It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage. Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000. On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals. Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner. Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago. Like Clark who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks. In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of NDP MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at 9 per cent, two points ahead of the NDP. The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall. As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

He is the first person of colour to lead a federal party.

In a speech after he was sworn in, Singh thanked the people of Burnaby South for allowing him to be their voice in Ottawa, as well as his friends, family and supporters.

""Any time you achieve anything, there are so many people that made it possible. You never do it alone.""

Singh said, as a young boy he could have never imagined he would run for prime minister one day, but he wants all children now to have a more diverse image of what a prime minister can be.

""That image is now going to be more and more clear for young people in this country,"" he said.

""I'm only here today because other people broke barriers for me.""

Singh won a byelection in Burnaby South at the end of February.

He will enter the Commons on a busy week that includes a federal budget and continuing drama around the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He also spoke about the mosque attacks in New Zealand that left 50 people dead, saying it's time to tear down the root causes of hate, not just denounce the actions. He called for an end to policies and language that treat people as less than human.

Being a leader means serving: Singh

Singh says his strategy in the House is to push for more affordable housing, an environmentally responsible economy, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and better healthcare.

He says he'll treat his role as rooted in the Punjabi translation of the word 'leader,' which translates roughly into English as ""the one who serves.""

""We're going to have a tough road ahead of us,"" he said, acknowledging the party only has a few months to convince Canadians that the NDP is a viable option.

""Together we're going to change this country.""

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn’t able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

Despite a bevy of recent polls that show Liberal support is leaking in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin matter, nervous Grits can look to how incumbent governments have fared in every general election since 1867.

Not counting the first general election — the only one, of course, in which there was no incumbent — the party that entered the campaign as the government held on to power after the ballots were counted 26 out of 41 times, a re-election rate of 63 per cent.

Political scientists describe the increased odds of winning elections if you’ve already won one as the “incumbency advantage” and there have been several studies in Canada and worldwide which have measured and validated this effect.

And while there is no consensus on how big or significant this advantage is, there is fairly broad agreement among both academics as well as practicing political operatives that, given the choice, you’d rather be an incumbent than a challenger.

Which brings us to Canada’s New Democratic Party.

Already facing many other challenges compared to its main rivals the Liberals and the Conservatives, the NDP is facing a steep “incumbency disadvantage” that could further hobble leader Jagmeet Singh’s attempts to make a difference in this fall’s election.

A whopping 32 per cent of New Democrats elected in 2015 will not be on the ballot in support of leader Jagmeet Singh this fall. (And it could be slightly higher: Two-term NDP MP Christine Moore has said she will not decide if she’s running again until after she gives birth later this spring.)

As an NDP strategist, Robin McLachlan, a vice-president at Ottawa-based consultancy Summa Strategies, concedes that losing a lot of incumbents, including veterans like B.C.’s Nathan Cullen, Edmonton’s Linda Duncan, or Hamilton, Ont.’s David Christopherson, will be a challenge.

“But any political strategist is going to say that any challenge is an opportunity and that's what this has to be for the NDP — to go out and find who's the next generation and who are we communicating to perhaps a little bit more strongly now,” McLachlan said.

By comparison, just 12 Liberal MPs, or seven per cent, will not follow Justin Trudeau into battle again and only slightly fewer Conservative MPs — 12 per cent — will not run again this fall in support of their leader Andrew Scheer.

Those numbers are based on interviews with MPs themselves, press releases, and data provided by each party.

Library of Parliament data going all the way back to 1945 shows that, on average, in any general election, about 12 per cent of incumbents do not run. The Global News estimate for the upcoming 2019 election is that about 11 per cent of the 338 MPs who won in 2015 (or in intervening byelections) will not stand again.

But the NDP’s incumbency disadvantage — 32 per cent of incumbents not running — is off the charts for any one party, at least according to Library of Parliament data going back to the 2000 general election.



In the last 20 years, no party has ever had more than 20 per cent of its incumbents decline to stand for re-election. That, as it turns out, was the Conservatives in the 2015 election. Interestingly, the NDP in 2015 also had its highest rate of incumbents not running: 17 per cent who won with Jack Layton in 2011 did not run under Thomas Mulcair’s banner.

A Bloomberg News analysis of party incumbency rates, published in 2015 and which examined data going back to 1945, found only one instance of a party losing more incumbents than Singh and the NDP have this year. That was in 1993 when, according to Bloomberg, 40.8 per cent of Progressive Conservatives elected on Brian Mulroney's ticket in 1988 opted not to run for Kim Campbell. The PCs, of course, got crushed in that campaign by Jean Chretien's Liberals and would win just two seats.

READ MORE: Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes says she won’t seek re-election

That 1993 election, just like the 2015 election, was one of those rare “change elections” and so, being an incumbent for the governing party may not have counted for much. And yet, though Justin Trudeau's Liberals were the clear beneficiaries of the electorate's desire for change in 2015, the Liberals may have been benefited from the fact that both the Conservatives and the NDP in that election were at 20-year highs when it comes to rates of incumbents not seeking re-election.

Conversely, looking ahead to the 2019 election, the ‘weak’ incumbency advantage for an NDP already struggling in the polls and struggling to raise money combined with the relatively ‘strong’ incumbency advantage for other parties could be an influencing factor in the campaign to come.

The NDP's competitors will almost certainly put resources and energy into NDP ridings where incumbents have left, if only because the job of stealing a riding from another party is made easier when no incumbent is there to defend it.



Expect, for example, the Bloc Quebecois will be licking its lips at the prospect of picking up the Montreal riding of Laurier Sainte-Marie, the riding long-held by former BQ leader Gilles Duceppe until New Democrat Helen Laverdiere snatched it away when the Orange Wave rolled across Quebec in 2011. Laverdiere, though, is not running this fall.

New Democrat Fin Donnelly had held the British Columbia riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam since 2009 but is not running this year. That's a riding the Conservatives can expect to be eyeing, in a part of the Lower Mainland where both Conservative and, before that, Canadian Alliance candidates had some electoral success.

READ MORE: Victoria MP Murray Rankin leaving federal politics, more NDP politicians could be on the way

Or think about the riding of Victoria. New Democrat Murray Rankin narrowly squeaked by the Green Party when he first came to the Commons in a 2012 byelection. And now that he's retiring, the Greens, whose leader Elizabeth May holds the riding right next door, will surely have much higher hopes to win this seat this fall than they would have had Rankin been the incumbent.

Political scientists who have studied the ""incumbency advantage"" suggest that an incumbent candidate enjoys what amounts to a head start of anywhere between five per cent to 10 per cent of the popular vote — a significant head start in Canada's first-past-the-post system where an MP can get elected on as little as 35 per cent of the popular vote in a local riding.

One study, published in 2012 in the Canadian Journal of Economics, concluded that, so far as elections for seats in the House of Commons were concerned, ""incumbents enjoy a 9.4-11.2% increased probability of winning over non-incumbents.""

Again: That's an advantage Liberals will have in 93 per cent of the 2019 races where they have an incumbent. The Conservatives will have that advantage in 88 per cent of races where they have incumbents but the New Democrats will enjoy that advantage in just 68 per cent of the territory they won in 2015 and that they must now defend.

That 2012 paper also concluded that the ""incumbency advantage"" goes to the candidate and not to the party.



""Our findings suggest ... that individual candidates are more important than may have been expected,"" wrote paper authors Chad Kendall of the University of British Columbia and Marie Rekkas of Simon Fraser University.

""The incumbent advantage is largely name recognition and organization,"" said Jason Roy, an associate professor in the department of political science at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ont. Roy co-authored a paper published in 2014 that described an experiment in which authors tried to quantify the electoral advantage a ""star candidate"" has in an election and found an advantage that was worth up to 10 percentage points.

""That was in an experimental setting but the challenge, of course, is that in that setting, everything else is controlled,"" Roy said. ""So, on average, you can say, yeah, there is a boost for a star candidate which I suspect would be true for the most part with an incumbent but [a lot] of other factors really matter that can wipe out that advantage quite quickly.""

READ MORE: Liberal incumbent to leave Toronto-area seat, setting up rare GTA opening for Tories

Roy's 2014 paper, co-authored with Western University associate professor of political science Chris Alcantra, did find that voters with weak partisan ties — the ""leaners"" in any election who could be persuaded to vote one way or the other — were most susceptible to voting for a strong local candidate which, for their study, was a strong ""star"" candidate. Roy and Alcantra estimated that the odds of a ""leaner"" voter choosing a strong local candidate increased by nearly 40 percentage points versus a generic candidate.

In a close race or a race in which there are three or four parties who may all be expected to get a significant portion of the vote, such an advantage with 'leaners' could be a big advantage. Conversely, if a party fails to attract star candidates — or loses strong incumbents — that advantage disappears or may shift to another party who can field a stronger local candidate. That, in a nutshell, is the NDP's ""incumbency disadvantage"" in this election.

All of that said, one of the factors that mitigate this incumbency advantage or the star candidate advantage is something political scientists have described as ""the leader effect,"" the notion that the local candidate has come to matter less and less over the last several elections. That may be a function of a changing media environment. In any event, some political scientists and political pollsters believe this means a candidate’s fate hinges increasingly more on the leader and the leader’s performance during a campaign

""I think that's the advantage that Jagmeet Singh has,” said McLachlan, the NDP strategist. ""He has to build his own brand as a leader and he needs to captivate the audience of progressive Canadians and he's going to do that by presenting a vision that demonstrates that Justin Trudeau isn't the same guy that he campaigned like in 2015.""

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection -- made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart -- ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.",NDP's Jagmeet Singh makes history in House of Commons,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/ndp-s-jagmeet-singh-makes-history-in-house-of-commons-1.4340972

OTTAWA -- New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has been sworn in as a member of Parliament.

The NDP says Singh becomes the first racialized party leader to sit in the House of Commons.

He won a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South in February, taking roughly 39 per cent of the vote.

The win means Singh can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the party reins from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

In a statement, Singh says he will use his new position to pressure the Liberal government to take action on affordable housing and bringing down prescription drug costs.

He says as a kid, he never would have imagined being in this position.

""I would've never imagined that someone who looks like me could ever run to be prime minister,"" Singh said in a statement issued by the party on Sunday.

Singh said he is committed to building on late NDP leader Jack Layton's message of love, hope and optimism with courage.",NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh sworn in as member of Parliament for Burnaby South,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-sworn-in-as-member-of-parliament-for-burnaby-south-1.4340018

He is the first leader of a major political party in Canada’s parliament who is not white, a distinction that Singh acknowledged after question period as something he never could have imagined when he was growing up.

“It’s an incredible honour. I’m humbled. I’m blown away by the immensity of the role I’ve been granted,” said Singh, a former criminal lawyer who was born in Scarborough and is the son of immigrants from India. “If I could have in some way broken down barriers for people, I would have done something good with my life,” he said. Singh’s debut in the Commons is a result of his Feb. 25 byelection victory in Burnaby South, the British Columbia riding he moved to last year in a bid to win his first federal seat. He used the occasion to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the government’s affordable housing plan, demanded the Liberals increase carbon price charges on heavy polluters, and repeat his party’s call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

For Singh, the moment comes at a challenging time for the party he leads. Fundraising has sunk from $18 million in 2015 to around $5 million last year, while the party has taken out a $12 million mortgage on its national headquarters, the Jack Layton Building. Meanwhile, about a quarter of the party’s caucus has resigned their seats or announced they won’t run in the general election this fall, including veterans like B.C. MPs Nathan Cullen and Murray Rankin, Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Ontario stalwarts David Christopherson and Irene Mathyssen.

Singh himself has received negative attention for communications stumbles, including occasions when he seemed unaware of his own party’s position on issues like the Liberal government gun legislation and the question of whether Canada was right to recognize Venezuela’s opposition leader as the country’s legitimate president. In the months leading up to his byelection run, as Singh toured the country in a series of “JagMeet and Greet” events, many NDP insiders argued he needed a seat in the Commons to change the narrative that had settled in over the first year of his leadership. On Monday, Singh finally appeared in the House, tapping the breast of his suit and waving to his family as he was escorted to take his seat at the head of the NDP benches. His younger brother, Ontario MPP Gurratan Singh, said afterwards that it was “an historic and momentous occasion for all Canadians.” He looked on from the public gallery with Singh’s wife and parents, and wore a yellow turban that matched his brother’s on the Commons floor below. “For people who don’t see themselves represented in politics, today was a milestone,” he said. Singh spent much of question period listening intently. During the opening exchange between Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, he pressed his earpiece against his head and took notes. Later, after he had asked his own questions, Singh got up and left for a few minutes. When he returned, he briefly walked down the wrong aisle and had to double back to get to his seat. He has seven months to learn where it is before he has to win it again. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @aballinga

In an interview with CTV’s Question Period, Singh called the contradictory testimony from Gerald Butts, Prime Minister Trudeau’s former principal secretary, “incredulous” and “simply unbelievable,” and he’s urging the Liberals to let the former attorney-general respond.

“Given all that, Ms. Wilson-Raybould should have the chance to come to committee and provide her rebuttal to what’s been put forward,” Singh told CTV’s Evan Solomon.

Singh enters the House of Commons Monday as the Liberals continue to deal with the SNC-Lavalin affair. Whether or not Wilson-Raybould will be granted the opportunity to return to the committee will be decided in a debate behind closed doors on Tuesday.

When Singh takes his seat in the House of Commons, he will do so as the first person from a visible minority to lead a federal party. He said he understands the historic weight of the moment.

“I remember when I was growing up as a kid, I would never have thought that someone like me, someone looking like me, would ever run to become prime minister -- would ever even have that opportunity,” he said.

“And I know there’s a lot of people counting on me, because there’s far too many Canadians who feel like they don’t belong, who feel like they don’t matter. And I’m hoping that the same way I’ve been able to get to this point because people broke barriers for me, I’m hoping that maybe I can break some barriers for others.”

POLLS: NDP LAGGING BEHIND

With a federal election coming in October, Singh won’t have any time to waste in winning over voters – particularly progressives who supported the Liberals in 2015.

In the latest Nanos Research tracking poll, released on March 12, the NDP ranked third, at 18 per cent, well behind the Liberals, at 33 per cent, and the Conservatives, at 36 per cent.

Still, Trudeau came out on top as the preferred choice for prime minister, with 32.5 per cent support, followed by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, at 25 per cent. Singh captured just 7.4 per cent – virtually tying Green Leader Elizabeth May, at 7.1 per cent.

Those numbers hint at an uphill battle for Singh. Touching on his election strategy, Singh said the NDP will “provide a real contrast” to Trudeau’s Liberals.

“Right now we see a scandal where there’s political interference, where well-connected executives of a corporation have a direct line of access can call up the prime minister of his office and get laws changed and can see attorneys-general that are being pressured to change their position,” he said.

“Instead, we want to say to people, listen, we don’t believe that’s the way government should operate. We believe government should be on people’s side working for people and putting forward their priorities.”

The Liberals are set to unveil their latest budget on Tuesday—Singh’s second day on the job. Details on a Liberal pharmacare plan could be unveiled.

The NDP has already proposed a universal, public pharmacare program if elected. Anything short of that, Singh says, simply isn’t good enough.

“We’re not looking for a U.S.-style patchwork system, which is what the Liberals are going to propose. We’ve heard that, we’ve seen them hinting at it. That is not good for Canadians. It doesn’t help all Canadians. Millions of Canadians will not be protected by that type of plan,” he said.

“What we want is a universal, national, public, single-payer, medication-for-all program, much like we’ve seen in other countries where it’s effective at giving everyone the care they need, reduce costs and (it’s) just something that makes sense.”

Asked how he’d pay for the ambitious plan, Singh said he would make “different choices” than the Liberals and crack down on tax havens and other systems the benefit the richest of the rich.

“I believe that a universal medication coverage for all is possible. We could cancel some of those types of initiatives that are not benefitting Canadians and there’s revenue that we’re proposing in our budget,” he said.

“We’re saying there’s other tax havens, there’s CEO stock option loopholes, there’s a number of things we can do to close that revenue that we’re losing and bring it into our country and invest in programs like this.”

CALLING OUT HATE

Singh also touched on the horrific mass shooting in New Zealand, where 49 worshippers were killed at a mosque in Christchurch during Friday prayers. He said politicians in Canada who flirt with hateful extremist groups, or don’t loudly call them out, should be held responsible.

Singh drew a direct line between hateful political rhetoric and hate-motivated shootings, specifically citing the case of Quebec mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette, who killed six people and injured 19 others in 2017.

“That type of rhetoric has to be called out. We have to name it. What happened in Quebec was born in Quebec. That was born in Canada. Not someone who came in as a refugee or an immigrant.”

When it comes to immigration, Singh said, the conversation cannot devolve into pointing fingers at outsiders.

“When people start blaming and using inflammatory language around immigration and refugees, it creates a climate for hate and fear to grow,” he said.

“There can be legitimate discussions around what is the appropriate approach to take to our immigration system, but it can’t include dog-whistle politics that are particularly inflammatory against people who are already marginalized. And we’ve seen that happen before. That needs to be denounced.”

TURNING POINT FOR NDP?

Monday marks a significant milestone for the NDP: it’s the first time since October 2017 that the party’s leader has sat in the House of Commons.

Asked whether he’s nervous for his first day, Singh admitted: “You know, a little bit.”

“It’s the big leagues. Anyone who’s looked at politics in Canada, anyone who’s looked at our system, looks at this as the pinnacle.”

Singh already knows what he’ll ask as his first question in Parliament – and he offered a broad hint.

“How do we make life better for Canadians, housing affordability, medication coverage for all, the environment. This general topic of area, you’ll hear me focus on.”

METHODOLOGY

The Weekly Nanos Tracking is produced by the Nanos Research Corporation, headquartered in Canada, which operates in Canada and the United States. The data is based on a dual frame (land + cell-lines) random telephone interviews with 1,000 Canadians using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week, 18 years of age and over. The random sample of 1,000 respondents may be weighted by age and gender using the latest census information for Canada. The interviews are compiled into a four week rolling average of 1,000 interviews, where each week the oldest group of 250 interviews is dropped and a new group of 250 interviews is added.

A random telephone survey of 1,000 Canadians is accurate ±3.1 percentage points, plus or minus, 19 times out of 20.

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

He won a byelection in Burnaby South on Feb. 25 to replace former MP and current mayor of Vancouver Kennedy Stewart.

Singh also made history as the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Parliament.

Singh used his first speaking opportunity during question period to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on housing.

He repeated a story he told many times during the byelection campaign, saying he met a teacher forced to live in her parents’ basement due to Burnaby’s unaffordable housing market.

Singh asked Trudeau whether the Liberal government would commit to building 500,000 new homes, alluding to the NDP’s proposal to do so over the next 10 years.

Trudeau welcomed Singh to Ottawa and said he hopes New Democrats back the Liberal government’s ongoing efforts to create affordable housing.

Singh also joined many Conservative MPs in calling on Trudeau to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify in front of the justice committee for a second time to address the the SNC-Lavalin affair. He also repeated his call for the Liberals to launch a public inquiry into the case.

“For Canadians watching at home, this doesn't look any different than when the Conservatives were in power – special access for powerful corporations, a closed door for everyone else,” he said. “Why is this prime minister so afraid to launch a public inquiry?”

Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger deflected the calls from the opposition parties, saying Wilson-Raybould already had her chance to speak.

Singh also addressed the mosque shooting that killed 50 and injured dozens more in New Zealand last week. An avowed white supremacist has been charged in the massacre.

“That attack reverberated across the world. Though it happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, the pain impacted all of us,” he said. “It hurts here in Canada, where Muslim brothers and sisters – our friends, our close ones, people who work with us – are thinking about their own loved ones when they go to masjid, when they go to prayer, and how much it hurts to know that you're being targeted for being who you are.”

Singh said the attack was borne of white supremacist and Islamophobic hatred.

“Hate knows no bounds. Once hate is allowed to grow, it consumes all in its path. Hate is like a fire – once it's allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everything,” he said.

Singh joined Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer in condemning Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, but said Canada must go further by addressing the root causes of such hatred.

When people refer to migrants as “illegal” or “barbaric,” they dehumanize them, he said.

“The purpose is to dehumanize and then, once you dehumanize, it leads to fear and hatred,” he said. “Let's be conscious of the words we use so we never create any ground for hate to grow.”

Singh made the comments after Trudeau and Scheer made their own statements condemning the attack and expressing solidarity with the people of New Zealand and Muslims around the world.

Trudeau addressed the various forms of prejudice and discrimination he said lead to terrorist attacks around the world.

“It's anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, anti-black, anti-Indigenous, misogynistic, homophobic – the list goes on and on,” he said. “This rhetoric is dangerous, hateful and vile; it lives and festers online, spilling out into the real world with deadly consequences.”

Scheer expressed similar sentiments.

He said the attack in New Zealand was reminiscent of the 2017 attack on a Quebec City mosque in which a white nationalist killed six men in their place of worship.

Scheer called for unity among political parties in condemning hateful ideologies.

“I say to my colleagues in all parties, we certainly have our differences on important policy matters that deserve rigorous and spirited debate, but on this – the very compassion and humanity of our Canadian society – there can be no debate,” he said.","Jagmeet Singh presses on housing, calls out dehumanizing language in Parliament debut",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/news/jagmeet-singh-presses-on-housing-calls-out-dehumanizing-language-in-parliament-debut-1.23667389

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney ...,"OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

The party introduced a bill last week that would create a local action on climate change fund.

It calls for a pot of money municipalities would be able to access to help with climate change-related projects that require new staff, or to support existing staff, planning work or in construction of physical infrastructure.

NDP municipal affairs critic Lisa Roberts said the goal is to reduce the barriers for municipalities looking to take action on climate change.

That also includes addressing questions of jurisdiction. The bill would clear the way for municipalities to be in control of green energy generation.

""We want to make it clear because we recognize that there is urgent need to act,"" she said. ""And where there is energy and good ideas from municipalities, we want to say, 'Yes, go, do it now.'""

The other key aspect of the bill is setting aside up to $62,500 to create a staff position within the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities that would be dedicated to helping municipalities access federal funding programs for climate change or environmental sustainability projects.

Roberts said her caucus has heard concerns from some smaller, more financially challenged municipalities that they don't have the resources to dedicate the necessary time to pursue federal funding.

""It doesn't make sense necessarily to try to put those resources at each municipality, especially when often there can be learning that can be done across municipalities,"" she said.

Yarmouth Mayor Pam Mood, who is also vice-president of the federation, said they support anything that would make things easier for cash-strapped municipalities, especially if it's something everyone can share.

""I think it would make a huge difference,"" said Mood.

""As municipalities big and small, we're certainly doing everything we can with regard to climate change. We know how important it is, but somehow we have to be able to pay for it.""

Currently, municipalities have access to provincial programs for flood-risk infrastructure and a program that can be used for storm water and wastewater projects.

Municipal Affairs Minister Chuck Porter said that while he's not heard concerns from municipalities, he knows climate change is a pressing issue across the province.

Porter said he believes the programs in place are working, but he's also open to reviewing what's offered and considering other ideas.

""We're always open to this. This is ever-changing, and we have to be — it's very fluid.""

The minister noted municipalities also have the ability to work together when it comes to planning. He said they can share resources or one council can buy a service from another council.

""It doesn't really matter about how big or how small you are,"" he said. ""It makes sense from a financial perspective for two or three or four municipalities in a region to work together on this thing,"" he said.

""There's nothing saying they can't do that. We encourage that and certainly our office is there to support them as well.""",NDP bill would provide more climate change support to municipalities,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/climate-change-municipalities-legislation-ndp-chuck-porter-1.5061560

The Saskatchewan NDP is calling on Premier Scott Moe to instruct his cabinet ministers not to attend yellow vest rallies.

Opposition Leader Ryan Meili pressed the matter during question period Monday and cited last week’s mosque shootings in New Zealand that left 50 dead.

Meili is demanding Moe distance himself from the yellow vest movement, which originated in France but has been adopted in Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

Some who attend yellow vest rallies and post on its social media pages decry immigration, as well as the federal government’s energy policies.

Earlier this year, an NDP member questioned why Minister of Highways and Infrastructure Lori Carr and Minister for Rural and Remote Health Greg Ottenbreit attended yellow vest rallies.

Moe said ministers who attended the rallies did so specifically to oppose federal energy policies.

“We should in no way paint all of these individuals with the same brush due to a few comments by a few individuals.”

His government condemns comments that are anti-immigrant and Islamophobic, he said.

Meili said anti-immigration language and statements of violence made against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can be found at yellow vest rallies and in its online groups.

“For the premier to be unwilling to distance himself from those events and that movement is irresponsible,” he said.

""Never say never, Jack Layton told me, so that's what I'm saying,"" Cullen said in an interview airing Saturday on CBC Radio's The House.

""It's in my blood, man. I think it's always been there and these last 15 years [in federal politics] have only confirmed that I love it.""

And while B.C. NDP Premier John Horgan might welcome a seasoned player like Cullen to his caucus, the high-profile parliamentarian said he is looking forward to taking a break before making up his mind about wading back into politics.

""I won't speak for the premier. I do think that I need a break from what I've been doing,"" he said. ""Maybe one day. But I haven't made any plans and I haven't made any promises, nor have any promises been made to me.""

On March 1, Cullen announced that he wouldn't run for re-election this fall — adding his name to a growing list of NDP MPs who have resigned or say they will not be running again.

In his interview with The House, Cullen — who was first elected in 2004 — told host David Cochrane the time was right to step down.

""My kids are eight ... and it's a 30-hour commute every week [to Ottawa],"" he said. His northern B.C. riding of Skeena-Bulkley Valley borders Alaska and Yukon.

""It's stunning, and I've never ever wanted to complain about it,"" he said. ""Representing a place that is that big and diverse is a challenge, but it's what I signed up for and I love it.

""It's a question of sustainability and making sure you're doing right by your family. I came in with my family, my physical health and my integrity, and the plan was always to leave with those three things intact as well.""

Changing nature of politics

Cullen said that, after 15 years on the Hill, he's seen a lot of changes to how politics gets done.

""The Internet and social media have picked up the pace for everything, from a story breaking to it having significance in people's minds and hearts. That distance has shortened,"" he said.

""We can move from the political to the personal very quickly. If you really want to crank up your numbers on social media, getting personal and making things seem much larger than they are is one way to gain that notoriety,"" he added, admitting he's had ""more than a few conversations"" which ended in him apologizing to colleagues after a debate.

""I've known right away when I've screwed up, when I've crossed that line. Representing the north, sometimes we talk pretty directly to each other.""

Cullen also discussed a trend he said he's noticed during his tenure as an MP.

""I think Canadians seem to have a willingness to change their moods and attitudes towards who they want to elect on a more frequent basis,"" he said.

Whether that means a switch from a Liberal government to an NDP one remains to be seen, but Cullen for one is optimistic as he prepares to leave the party he's represented for a decade and a half.

""I think there's nothing but opportunity actually for the party,"" he said. ""Politically, the circumstances are looking up. I don't think Mr. Scheer has fully connected yet with Canadians, and I think Mr. Trudeau obviously is having some fair and serious difficulties of his own.""

NDP's federal fortunes

Cullen admitted that puts some pressure on NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who won his first seat in the House of Commons in a byelection Feb. 25.

""If Mr. Singh is able to redefine himself, because I think the first year – as he admits – wasn't as good as he wanted it to be, now he has this opportunity. It's a short runway but it's one I've seen people land before.""

Focusing specifically on Quebec, a province the NDP dominated in the 2011 federal election in what was known as the 'Orange Wave', Cullen said he's not placing any bets.

""I think essentially Quebec is up for grabs,"" he said. ""I think you're going to be looking at a lot of three, four, five-way races.

""I think the expectation of Jagmeet has been lowered. I think his possibility to rise above that is almost guaranteed, and just how far above it he goes is really the question for me.""

The NDP is calling into question Premier Doug Ford's attendance record at Queen's Park.

In a news conference Friday, NDP MPP Catherine Fife told reporters that since Dec. 1, the premier has missed 11 out of 18 question periods.

""Instead of showing up and defending his government’s policies, he has been a no-show more than half the time,"" said Fife.

The NDP alleges that the Ron Taverner controversy is the reason why the premier has been absent so often.

WATCH (Aired March 6, 2019): Ron Taverner withdraws from consideration for OPP commissioner

""Since the OPP meddling scandal began, Doug Ford has been absent for 61 per cent of question periods. He’s ducking questions about his interference in the process to appoint the next OPP commissioner, and that’s why he has been hiding out so much since the start of the new session,"" said Fife.

The premier was absent for question period on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of last week after the news of former OPP deputy commissioner Brad Blair's firing broke. Ford was in the legislature, however, on Thursday and faced questions about the firing of Blair and changes to the Ontario Autism Program.

The premier's office said Wednesday that Ford spent much of the week touring businesses like SodaStream and Sobeys.

""Every single day, Premier Doug Ford travels across this province meeting with real people and job creators,"" said Simon Jeffries, a spokesperson for the premier, in a statement to Global News.

""This week, he attended the grand opening of SodaStream’s first and only Canadian manufacturing facility in Mississauga. He also met with farmers at the Chicken Farmers of Ontario AGM to discuss how the government can support our agricultural sector, and he opened Ontario’s pavilion at the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, where he heard from industry leaders who employ thousands of hard-working families in the mining sector.""

Jeffries added: ""While the NDP believe that everything begins and ends in downtown Toronto, Premier Doug Ford knows you have to go out and hear from real Ontario families.""

Interim Liberal Leader John Fraser also questioned Ford's attendance record.

""It’s obvious the premier is skipping question period because he doesn’t want to answer important questions about concerning changes to the Ontario Autism Program and interfering in police affairs,"" Fraser told Global News. ""He’s more focused on giving jobs to his friends than being accountable to Ontarians.""

Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner also weighed in.

""Why is the premier afraid to answer questions or be held accountable? The people of Ontario deserve better,"" Schreiner told Global News. ""They deserve a premier who will show up for work and answer the tough questions.""

Schreiner also said question period is the best opportunity to hold government accountable.

""It’s disappointing that the premier did not show up for this essential part of his job after the Taverner scandal broke,"" he added.

WATCH: Global News coverage of the Ron Taverner controversy

According to the Executive Council Act, ""every minister of the Crown is required to attend in the chamber during the period set aside for oral questions on at least two-thirds of the days on which the house holds routine proceedings.""

But attendance rules are not something the Speaker or the assembly are required to enforce — the premier is tasked with that duty.

Since Ford's election, the Premier's Office has not made public his daily itinerary. Distribution of a schedule has been standard practice with previous governments, however media outlets are often not notified of the events that Ford attends until they are publicized on government social media accounts.

News of Ford's whereabouts also regularly appears on Ontario News Now, a video production operation of PC Caucus Services that is used to promote government messaging.

Lois Mitchell.","Any doubt the NDP will home in on public health care ahead of the election was erased with Monday’s throne speech, delivered to a packed legislature by Alberta’s Lt.-Gov. Lois Mitchell.

The government pledged new measures to reduce wait times, strengthen critical women’s health services and reduce the cost of drugs for seniors. The speech also promised a significant expansion of affordable child care.

All of that will come on the heels of Bill 1, an act to protect public health care.

“This act will strengthen our ability to defend Albertans from American-style health care creeping into our province,” Notley told media at a Monday morning news conference at the Royal Alberta Museum.

“Whether you come to hospital with a fur coat or no coat, you deserve the same world-class health care as everyone else.”

Notley also promised to ramp up work to deliver clean drinking water to Alberta First Nations and introduce new measures to beef up democratic reforms.

If re-elected, Notley said her government will establish an all-party committee to review the Elections Act. It will focus on identifying loopholes that are allowing big money to trickle into politics.

“It’s always a difficult challenge, because we have to look at the constitution, but if there are ways to tighten this up then we will,” she said. “We want to see all parties in that process.”

Reflecting on its record

Surrounded by the usual pomp and circumstance of a throne speech — the 15-gun salute, inspection of the guard, music by the Royal Canadian Artillery Band — Monday was also a chance for the NDP government to reflect on its record as Alberta races toward a spring election.

In particular, the government highlighted its ban on corporate and union political donations, work to build or repair 4,700 affordable homes, and diversification of the economy through royalty incentives and loan guarantees.

The subject of pipelines earned attention in the throne speech too, with a renewed commitment to get the Trans Mountain expansion done.

“Years of inaction on pipelines left us overexposed to the price of oil. This is what we inherited and what we set out to fix. The job is not done, but we’ve made good progress,” Notley said.

“Gone are the days where we pay lip service.”

With seven pieces of new or amended legislation already lined up for the spring session, Notley gave voters no hints on when they might head to the polls, but the throne speech drummed home her government’s messaging that it is “working for Albertans.”

On Monday morning the premier also returned to referencing the “Sky Palace,” a controversy tied to former premier Alison Redford and costly upgrades ordered for the renovated Federal Building. Notley talked about the “entitlement,” “scandal” and “corruption” of previous conservative governments.

“The message is clear: Your government is here to work for you, not for itself,” Mitchell said in the throne speech.

“Sky Palaces are part of our past, not our future.”

Though the throne speech did not explicitly refer to the coming election, a new online poll by Leger conducted last week indicates growing voter intention to support the NDP, particularly in the Edmonton region where the NDP has inched ahead of the UCP by a single percentage point.

“It’s neck and neck, which I think is surprising,” said Ian Large, Leger’s Alberta vice-president.

Large said as more information about the UCP leadership campaign and collaboration between the Jason Kenney and Jeff Callaway camps leaks out, it might have more of an impact as Alberta gets closer to the election.

Still, the UCP continues to outrun the NDP in other parts of the province, polling at 49 per cent to the governing party’s 32 per cent in Calgary and 52 versus 31 in other parts of Alberta.

As a non-random internet survey, a margin of error is not reported.

Minor parties outline session plans

As the NDP government gave some vague direction for the spring session, minor parties outlined their plans.

Liberal Leader David Khan wants to debate legislation, countering calls from the UCP for Notley to drop the writ immediately.

“The UCP have their own particular political reasons for wanting an election right away. I think there’s important work that we have to do as a legislature … there are some important bills on the order paper that we want to discuss, especially protecting our public health-care system.”

But he doesn’t want bills introduced that are “political footballs.”

“If they’re on the order paper, they should be important to Albertans,” Khan said. “There should be a budget … that Albertans can look at.”

Meanwhile, the Freedom Conservative Party headed up by Strathmore-Brooks MLA Derek Fildebrandt will focus on holding the government to account.

Fildebrandt told media Monday morning it will fight attacks on choice in health care and oppose any interim supply bills.

His party will also fight “attacks on free speech,” he said, “even if the Tories tuck tail and run away again” as the UCP caucus did in refusing to debate or vote on abortion clinic bubble zones.

OTTAWA - New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has been sworn in as a member of Parliament.

The NDP says Singh becomes the first racialized party leader to sit in the House of Commons.

He won a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South in February, taking roughly 39 per cent of the vote.

The win means Singh can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the party reins from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

In a statement, Singh says he will use his new position to pressure the Liberal government to take action on affordable housing and bringing down prescription drug costs.

He says as a kid, he never would have imagined being in this position.

“I would've never imagined that someone who looks like me could ever run to be prime minister,” Singh said in a statement issued by the party on Sunday.

“Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson pans speculation tax at West Vancouver yacht club chat,” reported the North Shore News Thursday atop a report on his speech to the local chamber of commerce.

An Opposition leader who the populist-led New Democrats have framed as an elitist. Who played into the stereotype with a comment on the “wacky fun” of renting, which he later had to repudiate.

Now he chooses to deliver a speech on the admittedly half-baked speculation tax at the yacht club in West Vancouver of all places?

“Surprisingly, this isn’t satire written by me,” wrote Jeffrey Ferrier, a self-styled “progressive” and one of several who posted the story on Twitter.

“Wow,” returned Global TV correspondent Keith Baldrey, himself a columnist in the North Shore News. “Does no one do advance work for the Libs any more? A yacht club — especially the West Van one — is the last place a politician with an elitist image problem should go anywhere near.”

Stung, members of the Opposition caucus rode to Wilkinson’s defence.

“But this was a local chamber of commerce event,” protested former cabinet minister Rich Coleman. “When my chamber invites me I don’t tell them where to hold it. It is important to respect local volunteer groups, it is their decision.”

“Come on, Keith,” tweeted Michelle Stilwell, another former cabinet minister. “Why not focus on the issue of a half-baked speculation tax that doesn’t actually target speculators but makes 1.4 million British Columbians prove themselves otherwise?”

Picking up on the what-about-ism theme was former minister Shirley Bond: “How about when John Horgan calls (Liberal MLA) Jackie Tegart a ‘whiner’ for representing constituents and a bill introduced by (Liberal) Stephanie Cadieux is a ‘political stunt’? No comment???”

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the latest in the SNC-Lavalin affair, as well as challenges facing Education Minister Rob Fleming on Surrey school portables and Vancouver school closures, as well as the future of the NDP minority government now that it has survived confidence votes on the throne speech and budget.

But as experienced politicians know — or should know — telling a reporter that he/she should be writing about something other than what he/she is writing about is not a proven media management strategy.

“The physical location/backdrop of a political leader’s appearance during an election campaign is chosen with deliberate, strategic care,” wrote Baldrey by way of reply to several Liberals. “That’s because they matter when it comes to shaping messages and image.”

Yet from this case and others, it would appear the Liberals can’t be bothered with optics, making it easier for opponents to define Wilkinson.

Before long, the exchange veered into ridicule.

When I wrote of the Liberals that “they do protest too much,” someone tweeted back: “I believe in West Vancouver it’s pronounced ‘doth.’”

Also riffing on the Liberal gaffe was one who posted a video of Thurston Howell III, the parody billionaire played by Jim Backus on the old Gilligan’s Island TV show.

The New Democrats played it for laughs as well.

“B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson sailed into the West Vancouver Yacht Club yesterday to say ahoy to about two-dozen members of the exclusive group,” read the press release from a government caucus that is still more quick-witted at the job of opposing than the official Opposition.

And so on, through Wilkinson “tying himself into knots” and “his priority is to buoy the richest two per cent and leave everyone else lost at sea,” and “instead of throwing people a lifeline, Wilkinson is making them walk the plank.”

Great fun unless you happen to be on the Wilkinson defence team.

Reaching, someone in Liberal ranks noticed that attorney general David Eby had spoken at the “ritzy” Vancouver Club, and wasn’t that the same thing?

Plus there was this, from Opposition house leader Mary Polak: “Someone should advise Horgan not to speak at the B.C. Fed convention.”

Both missed the point.

Getting cozy with the Vancouver Club is not one of the unfortunate stereotypes associated with Eby. That appearance by the wealth-taxing, lawyer-bashing attorney general was more of a case of a politician venturing into the lion’s den.

And the annual convention of the 500,000-member B.C. Federation of Labour is a somewhat more broadly based venue than the West Van yacht club, whomever is hosting.

A more apt comparison would be to Environment Minister George Heyman’s attendance at a celebratory dinner with anti-pipeline activists last January, just after he announced B.C. would restrict shipments of heavy oil from Alberta.

Not only did his government have to pull back the threat, but reporting on the appearance helped put Heyman in the activist camp himself.

Or consider how the story was played when Adrian Dix, who’d admitted forging a memo in the casino scandal, was caught without a ticket on SkyTrain.

As for Horgan, one of his vulnerabilities is a quick temper. Though he’s kept it in check lately, he made the news more than once when he lost it during his days in Opposition.

Every leader has weaknesses, some more unfortunate than others. A key political art is to turn one’s weaknesses into strengths, or failing that, to avoid reinforcing the stereotype.

Wilkinson knows very well that the NDP will indulge the class warfare theme every chance it gets.

“It’s a good way to generate stories about people who are deemed to be well off and how they are going to be kicked around a bit,” he told the chamber crowd. “That’s good politics for the NDP.”

Kicking Wilkinson around is even better politics for the New Democrats. Once more this week, he played right into their hands.

The party announced Sunday that Kirby Smith has been chosen as the NDP’s candidate in the riding after Esther Tailfeathers withdraw her name.

The NDP says Smith has “proven that he is committed to serving his community,” having worked as the economic development officer for the Piikani Nation and as the managing director for the Piikani Nation’s only for-profit corporation, Piikani Resource Development.

“Having worked in a number of different fields, including economic development, post-secondary education and family and children’s services, I know just how important it is to make life more affordable for Albertans,” said Smith in a news release.

In the release, Smith also said that “as an Indigenous person, I feel it is important to build cross cultural networks and alliances that foster economic and social growth and benefit all constituents in this great new riding.”

Tailfeathers wrote on Twitter March 10 that the decision to withdrawn her name as a candidate was not an easy one.

“I believe it is important we keep this province moving forward with Rachel Notley’s leadership.

“At this time, however, my community is mourning the tragic loss of two young lives and my place is here with the families and my patients during this challenging time.”

Tailfeathers said her decision to withdraw has “nothing to do with any disagreement with the party or any elected members.”

“I wish them well and will continue to support the party in any way possible,” she said.

Tailfeathers is a physician who practices family medicine in Cardston and on the Blood Reserve.

And, ironically, the predicted slowdown is largely attributed to its new taxation measures.

Two financial institutions released economic analyses that zeroed in on B.C.’s economy, with both projecting it will slow down significantly due to the cooling of the province’s real estate market.

Central 1 Credit Union concluded the province’s economy will have three years of weak economic growth after several years of robust annual growth of more than three-per-cent GDP.

Its deputy chief economist, Bryan Yu, said in a news release that “economic growth is being held hostage by the housing market slump, which is deeper than previously forecast.”

As a result, Central 1 is now forecasting the provincial economy will grow by just 2.2 per cent in the coming year, then 2.4 per cent in 2020 and 2.8 per cent in 2021.

TD Economics had a more pessimistic assessment, projecting B.C.’s economic growth to be just 1.4 per cent this year and two per cent next year. Again, the chief villain is the slumping real estate sector.

“B.C.’s deepening housing market slowdown is likely to put a larger damper on growth this year,” it said in its provincial economic forecast. “The province’s housing market has been the most hard-hit by the implementation of tighter rules, rising interest rates and B.C. government policy measures.”

To be sure, neither of these projected scenarios constitute being anything close to a recession, but this may spell bad news for the government’s three-year fiscal plan. The lower the economic growth, the fewer tax dollars are available. That plan projects an increase of almost $4.5 billion in tax revenue over that period.

What’s disappointing about this situation is that measures such as the speculation tax, the increase in the foreign buyers tax and the higher tax on high-end homes were supposed to make housing more affordable.

Instead, while house prices and some rents have dropped, they haven’t dropped to the point of making homes actually affordable.

So it now looks like the government’s housing policies (which do not place much emphasis on increasing the supply of housing) are not only not meeting the affordability targets, but are instead having the biggest impact at slowing down the provincial economy

Now, none of this may come back to haunt the NDP. Both financial institutions are predicting employment levels will remain high with the government’s infrastructure program considered to be providing a cushion to any slowdown.

As well, the BC Liberals continue to struggle to find their identity as an Opposition party and party leader Andrew Wilkinson has had a bad run of foot-in-mouth-itis in recent days.

But after experiencing relatively sunny days during their first 20 months in office, things may be about to get a little darker for the NDP government.

NDP Critic for Sport and Persons with Disabilities Cheryl Hardcastle made the following statement:

“New Democrats welcome the federal government’s decision to establish an independent investigation unit for National Sport Organizations (NSO), and a national toll-free confidential helpline for victims and witnesses of abuse in sport.

The NDP has been calling for an independent investigative body for some time. Last year, we organized a National Symposium on Sexual Abuse in Sport, bringing together leading voices and experts across North America to consider the issue. We released a report to the Minister of Sport; which called for a well-resourced independent body with a mandate to investigate claims of abuse, the power to compel testimony and the production of documents, and which possessed the ability to impose real sanctions.

We will monitor this new unit closely as it is rolled out because many important questions remain unanswered. Will investigations take place only if the NSO asks for one, or will athletes be able to lodge a complaint independently, while having their privacy respected? Will an investigation be mandatory once a complaint has been made, as is the case with the United States Center for Safe Sport? Will the creation of the new unit mean that NSO’s will not have to pay for the investigation themselves?

Athletes deserve a safe environment in which they can train and compete free of harassment and abuse. We can do better and we will do better.

The NDP applauds the bravery of the many victims who have come forward at great risk to speak out about their personal stories of abuse. All athletes, past, present, and especially future, owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.”",NDP Statement on Creation of Independent Body to Investigate Harassment and Abuse Complaints in Sport,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-statement-creation-independent-body-investigate-harassment-and-abuse-complaints-sport

Together Now, as ...","VICTORIA — Ten years after New Democrat Shane Simpson first called for a B.C. poverty reduction strategy, the now cabinet minister released the first version of one on Monday.

Together Now, as it is called, runs to more than 40 pages and lists dozens of measures large and small, some announced earlier, others still to come.

Together, they are supposed to reduce the poverty rate in B.C. by 25 per cent and the child poverty rate by 50 per cent over the next five years.

Cost? About $4 billion all in, Simpson told reporters Monday, which would be less than two per cent of budgeted provincial spending over the five years.

The goal is to lift 140,000 adult British Columbians and a further 50,000 children above the poverty lines, as defined by Statistics Canada.

Assuming the New Democrats achieve those targets, the cost of getting there would work out to about $20,000 for each person helped.

The strategy and targets are grounded in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Act, passed unanimously by the legislature last November. The legislation was similar to Poverty Reduction Acts that the New Democrats introduced multiple times during their years in Opposition, starting after Simpson issued his first call for a strategy in 2009.

On Monday, the veteran MLA, now minister of social development and poverty reduction, defended the 20-month lag between the New Democrats taking office on July 18, 2017, and release of the first comprehensive strategy.

He said the New Democrats had not been idle in the interim, citing increased rates for social assistance, boosted minimum wages and phased-out medical service plan premiums.

One of the biggest challenges over the next five years will be improving housing affordability, central as it is to the cost of living for British Columbians on both sides of the poverty line.

Related

The government has already weighed in with a 30-point housing plan, offering relief for renters and almost $7 billion over 10 years in subsidized public housing.

But the plan falls well short of measures to encourage private construction of rental and middle income housing. Indeed, its focus on higher taxes and tighter regulation may discourage investment.

Other items in the Simpson strategy struck me as a bit of a stretch. While the New Democrats pleased commuters by eliminating the tolls on the Port Mann and Golden Ears bridges, it was not clear how that would have much affect on the poverty rate.

Indigenous people should be helped financially by the promise of $550 million in targeted social housing and by the decision to share $100 million a year in gambling revenues with First Nations.

Not as obvious is how the First Nations poverty rate would be directly reduced by the NDP endorsement of the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Some of the most ambitious aspects of the strategy are still to come.

The New Democrats have recruited UBC economist David Green and two other academics to examine the possibility of establishing a basic income policy for B.C. Research is already underway on how “basic income principles” might supplement or replace the existing system of social assistance. The panel will report back to the government next year.

Also in the works is a separate report from the fair wages commission on what would constitute a “living wage” in B.C.

Simpson predicted those two reports will provide the basis for a major public debate on the next phase of the poverty reduction plan, before the next provincial election.

When in government, the B.C. Liberals rejected any need for such a strategy, preferring the line that the best poverty reduction plan was a job.

But that line provoked a memorable backlash at one moment in the 2017 election campaign when one voter fired back: “I have a job. I still can’t afford a place to live.”

For all their previous disdain for poverty reduction strategies during their days in government, the Liberals last fall joined the New Democrats and Greens in voting for Simpson’s bill. It passed “nemine contradicente”, meaning without dissent.

The Opposition strategy is now to monitor progress of the NDP plan, knowing that the poverty rate can fluctuate from factors independent of the best intentions of government.

For instance, even without a poverty reduction strategy, the number of B.C. children living below the poverty line dropped by 20,000 (almost 20 per cent) between the time Simpson introduced his first Poverty Reduction Act and the time the New Democrats took office.

The current legislation obliges New Democrats to report publicly on progress made in reducing the poverty rate for adults and children. Simpson, as minister, is due to make the first report in the fall of 2020, more than three years into the NDP term of office and with the scheduled date for the next election but a year away.

Consequently, he took the long view Monday when asked what was new about the strategy: “None of this is going to be new in five years, when we are able to celebrate that we have hit our target.”

In short, as a work in progress, the NDP poverty reduction strategy is just getting underway. Success depends heavily on Simpson and his colleagues winning a second term in government.

Ford’s office called all of Hillier’s allegations “absurd and categorically false.”

Ontario Conservative MPP Randy Hillier speaks with journalists outside the Ontario Legislature in Toronto on Feb. 20, 2018. Hillier says he is being punished by the party for a variety of activities including refusing to obtain permission to speak to the media and for failing to stand and applaud the government during legislative sessions. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

In a statement issued Monday, Hillier alleges Ford Chief of Staff Dean French and Chris Froggatt, who heads the election readiness committee, “engaged in an underhanded and relentless campaign” for months to get rid of him. Hillier said he was expelled because he refused to “accept the obstruction and prevention of caucus criticism or input on public policy,” didn’t ask for permission to speak to reporters, and also for his “refusal not to stand and applaud,” which PC MPPs now do routinely during question period. And, Hillier writes, he was also ousted for “raising concerns of possible illegal and unregistered lobbying by close friends and advisers employed by Premier Ford.” He provided no specifics about the alleged improper lobbying.

Hillier, first elected in 2007, was suspended from the PC caucus last month — and expelled last week — by Ford after the eastern Ontario MPP was accused of saying “yada yada yada” to parents of children with autism who had packed the public gallery in the legislature over recent government changes. But Hillier, the MPP for Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston, has maintained his comment was directed at New Democrat MPP Monique Taylor. Hillier has been accused by some colleagues of not being a team player. However, last week Ford told reporters he would sit down with Hillier to discuss his return — though that meeting did not happen. Another eastern Ontario MPP, Steve Clark — the minister of municipal affairs and housing — said in the legislature that Hillier’s allegations were “unfounded,” but that “no matter in what capacity that member sits in this House, I’ll continue to work with him.” Finance Minister Vic Fedeli said “everyone in our caucus wanted to work with Mr. Hillier, but it’s very clear that Mr. Hillier did not want to work with our caucus.” Hillier has received a lot of support from constituents, with his local PC riding association demanding the government allow him to return. Simon Jefferies, a spokesperson for the premier, said “everything Randy Hillier outlined in his letter is an outright lie. These fabrications are absurd and categorically false. “This further shows Randy Hillier never wanted to be a true member of our PC team despite repeated attempts by Premier Ford to engage him as an important member of our caucus. In fact, Premier Ford made overtures to Randy Hillier since the election ... It’s disappointing and disheartening that Randy Hillier refuses to take responsibility for his own actions.” Jefferies also disputed Hillier’s claim that he was in trouble for not seeking permission to attend his brother’s funeral. “False,” said Jefferies. “Everyone deserves the proper bereavement and would be afforded the right to do-so.” Natyshak, noting two former PC MPPs now sit as independents — Amanda Simard and Jim Wilson — quipped that the “fastest growing party in chamber today” are those who’ve either left or been kicked out of the Progressive Conservative party. This is not the first time French has made the news. Last November, the Star revealed Ford’s chief of staff had been accused of instructing to order the OPP to raid outlaw cannabis shops before the drug was made legal, so that images of “people in handcuffs” would be be shown on TV news.

OTTAWA — Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection — made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart — ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

Jason Kenney says there was nothing improper or even unusual about staff on his successful 2017 campaign to lead Alberta’s United Conservative Party helping out a rival, and he denies there was any plot to have Jeff Callaway run as a stalking-horse candidate on his behalf.

Mr. Kenney and the UCP have been under attack since a trove of e-mails leaked over the weekend that showed staff from his leadership campaign provided speaking notes, message planning, graphics and videos to Mr. Callaway’s team while the pair were ostensibly competing to lead the newly created party. Mr. Callaway’s campaign co-manager is now co-operating with the election commissioner’s investigation and alleges Mr. Kenney’s campaign recruited Mr. Callaway to launch a leadership bid that was never intended to make it to the final ballot.

The revelations came ahead of a spring election campaign that could begin at any time. Mr. Kenney held a news conference Monday to respond to the NDP government’s pre-election Throne Speech and position his own campaign, but instead spent an hour fielding questions about the UCP leadership race. He said no one on his campaign did anything wrong.

“The two campaigns communicated on issues management, communications and research and things like that in a way that I think is normal,” Mr. Kenney told reporters in Edmonton.

“The idea of Mr. Callaway running was Mr. Callaway’s idea. Our intention was to get his support.”

Mr. Callaway has been accused of running a “kamikaze” campaign in which he would attack former Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean before pulling out of the race. Mr. Callaway eventually ended his campaign and endorsed Mr. Kenney, though he, too, has denied working to benefit Mr. Kenney.

In the leaked e-mails, Mr. Kenney’s current deputy chief of staff, Matt Wolf, was in regular contact with Cameron Davies, who was the co-manager of Mr. Callaway’s campaign. In one exchange, Mr. Davies laid out a proposed timeline for Mr. Callaway to drop out.

“I learned about Jeff’s decision to withdraw and endorse me the night before he made that announcement,” Mr. Kenney said.

In addition, the province’s election commissioner and the RCMP are both looking into the source of Mr. Callaway’s donations, though Mr. Kenney has maintained that the investigation doesn’t have anything to do with him. One donor, Karen Brown, has been fined $3,500 for donating money that wasn’t hers, while Mr. Davies has been fined $15,000 for obstructing an investigation.

Mr. Davies told Macleans that he received $60,000 from a corporation called Agropyron Enterprises Ltd. and that he assigned some of that money to some of Mr. Callaway’s donors. Agropyron is controlled by Robyn Lore, also a Callaway donor, who told Macleans it was a loan and he did not know what Mr. Davies did with the money.

The governing New Democrats have seized on the leadership controversy and are expected to raise it frequently during the election campaign. Premier Rachel Notley said Mr. Kenney has repeatedly lied to Albertans about what happened and what he knew about it.

“There is a very significant scandal right now. At its very best it amounts to very dark backroom politics focused on thwarting democracy, at its worst it is criminal in nature,” Ms. Notley told a news conference in Edmonton.

“I think the larger picture is, who can you trust?”

On Monday, the government promised new measures to strengthen health care and the province’s democratic institutions in a Throne Speech that served as a preview of Ms. Notley’s planned campaign for re-election.

One of the biggest promises in the speech is a major expansion of a pilot program brought in by Ms. Notley that created 7,300 child-care spaces that cost $25 per day. The Premier promised a “very detailed proposal” for an expanded program that would be open to all families across the province, but would not confirm whether any legislation would be passed.

The first bill the government tabled after the Throne Speech prohibits an expansion of privatized health care and queue-jumping by patients, while creating new restrictions on billing by physicians and dentists paid through the public system.

A proposal on democratic reform, which is currently not scheduled for introduction as a bill, would look to close what Ms. Notley called loopholes in the province’s political financing law.

The NDP says Singh becomes the first racialized party leader to sit in the House of Commons.

He won a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South in February, taking roughly 39 per cent of the vote.

The win means Singh can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the party reins from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

In a statement, Singh says he will use his new position to pressure the Liberal government to take action on affordable housing and bringing down prescription drug costs.

He says as a kid, he never would have imagined being in this position.

“It belongs on House of Cards, it belongs on Netflix, it doesn’t belong in Alberta politics,” she told reporters outside the Federal Building on Sunday.

“We have seen over the weekend that Mr. Kenney and his campaign will stop at nothing to take power away from Rachel Notley,” she said.

Leaked emails show regular communication between Matt Wolf — Kenney’s current deputy chief of staff, the man behind the official Twitter account for Kenney’s office and a senior member of his leadership campaign staff — and leadership candidate Jeff Callaway’s campaign manager, Cameron Davies.

Last month, Alberta’s election commissioner handed a $15,000 penalty to Davies for “obstruction of an investigation.”

‘Spit-balling copy’

Emails from Wolf’s personal and official Jason Kenney campaign email accounts document months of communication between him and Davies, including proofs of ads and memes, research, timelines of ad drops, strategy tips and talking points.

In an Aug. 27, 2017 email titled, “Some draft thoughts,” Wolf hands Davies “ideas of a rough narrative” with which to bludgeon Jean’s leadership campaign.

Wolf honed in on the financial woes inside the Wildrose caucus at the time. He suggested Callaway label it “the elephant in the room,” and follow-up with, “I know how many people in this room had concerns about how things were being run. And your concerns were rebuffed.”

Later that night, in an email titled, “CONFIDENTIAL,” Davies told Wolf, “We ought to dig into leaves of absence and severances here. I’ll wager many were given severances or wage increases from Jan onward are currently working for jean [sic].”

Wolf responded with information about new hires inside the Wildrose caucus but included a caution that Davies might have better information, “so please provide feedback.”

A week later, on Sept. 6, 2017, Wolf sent Davies an email titled “spit-balling copy,” with potential lines for Callaway that take aim at the former Wildrose leader, slamming Jean for comments about taxes and the death of hard-right governments.

Two days later, Davies wrote to Wolf, saying he was thinking about pushing out Callaway messaging and ads.

“Makes sense to me,” replied Wolf.

On Sunday, neither Kenney nor Wolf were speaking with media. When asked for comment, UCP spokeswoman Christine Myatt said Wolf had gone home.

‘I recognize that my emails might look unflattering today’

In an email sent to the UCP caucus Sunday morning obtained by Postmedia, Wolf admitted he had political communications with the Callaway campaign during the leadership.

“I’ve made no secret about that for those who have asked,” he wrote.

Wolf wrote that Kenney’s leadership team would have preferred Callaway not enter the race, but once he did, “it was also clear that his team was receptive to keeping some communication channels open between our respective campaigns.

“This is of course completely normal in politics, especially in a leadership race that could see multiple ballots in the end. It would be imprudent to push away someone whose second ballot support might be required at a later time,” Wolf wrote.

Still, Wolf insisted it was “not a ‘puppet’” type operation.

“Mr. Callaway made his own decisions for his own reasons. And while communicating with the Callaway campaign was hardly my preoccupation during the leadership, I did, at times, push things like research materials to Mr. Callaway’s team,” Wolf wrote.

“I recognize that my emails might look unflattering today, and I’m willing to accept that. You are all familiar with politics also know that this is sometimes the nature of the business we’re in.”

Wolf also doubled down that the Kenney leadership campaign “did not in any way funnel donations to the Callaway camp,” which would have been against the law.

“I understand some on the other side will try to characterize my actions with the menacing term ‘collusion,’” Wolf wrote.

“It was politics. It wasn’t personal. It wasn’t against the Party rules, and I’m confident it wasn’t against any laws.”

Multiple members of Kenney’s team included in emails

The two camps also shared a communications plan for Callaway’s campaign, detailing his policies and dates they were to be rolled out, graphics, videos, and a series of one-liners Callaway might use.

Wolf also sent Davies the proof of an ad about the Wildrose, titled “WafflingBrianJean,” and a swath of videos.

It wasn’t just Wolf who was part of the chain of communication.

The day Callaway announced he was dropping out of the UCP leadership race and throwing his weight behind Kenney, Blaise Boehmer — a senior member of Kenney’s team — sent Davies a draft press release with suggested quotes for Callaway.

Earlier that morning, Wolf also sent Callaway a suggested script.

Davies and Boehmer also discuss an investigation by the UCP dispute resolution committee regarding two emails sent from the Callaway campaign.

“That didn’t take long. Lol,” responded Davies.

Current UCP MLAs are also mentioned throughout the leaked emails. In October 2017, Davies and Wolf discuss Leela Aheer, who endorsed Jean in the leadership race, to which Davies replies, “Jason Nixon needs to leak the emails imo.”

Randy Kerr, who was recently removed by the UCP as their candidate for Calgary-Beddington after the party said he wasn’t forthcoming about financial contributions to the Callaway campaign, was also involved in the communications.

‘Lack of integrity’

Premier Rachel Notley weighed in on the issue Sunday and said Kenney showed a “profound lack of integrity.”

“This morning we learned these denials were calm, cool, confident lies,” she said in a speech at her nomination rally in Edmonton-Strathcona.

She told reporters that it appears Kenney’s campaign was “essentially running the other campaign.

“They can desperately spin whatever they want to desperately spin,” she said.

Kenney has repeatedly denied his leadership campaign team was involved in a kamikaze candidate plan. Most recently on Friday, he told reporters that he asked his staff in late fall whether they had heard or seen anything related to the Callaway campaign donation issues, and the answer was no.

UCP executive director Janice Harrington said communication between leadership campaigns is “perfectly normal” and within party rules.

“Mr. Kenney’s campaign has previously and repeatedly confirmed that there was communication between the Kenney leadership campaign and the Callaway leadership campaign,” she said in a Saturday statement.

Alberta’s Election Finances and Contributions Disclosure Act says non-monetary, in-kind contributions over $50, including “the production of advertising or promotional material,” must be recorded by party leadership campaigns.

“As a result of cuts and consistent underfunding, legal aid is now in crisis,” said a February association report to Attorney General David Eby.

As a result, the lawyers voted 97 per cent to begin withdrawing services April 1. Withdrawals will increase in scope through May.

The funding numbers are in the 2019-22 service plan of the Legal Services Society (LSS), which administers legal aid in B.C. That plan was released the same day Finance Minister Carole James delivered the 2019 budget as well as the province’s 2019-22 strategic plan.

For 2018-19, the society, which runs the system, received $85.8 million, up from 80.7 million the year before.

However, the funding will stop increasing. The Ministry of Attorney General said government transfers to the society would be 86.8 million for the years 2019-22.

“The service plan shows why we’re taking this action,” Fowler said.

However, neither the Ministry of Finance nor the Ministry of Attorney General will discuss the freeze.

He said if the plan showed the system was anticipating new revenue, the lawyers would be responding much differently.

Eby was not available for comment but a statement from his office said talks with the association are continuing.

In a memorandum to staff, the society said the purpose of the lawyers’ service withdrawal “is to pressure government into increasing LSS’s funding, so that we can increase the rates we pay them to do legal aid work. If they vote to stop taking contracts, it means many legal aid clients will not have the benefit of legal advice and representation.”

The memo said efforts would be made to help the most vulnerable clients. Priority areas of coverage will be cases where children have been or may be removed from a parent, family protection orders, clients who may lose contact with a child and clients in jail and require a bail application.

Fowler confirmed that, praising the society for doing incredible work with scant resources.

“It’s unconscionable that professionals are required every year to provide this quality of work for less and less money,” he said.

But, the lawyers have been unhappy for some time. They say legal aid should be a government priority alongside health care, education, welfare and child protection.

Indeed, that’s what lawyer Len Doust recommended in his 2011 Report of the Public Commission on Legal Aid in British Columbia.

The association said in the report to Eby, a former activist lawyer with Pivot Legal Society and the BC Civil Liberties Association, that “successive governments have starved the legal aid system of the financial resources it needs to fulfill its essential role in our society.”

An NDP freeze of legal aid funding is nothing new. That’s what happened in 1997 under Premier Glen Clark. Five years later, Gordon Campbell’s Liberals slashed the budget by 40 per cent.

While Doust’s report came out eight years ago, lawyer Jamie Maclaren’s review of the system released in January also calls for funding boosts.

“Legal aid is not broken in B.C. It has simply lost its way,” Maclaren said in his report. “Years of underfunding and shifting political priorities have taken their toll on the range and quality of legal aid services, and especially on the people who need them. Still, the will exists in B.C. to make legal aid more accessible and effective for all of its many users.”

The association said the LSS has been able to offer only one raise for legal aid lawyers since 1991. The average hourly rate is now $88, from which lawyers need to pay for their offices and legal support teams.

“This represents about 27-30 per cent of the private law hourly rate, well below the 75 per cent recommended by Ted Hughes in his 1984 B.C. Task Force on Public Legal Services,” the report said.

“By every objective measure the legal aid tariff is fundamentally grossly inadequate,” the association report said.

Legal aid lawyers have long maintained that the provincial government for years has failed to use the tax paid by all people who use legal services in B.C. to fund the legal aid system as was intended when it was introduced in 1992.

“The more than $200 million raised by this tax is enough to fund a legal aid system all of us in British Columbia would be proud of,” the association report said.

NDP Leader Ryan ...,"Question period turned personal on Monday during a debate about cabinet ministers attending yellow vest rallies.

It was likely the first time the arrest history of two party leaders was ever raised in a debate in the same question period.

NDP Leader Ryan Meili said there was a ""dark link"" between the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand which left 50 people dead and views shared by some in the yellow vest movement. Specifically, an opposition to the UN migration compact.

""The shooter used terminology, on his rifle he'd written 'here's your UN migration compact',"" Meili said.

The pact outlines objectives for treating global migrants humanely and efficiently.

Meili asked Premier Scott Moe for his position on the migration pact. The Minister of Energy Bronwyn Eyre turned the debate towards Meili's history as a protester himself.

""That day back in 2001, he [Meili] joined forces with the Sierra Club, the International Socialists Union. None other than Cuban dictator Fidel Castro sent a special note of support to the protesters,"" Eyre said.

""You can be sure that if Facebook existed back then there would be some pretty far out posts.""

Eyre said Meili presents everyone who has attended a pro-oil rally ""as a racist.""

Meili countered by raising the drinking and driving arrests of government MLAs, including the premier. Moe was convicted of drunk driving in 1992.

""I will happily stand up for having been arrested for standing up for my convictions rather than having been convicted for not being able to stand and trying to drive.""

Meili said he was protesting at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City over concerns of climate change and clean water. He spent one day in jail.

""We're getting far too personal. It's got no business in this chamber,"" said Speaker Mark Docherty.

Premier condemns Islamophobia, Meili denounces yellow vest movement

Before the personal attacks, Meili asked Moe if he still supported his caucus attending rallies ""with even the loosest association with any form of hate speech.""

Meili said the yellow vest movement in Canada has promoted an anti-immigration message at rallies and online.

CBC More

Moe said all members of his government ""condemn any violence against any community in this province or abroad no matter their faith or creed. We also condemn any form of Islamophobia.""

Earlier this year, the Minister of Rural and Remote Health Greg Ottenbreit attended a yellow vest rally in his constituency in Yorkton. Minister of Highways Lori Carr attended a similar rally in her constituency of Estevan.





Moe said both were hearing their constituent's concerns about the energy industry.

Moe and Meili took questions from reporters following the heated debate.

On the yellow vest movement Moe said, ""we should not paint all of these people with the same brush.""

He said at the rallies his cabinet ministers attended people were concerned about their jobs in the energy industry.

Moe also defended the government's record on immigration. He said 108,000 immigrants from 190 countries have moved to Saskatchewan over the last decade.

Moe said he had not visited Facebook to read comments or posts by people supporting the terrorist attack in New Zealand.

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham will be under scrutiny in the B.C. legislature over her latest overhaul of the Agricultural Land Reserve. (Hansard TV)

B.C. Agriculture Minister Lana Popham has launched the second phase of her remake of an NDP icon, the Agricultural Land Commission.

In a determined push to plow under changes made since the Dave Barrett government hastily imposed the Agricultural Land Reserve in the early 1970s, Popham has introduced a new batch of legislative amendments. It’s an effort to stop what she claims is pressure from speculators, buying farmland and trying to get it sprung from the ALR so they can grow houses on it.

The latest amendments dissolve the regional ALC panels set up to bring local knowledge to the table. The whole show will again be run from Burnaby, with token regional appointees on a central politburo, sorry, commission.

When Popham proudly unveiled the amendments a couple of weeks ago, there was an awkward moment. The bill includes a new definition of “person,” changing it to a provincial or local government or their agencies. People, specifically farmers, will not be persons once the NDP-Green coalition pushes this nanny-state vision through.

It’s awkward because Bill 15 was presented the day before International Women’s Day, celebrating the 90th anniversary of the “persons case” where five pioneering women won the right to vote in Canada. In B.C., women remain persons, unless they’re farmers.

Horrible optics aside, it’s a minor change. Property owners applying to exclude land from the ALR have long had to obtain the view of their local government, to see if an exclusion fits with community plans for roads and utilities. Soon only state entities will be able to apply to remove land, if and when they see fit to judge the property owner’s wishes.

After I reported this, Popham sent me a lengthy statement, including the following:

“Over the last few years, we’ve seen people buying land in the ALR, only to turn around and immediately apply to get it pulled out of the ALR so they can develop it. This volume of applications to review has become burdensome to both local governments and the ALC, since in many cases exclusion applications are not approved as they are for development purposes.”

In other words, local governments and the ALC continue to protect farmland, as required by the “old government” legislation. I asked the ALC for its latest data on this crushing volume of speculator applications, since it stopped posting archived decisions after Popham took charge.

READ MORE: Farmland review head named ALC chair

READ MORE: B.C. farmers aren’t ‘persons’ in NDP law

In 2018, there was a grand total of 39 applications to remove land province-wide. One of two in the Interior region was approved. On Vancouver Island, four applications flooded in and all were refused. Same in the Kootenay region.

In the Okanagan, the commission grappled with 11 applications, turning away six. On the South Coast, there were 14, with nine refused. The numbers are even lower for 2017. The ALC annual report shows a steep decline in applications since the 1980s.

Here is current ALC staffing: A Popham-appointed chair and 18 commissioners oversee staff consisting of a CEO, director of policy and planning and director of operations. Kim Grout, the current CEO, made $185,096 plus benefits last year.

Under them are three senior policy planners, a policy planner, policy analyst and six planning officers. On the operations side, there are two co-ordinators, four compliance and enforcement officers, an office manager and six technical and support staff.

Popham intends to hire more enforcement “boots on the ground” to cope with the speculator crisis she wants you to think is happening.

Robinson took issue with a tweet from Terry Beech that called for unity among Liberals after Jane Philpott resigned from cabinet in solidarity with Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general who resigned from her ministerial role in February.

article continues below

Philpott, Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “are the leaders Canada needs to fight climate change, move forward on indigenous reconciliation, and ensure every Canadian has a fair and real chance at success,” Beech tweeted on Monday. “It is my sincere hope differences can be resolved. #betterisalwayspossible”

Robinson said it’s impossible to support both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott at the same time as supporting Trudeau, and Beech needs to pick a side.

“Where does he stand? You can’t be both supporting Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould on the one hand, and supporting Justin Trudeau on the other,” he said. “That’s completely not reconcilable.”

So do you stand with @JanePhilpott and @Puglaas, who have shown great integrity and courage, or with @JustinTrudeau responsible for their decisions to leave Cabinet? They lost confidence in JT after his attempts to subvert justice for powerful Quebec corporate friends. And you? https://t.co/5FpnkjHNtx — Svend Robinson (@Svend4MP) March 4, 2019

Robinson said both former ministers have clearly lost confidence in Trudeau.

In her resignation letter, Philpott said she “lost confidence in how the government has dealt with” the criminal charges against engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and the alleged pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office on the former attorney general to secure a deferred prosecution agreement. Wilson-Raybould did not answer whether she had confidence in Trudeau when asked during her testimony to the Parliamentary justice committee.

“(Beech is) saying ‘let's all love one another’ and that's a complete abdication of responsibility,” Robinson said. “This is the moment of truth for Terry Beech and for every Liberal member of Parliament in that caucus. Are they going to stand up for integrity and the independence and the rule of law in Canada, or are they going to accept this kind of bullying and pressure that both Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould have obviously said is not acceptable?”

Beech did not respond to repeated interview requests. His tweet is the only public statement he has made on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- The Trudeau government will attempt to set the stage for this fall's election -- and provide some distraction from the SNC-Lavalin affair -- with today's end-of-mandate budget touting the Liberals' economic record.

The Liberal government's fourth and final budget before the election is expected to include measures to help first-time home buyers, seniors and adult Canadians who want to return to school for skills training.

It's also expected to take an initial step towards a national pharmacare program and disclose details of previously announced tax credits and incentives, worth $595 million over five years, to help Canada's ailing journalism industry.

But Finance Minister Bill Morneau will also try to set the narrative for the coming election, arguing that years of deficit spending have put the economy on a stronger footing.

Expect him to credit the Liberals' investments in infrastructure and other spending measures for the creation of almost 950,000 jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in almost 40 years, and point to the Liberals' enhanced child benefit for the lowest poverty rate in 10 years.

Moreover, Morneau is expected to boast a better fiscal picture than he anticipated in last fall's economic update, thanks to an increase in tax revenues despite surprisingly weak economic growth in the final three months of 2018.

The budget is being presented in the midst of a continuing furor over allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff and others improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to end a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. The affair has so far cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and the country's top public servant, although he continues to insist no one did anything wrong.

The Liberal-dominated House of Commons justice committee is to meet behind closed doors today to discuss opposition demands for Wilson-Raybould, who's already given nearly four hours of testimony, to be recalled. She has indicated she has more to say, particularly about the period between her mid-January move from Justice to Veterans Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

However, the Liberal MPs on the committee sent a letter to the chair late Monday indicating that they'll block any further investigation into the matter. They said they've heard enough after 13 hours of testimony from 10 different witnesses and they ""believe that all rules and laws were followed."" The Liberal MPs said the ""appropriate way forward"" is to let the federal ethics commissioner conclude his own investigation into the matter.

Today's budget may at least give the Liberals a short respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

But it will also draw attention to the Liberals' failure to deliver on a major 2015 campaign promise, to run up annual deficits of no more than $10 billion before balancing the budget by 2019.

Instead, the Trudeau government has posted deficits of more than $18 billion in each of the last two years and has offered no timeline for returning to balance. In his economic update last fall, Morneau projected annual deficits of between $18.1 billion and $19 billion over the next three years.","Budget to tout Liberal economic record, provide distraction from SNC furor",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/budget-to-tout-liberal-economic-record-provide-distraction-from-snc-furor-1.4341871

On Sunday, finance critic Pierre Poilievre said his party would ""use every parliamentary tool in the toolkit to end the coverup and let her speak"" about the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair.

The Conservatives were set up to potentially trigger a marathon voting session in the House of Commons on Monday that could have delayed the tabling of the budget — until the government stepped in.

Because these tactics are only allowed on set ""opposition days,"" — where the other parties get to set the agenda and set the topic for debate — the Liberals tweaked the schedule to make Wednesday the opposition day instead of Monday. They then informed the other parties.

""Our government will act responsibly to ensure the budget, which will help Canadians, is introduced on Tuesday as planned,"" Mark Kennedy of the Government House Leader's Office said in a statement to CBC News.

Conservatives had tabled opposed votes

Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen accused the Liberals of trying to cover up Trudeau's involvement in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""We know Mr. Trudeau is desperate to change the channel on the SNC-Lavalin Affair, but Canadians have legitimate questions and they won't be distracted by his budget,"" she said in a statement.

The Tories had put forward opposed votes on previously announced federal initiatives, each of which would have necessitated a vote in the House. They tabled 257 opposed votes for Monday, but now can only act on them on Wednesday.

Each of these votes is a fiscal matter, so every vote is a vote of confidence, which would keep Liberal MPs close to their seats. A loss of confidence could trigger an election.

Because of the sheer number of votes, the sitting of the Commons could have extended overnight Monday — similar to what the Conservatives did last March in retaliation after Liberals opposed having Trudeau's national security adviser talk to committee about his India trip.

If the sitting was extended, it could have potentially delayed the budget.

But the point Andrew Scheer's party is trying to make is more about SNC-Lavalin, than the budget.

""All eyes should be on those closed doors at the justice committee meeting,"" Poilievre said.

""If [the prime minister] thinks Canadians will quietly let him shut down the investigation, he's in for a terrible surprise next week.""

The committee is scheduled to meet in private Tuesday morning, ahead of the unveiling of the federal budget for 2019.

The former justice minister and attorney general addressed the committee last month, offering unprecedented testimony alleging the prime minister, members of his top staff and other government officials had pressured her to help secure a special legal agreement for SNC-Lavalin through the director of public prosecutions. The company is facing bribery and corruption charges that could lead to it being barred from bidding on federal contracts, affecting thousands of jobs.

Budget, interrupted

Budget 2019 comes in a high-stakes election year and could be as much about shoring up sliding Liberal support as it is about fiscal policy.

Wilson-Raybould said she was only able to address the events surrounding SNC-Lavalin that happened before she was shuffled out of the attorney general position. During his appearance, Gerald Butts, the former principal secretary to Trudeau, spoke of things that occurred after the move.

In a letter to her constituents this week, the Vancouver MP said she had more to say on the topic. Opposition MPs called an emergency meeting of the committee on Wednesday to debate whether to allow her to speak again, but the Liberal majority shut it down within 30 minutes.

Liberal MP Francis Drouin, who triggered the sudden adjournment of the meeting, insists there's been no attempt by the government to coverup the SNC-Lavalin affair, and says it's time to turn the page on the controversy.

""I think I've heard enough,"" he said in an interview with CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning.

The Liberal government’s Tuesday budget will target millennials and baby boomers, the two large generations that will shape the outcome of the 2019 federal election.

Language around helping the broad middle class will remain a rhetorical staple, but Finance Minister Bill Morneau is singling out the two politically important demographics for special attention in this year’s budget.

For the first time in decades, baby boomers will no longer be the largest cohort of potential voters when Canadians head to the polls in October. According to Abacus Data, a polling firm that specializes in researching the consumer and voting trends of millennials, the generation of young Canadians will make up about 36 per cent of eligible voters, up sharply from 29 per cent in the previous federal election.

Story continues below advertisement

The polling firm defines millennials as those born between 1980 and 2000, although there are other definitions.

The firm estimates the percentage of eligible millennial voters will be slightly ahead of the 34 per cent of eligible voters who fall into the baby-boomer category.

Whether millennials will come out ahead among those who actually turn out and cast a ballot could be a key factor in determining the shape of Canada’s next Parliament.

Abacus Data pollster David Coletto said young voters were a key source of support for the Liberals in 2015 but that the governing party will need to generate enthusiasm among those younger voters if it hopes to win over that growing demographic in 2019.

“The Liberals need young people to vote for them again,” he said.

An Abacus survey conducted last year for the Canadian Real Estate Association found millennials listed housing affordability as the top issue that should be prioritized by the federal government.

The challenge for Mr. Morneau is that experts disagree over which – if any – of the potential policy options to boost affordability should be considered.

Story continues below advertisement

In his prebudget comments, the Finance Minister has specifically singled out millennials and seniors as groups that will benefit from budget measures. Announcements on housing and skills are expected to benefit younger Canadians. Seniors advocates say they would like to see private pension protection measures, improved support for low-income seniors and policies to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, among other possible announcements.

Liberals are also clearly hoping that this week’s budget will provide a distraction from the weeks-long controversy over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin issue, which has led to the resignation of two of his senior ministers – Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott – and his principal adviser and close friend, Gerald Butts. Another major resignation came Monday when Michael Wernick, a key player in the controversy, announced he is stepping down as Clerk of the Privy Council because he felt he did not have the trust of the opposition parties.

Melissa Lantsman, a former director of communications to Conservative finance minister Joe Oliver and vice-president of public affairs at Hill+Knowlton Strategies, said the government is clearly hoping to shift the public’s focus toward measures that will directly benefit groups that traditionally vote for the Liberals.

“The Liberals have honed in on their voter coalition to make sure that the cheques are in the mail for those that they think are most likely to vote for them,” she said.

However, Ms. Lantsman said the fact that the Liberals have clearly broken a campaign pledge to erase the deficit by 2019 will have lasting negative consequences for the Liberals in areas such as Toronto’s 905 area code where many ridings swing between electing Liberals and Conservatives.

“People in the 905 have some real questions for the Trudeau government,” she said. “It’s about a government that promised you one thing and didn’t deliver.”

Conservative MPs have made the Liberal government’s broken promise on the deficit their key focus ahead of the budget. Meanwhile, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh used his first appearance in the House of Commons Monday to call on Ottawa to act on climate change and affordable housing.

“Three budgets, and Canadians are still waiting for housing,” said Mr. Singh, who called on the government to set a target of building 500,000 affordable homes.","Liberal budget to be aimed at younger voters, seniors",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberal-budget-to-be-aimed-at-younger-voters-seniors/

An election year budget is a high-stakes exercise in any context — but this one comes as the Liberals find themselves in their worst position in the polls since coming to power.

The Liberals are trailing Andrew Scheer's Conservatives and Trudeau's party has taken big hits in the demographic groups that helped deliver a majority Liberal government in 2015.

So if today's budget includes measures targeted at those very groups, don't call it a coincidence.

The CBC's Canada Poll Tracker puts the Liberals about three points behind the Conservatives, at 32.7 per cent to 35.3 per cent. That's far below where the Liberals were on previous budget days.

When their first budget was delivered in March 2016, the Liberals were in the midst of their post-election honeymoon — nearly 16 points ahead of the Conservatives. By March 2017 and the unveiling of Finance Minister Bill Morneau's second budget, the Liberals were still ahead by about 11 points.

Last year, polling conducted before the budget was tabled — and before Liberal support took a dive in the wake of Trudeau's botched trip to India — showed the Liberals in the lead by about 5.5 points.

This undoubtedly is a worrying trend line for Trudeau, who is scheduled to face the electorate in just seven months. But the profile of the voters who are drifting away from the Liberals should worry the prime minister even more.

Liberals losing support among millennials

Comparing the demographic breakdowns in three polls conducted in the last few weeks by Ipsos, Nanos Research and Abacus Data to surveys conducted by these polling firms in the months prior to the 2018 budget shows that the Liberals are shedding support in all age groups and with both genders.

But they have taken a particularly big hit among millennials — down about 10 points. The Liberals still hold a narrow lead in this age group, with an average of 31 per cent support to 28 per cent for the Conservatives and 27 per cent for the NDP — but before the 2018 budget the Liberals were ahead by 17 points among millennials.

This was a key voting bloc for the Liberals in the 2015 election. A post-election survey done by Abacus found that, among voters between the ages of 18 and 25, the Liberals took 45 per cent of the vote — 20 percentage points more than the second-place New Democrats.

Normally, younger Canadians don't vote in big numbers. But that wasn't the case in 2015, when new turnout records were set for this historically apathetic cohort.

The Liberals also have lost their lead among women, men and middle-aged Canadians, while they now trail the Conservatives by double-digits among seniors. Instead of the narrow one-point advantage they held just prior to the 2018 budget, the Conservatives are now ahead by an average margin of 43 per cent to 33 per cent for the Liberals across the Ipsos, Nanos and Abacus polls.

The Conservatives have not seen their support take off among women, however. The Tories are up only three points with women voters over the last year, compared to a gain of eight points among men. There isn't any significant difference between age groups in the changes in Conservative support.

But the NDP has seen disproportionate gains among millennials. The party is up by an average of five points among younger Canadians in these three polls, while the party as a whole has dropped by one point. This decrease has been driven primarily by a fall in support for the NDP among men and older Canadians.

Budget a chance to reverse the trend lines

The loss of younger voters to the NDP and middle-aged voters to the Conservatives is a combination that could prove electorally problematic for the Liberals — costing them urban seats around universities on the one hand, and suburban seats full of commuters on the other.

The budget provides an opportunity to address some of these vulnerabilities. CBC News has reported that the budget is expected to contain funding for lifelong learning and adult skills training programs and measures to assist first-time home buyers.

But the bleeding is coming from all quarters. It puts the Liberals in an unenviable position for a first-term government.

The last few first-termers were in a better position than Trudeau is today. At the time of Harper's last budget in his first term in 2008, the Conservatives were ahead in the polls by about a point in a minority legislature. They succeeded in increasing the size of their minority government in the subsequent election.

In 1997, when Paul Martin tabled the last budget of Jean Chrétien's first term, the Liberals were ahead of the Progressive Conservatives by a whopping 31 points.

Brian Mulroney's PCs, however, were trailing by about six points at the end of 1987 — just a few months before his government tabled its last budget before the 1988 election. That election turned on the free trade debate and Mulroney was able to secure another (reduced) majority government.

This fall's federal election is unlikely to be dominated by a national issue of such importance, so Trudeau will have to bank on something else to turn things around. Today's budget is a chance for the Liberals to try to do just that.

Such opportunities are going to be limited in number between now and October. So could the Liberals' remaining days in office if they aren't successful in changing the channel.","As Liberals slip in key demographics, they hope the budget can stop the bleeding",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-budget-polls-1.5061160

Global News reported last week that officials from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada had advised Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen to raise the Safe Third Country Agreement as a key issue at a meeting with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. The memo, prepared in January 2018 ahead of the later-cancelled meeting, also said the minister should discuss plans to create a steering committee tasked with addressing “immigration issues.”

“With the recent influx of asylum seekers to Canada, the Safe Third Country Agreement is no longer working as intended,” the memo prepared for Hussen states.

“Asylum seekers are evading the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement by crossing into Canada between ports of entry where the agreement does not apply. This has brought to our attention gaps that may be creating a pull factor for people to cross illegally into Canada.”

WATCH BELOW: Rempel on Trudeau’s response to immigration critique: ‘Stop this’

That memo from the department came months before both Hussen and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly defended it against questions on whether the agreement needed to be changed to better address the flow of tens of thousands of migrants crossing the border at unofficial points of entry.

Trudeau said in the House of Commons on May 1, 2018, that the agreement “allows for good management of asylum requests.”

Hussen, also on the same day, praised the agreement as a “great tool” and “amazing experience.”

Rempel says the positive tone struck by the government on the agreement — despite what departmental officials were saying — should concern Canadians.

“They are being dishonest in this conversation,” Rempel said in an interview with Global News.

“They know Canadian public sentiment on this issue, particularly new Canadian communities on this issue … is that people expect fair and orderly migration and this is not being seen. The way that they’re facilitating this is not fair and orderly.”

WATCH BELOW: Conservatives ask government when it will close loophole in Safe Third Country Agreement

For months, the government has said it is discussing ways to “modernize” the agreement with American counterparts but offered few details as to whether it is getting anywhere with the talks or clearer details on what specific changes it would like to see.

When asked repeatedly whether he believed the agreement was still working as intended, Border Security Minister Bill Blair’s office acknowledged last week that “we are in a different environment than we were when the agreement was signed in 2004,” but would not specifically address the question.

Responsibility for the Safe Third Country Agreement transferred to Blair when he was named to the newly-created position last fall.

WATCH BELOW: Canada seeks U.S. help turning away asylum seekers

The Safe Third Country Agreement is a deal between Canada and the U.S. in which both countries recognize each other as “safe” countries for asylum seekers to submit a claim. As part of that, asylum seekers must make their claim in the first safe country in which they arrive.

That means an asylum seeker who lands in the U.S. must make a claim in the U.S. and cannot head to a Canadian border checkpoint to submit an application for asylum there — but a loophole means the claimant can do exactly that by being intercepted while crossing the border at unofficial points of entry.

More than 36,000 asylum seekers have entered Canada irregularly from the U.S, since the start of 2017.

Less than a quarter have been dealt with, as of December 2018.

READ MORE: Ipsos poll shows Canadians have concerns about immigration. Here are the facts

A poll by Ipsos conducted exclusively for Global News in January 2019 found Canadians have stronger negative views of immigration than they did in 2017, with 54 per cent of respondents saying they believe Canada is too welcoming to immigrants.

However, the poll indicated the concerns of Canadians tend to be more focused on whether the processes immigrants go through before being allowed to come to Canada are actually working, and less focused on the immigrants themselves.

Rempel said conversations with constituents and Canadians on immigration also suggest their concerns centre on whether the government is able to find a solution to fixing a problem flagged by its own department.

“I want to be very clear,” she said. “I do not believe that we should be having a conversation in Canada about if we should allow immigration. One of my former colleagues is flirting with that right now. I’m not going there. That is not my belief. So now we have to have a conversation about how.”

Rempel has pushed the government to amend the deal to apply the provisions across the entire border, which would mean no matter at which point asylum seekers cross, their claim would not be considered if they came directly from the U.S., where they should have first made their claim.

Jenny Kwan, NDP immigration critic, also expressed concern about the memo but said the only solution is to suspend the agreement.

“Of course the STCA is not working ‘as intended,'” she said. “As I’ve been saying since January 2017, the United States under President Donald Trump is not a safe country for asylum seekers. … The only change that can be made to the STCA that respects the humanity of asylum seekers and allows Canada to live up to its domestic and international obligations is to suspend the agreement.”

Doing so would allow asylum seekers already in the U.S. to make applications to come to Canada at regular border checkpoints.

Kwan has argued that because of Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, the U.S. cannot be considered safe for asylum seekers to get fair consideration for their claims.

Canadian officials did review their classification of the U.S. as a safe third country in early 2017.

The conclusion of that review was that the U.S. “continues to meet the requirements for designation as a safe third country.”",‘Dishonest’: Liberals criticized after memo says Safe Third Country Agreement is not working,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5067181/justin-trudeau-safe-third-country-agreement-no-longer-working/

In a letter to constituents posted to her website Friday, Wilson-Raybould said the explosive political saga has been a “wake-up call” for Canadians about the “culture of conflict, empty partisanship and cynical games” that exists in Ottawa.

Nonetheless, she said, she plans to stand for re-election as a Liberal in the Vancouver-Granville riding next fall because she got into politics to change that culture — and believes she still has plenty of work to do.

“Beyond partisanship, spin and image, there lies a politics of change that is driven forward by galvanizing our core values — regardless of political stripe — into concrete laws, policies and actions that support Canada as an ever-advancing society,” Wilson-Raybould wrote.

She said she never expected to find herself thrust into the centre of a controversy that culminated last month in her resignation from cabinet.

“I was just doing my job and I did not expect it to become a national focus.”

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that Trudeau and several members of his senior staff were part of a prolonged and co-ordinated effort to convince her to overrule a decision by the director of public prosecutions to proceed with a criminal trial against SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery.

Trudeau said he believed Wilson-Raybould was open to receiving additional information that could affect her decision, and directed his staff to provide that information — including the potential impact on SNC’s 9,000 Canadian employees. He also wanted her to consider getting an outside legal opinion on the use of remediation agreements, a new tool in Canadian law that can avert a trial in exchange for fines and outside monitoring.

The justice committee and the ethics commissioner are both investigating the allegations, the RCMP have been asked to investigate and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has expressed its concern, saying it is monitoring the investigations.

Wilson-Raybould resigned her cabinet seat Feb. 12, about a month after she was shuffled from Justice to Veterans Affairs, a move she believes was precipitated by her refusal to change her mind about the SNC-Lavalin case, an allegation Trudeau has denied.

She remains a Liberal MP, as does Jane Philpott, who resigned her own cabinet post March 4 saying she had lost confidence in the way the Prime Minister’s Office had handled the SNC affair. Trudeau has said he is still considering their future in the caucus. Both have already been nominated in their respective ridings by the Liberals.

A spokesman for Trudeau said Friday the prime minister has not spoken with either Wilson-Raybould or Philpott in recent days and has no comment on Wilson-Raybould’s letter.

Wilson-Raybould said in her letter she believes the full SNC-Lavalin story hasn’t yet been told.

“These matters are still unfolding, and further clarity and information is needed,” she said.

The Conservatives Monday will seek to give Wilson-Raybould more of a chance to provide more detail with a motion in the House of Commons calling on Trudeau to extend the time period on the confidentiality waiver he issued his former attorney general, so it includes events that occurred after she was shuffled out of the justice portfolio.

She has said the waiver doesn’t free her to explain why she resigned from cabinet or what she told the cabinet in an unusual meeting she attended a week after she resigned.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn

OTTAWA – When the Liberals release the last budget of their mandate Tuesday, Canadians can expect to hear arguments that years of deficit spending have put the economy on stronger footing.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau has promised the budget will contain help for workers in need of skills training, young people looking to buy their first homes, seniors worried about their own finances, and patients with high drug costs.

“It’s an election budget … There’s been a tendency to use these as important communications vehicles – almost platform-launching vehicles,” Kevin Page, Canada’s former parliamentary budget officer, said in reference to recent budgets from federal and multiple provincial governments.

The likelihood that the Liberals will use the budget to sell their own record raises a question: who deserves credit for Canada’s strong economic run?

Job-creation numbers have been solid and the unemployment rate has fallen close to a 40-year low. A recent Statistics Canada report said in 2017 fewer Canadians were living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade. The agency credited the drop to a mix of a stronger economy and the Liberals’ enhancement of child benefits.

Canada rode a long stretch of impressive economic growth until the final three months of 2018 before it abruptly decelerated – and nearly stalled – along with a drop in oil prices. Experts predict the economy will regain its momentum over the coming months.

But even with a surprisingly weak end to 2018, Ottawa’s financial situation is better than last November’s fall fiscal update projected.

Experts say the federal treasury pulled in more tax revenues than anticipated. Many fully expect the Liberals to dedicate the bulk of the extra money to new promises, as they’ve done with windfalls in past budgets and economic statements.

Over the last few years, the Liberals have spent billions more than they promised in their 2015 election platform.

They vowed to post annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to return to balance by 2019. Instead, they’ve posted shortfalls of more than $18 billion in each of the last two years and have offered no timeline to balance the budget. In their November update, the Liberals projected annual deficits of between $18.1 billion and $19 billion over the next three years.

Morneau has regularly argued that the Liberal plan is working.

“Our government has made smart and responsible investments in the middle class, and Canadians are seeing concrete results,” Morneau told the House of Commons last month as he announced the budget date.

Morneau has argued the bigger-ticket commitments, in areas such as child benefits and infrastructure, have been necessary to juice the economy for years to come. He’s also insisted the deficits remain small enough that they’re fiscally prudent.

Page expects the Liberals to take credit for the economic improvements and he thinks they deserve some recognition – particularly for enhancing child benefits and an ambitious, expensive infrastructure plan, despite its slow start.

But he added Canada’s prospects have also been lifted by strong economic performances in the United States and the world as a whole.

Page said it’s difficult to know whether the Liberal deficits will actually raise Canada’s long-term growth or if they’ve mostly created a big, temporary bump in consumer spending, as the government has borrowed money and put it into Canadians pockets.

“You don’t have to be at balance. There’s nothing perfect about a zero (deficit) number in this environment,” said Page, who now heads the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy think-tank at the University of Ottawa. “Having said that, we are adding to the stock of debt and that creates potential instability down the road and we’ll have less room to manoeuvre – and future generations, definitely, are going to pay higher interest costs on the public debt.”

The Opposition Conservatives, some economists and leaders in corporate Canada have criticized the Liberal deficits, especially because they’ve come during good economic times that are traditionally thought to be when governments should pay debt off.

“My concern is, and I’ve said this to him … privately and publicly, it’s not that you’re spending, it’s where you’re spending,” Goldy Hyder, CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said of his exchanges with Morneau. “You’re spending a lot on things that no one can really point to and can say (there’s a) direct line back to helping the economy.”

Hyder said he supported Morneau’s move last fall to use some fiscal space for new accelerated investment write-offs for businesses. He also applauds the Liberals’ commitment to invest in worker training in Tuesday’s budget and their earlier efforts on trade, immigration and child benefits.

But he insists there’s an urgent need for Canada to be more competitive on regulations and taxes if it hopes to avoid falling behind the rest of the world.

And the Liberals are avoiding it because they know what the answer to that question would be, and they don’t like what it would say about Justin Trudeau’s conduct.

By a company that had previously donated bags full of money to the Conservatives. Are you kidding? We’d never hear the end of their outrage.

And yet most of the Liberal caucus remains quiet as a mouse over Trudeau and the conduct of his office, even following the spectacular resignations of Gerry Butts, Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, and the very public mutinies of backbench MPs Wayne Long and Celina Caesar-Chavannes. Think the Liberals would have cared if Jason Kenney and Lisa Raitt had resigned from Cabinet on principle over a scandal?

Welcome to politics, where necessity kills principles stone dead.

Only those weren’t the politics — or the principles — espoused by Trudeau when his hands weren’t on the mighty wheel of the Canadian economy. Trudeau the challenger was about restoring faith in politics and our institutions; Trudeau the incumbent is now about ends justifying means, at least when it comes to the employment prospects of 9,000 highly in-demand and eminently employable engineers and their support staff.

It’s a stunning downgrade in ambition. And if Liberal partisans want to preserve some of what made their brand such a tonic to the Harper years, they’re going to have to stop what they’re doing and have the courage to answer the Harper question honestly.

And the question they must answer is the central one in former Citizen editor Andrew Potter’s test for partisans: do we define ourselves by what we believe in or by what we despise?

Looking back at the six-plus weeks of SNC stumbles the answer to that question — at least from Trudeau’s perspective — seems pretty clear.

“Why shouldn’t I be able to go home?” he said in an interview with CTV. “I’ve done nothing in Canada. I’ve broken no laws there at all.”

Wrong. Under Section 83.181 of the Criminal Code, anyone who leaves or tries to leave to commit an offence that is indictable in Canada is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years.

And yet, the Liberals have failed to apply the law fully to jihadists who have returned. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told the House in 2017 that “the number of returnees is in the order of 60” and said fighters considered a threat are monitored. Further, they will be tried if there is evidence they acted outside the law.

But, they all should have been imprisoned for a decade for simply leaving to join ISIL. The Tories had it right in 2015 when they wanted to strip them of their citizenship and forbid them from returning. With thousands now in custody in the Middle East, this is exactly what some countries are doing, instead of allowing these time bombs to wander into their societies.

Here in Canada, the Liberals have done virtually nothing, which endangers everyone. In Dec. 2018, terrorism researcher Professor Amarnath Amarasingam, with the George Washington University Center for Cyber and Homeland Security extremism program, said only four of the 19 Canadians he identified as having returned from Syria and Iraq had been charged. Two were found guilty and two were waiting to go on trial. Five more were given terrorism peace bonds, now expired.

Peace bonds for violent, brainwashed killers? No consequences for most of the 60? No exact numbers?

Clearly, Ottawa has been derelict in its duty to protect the public. A Dec. 2018 report, drafted by the federal Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, says it is “’conceivable’ all 60 returnees could commit ‘low-sophistication’ terrorism attacks, including knife and vehicle attacks,” CBC reported.

In February, the Tories pushed a motion to force the federal government to come up with a legal strategy for dealing with jihadists. Exasperated Tory immigration critic Michelle Rempel said to Liberal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale that “it’s their job to keep Canadians safe … When will this government get serious?”

In December, a private member’s bill in Ontario proposed denying these terrorists drivers licenses, health care coverage, or housing assistance.

Critics and supporters of the bill say such measures will never fly under constitutional grounds because residents and citizens are entitled to privileges. But terrorists, who flout the rule of law, should be denied the rule of law. Since 2015, Australia has stripped citizenship from dual citizens who join terrorist groups, and the only “evidence” required to do so is that they entered certain “declared-area” forbidden regions. Germany plans to pass similar laws and Sweden is debating whether to do the same.

Britain recently cancelled the U.K. citizenship of a pregnant ISIL wife who holds another citizenship. The United States also cancelled the citizenship of an ISIL spouse born in the U.S.

Most foreign fighters who joined ISIL perished as their caliphate was destroyed. They forfeited their citizenship and should be rejected altogether.

Across the country, an entire swath of young Canadians are being consigned to a life of renting — their home ownership aspirations tempered in the wake of a series of policy failures by the federal Liberals.

The Liberal government rode to power in 2015 on a promise to champion the middle class and those working hard to join it. Yet Canadians have seen a series of stealth policy moves from this government that have made one of the single biggest determinants of middle-class status — home ownership — unaffordable for an entire generation of Canadians.

Foremost is the introduction of the mandatory 2% mortgage stress test in January 2018, which means that Canadians buying a home need to prove that they can afford mortgage payments based on the higher of the five-year benchmark rate or their contract mortgage rate, plus two percentage points. The policy was supposedly introduced to protect Canada’s major banks and prevent households from taking on excessive debts. At least that’s what the federal bank regulator has said. Liberal Finance Minister, Bill Morneau, as well as several Liberal backbench MPs, have instead suggested that stress test was not about economic safeguards but instead has the desired effect of reducing real estate prices in major urban centres like Toronto and Vancouver.

Despite the best of intentions, it is clear that these new mortgage rules have stymied a national housing market in recovery, robbed young families of the ability to step into their first home and spun the wheel of fortune in favour of wealthy cash buyers and leveraged investment funds.

Mortgage Professionals Canada has estimated that 100,000 Canadians have been prevented from buying a home due to the stress test and that 18% of prospective buyers, who could currently afford their preferred home, would fail the stress test.

Recent data from the Bank of Canada data shows that mortgage growth has hit a 17-year-low in Canada with more and more middle-class buyers being priced out of the market.

The winners of the Liberals’ stress test are the big banks. A family whose mortgage comes due for refinancing can only renew with their current lender if they fail the stress test. Data from Mortgage Professionals Canada would suggest that as many as 18% of Canadians homeowners could now be trapped with the current lender who, aware of their clients’ vulnerability, will surely go to no great lengths to offer them the best rate.

Ottawa has also dealt a blow to Canadian homeowners by unnecessarily increasing mortgage insurance premiums through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) – a federal Crown corporation that insures lenders against losses from mortgage loans.

The Liberals increased CMHC mortgage insurance premiums in 2017, despite the fact that the government-run corporation had been posting sizeable profits in recent years. Shortly after the Liberals hiked insurance premiums on homeowners, they were instructed to pay a special dividend of $5.6 billion to the federal government for the first time ever. Prior to last year the CMHC never paid the federal government any dividends or profits; the premiums they charged were always used to capitalize the insurer in the event of a major loss scenario, such as a recession.

The Liberals’ use of heavy-handed one-size-fits-all regulatory tools has swung the pendulum to the opposite side, curtailing growth and actually fostering instability in what was a recovering housing market — particularly markets outside of the major urban centres.

A series of missteps and failures on the part of the Ottawa Liberals have restricted the real estate market to make it significantly harder for first-time buyers and those wishing to move homes. Without the Liberals’ tinkering, Canada would likely be seeing a healthy cohort of young first-time buyers entering into homes, facilitating their transition into the middle-class while also contributing to their personal savings over the long term.

Instead, more and more young Canadians are consigned largely to renting, and increasingly, at prices higher than the cost of servicing a mortgage.

With a federal election looming and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government facing its worst political crisis in four years, Canada’s ruling Liberals are expected to table a goody-filled budget in a bid to get back on course with voters.

At 4:05 p.m. (2005 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3341 to the greenback, or 74.96 U.S. cents. The currency, which advanced 0.6 percent last week, traded in a range of 1.3304 to 1.3365.

“Maybe we have seen a lot of the good news in Canada already as far as the currency is concerned,” said Hosen Marjaee, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. “If the deficit widens much more than expectations there might be a hit to the currency.”

Canada finances its fiscal deficit, which is about 1 percent of gross domestic product, by selling bonds to domestic and foreign investors.

Foreign investors bought a net C$28.40 billion in Canadian securities in January, led by federal government bonds, following a revised C$20.49 billion total divestment in December, Statistics Canada said on Monday.

The U.S. dollar declined against a basket of major currencies ahead of the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday. Traders expect there will be no Fed rate hikes this year, and are even building in bets for a rate cut in 2020.

The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, was supported by the prospect of prolonged OPEC-led oil supply curbs and signs of inventory declines in U.S. crude stockpiles.

U.S. crude oil futures settled nearly 1 percent higher at $59.09 a barrel.

For a government that wants to do anything and everything possible to secure Canadian jobs, amending legislation to allow for single-game sports betting seems like the biggest no-brainer of them all. It costs the federal government nothing; it protects consumers by channelling current unregulated gaming into a regulated environment; it channels revenue, currently leaving the country, to the provincial governments and toward government programs; and most importantly, it protects and creates jobs.

Michigan and New York are moving forward. We know exactly what happens when the U.S. casinos have an advantage. In 2006, the Smoke Free Ontario Act created an unlevel playing field. Revenue at Caesars Windsor dropped 27 per cent the next year. This is not theory or hypothetical, this is fact. The impact was immediate. With craps, it was a Liberal government, with the Hon. Herb Gray as the champion to allow craps into Canadian casinos, that moved swiftly to amend the Criminal Code to provide Caesars Windsor with a level competitive playing field with Michigan, thus avoiding a major impact. When the playing field is level, we compete.

When the playing field is level, we compete

The risk today is real. The timing is urgent. The impact of inaction is absolute, predictable and completely avoidable. People will cross the border to Michigan and New York. Windsor and Niagara will once again be impacted. All of this is avoidable and the solution is simple. The Liberal government should put an amendment to the Criminal Code into the March 19 budget. This has been done before for other Criminal Code changes and this is 100 per cent in line with the government’s message of jobs.

Sports betting in Windsor will add 150 jobs to the casino. There are over 300 gaming venues in Canada. Moving forward to regulate this industry could add 1,000 to 2,000 or more jobs across the country. This is not just a Windsor issue, this is a Canadian issue. According to Legal Sports Report, there are now over 120 sports betting bills that have been filed in more than 30 U.S. states. The border states from Washington in the west to Maine in the east have introduced legislation to regulate sports betting.

The provinces are behind this (Ontario just announced its support), the major sports leagues are behind this, Canadians are behind this. The CFL, NBA, NHL and MLS are all publicly in support of this change. According to the polling firm Ipsos, 71 per cent of Canadians are in favour of sports betting. There is no opposition here. There is also no time to make politics out of this. It is simply good public policy. There is no time to wait.

We call on the Liberal government to use the March 19 budget as an opportunity to allow for single sports betting to be regulated by the provinces, like all other forms of gaming. There are no barriers to do this and you have the country behind you. This is about jobs. This is about consumer protection; this is about ensuring that we do not simply hand our players and jobs to the U.S. The ball is in your court, Liberal government. This is an uncontested layup. Score the basket for Canadians and let’s all be the winners.

With a federal election looming and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government facing its worst political crisis in four years, Canada’s ruling Liberals are expected to table a goody-filled budget in a bid to get back on course with voters.

At 4:05 p.m. (2005 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3341 to the greenback, or 74.96 U.S. cents. The currency, which advanced 0.6 percent last week, traded in a range of 1.3304 to 1.3365.

“Maybe we have seen a lot of the good news in Canada already as far as the currency is concerned,” said Hosen Marjaee, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. “If the deficit widens much more than expectations there might be a hit to the currency.”

Canada finances its fiscal deficit, which is about 1 percent of gross domestic product, by selling bonds to domestic and foreign investors.

Foreign investors bought a net C$28.40 billion in Canadian securities in January, led by federal government bonds, following a revised C$20.49 billion total divestment in December, Statistics Canada said on Monday.

The U.S. dollar declined against a basket of major currencies ahead of the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday. Traders expect there will be no Fed rate hikes this year, and are even building in bets for a rate cut in 2020.

The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, was supported by the prospect of prolonged OPEC-led oil supply curbs and signs of inventory declines in U.S. crude stockpiles.

U.S. crude oil futures settled nearly 1 percent higher at $59.09 a barrel.

Expunging records means permanently destroying or removing them. Canadian ...","OTTAWA — The Liberal government should follow the lead of American jurisdictions that have moved to erase criminal records for simple cannabis possession, says NDP justice critic Murray Rankin.

In late February, officials in San Francisco announced they would expunge more than 9,000 cannabis convictions dating back to 1975 — a move that followed the passage of a bill last summer requiring California prosecutors to erase or reduce the severity of tens of thousands of convictions.

In Canada, the government has introduced a law making it much easier to apply for a pardon for a past conviction for cannabis possession, which would leave a record of that conviction accessible in certain circumstances. Another term for it is a ""record suspension.""

""In California, they're moving to expungement, not pardons,"" Rankin said in an interview. ""The Democratic candidates for president are all talking about expungement. I wish (Canada's Liberals) would look south of the border to see that the debate they're having now has already happened and people understand that expungement is the way to go.""

Expunging records means permanently destroying or removing them.

Canadian legislation — known as the Expungement of Historically Unjust Convictions Act, which came into force in early 2018 — allows for the destruction or permanent removal of judicial records of unjust convictions from federal databases.

Rankin, who is not seeking re-election this fall in his Victoria riding, said he will push to expunge the records of Canadians carrying simple cannabis possession convictions during his remaining time in Parliament because he sees a clear injustice that must be addressed.

The issue disproportionately affects black and Indigenous people, he said, adding the Trudeau government's current approach to suspend records rather than expunge them is far from enough to help an estimated 500,000 Canadians with past pot convictions.

The country has proven it is ready for cannabis legalization, he said, adding most Canadians would agree ""the sky hasn't fallen"" since pot was greenlit for personal use by adults.

""Let's finish the job for people who are marginalized and still bear a burden for something which is now completely legal,"" he said.

Rankin, who put forward his own private member's bill last year proposing the expungement of cannabis records, is urging the Liberal government to work with him to improve its own bill.

He said he's talked to Liberals and Conservatives who have taken ""great interest"" in expungement. Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith has seconded Rankin's bill.

""If we can agree that expungement is the route to go, I would do everything I could with the opposition to assist them in getting a better bill for Canadians through Parliament,"" Rankin said.

A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Friday in a statement the government welcomes ""constructive ideas"" from any MP to improve the pardon bill and will consider proposals during the normal parliamentary process.

""Our government has accepted amendments from every party to other legislation tabled by Minister Goodale,""said Scott Bardsley, Goodale's manager of media and communications.

Goodale said when the bill was tabled that expungement is a ""very new concept in the law"" designed to deal exclusively with situations in which a previous law was a violation of human rights and would today be contrary to the charter.

""I would hope that they would work with me, allow me to work with them, in order to improve the bill,"" Rankin said. ""If it's too late, I'm very sad and I'm very disturbed, actually, because they could have done this months ago and they should have ... Why he can't see that he should go all the way like the Americans are doing?""

Trudeau’s Liberals surged to power in 2015 on a pledge to jolt the economy by boosting spending, but their popularity has dropped sharply in recent weeks amid claims that Canada’s former Justice Minister was pressured to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial.

Adding to the pain, economic growth slowed sharply at the end of 2018 and, despite blockbuster job gains, Canadians are feeling increasingly pessimistic about the future as record household debt runs up against higher interest rates.

To counter the negative sentiment, Finance Minister Bill Morneau is expected to make use of unexpectedly strong revenues from the first nine months of the fiscal year to table a stimulus-filled federal budget on Tuesday, the last budget ahead of an October election.

High on the list of expectations is supports for millennial home buyers, money for skills re-training, pharmacare help for those lacking prescription drug plans through their workplace, and new spending for families with children.

If Morneau wants to look fiscally prudent, the key will be to divvy up only the unexpected revenue, and not disrupt plans to reduce the net-debt-to-GDP ratio - a measure of how burdensome debt is relative to the economy, said Derek Holt, head of Capital Markets Economics at Scotiabank.

“If they want their cake and eat it too, you spend only the unanticipated revenue surprise, and you keep your powder dry on the rest,” he said.

HOUSING FOR MILLENNIALS

New mortgage rules that came into effect last year, and five interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada since July 2017, have left would-be buyers on the sidelines.

While the central bank says the changes have improved the quality of new mortgage debt in Canada, they have also contributed to a slowdown, with home sales slumping nationwide to a six-year low in February.

“Our recommendations include restoring 30-year mortgages for first-time home buyers and making some adjustments to the current stress test now that the market has changed,” said Kevin Lee, chief executive of the Canadian Home Builders’ Association.

Others options include bigger tax breaks for first-time buyers and more space to borrow from retirement savings.

But economists warn that too many perks could inadvertently reheat housing markets, putting ownership further out of reach for millennials and other first time buyers, especially in expensive cities like Vancouver and Toronto.

PHARMACARE AND MORE

The budget is also expected to propose a limited expansion to Canada’s healthcare system to cover part of the cost of prescription drugs, Reuters reported in January, citing sources.

Budget documents may go into some detail, or just make a general commitment to boost coverage, leaving specifics for the election campaign.

And while one of the bright spots in Canada’s sluggish economy has been booming employment numbers, companies say they are struggling to fill jobs requiring specialized skills, notably in the technology and healthcare fields.

“We would welcome a focus on skills, since it could address a current business challenge,” said Craig Wright, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, in a research note.

Speaking at a shoe repair shop on Thursday, Morneau hinted such measures would be coming.

“In our budget this year, that’s what we’re going to be thinking about. How do we help Canadians to take time off ... and how do they pay for their training?” he said.

The Liberals have faced criticism for backing away from a pledge to balance the budget by 2019, but with a vote looming the focus will likely be on setting up the campaign platform with items to come. A deficit of C$18.1 billion ($13.6 billion) is forecast for 2018/19.

“When it comes to how the deficit gets allocated, as we saw in the last election, (voters) still like to see a check in their own mailbox,” said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, in a research note.",Stimulus budget in cards as Canada's Liberals look to eclipse crisis,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN1QY0L9-OCADN

CHARLOTTETOWN – The governing P.E.I. Liberals are expected to send Island voters to the polls as early as this spring, but despite a booming economy the party is likely facing a rough ride.

The smallest province’s economy is on fire – the Conference Board of Canada says it will lead the country in economic growth over the next year.

But the Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs Premier Wade MacLauchlan – a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier – is personally unpopular.

A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released this month suggests the Green party has a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals are in third place, the poll suggests.

CRA president Margaret Brigley said satisfaction with the government has been declining.

“Right now there’s 51-per-cent satisfied. Based on our history, we see when satisfaction falls below 51 per cent it’s not necessarily likely that party will be voted back in. They’re right at the threshold right now,” she said.

The Charlottetown Guardian newspaper said in an editorial this week the Liberal party may have no choice but to switch leaders if it hopes to win the election.

Peter McKenna, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said in an interview there’s a strong desire for change among Island voters.

“What we’re seeing is even though the economy is very strong here on Prince Edward Island, it’s not translating into support for the governing party. More specifically, it’s not translating into support for Wade MacLauchlan as leader of the party and premier,” he said.

McKenna said MacLauchlan’s leadership style is seen as “too top-down, too dictatorial, that the public is not being properly consulted or listened to.”

“I quite frankly don’t think that the Liberals are going to be able to hold onto power in the next election if he’s the leader of the party,” McKenna said.

The current standings in the Island legislature are 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member.

McKenna said that even with a lead in the polls, Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker will have to assemble enough credible candidates in the Island’s 27 ridings if he hopes to have a chance to form Canada’s first Green government.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

“Islanders are desperate for something different. They’re tired of politics as usual. They think the change agent is the Green party and Peter Bevan-Baker,” he said.

The Tories saw a slight bump in the polls after choosing their new leader last month.

Brigley says voters may be looking to give someone else a turn after three terms of Liberal government, starting with then-premier Robert Ghiz 12 years ago.

The government doesn’t have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7, under the province’s fixed-date election provisions, but there have been indications the Liberals want to go early in an effort not to overlap with the federal election this fall.

MacLauchlan and Island cabinet ministers have made a series of funding announcements this month, joined by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several federal ministers.

And this week the provincial government released its third-quarter forecast for 2018-2019, showing a projected surplus of $13.8 million – up from a budgeted surplus of $1.5 million.

The P.E.I. election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform – asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model.

The amendment is well overdue and is a political and economic winner for both governments and should be implemented immediately.

Fedeli is championing a change that protects consumers, creates jobs, increases gaming tax revenues, attracts American tourists to Canadian casinos and would hurt organized crime.

“It’s time to legalize single event sports wagering in Canada and we’re committed to working with the federal government to make it happen,” wrote Fedeli on Twitter.

Currently in Canada you cannot legally bet on a single sporting event like the World Cup or the Super Bowl.

Fedeli is leading the charge of several provinces who want the change.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford also sent out a tweet supporting the legalization of single events sports wagering. “Gaming can make a significant contribution to our economy. Our government wants to allow the people of Ontario to legally bet on single events like tonight’s @MapleLeafs game. @NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman thinks so too.”

Ford wrote “The @NHL, @NBA, @CFL and @MLS all agree – let’s regulate single game sports betting in a responsible manner to give consumers a legal alternative to illegal or offshore sports books and U.S.-based casinos.”

Legalizing single-event sports wagering is a simple change the Trudeau Liberals could make happen this spring before the next election.

This would stop criminals from taking advantage of the public, who are now given no other choices or options when it comes to single-event sports betting. It would also create much needed tax revenue for the provinces.

Readers should know my business partners and I currently have no clients with a financial interest in the single event sports betting industry. It is possible we could in the future if single sports betting becomes a reality.

Support for the change is broad based and also strong in Liberal-friendly union circles.

Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor and Dave Cassidy, president of Unifor Local 444 in Windsor, wrote in the Toronto Sun and National Post this week.

“For a government that wants to do anything and everything possible to secure Canadian jobs, amending legislation to allow for Single Sport Betting seems like the biggest no brainer of them all,” wrote Dias and Cassidy.

They went on to write, “It costs the federal government no money; it protects consumers by channeling current unregulated gaming into a regulated environment; it channels revenue, currently leaving the country, into the provincial governments and towards government programs; most importantly, it protects jobs and creates jobs. Michigan and New York are moving forward.”

Previously, professional sports leagues were opposed to single event sports wagering. Now many of the leagues support the legalization including the National Hockey League.

“The NHL believes that a level playing surface for sports betting is in the best interest of the NHL’s sports betting landscape. With two franchises in Ontario and two right on the border with the U.S., Ontario is a very important market for the NHL. Accordingly, the NHL does not object to the province of Ontario’s initiative to offer single event wagering when it is permitted,” wrote Gary Bettman, NHL Commissioner.

Ford and Fedeli should be applauded for requesting a change that is long overdue and a sure bet to protect consumers and create jobs.

I ask only because I read right here in the National Post the other day that our worsening economic forecast might give Finance Minister Bill Morneau a chance to do exactly that. Reporter Jesse Snyder wrote, “Canada posted bleak economic numbers on March 1, with GDP growing just 0.4 per cent, the lowest in over two years. … That has led analysts to begin lowering their economic forecasts … (and) … would cushion any desire on the part of the federal government to bulk up its budget in an election year, which often leads to higher spending geared toward potential voters.”

It is indeed an election year

That last bit is key — it is indeed an election year, of course, and as you may have read, the Liberals have been struggling of late. There’s been this nagging little scandal they can’t quite seem to shake off, and they’ve taken a hit in the polls. A bit of an excuse to really open up the fiscal taps and throw some goodies around might be exactly what the Liberals are hoping for. A weak economy is a great opportunity to spend, apparently.

But then I realized, hey, wait a minute — according to these guys, isn’t a good economy also an opportunity to spend?

Turns out it is!

Just over a year ago, when the economy seemed much more robust, Morneau couldn’t have been happier about the chance to invest in Canadians. Check out this little slice of his 2018 budget speech: “The Canadian economy is doing well — remarkably well. Over the last two years, hard-working Canadians have created nearly 600,000 new jobs, most of them full time. Unemployment rates are near the lowest levels we’ve seen in over 40 years. … Today, Canada leads all the other Group of Seven (G7) countries in economic growth … That’s why we are able to invest in the things that matter to Canadians, while making steady improvements to our bottom line.” This “investment” included billions in borrowed money.

A year before that, it was much the same. Morneau said then, “In the last seven months, the Canadian economy has created a quarter million new jobs — the largest seven months of job gains Canada has seen in a decade. Unemployment has fallen in the time since we took office. … That’s why we will continue to invest in our people, our communities, and our economy while maximizing every dollar and ensuring it is well spent.” These “investments” also included billions in borrowed money.

These 'investments' also included billions in borrowed money

Now, in fairness, of course, all those speeches had the usual notes of caution and concern, too. But the overall message is clear: We’re doing well! We can afford to spend on the things we want!

Let’s rewind the clock a bit further, all the way back to the sunny ways days of 2015. Justin Trudeau was then the leader of the third-place party, and he was campaigning on deficits. Temporary deficits, you see, and just itty-bitty ones — $10 billion a year for three years, to stimulate the economy. The Conservatives and the NDP were promising balanced books, but the Liberals thought that more spending was needed. The economy had “faltered,” their platform said. Deficits were needed to “turn our economy around and get it growing again.” These deficits, the reader hardly needs to be reminded, proved neither modest nor temporary — the Finance Department projected three months ago that the budget wouldn’t be balanced until 2040, during which time Canada’s federal debt would grow by approximately $300 billion. Bit of a rounding error, that. Federal spending has grown from just under $300 billion annually in the last year of the Conservative government to almost $340 billion (projected) for the past year.

Hmmm. So … when times are good, we should invest, even if we have to borrow, because we can afford it. And when times are bad, we should invest, even if we have to borrow, because we can’t afford not to.

This isn’t a new lament, I know. We’ve been here before. That’s why I know exactly how the Liberals will respond to the question I opened with. They’ll talk about infrastructure gaps and shortfalls (never mind the fact that their deficit-financed infrastructure plan became immediately bogged down in bureaucracy and failed to deliver anything close to the forecasted economic gains, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer). The term “debt-to-GDP ratio” will be thrown around a lot. Stephen Harper’s name will be invoked — maybe even Mike Harris’s! Comparisons will be made to our economic peers, and Canada will be flattered by them.

Perhaps there is some Goldilocks-esque formula for this

And that’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with using debt to finance capital infrastructure development, especially when the project will provide economic and productivity benefits for generations. Debt-to-GDP is absolutely a useful metric for measuring an economy’s health. Our fiscal position is certainly better, relatively speaking, to many of our economic peers. I’m happy to grant all those points.

But none of them actually answers the question — when would the federal Liberals think it was a bad time to be throwing a lot of extra cash around? It’s not when times are bad, clearly, and it doesn’t seem to be when times are good, either. Perhaps there is some Goldilocks-esque formula for this that they could share with the voters? Because at a certain point, the constant focus on growing the government and increasing spending, even if we need to borrow, starts to seem less like a plan to cope with bad times, or an opportunity offered by good times. It starts to just seem like a political preference. Or maybe even a habit.

Our fiscal capacity to borrow is something to be protected

It’s a dangerous habit. The world has a bad way of springing nasty surprises on us. Our fiscal capacity to borrow is something to be protected during good times so that it’s there in the bad. It’s how we cushion the shock of economic crises, disasters and wars. We’re doing ourselves no favours if we spend as happily in good times, because we can, as we do in bad times, because we must.

The leader of the BC Liberals was in Squamish on Mar. 14 to discuss some of the most pressing issues affecting the town. He was scheduled to speak at a Rotary Club of Squamish event later that day.

However, before the event, Wilkinson, along with Sturdy, dropped by The Chief's office for a wide-ranging conversation.

The following includes highlights from the interview, which has been edited and condensed for brevity and clarity.

Q: What're you doing in Squamish? This is not really campaign season. Just hanging out?

AW: That's right—just hanging out. Why not? [laughter]

I'm a guy who is president of the B.C. Mountaineering Club. I've been up and down the corridor a thousand times. And then once you get into elected office, you count on Jordan as the local presence to understand the community issues. And you realize you got to slow down, stop in the community, check things out to understand the community issues rather than just drive by.

Q: How does Squamish specifically fit into the BC Liberals' plan?

AW: Squamish is diagnostic of so many things in British Columbia. It's a thriving community that's trying to make sure it retains a sense of community rather than become a commuter town. And this, I think, is the biggest question in Squamish right now—the identity Squamish wants to have 20 years from now. Because it's changing rapidly and we want to make sure it changes in a good direction.

Q: Right, and how do you make sure it changes in a good direction?

AW: Jordan has made it clear that having well-paying jobs here in Squamish is really important because otherwise you're at risk of becoming a commuter town.

Q: Are there any initiatives or things you can name, possible policies that would help realize that for Squamish?

AW: Well, province-wide we got to make sure that the private sector can do well and build the companies and businesses and jobs in communities like Squamish. A lot of that depends on tax policy. A lot of that depends on the attitude of the provincial government towards those businesses. You've got phenomenal activity here like Carbon Engineering, and we want to see the kind of technology spinoffs and interesting stuff happening right here in Squamish. A lot of that depends on government policy.

—On rent—

Q: I know you've gone on the record walking back your comments in the legislature about renting being ""fun"" and ""wacky"" a little bit earlier. But what would you say to people in Squamish concerned over whether the BC Liberals have the sensitivity to navigate the rental challenges here?

AW: Rental supply is critically important, and especially in a place like Squamish. We see all the construction that's happening here. We've got to make sure there's a sufficient mix of accommodation so there are affordable rentals mixed in with the nice new condos. And that's the challenge for any government policies, is to make sure that there's a full range of accommodation available, so people who are in the rental market either as a phase of life or for their entire life have a choice of rental properties. Because if they don't, they get trapped in a place they may not be happy with and they can get caught in a rent squeeze. Because if there's limited supply, the rents are going up.

JS: And I have to say that Squamish has done a great job over the last number of years in making approvals. Look at what's going on around us. Look at all the multi-family that's being developed as we speak. And I think that does speak well to this community and this local government and it's recognition of some of the challenges and it's willingness to move things forward.

—The legislature spending allegations—

Q: Head clerk Craig James and sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz were well known in the legislature. What was your impression? Did you see anything coming?

AW: The Lenz-James matter is now going to be reviewed by former Supreme Court of Canada chief justice Beverley McLachlin. And that's appropriate, because there's been a whole bunch of hearsay and conjecture tossed around about what might have happened and what should happen. And it'll be very refreshing to have a lucid, comprehensive review of this by someone who is beyond reproach.

JS: And who's really outside that environment.

Q: What was your working relationship with them?

JS: We saw each other in the halls. I think we were all familiar with each other. It's not a big building with a lot of people. It's relatively intimate. You get to know people.

Q: Would you guys see each other a lot?

AW: It was like your relationship with the principal at your high school. You were aware of them, knew their name and didn't deal with them unless you had to.

Q: Did they ever visit you guys at your constituencies? I know they were involved in a lot of tours. Did they ever drop by Pemberton or Quilchena?

AW: No.

JS: No.

Q: A lot of people, including people in Squamish, noted this alleged misspending happened when the BC Liberals were in power. Some might be saying that since you guys were in power, maybe you should've stepped up sooner.

AW: The spending patterns will be clarified by Madam Justice McLachlin as to what the facts are, because that's very unclear. And the key thing is that the BC Liberals are the ones who forced the management committee meetings to be held in the open. And it's now, I think, 10 years that both parties have been actively involved in management committees. The NDP and the Liberals were involved all the way through this story.

JS: I think it's important to recognize as well that it was under our previous finance minister the initiative pushed through that ultimately we were all going to have to, as elected officials, post all of our expenses. And that took place about four years ago or so. I think in retrospect, I'm certainly grateful that happened because it's entirely possible that we could all be implicated in this thing. Whereas, as elected officials on both sides of the house, everything I spend in my constituency office, everything I spend for travel —it is all posted online. You can have a look at everything that happens.

—Gas prices—

JS: We should have fuel prices about 14 cents a litre cheaper here in the Sea to Sky than in Metro Vancouver because we don't have a TransLink levy in the Sea to Sky yet. We've actually been monitoring—we take snapshots twice a week of all the fuel stations up and down the corridor and West Vancouver, because we're trying to track it to see what it actually looks like. Whether it's consistent in terms of differential. And it's not. But—is it 14.5 cents? Absolutely not. Like, never. In fact, more commonly it's within a cent or two.

Q: We've been talking about this with a lot of people and they keep kicking it over to the Competition Bureau. Is there anything the provincial government can do to alleviate this?

AW: Competition law under the Canadian constitution is a federal function. So there's a very limited role for the province to get involved in things like fuel pricing and alleged price fixing.

JS: I'm not sure anybody has actually put forward a submission to the Competition Bureau with comprehensive data. Which is exactly why we're doing it. Because we want to see if there's a differential and how it manifests itself. Without a good dataset it's hard to make an argument.",In conversation with BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson,Pique Newsmagazine,https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/in-conversation-with-bc-liberal-leader-andrew-wilkinson/Content?oid=13416986

The Canola Council of Canada calls the golden crop the most valuable one grown in Canada. In Alberta, it has been a staple for at least 30 years and accounts for around 70,000 jobs in the province. Ninety per cent of Canadian canola is exported, and China buys about 40 per cent of that, accounting for around $3.5 billion every year, according to the Council.

But on March 7, China’s customs agency announced it would be inspecting Canadian canola more vigorously after finding fungal pathogens in some shipments. China then revoked the export permit for Manitoba company Richardson International, one of the largest Canadian exporters of canola. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has investigated multiple complaints from China about Canadian canola exports, including nine since January, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau confirmed in a statement March 6. Six days later, CBC reported Bibeau said the Canadian government is still waiting for China to prove its pathogen claims. At a gathering at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, Bibeau said Canadian scientists have found zero evidence of the pests China reported.

Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada, said that while exports are stalled from time to time over inspections and potential pathogens, to his knowledge, this is the first time a company’s permit has been revoked. That’s why some are calling this a political issue, not a scientific one, linking it to the Dec. 1 arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, followed by the United States’ extradition request March 1. Alberta canola farmer Tom Coppock said he sees the issue as “100 per cent political and not at all scientific.” Though only one company has had its permit revoked, he said the uncertainty has reduced the price of Canadian canola across the country. “Of course we’re being affected,” he said. “If they can revoke it from one, who’s to say they won’t revoke it from four or more?” In a meeting of the House of Commons trade committee March 17, Conservative MP Randy Hoback put forward a motion to have Bibeau, International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr, and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland appear before the committee to address the situation.

Hoback was firm in his stance that the problem is not with Canadian canola, which he called the safest in the world. “This is a political issue,” he said. “We think it’s very important to have a game plan.”

Article Continued Below

Liberal MP Sukh Dhaliwal put forward an amendment to remove Freeland from the list, to which the opposition strongly objected — Hoback argued Freeland should be included because of the potential political nature of the issue. Dhaliwal said the responsibility of the file rests with the minister of international trade and reiterated the time-sensitive nature of the case. All five Liberal committee members voted in favour of the amendment, while the four opposition members voted against. The resulting motion, to have the two ministers appear the week of April 1, was unanimously passed. In a press release Monday, Hoback blamed the export block on the Liberals’ political relationship with China and again called for Freeland’s involvement. “Without an ambassador to deal with the situation on the ground in China, we need the minister of foreign affairs to tell Canadians what the government is doing to restore the market access that is vital for the livelihoods of canola farmers and their families,” he said. Ward Toma, general manager of the Alberta Canola Producers’ Commission, said farmers are currently in “wait-and-see mode.” Though only one company has had its permit revoked, he said the decision affects Alberta companies with ties to Richardson International, including a processing plant. “What will affect them, will affect everything. And if it spreads to other companies, it could have a greater impact,” he said. Around 25 per cent of Coppock’s annual crop is canola, but if this issue isn’t resolved in a few weeks, he said he’ll consider planting less this year. Most of his 2018 crop is already sold, he added, making him one of the lucky ones — many farmers have bins of yet-unsold canola that is now sinking in value. “We have more uncertainty now than ever before,” he said. Everson said he is concerned about the economic implications of the issue, but also about the effect it could have on Canadian canola’s reputation. “The faster we can get to the bottom of this and work with (China) to resolve it, the better,” he said.

Grounded: Three days after an airline crash in Ethiopia raised questions about the safety of one of the world’s most popular aircraft, and days after many countries first grounded their fleets of Boeing 737 Max 8s and 9s—including all of Europe—it was finally Canada’s turn.

Attention has fallen on Transport Minister Marc Garneau‘s delayed decision to order those models of planes to stay on the ground. At Garneau’s press conference, which came just hours before the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority also grounded the planes, the former pilot and astronaut delivered a clinical explanation of the “new data” behind the government’s decision. But, as Shannon Proudfoot writes, while Garneau’s tone was resolutely keep-calm-for-we-are-carrying-on, the facts he laid out were unavoidably the stuff of deep human phobia. (Maclean’s)

‘The Justin committee’: An emergency televised meeting of the justice committee looking into the SNC-Lavalin controversy ended in howls of “cover-up” and “shame” after the Liberal majority on the committee shut it down less than 30 minutes in. Opposition members want to bring former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould back to testify for a second time. The Liberals voted instead to shut down the meeting and wait until a scheduled non-televised meeting to debate Wilson-Raybould’s return on March 19—budget day. During and after the vote opposition MPs unleashed on the Liberals: “Justin Trudeau is transforming the justice committee into the Justin committee,” said Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre. (CBC News)

“All alarms” were sounded at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development when Wilson-Raybould testified that she’d felt sustained pressure to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution. Drago Kos, chair of the OECD’s working group on bribery—which said earlier this week it is watching to see how the SNC-Lavalin case unfolds—reiterated that “national economic interest” (Read: 9,000 jobs) should not be considered when prosecutors decide whether to pursue anti-bribery charges: “Only the merits of the case should be taken into consideration and nothing else.” (CBC News)

As questions whether the Justin Trudeau government tried to shield Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from bribery charges over the company’s past dealings in Libya dominated headlines last week, the mining industry’s biggest players gathered at the annual Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) conference in Toronto.

Issues of ethics and law were all over the agenda as more than 30,000 consultants, investors and government officials from around the world descended on the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. Just like SNC-Lavalin, which has a hand in most of Canada’s biggest public infrastructure projects and a multitude of other activities abroad, Canadian mining – nearly 60 per cent of which raises funds through the Toronto Stock Exchange – is trying to clean up its act.

Corporate social responsibility has been a focus at successive PDAC conventions. PDAC has worked with NGOs and boutique consultancies to produce and promote best practices abroad. Yet these remain voluntary even while human rights and environmental disasters continue to plague some of the industry’s biggest stars and PDAC sponsors.

Investors were reminded of that fact when environmental activists managed to get by security and unfurl a banner overlooking the trade floor pointing out mining abuses in Brazil. Within minutes, the activists were escorted outside.

In January, a tailings dam broke at Vale’s Córrego do Feijão mine in Brazil, releasing massive amounts of toxic sludge and killing several hundred people. It was the Brazilian company’s second dam disaster in three years, yet there was only mild acknowledgement at a session Vale co-sponsored before it was on to other business.

Additionally, Canadian-based PDAC sponsors Hudbay Minerals and Pan American Silver are currently the subjects of massive lawsuits alleging human rights abuses at their operations abroad. Toronto-based Barrick Gold, another PDAC sponsor, remains a perennial target of human rights allegations following highly-publicized incidents at mining operations in Tanzania and Papua New Guinea.

Conducting operations in developing countries can be complicated when corruption and regime change can be part of the reality of doing business. Mining companies also face tremendous financial and logistical hurdles with exploration.

But it’s also true that Canada has overlooked opportunities to establish a legally binding code to govern the behaviour of Canadian companies overseas. Liberal MP John McKay introduced Bill C-300 in 2010, which would have allowed Export Development Canada and Canadian trade commissions and embassies to withdraw support from companies convicted in court of violations.

But following fierce lobbying, including at PDAC, the bill was voted down, despite the Liberals and NDP holding the balance of power in the House at the time over a Stephen Harper minority government that was all too willing to cut their corporate friends slack.

The Harper government also opposed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which provides for prior and informed consent on activities on their lands. The declaration was adopted under Trudeau in 2016. Still, what constitutes free, prior and informed consent varies widely, with consent in Canada instead achieved by mining companies and Indigenous leaders signing so-called impact-benefit agreements.

PDAC has teamed up with Indigenous organizations to offer guidance and training. However, there’s an underlying assumption that First Nations communities, engaged early and with gestures of respect and inclusion, will logically embrace extraction on lands they claim as their traditional territories. Indigenous community leaders who refuse mining on their traditional lands – and are sometimes jailed for their opposition – see things differently.

The effects of mining on biodiversity and climate change are other issues given short shrift by the mining industry. They finally made it onto the agenda at PDAC, with talk about new species databases, mapping tools designed to assess and mitigate risks and greenhouse gas emissions calculators to help with project planning and new government reporting requirements. A Goldcorp rep heralded an alternative to diesel power — its battery-based, all-electric supply at its Borden gold mine west of Timmins. Others pumped gymnasium-sized nuclear reactors generating “emissions-free” electricity at remote sites by 2026.

PDAC may not be the wild west of years past, but as the SNC-Lavalin affair continues to suggest, the relationship between government and entities it should be regulating remains uncomfortably collegial.

Here are some things to watch for:

1) A boost to skills training

The government says it wants to help workers adapt to the rapidly changing needs of the modern workforce. The budget is expected to announce measures to help Canadians cover their bills if they choose to head back to school to upgrade their skills or to change careers. Morneau has also said he wants to make sure workers have dedicated time off so they can get that skills training. As part of the package, the Liberals plan to create a lifelong savings account for adults after drawing inspiration from a similar program launched a few years ago in Singapore, said a government source, who was not authorized to speak publicly because the plan is not yet released. The program is expected to share traits with Canada's registered education savings plan (RESP), but be aimed at mid-career adults rather than youth. In late 2017, Morneau's council of economic advisers recommended such a program, which the group called the ""Canada Lifelong Learning Fund.""

The Canadian Press Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau puts on his budget shoes in a pre-budget photo opportunity in Toronto on March 14, 2019

2) Helping more millennials buy homes

The budget will include plans to help more first-time buyers enter the housing market, changes that will arrive at a time of out-of-reach real estate prices in some parts of the country. Morneau has said he's particularly focused on helping millennials, a generation of people who are now in their mid-20s to late 30s. His budget will make home-buying more affordable with a series of changes affecting housing supply, demand and regulation, a government source said.

3) (Early) steps toward national pharmacare

The Liberals also plan to move toward their two main goals on pharmacare: keeping costs down and ensuring better coverage for everyone. Earlier this month, an advisory panel assembled by Ottawa released an interim report that recommended the federal government create a new agency to oversee the rollout of a national drug plan, the first part of a much broader pharmacare program. The panel, led by former Ontario health minister Eric Hoskins, said the federal government should also develop a national list of drugs to ensure consistent coverage across the country. It called for funding to gather better data on prescription medications. Some have high hopes Tuesday's budget will include an extensive pharmacare component, but a government source said any firm commitments won't go much beyond the interim report's recommendations.

Watch: Morneau speaks about upcoming budget

4) On or off the fiscal track?

In November, Morneau predicted annual deficits of $18.1 billion in 2018-19, $19.6 billion in 2019-20 and $18.1 billion in 2020-21. After 2020-21, the annual shortfalls were expected to shrink each year, reaching $11.4 billion in 2023-24. Ottawa's fiscal track promises to be a key issue in the October election campaign — with Liberals calling for investments to lift long-term growth and the Opposition Conservatives demanding balanced books to ensure future generations aren't stuck with the tab.

5) Lifeline for the news industry

The Trudeau government is due to deliver an update to its plan to support the ailing journalism industry. Last fall, it announced new tax credits and incentives worth $595 million over the next five years. Ottawa said it would create an independent panel of experts from the journalism community to seek advice on the measures and, in particular, define which outlets will be eligible for a refundable tax credit on labour costs. But it has yet to assemble the panel, which has raised concerns in the news industry that the support is taking too long to materialize.

Jody Wilson-Raybould is telling her Vancouver constituents she intends to run for re-election this fall as a Liberal.

The former justice minister and attorney general quit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet last month and has testified that he and his staff inappropriately pressured her to help engineering firm SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial on corruption charges.

In an open letter posted to her website on Friday, she says important questions haven’t been answered about the affair and Canadian politics still has a “culture of conflict, empty partisanship and cynical games.”

The letter also says she has support from people across the country who want to change that, which is why she is staying in politics and in the Liberal party.

Trudeau has said he needs more time to think about whether he will move to expel Wilson-Raybould from caucus, or bar her from running for the party.

Wilson-Raybould was first elected in Vancouver-Granville in 2015 and has already been nominated to carry the Liberal banner in October’s election.

Gabe Garfinkel, the director of the Liberal Party of Canada in B.C., said he has been focused on listening to what grassroots Liberals have to say about Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, and encouraging their feedback and ideas.

“This open dialogue has been important and will ultimately help us work toward our common goal of maintaining the Liberal government’s progress on housing affordability, creating jobs and protecting the environment,” Garfinkel wrote in a text message to Postmedia News.

“It’s also been important to Liberals across British Columbia for Jody Wilson-Raybould to speak openly at the justice committee, and supporters here were pleased she had the opportunity to do so.”

“The Vancouver Granville Liberal Riding Association stands in full support of our MP Jody Wilson-Raybould, and her important work for our community, region and Canada,” said association chair Claire Marshall.

Tamara Taggart, a former CTV news anchor, said she is still seeking the federal Liberal nomination for the Vancouver Kingsway riding, held by the NDP’s Don Davies since 2008.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony has not made her reconsider carrying the party’s banner, she said.

“I think that Jody Wilson-Raybould is an amazing woman and I look up to her,” Taggart said.

“I have deep respect for her and I have deep respect for the prime minister, and that’s all I can really say, because I just watched it like every other Canadian did.”

But David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said the Liberals will now have a tough time selling their “Sunny Ways” slogan, should they plan to use it again for the Oct. 21 election.

‘Fairly or unfairly, it (the party’s alleged conduct) certainly undermines claims to be a great champion and defender of feminism,” he said.

“That might not be an entirely fair point because you might say, look at Jane Philpott, look at Catherine McKenna, look at Kristy Duncan … there are plenty of strong women in the cabinet who have an influence. But that doesn’t mean people won’t make that argument.”

Moscrop said the Liberals have also undermined their position as a party which champions reconciliation and supports Indigenous people.

“That’s the price you pay when you try to forefront an Indigenous woman as being core to your brand and then throw her under the bus,” he said.

Moscrop said it is too early to get a good sense of what past Liberal voters will do at the polls this fall. There’s still the potential for more information to come and for resignations, and it’s unclear how long the scandal will drag on.

“But, put it this way, it certainly has the makings of something that could do significant damage to the Liberals’ re-election prospects,” he said.

– Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Joyce Murray as President of the Treasury Board. This appointment filled the position left vacant by Jane Philpott. Philpott resigned on March 4, citing a “loss of confidence” in the government following the SNC-Lavalin controversy. Murray will also become the Minister of Digital Government. This is the third time Trudeau has shuffled his cabinet in 2019.

Wire service The Canadian Press published an article featuring anonymously sourced attacks on Jody Wilson-Raybould, a Canadian member of Parliament.

The Canadian Press apologized for the article’s inclusion of those anonymous attacks. In a statement, the Canadian Press said the article didn’t meet standards for anonymous sources. “The Canadian Press has detailed policies on the handling of anonymous sources,” the article said in part. “They were not followed in this case. We will redouble our efforts to ensure that our journalists use unnamed sources carefully, sparingly, and only when circumstances demand it.”

The Canadian Press’s James McCarten, the acting Ottaway bureau chief and stylebook editor for the Canadian Press, explained to iMediaEthics that while the Canadian Press has an anonymous source policy, it wasn’t “properly followed nor efficiently enforced.” He said the article was intended to profile Wilson-Raybould, a former justice minister and former attorney general, given the controversy surrounding her allegations she was “improperly pressured” by the government in handling a corruption case.

McCarten told iMediaEthics that Wilson-Raybould didn’t complain but another reader did.

The story didn’t just break guidelines for allowing anonymous sources to speculate or offer opinion, but also because it didn’t say why the sources were granted anonymity, McCarten added, noting “a senior manager was not consulted” before publication.

Moving forward, the Canadian Press reminded staff of its anonymous source policy. “Because anonymous sourcing tends to occur most often in political circles, we here in Ottawa have taken pains to re-emphasize with staff the importance of following the standards and clear and detailed guidance as it is laid out in the Stylebook,” he noted.

Toronto Star public editor Kathy English flagged the apology in her recent column about the Canadian Press report on Jody Wilson-Rayblould. She noted that the Star published the Canadian Press report, but edited it to remove some of the anonymous criticisms. According to English, Star staffer Patrick Ho raised questions about the article, telling her it was a “cheap potshot.”

The Star added an editor’s note to the article to reflect it removed the anonymous problems. That editor’s note reads:

Public Editor’s Note — February 10, 2019: This article, distributed by The Canadian Press on Feb. 9, was edited by the Star to align with the Star’s journalistic standards on granting anonymity to confidential sources.



English explained the Star‘s guidelines state:

“We do not provide anonymity to those who attack individuals or organizations or engage in speculation — the unattributed cheap shot. “People under attack in our publications have the right to know their accusers.”

The chain, founded in 1990 and based in London, sells collectibles, toys, candles, jewelry and other unique items, primarily in malls in mid-sized urban centres.

As the case for many mall-dependent retailers, the chain has been hit hard by the growth of online shopping, where customers can order similar types of eclectic products, and have them delivered to their door.

""After considering a number of restructuring options we have determined that this is the best course based on an array of business challenges,"" Matthew McBride of Green Earth said in a press release this week.

The chain filed a notice of intent under Canada's Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act earlier this month, as a first step in liquidating itself, including selling off $16 million worth of its inventory at deeply discounted prices.

The Yellowknife Co-op recently installed a hydroponic greenhouse on its property. Its general manager hopes to start selling homegrown leafy greens and fresh herbs in four to six weeks time.

“We’ve had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce or Canadian produce,” said manager Justin Nelson.

“There was an opportunity to get involved in a hydroponic greenhouse, so we decided to do an investment in it. We just want to provide to our members some locally-grown produce.”

We’ve had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce. Justin Nelson, manager

Hydroponics are systems for growing plants in water— without soil. The co-op’s food is growing in a greenhouse made out of an upgraded shipping container from Ottawa-based company The Growcer.

The Growcer’s greenhouses use water enriched with nutrients, an artificial light source and carbon dioxide to grow plants “as quickly as possible,” said Corey Ellis, a company co-founder. He said the greenhouses can grow seeds into full plants in about six weeks.

The sea cans are outfitted to keep plants growing when outside temperatures drop as low as -52 C. Ellis said the greenhouses use about as much electricity as an air conditioner that’s running 24/7.

He said the Yellowknife Co-op should be able to stock its vegetables the same day they are harvested, “which is pretty unique and I think something [customers] will really appreciate.”

The Yellowknife Co-op’s sea can greenhouse isn’t the first in the North. Ellis said his company has installed them in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, and Kuujjuaq, Que., as well.

Right now, the Co-op is growing kale, spinach and bok choi, as well as a variety of lettuces and herbs.

Nelson said the plants are pesticide-free and when harvested, are expected to be fresher and last longer than their counterparts trucked up from the South.

If all goes well, he said, the store will harvest about 400 plants a week.

Curious Yellowknife Co-op shoppers will be able to watch the in-house farming live.

Cameras have been set up in the greenhouse and the plan is to broadcast a livestream onto a large-screen TV set up in the produce department, said Nelson.

Nelson said the idea is not to produce a cheaper vegetable.

“Power and heat up here isn’t cheap, so this isn’t something to subsidize produce here,” he said. “Produce is cheap, it’s no different than other locations in the South.”

The hope is to make a profit off the home-grown greens, said Nelson, and then return those profits to co-op members.

Though he declined to talk about how much the greenhouse costs, Nelson did say he is “feeling pretty cool” and “pretty happy” about the operation.

It reported that German industrial giant Siemens AG is teaming up with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to build an underground 560-kilometre transmission line that will carry power from Iowa to the Chicago area. It will be called the SOO Green Renewable Rail.

The prices of publicly traded wind and solar companies have been edging higher, but they are still undervalued compared to the broad market, according to some experts. ( MARTIN BERNETTI / AFP/GETTY IMAGES FILE PHOTO )

So, what’s so special about another power line, even if it’s underground? Just that the electricity it carries will be wind and solar generated. When it’s completed, hopefully by 2024, the line will be capable of transmitting 2,100 megawatts, which the Journal says is the equivalent of a large nuclear power plant. Although two European companies are undertaking the project, there’s a Canadian connection. Most of the route will run along a Canadian Pacific railroad corridor, which should make it easier to obtain the necessary permits. I found this story intriguing because I had no idea that solar and wind generation had reached such a substantial scale. I had been under the mistaken impression that green energy initiatives were still small-scale ventures that relied heavily on government subsidies to survive.

Not so, says John A. Cook, president of Greenchip Financial Corp., which specializes in this type of investing. “Last year there was $340 billion invested in wind and solar energy projects – more than for all other types of electrical generation,” he told me in a phone interview. He noted that in December, the Alberta Government signed three contracts to provide 600 megawatts of wind generation to the province for the next 20 years (enough to power 255,000 homes). “The remarkable part of this story is the unsubsidized auction price of 3.7 cents per kWh,” he says. “This is about half where wind generation was at only a year ago and is almost as cheap as solar. It is also half what a new natural gas or coal plant could produce these electrons at. The breakthrough can be attributed to technological advances, the good Alberta wind regime, and the low cost of capital large developers now bring. For several reasons, solar will continue to grow faster than wind, but 3.7 cents is a game changer.” Greenchip is a sub-advisor to the recently launched Mackenzie Global Environmental Equities Fund. It has only been around since October, so we don’t have much history to work with. However, the year-to-date gain of 13.25 per cent (to March 11) is impressive. The portfolio is basically the same as the 11-year-old Greenchip Global Equity Fund, which is only open to accredited investors ($250,000 and up).

That Greenchip portfolio consists of several familiar names such as Siemens, Panasonic, Hitachi and Johnson Controls, plus a lot of companies that few people have ever heard of. The largest position is in JinkoSolar, a small-cap producer of solar modules, based in Shanghai. Although the prices of publicly traded wind and solar companies have been edging higher, they are still undervalued compared to the broad market, says Cook. It may be hard to believe, but the market capitalization all the listed solar manufacturers in the Greenchip portfolio is just over $10 billion. A single cannabis company, Canopy Growth, has a market cap more than double that.

One reason for the depressed value of solar and wind stocks is that relatively few analysts cover them. Also, environmental sectors generally experience higher levels of technological and regulatory change, which is often missed by investors. Finally, due to the sector’s high growth potential and disruptive nature, individual companies or sub-sectors are susceptible to excessive hype and/or cynicism. The net result, Cook contends, are “incredibly attractive” valuations. So, how do you participate in this energy revolution? There are four Canadian mutual funds that focus on these companies. They include the Mackenzie fund already mentioned, the NEI Environmental Leaders Fund, the Desjardins Societerra Environment Fund (a fund that invests in bonds issued by “responsible” companies), and the AGF Global Sustainable Growth Equity Fund. It’s been around the longest and shows a 10-year average annual return of 9.9 per cent. The portfolio goes well beyond energy to include health care, basic materials, consumer cyclicals, etc. Surprisingly, I could not find a single Canadian-based ETF that focuses on this area. There are several in the U.S., however. One of the largest is the Invesco Solar ETF, which invests in a portfolio of U.S. and international companies that produce solar power or build components for the industry. Its 10-year record is in negative territory but for the first two months of this year it was ahead an amazing 34.85 per cent. Another strong performer this year is the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, which was up 17 per cent for 2019 as of March 11. Here again, the 10-year return is negative. Investors have taken a long time to understand this business, but they finally are catching on. Amazingly, this is all happening in a world where the President of the United States is a climate change skeptic, whose policies seek to weaken the development of alternative power sources and, instead, revitalize the coal industry. Clearly, his plans are not working. Alternative energy momentum is building, and investors are increasingly looking to get in on the action.

As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.","OTTAWA—For his first question in the House of Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh asked the prime minister whether he was going to make housing more affordable for Canadians. This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto. Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is recognized in the House of Commons before taking his place before question period on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. The prime minister and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh, Chantal Hébert writes. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair. With the resignation of clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick — one of the main protagonists in the controversy — announced just minutes before question period, the focus promptly returned to the topic that has consumed Canadian politics for the past five weeks. Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation. But he may have to wait a few more months — until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign — for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

Article Continued Below

Tuesday’s budget — the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office — marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future. In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Article Continued Below

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda. One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more. But the SNC-Lavalin affair — and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction — has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic. As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue. Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh. The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives. It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage. Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000. On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals. Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner. Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago. Like Clark who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks. In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of NDP MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at 9 per cent, two points ahead of the NDP. The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall. As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

LISTEN: This week’s White Towel podcast opens with talk of expectations squarely on the shoulders ...","Will dropping the number of homegrown starters in the CFL diminish the Canadiana of the league?

With just 21 sleeps until the NHL’s draft lottery, here’s something else that’s exciting to Vancouver Canucks’ fans, the musings and meditations on the world of sports.

• The news that the CFL and CFLPA is considering revisions to the player ratio has been floating around the league for a couple of months but it surfaced violently last week as negotiations opened for a new CBA.

Traditionalists, predictably, had a conniption, claiming the league would sell out its birthright if the ratio was altered. The league, they argue, derives its character and identity from its Canadian content and if the number of Canadian starters is reduced from seven to five, the league will lose its soul.

You can understand their outrage to a point but, in this case the economic considerations of an adjustment outweigh those issues which concern the flag and back bacon. The CFL is a lot of things — not least of which is a uniquely Canadian institution — but it’s also a second-tier professional league trying to survive in a brutally competitive market.

The ratio, unfortunately, distorts the league’s business model. Once you get past the quarterbacks, the highest-paid players aren’t the league’s stars but tend to be veteran Canadians who can play at or near an all-star level. The proposal to reduce their number doesn’t eradicate the Canadiana aspect of the league. But it does reduce the inflationary pressure involved with those players.

The CFL will also argue that expansion will open more jobs to all players, irrespective of their passport, and when you come right down to it, it seems the millennial audience the league is trying to reach isn’t as concerned with the game’s history as their parents and grandparents.

The league is trying to rebrand itself as a global entity which can attract players from all over the world. This is a necessary step in that process.

Now, if they come after the rouge they’ll have a fight on their hands.

• If the Players Championship isn’t the fifth major, it easily qualifies as the fifth-most important tournament in world golf and you can make the case it’s as prestigious as the PGA. It served up another beauty this week, a 16-man battle royal from which Rory McIlroy emerged as the survivor. The new March start date also serves as a brilliant kickoff to the golf season for anyone who lives north of St. Louis.

It’s has its own history, its own setting and its own unique story to tell each year. Basically, it’s the Masters Lite which is a pretty good thing to be.

• During Wednesday’s Canucks-Rangers tilt, I made the observation on Twitter that, while the bar isn’t exactly high, Tyler Motte qualifies as one of the more positive stories of this Canucks’ season.

Didn’t realize this was a hugely controversial position.

Motte, in fact, sets up as a test case in the ongoing debate over analytics. The eyeball test sees the 24-year-old winger as a fourth-liner who kills penalties, has scored nine goals this season and plays the game with speed and tenacity. Among other things, he leads the Canucks in hits by a huge margin.

Again, this is as much a commentary on the rest of the team as Motte.

As for his fancy stats, they are, well, terrible. I’d argue that’s a result of playing most of the season with Jay Beagle and Loui Eriksson in a matchup role but the analytics folk believe his underlying data is a reflection of Motte as a player. At least that’s what they mentioned on Wednesday in the calm, reasoned language which makes Twitter such a fun place to inhabit.

We can revisit this one this time next year and if I’m wrong, it won’t be the first time.

Travis Green, by the way, likes Motte so take it up with him.

• Ran into an NHL scout in Dallas who spends a lot of time working the NCAA. Here’s his take on Canucks’ prospect Tyler Madden, who’s just finishing his freshman year at Northeastern.

“The kid’s a stud. I don’t care about his weight (Madden goes a buck fifty-five on a good day). He’ll play and he’s a winner.”

• And finally, it’s been an up-and-down season for Luke Schenn and that’s putting it mildly. In his career, a larger stardom has eluded the fifth-overall pick in the 2008 draft but, until this season, he spent 10 years in the NHL as a reliable stay-at-home defencemen.

Then things changed, abruptly and the speed of the game and Schenn’s own limitations made him an expendable commodity. He’s played for four teams this season — Anaheim and the Canucks in the NHL; San Diego and Utica in the AHL — and, as much as anyone, he understands his situation.

“You don’t ask questions,” said the 29-year-old. “When you get in the lineup, you just try to play to the best of your capability. Being in the position I have been this year I don’t take anything for granted. I just want to enjoy it and have fun.

“When you’re a young guy, you can be naive to the way things can be. When you’re younger you take certain situations and opportunities for granted. When you get older you learn to appreciate them a lot more, knowing they’re not going to be there forever.”

Schenn drew into the Canucks’ lineup on Sunday because of the injury to Chris Tanev. He also understands the hazards of playing the style he shares with Tanev.

“It would be nice to sit on the half-wall and run the power play but it’s just not in the cards for guys like myself and him,” he said with a laugh. “I did it a couple of times in the minors where you run the power play and you think, man, it would be nice to be doing this my whole career. You’d feel a lot less beaten down.

“But you have to play to your strengths and that’s part of it, taking hits, making hits, blocking shots.”

Good Canadian kid there.

OMG has signed a joint venture with Cannabolland Cluster S.A.S (“Cannabolland”), a vertical biotech cluster based in Piedemonte Llanero region, Meta (Colombia) that groups companies with cannabis licenses with the aim of structuring the companies, consolidating the licenses, providing technical knowledge and infrastructure. As per the joint venture agreement, OMG has now access to the planned production of cannabis on 5,000 hectares of land with possible extension of the cultivation licenses for all types of production to the geographical area of the cluster (up to 12,000 acres). The six companies within Cannabolland, that include 2,500 associated growers, have 3 psychoactive (THC) and 3 non-psychoactive (CBD) licenses, as well as 2 transformational (extraction) licenses. In collaboration with its strategic and distribution partner Ortix S.A.S,

OMG is working on the launch of 9 cannabis-based topical products under the OMG brand. The first 2 products from the OMG portfolio in Colombia will be distributed across Ortix network of 7,300 stores within the next 60 days.

OMG is actively pursuing a go-public transaction and focusing on becoming a significant producer and supplier of medicinal cannabis products and services in Colombia alongside companies such as PharmaCielo and Khiron Life Sciences Corp. OMG is positioning itself to become one of the lowest costs, high-margin businesses operating in Colombia while delivering premium quality cannabis products to their consumers.

“To see how quickly OMG is growing their business opportunities in Colombia is exciting for Next Green Wave,” stated Leigh Hughes, CEO of Next Green Wave. “As OMG grow their distribution channels, it opens up the platform for our brands outside of California and gives us scope to do more in a low-cost, high-margin environment in Colombia.”

Invest in 2,000,000 common shares of OMG at CAD$0.25 per share for a total amount of CAD$500,000 under a subscription agreement with OMG

The Canadians in the field this week at The Players Championship – Adam Hadwin rounds out the Canadian contingent – are only a small part of global group Applebaum has connected ...","PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – On the 18th green at TPC Sawgrass, Laurence Applebaum was laughing and chatting with whomever was around.

Usually standing on that intimidating tee – with water up the left-hand side and a thin fairway – you’re not happy at all. But Golf Canada’s CEO caught Canadians Nick Taylor and Corey Conners coming through in the final hole of their practice round, and how could he not be happy?

Taylor and Conners were wearing shorts. Applebaum was clad in a grey monotone ensemble, the pop of colour reserved for the red in the Golf Canada logo on his shirt. It was like a scene you might stumble upon at any golf club in the country when a trio of friends got together at the end of a round – it just so happened that two of the three are some of the best golfers in the world.

“They’re true professionals on the PGA Tour,” said Applebaum on the veranda of the iconic clubhouse at TPC Sawgrass. “It seems like the vibe amongst those guys is that every week there is a different guy who is finding his groove. Roger Sloan, for example, had a couple great weeks, and to have Adam Hadwin leading that class… it’s so good to have those guys on the Tour and they’ve been great ambassadors for golf in Canada.”

The Canadians in the field this week at The Players Championship – Adam Hadwin rounds out the Canadian contingent – are only a small part of global group Applebaum has connected with already.

As the CEO of Golf Canada, he’s been thrilled to continue to drive the momentum of the organization forward – ‘momentum’ he said, is probably the one word to sum-up the last 12 months or so.

Applebaum, with his second Annual Meeting as CEO in the rearview – where Golf Canada announced its three-year strategic plan – was happy to mix business with pleasure this week in Ponte Vedra Beach.

Martin Slumbers, the chief executive of the R&A, Jay Monahan, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, Canadian golf hall of famer Mike Weir, and Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada president Jeff Monday are just some of crew Applebaum has talked with. He’s enjoyed sharing the good-news story behind this year’s RBC Canadian Open.

“The new date. The new purse. The extension of the RBC sponsorship. The recent news that we’ll have three direct qualifiers from the RBC Canadian Open into the British Open is going to be wonderful,” he said. “We have such a great snowball effect of what’s going on.”

The commissioner, Applebaum said, was instrumental with the new date and helping to bring three partners – RBC, Golf Canada, and the PGA Tour – together to make the upcoming RBC Canadian Open a special one.

He said although the PGA Tour is a big professional sports organization, it’s also a really intimate family.

“They’ve wrapped their arms around Canada,” he said.

With The Players becoming the signature event of the PGA Tour, it’s become a spectacle with the global golf community invited. There are things the organizing team will bring from The Players to the RBC Canadian Open this year.

“When you spend any time here, you realize it’s a little beach town outside Jacksonville, Florida, and it’s become a mecca for golf fans. Golfers, sports fans, people looking for fun things to do – like family entertainment – and they’ve brought food, music, a real spectacle in the middle of March which is really nice,” said Applebaum.

“We’ve learned a lot from what they’ve done. We’ve really got to build our own identity for the RBC Canadian Open and it’s going to be the start of summer when our new event is, which is really exciting.”

Not only is there exciting news around the RBC Canadian Open, but Canadian golf as a whole, said Applebaum.

There are eight Canadians with PGA Tour status this year – nine if you count Graham DeLaet, who is on a major medical exemption and 10 if you count Weir, as a past major champion – which is the most ever.

He also points to the success of Team RBC members Dustin Johnson (as world no.1) and new Team RBC member Webb Simpson (as defending champion at The Players) as something else that’s been a positive through late 2018 and early 2019.

“We want to keep that momentum going,” he said – with a smile, of course.",Momentum builds for 2019 RBC Canadian Open,Golf Canada,https://golfcanada.ca/article/momentum-builds-2019-rbc-canadian-open

Businesses with unique inventories are always a pleasure to see, but, unfortunately, sometimes it’s difficult to keep up with the times.

London, Ontario-based gift shop business Green Earth, which has been in business since 1990, has announced it will be closing its doors due to multiple factors.

We are sad to be closing, but we can’t say how much we love our customers and appreciate their business over the years!

“After considering a number of restructuring options we have determined that this is the best course based on an array of business challenges,” Green Earth representative Matthew McBride said.

“We thank all of our loyal employees for their hard work and dedication, and we thank all of our life long customers for so many years of patronage and support, and encourage all to take advantage of the incredible savings on our entire inventory.”

The business is known for its specialty gift items, which come in a large selection of products. These range from candles, jewellry, pots, and intricately-designed dragon eggs.

As a signal of appreciation to customers, Green Earth has also announced a nation-wide liquidation sale event, which could see all products, including many of the aforementioned, receive anywhere from 40 to 80 per cent off.

The sale began on March 9, and will continue until all of its $16 million of inventory, plus fixtures and equipment, is liquidated.



Furniture products, as well as fixtures and equipment, are also available for sale.



“Our stores are really well known in the local markets where we have served our communities for years. McBride said.” The sale provides an opportunity for our loyal customers to buy products at compelling discounts.



“A sale like this is unprecedented in Green Earth’s history. We encourage customers to take advantage while selection is best.”

Name: Green Tea

Contact: 261 Spadina Ave., 416-519-1073, @greenteacanada

Neighbourhood: Chinatown

Previously: Dim Sum Plus

Owner: Celine Zhang

The food

“I think we’re the first restaurant to bring real Southern Chinese food to Toronto,” says Celine Zhang, who also co-owns Canada’s only other Green Tea franchise, located in Markham (there are 80 locations in China, however). Green Tea is part of the new crop of mainland Chinese chains that have set their expansion sights on the Canadian market. It specializes in Hangzhou-style food, which is known for its ingredient-forward dishes that aren’t overly spicy or greasy: it’s a fresh, light cuisine. “A lot of the dishes are a little sweet, too,” says Zhang. “We add sugar to almost everything to bring out the flavour.”

The drinks

Despite being called Green Tea Restaurant, the focus here is on the fresh-made juices, which include watermelon and pear, along with blends popular in China like cogongrass root and sugar cane. The one tea on offer is longjing, a pan-roasted green tea from Hangzhou.

The space

Zhang took what was previously a bare-bones dim sum place and brought it to life with Southern Chinese–inspired décor, decorative blonde wood and wall murals depicting traditional buildings commonly found in Zhejiang province. “I wanted the space to feel young so it would appeal to students and young professionals,” says Zhang, who says their Markham location abides by a more traditional Chinese aesthetic, which she thinks is a bit dark and heavy.","What’s on the menu at Green Tea, Chinatown’s new place for Hangzhou-style dishes",Toronto Life,https://torontolife.com/food/restaurants/whats-menu-green-tea-chinatowns-new-place-hangzhou-style-dishes/

The party leader and MP for Saanich-Gulf Islands is confident she won’t remain the lone Green elected once ballots are counted on Oct. 21.

article continues below

Citing the absence of a polarizing politician like former Conservative leader Stephen Harper, the SNC-Lavalin scandal surrounding the governing Liberals and Max Bernier’s fledgling People’s Party likely to divide the Conservative vote, May said Canadians can have confidence choosing who they want as opposed to voting strategically — an issue she believes hurt the party in the 2015 election.

“This is an election where people can breathe easily knowing that with five parties nationally — and six, including the Bloc Quebecois — we’re very likely to have a minority Parliament, and in that Parliament, the most powerful and effective MPs are the ones that are good at co-operation,” she told KTW.

May visited the city on Monday night, speaking to a packed crowd of supporters at St. Andrews on the Square as part of her national Community Matters tour — an effort to gauge voters’ priorities and concerns in the run-up to the election campaign.

Monday’s forum drew questions such as whether the proportional representation debate was over, enshrining the environment in the Canadian Bill of Rights, how government can support people transitioning out of heavy industries and how to work with First Nations hereditary chiefs.

In response, May said the Greens won’t drop the proportional representation issue and that she would also like to see a federal environmental bill of rights similar to Ontario’s.

May also noted Alberta has the country’s best potential for solar and wind energy and said the Greens would propose a timeline of 2025 to repeal the Indian Act and consult with First Nations as to their preferred government model.

Asked by KTW what she took away from the night, May noted the concerns she heard about large corporations receiving favouritism and deals from governments.

“I think the Green campaign in 2019 may well have a theme about let’s restore, to the citizens of a country, the allegiance of their government,” May said.

Support for the federal Greens has waned in the Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo riding in recent elections.

Donovan Cavers, the federal Green candidate in 2008, pulled in eight per cent of the vote, then five per cent in 2011. In 2015, Matt Greenwood garnered 3.5 per cent of the vote.

Asked how the Green Party of Canada can make gains in the Kamloops riding in 2019, May noted the support Green candidates received in the 2017 provincial elections — when Dan Hines and Cavers each received about 20 per cent of the vote — as a sign of progress.

“That’s a big statement of 20 per cent of a popular vote for Greens in Kamloops. We’ll see how we do in the federal election,” she said.

“We’re feeling optimistic about electing Greens in many parts of Canada.”

The topic of whether or not marijuana causes ...","On Feb. 2019, TGO published a story on how a Canadian supplement company was aiming to mitigate marijuana’s negative effects, including hangovers. The topic of whether or not marijuana causes hangovers led to a spirited debate.

“Some users have reported that they have never experienced a cannabis hangover. So, there is a gamut of individual experiences based on anecdotal evidence,” says Thomas Folan, MD, CEO and founder of SolaceMD, an online medical cannabis information, recommendation and consultation platform. “As with so many other areas of cannabis research, more well-performed trials are needed to fully understand what is going on,” Folan notes.

The symptoms of a weed hangover range from headache, nausea, brain fog, dehydration, lethargy to dry eyes. Overconsumption, like it is with alcohol, is the key.

Bethany Rae, founder of Flower & Freedom, a community exploring cannabis use for fitness, admits to experiencing brain fog and a feeling of lethargy when she goes over her sweet spot. “The term hangover doesn’t necessarily make sense to me. But I have experienced brain fog and the feeling of lethargy from overconsuming cannabis—particularly from too many edibles.” Rae uses cannabis for pain relief, anxiety and depression. “I understand cannabis to be a lot like food, and not so much like alcohol or tobacco. When you have education around nutrition, you know what to eat and how much. With cannabis, it’s the same; understanding the amount and strain type is crucial,” she says.

What do the studies say about cannabis hangovers?

Conclusively, not a lot. There’s lack of extensive research done on this topic, and two most commonly known studies were conducted in 1985 and 2006.

The study conducted is 1985 saw participation from 13 male marijuana smokers. The purpose of the study was to determine whether marijuana smoked in the evening would result in subjective or behavioural effects the following morning. “The findings suggest that marijuana smoking can produce residual (hangover) effects the day after smoking. The precise nature and extent of these effects, as well as their practical implications, remain to be determined,” notes the study abstract.

The one published in 2006 examined the association among cannabis use and cognitive performance, mood and human error at work. “The pattern of results suggests two possible effects. First, a hangover-type effect that may increase with frequency of use; second, a subtle effect on cognitive function, perhaps more apparent under cognitive load and/or fatigue, which may increase with more prolonged use,” reads the study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology.

Folan points out that “the 2006 study was confounded by concomitant alcohol and tobacco use, so the results must be considered in that light.”

Hangovers: Cannabis versus alcohol

Despite the similarities, alcohol hangovers are more severe and have been reported to induce coma and even cause death.

Unlike cannabis, “the alcohol molecule actually suppresses the hormone in the body that is supposed to hold onto water—appropriately named anti-diuretic hormone, or ADH. This is why people will talk about breaking the seal and attempting to hold out urinating when drinking,” says Folan. “It also explains the reason behind being dehydrated after a drinking session despite (potentially) imbibing copious amounts of fluid. Upon overindulgence, the body’s alcohol dehydrogenase (the enzyme used to break down alcohol) cannot work any faster than if you just had a beer or two. This is not how it is with most substances, including cannabis overconsumption,” he explains.

Is confusion around usage contributing to hangovers?

More than half of respondents (56 percent), who participated in a 2018 survey by Shopper’s Drug Mart in partnership with Environics Research, admitted that with so many different strains and brands, medical cannabis is really confusing. The survey reviewed data from among 1,000 Canadian adults over 18 and years of age or older.

Gerald Major, president and CEO of Canadians for Fair Access to Medical Marijuana, is not surprised. “Cannabis is a medicine, first and foremost; and for those reasons, absolutely requires expert advice. Imagine someone over the age of 50 taking gummies. What if they can’t gauge the dosage and end up taking 100 mg of cannabis? I am certain that would require an emergency visit to the hospital.” A medical cannabis patient himself, Major adds, “you can take cannabis for seizures, Post-traumatic stress disorder, arthritis… but if you are not taking the right thing, then the medical properties that would help with, say, seizures can cause negative effects.”

Source of your cannabis can play a huge role

The product needs to well-sourced and “devoid of contaminants, pesticides and solvents, which could potentially be contributing to side effects and/or hangover,” Folan points out.

Andrew Gordon, senior vice president of strategic partnerships and community at cannabis retailer Kiaro, agrees. “The good news is in a regulated market, one can be assured that the products have been tested for pesticides and residual solvents.”

While the issue of cannabis hangover should be taken seriously, Gordon says, “I also want us to be mindful of a larger hangover—prohibition hangover, one that’s still in the air post-legalization, and affects people, in terms of asking questions or getting involved.”

While cannabis is not harmless, “as a society and as retailers working with regulators, we need to be proactive in interacting with existing and prospective consumers to help reduce stigma and normalize cannabis use in a meaningful way,” he adds.",Going green with cannabis on St. Patrick's Day?

Like many of the pot companies, TGOD has had a great start to 2019, in its case rising 85 per cent since January 1. Now trading in the mid-$4.00 range, the stock is well off its high of $10.24 set last September, but there are reasons to be bullish on the name.

Last month, the company got the nod from Wall Street investment bank Jefferies in its coverage launch of the cannabis space, where TGOD was one of five Buys listed. (They initiated coverage on nine companies.) Rather than trying to be all things to all pot consumers, concentrating on the organic market could be rewarding, according to Jefferies, who gave the stock a price target of $4.65 per share.

Nash agrees. “This is a really interesting cannabis company. It’s the only one that’s certified organic,” he says, in conversation with BNN Bloomberg last Thursday.

“What it comes down to is that the market is still so young on [cannabis], so for consumers that are buying online, I don’t see a huge amount of differentiation involved. What I’m curious to see is once those stores are available and people can go in and touch it and smell it, are they going to have a preference for an organic cannabis option? If the answer is yes, then this company is very, very well situated to capitalize on it,” Nash says.

310,Sports,2019-03-17T02:38:00.0000000Z,The 30-year-old Canadian arrived at TPC Sawgrass feeling great about his putter before promptly missing several short putts in Thursday’s first round. After a good day on the greens on Friday ...,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Don’t call him Goldilocks, but Corey Conners finally played the par-3 island green at TPC Sawgrass just right.

During the first round of the Players Championship, his shot at the iconic 17th hole was too soft. That day, he intended to fly his ball past the front pin and use the back stop to get it close. Instead, his shot – which he deemed his luckiest of the day – barely made it over the water before nestling nine feet from the hole. He made par.

During round two, Conners hit his target but the late afternoon green was too hard and his ball skipped forward, almost meeting the same watery fate as Tiger Wood’s ball. Conners’ ball mercifully stopped in the sliver of rough between the green and the water. He made another par.

On Saturday, Conners arrived at the 17th tee at three-under for the day, five-under for the championship.

Weekends at the Players are different. There is a lot more fun to be had outside of the ropes, especially at the island green. The VIP suites surrounding the hole bustled with action. Everyone’s spirits raised by, well, spirits. Below on the grassy amphitheatre, much of the grass had been replaced by chairs and blankets; fans camped out in the best seats in the house for an afternoon of water balls and cold beer. Marshals had all but given up keeping the fans quiet, raising their arms before each shot more in surrender than authority.

Coming off a birdie at the par-5 16th, Conners wasn’t thinking about the crowd.

“I don’t really notice the noise, don’t really mind it when it’s consistent like that,” he said after the round.

On Saturday, the wind at 17 had turned into the players, and with the pin at the front left, Conners found it trickier to get close.

“I think for most guys it will be a wedge, but you’ve got to hit a good wedge,” he said. “It’s a gutsy wedge I guess.”

Conners’ playing partner Matt Wallace, not happy with his wedge shots on Saturday, hit nine-iron and it went long. The Englishman’s lower trajectory shot penetrated the wind and sent his ball to the back tier. Conners’ pitching wedge was higher, hit harder by the wind, but landed gently 12 feet from the hole.

Just right.

“It was a perfect shot,” Conners said “Exactly how I wanted it. I maybe thought it was going to land one or two yards further into the green but I hit it really solid.”

Being a golf nut was about to pay dividends for Conners. After watching similar putts on television throughout the years, he knew that his 12-foot putt would stop breaking near the hole, a subtlety not obvious from the green. There was a pitch mark near his line and he knew if he started his ball just to the right of it, it would go in for birdie.

He did, and it did.

“My mind is always thinking about golf,” he said when asked about the changing course conditions. “Last night on the practice green I was rolling some putts and envisioning some of the holes, sitting on the couch back at the house I was thinking about how some of the holes might play, sort of visualizing what I wanted my shot to look like.”

Conners’ Saturday 68 moved him up the leaderboard into a tie for 24th at six-under par. Another good round Sunday will mean a great payday and valuable FedEx Cup points.

But, beware, this course is a bear.

Taylor battles putter, finally wins

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Nick Taylor’s patience is being tested this week at the Players Championship.

The 30-year-old Canadian arrived at TPC Sawgrass feeling great about his putter before promptly missing several short putts in Thursday’s first round. After a good day on the greens on Friday, nothing would drop on Saturday.

“To be honest there was probably three putts today where a foot short I would have bet a lot of money they were going in, and they didn’t,” Taylor said.

Taylor made a total of just 47 feet of putts during round three. His first three birdies came on near-gimmes from 8 inches, 3-feet-7-inches and 1-foot-7-inches. Taylor hit 15 greens in regulation on Saturday and had plenty of mid-range looks at birdie that went unrewarded.

“You keep telling yourself that eventually, they are going to drop,” he said. “If you keep hitting edges and starting on the lines you are choosing that’s really all you can do.”

Despite frustration setting in, Taylor was playing well and was determined to keep giving himself chances. At the brutally difficult 18th hole, Taylor had one last chance to make a putt. He had 10-feet-5-inches for birdie get to five-under for the week and head to Sunday tied for 32nd at the Players Championship.

It dropped. Finally.

Taylor shot 69 at TPC Sawgrass on Saturday while making just one putt from outside of five feet.

It seems sensible to say the team that has swept ...","The new Formula One season opens in Australia on Sunday with the same old question — can Mercedes be beaten? — and a trunkful of tantalizing subplots.

For one, Montreal’s Lance Stroll carries the colours of a new team and the prospect of a smoother road ahead after a rocky ride in his sophomore campaign last season.

The 2019 calendar features a record-matching 21 stops, with the Canadian Grand Prix taking up its usual slot June 7-9 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.

To get you primed, here are five key storylines to watch as F1 gets set to go in Melbourne:

Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes

It seems sensible to say the team that has swept the drivers’ and constructors’ championships in each of the last five years enters the new season as the clear favourite.

Hamilton, though, doesn’t want you to think that. He’s been playing up Ferrari’s strong form during pre-season tests and insisting the Silver Arrows are behind by as much as half a second per lap, an eternity in F1 terms.

But we’ve heard this before. Last season, too, Ferrari seemed to have the better car at the outset and at certain points during the campaign. And yet, in the end, Hamilton bagged his fifth drivers’ title with two races to spare.

Which goes to show, despite what the detractors say, the car alone doesn’t win championships. The driver must deliver maximum performance, too, at every opportunity, or pretty well close. And so does the team around him.

No one has delivered better on all three fronts — driver, car, team — than Mercedes since the introduction of hybrid-turbo engines in 2014. That’s why they are where they are, and why they will be difficult to displace.

Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari

Hamilton’s hyperbole aside, it’s true Ferrari looked strong in testing and remains the most likely candidate to break the Mercedes stranglehold on F1.

To do that, though, it must avoid repeating the gaffes of last season — both on and off the track — that saw it squander championship points on too many occasions.

Vettel, a four-time champion, must for his part be more like, well, Hamilton, and put in a near-error-free performance if he is to deliver Ferrari its first drivers’ title since 2007.

This time around, it seems, the atmosphere at the Italian stable is more positive and relaxed under new team principal Mattia Binotto, who has replaced the enigmatic Maurizio Arrivabene. That should help.

But Binotto is not the only big change, nor perhaps the most significant.

The highly rated Charles Leclerc is making his much-anticipated debut as Vettel’s teammate, replacing the veteran Kimi Raikkonen, who’s sitting in Leclerc’s old seat at Alfa Romeo.

With the eager and talented Leclerc nipping at his tailpipe, Vettel will have all the more reason to up his game if he wants to remain Ferrari’s No. 1 title contender.

Lance Stroll and Racing Point

If there is something to be learned from Leclerc’s accelerated move to Ferrari, it is that you don’t need a great car to make a big impression.

The lesson is not lost on Stroll, you’d think.

In just one year in F1, Leclerc, 21, managed to show sufficient promise at a mid-level team to have earned him arguably the most coveted seat on the grid.

Stroll, meanwhile, is starting his third year. At 20, it’s fair to say he’s held his own so far. It’s also reasonable to expect a little bit more.

This season offers a fresh start with a new team — Racing Point, the former Force India outfit that was bought out by a group of investors led by his billionaire father.

Given dad’s influence, Stroll will have all the support he needs to step up and stand out, Leclerc-like.

If he doesn’t, the risk is that pretty soon he’ll be seen as just another also-ran.

Robert Kubica and Williams

Kubica, who’s making an improbable return to F1 after eight years, has strong connections to Montreal — both good and bad.

The bad came in 2007, when he was involved in a horrific crash at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, his airborne BMW-Sauber striking a barrier at 300 km/h. Incredibly, he suffered only minor injuries.

The good came the following year when he returned to the scene of the accident to score his first and only F1 win, stunning the packed grandstands that included a great many emotional members of Montreal’s Polish community.

In 2011, another major setback: Kubica sustained major injuries, including a partially severed forearm, in a rally crash in Italy, and his racing days were thought to be over.

But no. Intense rehabilitation and determination have steered him back to an F1 racing seat at age 34, filling the vacancy left by Stroll at Williams.

Watch for the Polish flags to wave once more on Île Notre Dame come June, no matter the result.

Daniel Ricciardo and Renault

F1 drivers take a risk every time they climb into their cockpits, but Ricciardo’s decision to ditch Red Bull in favour of Renault might rank as his biggest gamble yet.

Red Bull is the only team besides Mercedes and Ferrari to have won races since 2014. Ricciardo has seven to his name — his first coming, coincidentally, at the Canadian Grand Prix that year.

There is no evidence Renault is anywhere near ready to challenge for a win — even a podium might be difficult — so it’s a mystery why the Australian has chosen this path.

The closest he has come to an explanation appeared in a Melbourne newspaper this week, where he was quoted as saying “perhaps the love just wasn’t there” during contract negotiations that left him feeling less wanted than his younger and brasher teammate, Max Verstappen.

Ricciardo, who turns 30 on Canada Day, is among the most talented and popular drivers in F1, and it would be a shame to see his career shift into reverse.

Then again, behind his trademark grin, maybe he knows something the rest of us do not about Renault’s prospects, whether in the short or long term.

WINNIPEG, March 15 (MarketsFarm) – Routine business and crusher activity are supporting increases on the ICE canola futures midday Friday, said a Winnipeg-based trader.

“We’re off those lows certainly by a fair chunk, but we’re still below yesterday’s high,” he said, noting the funds are maxed out with their large short positions.

He also pointed to farmers, who have been quite reluctant to sell their canola, as they wait for better prices.

The Canadian dollar slipped under 75 U.S. cents.

There has been nothing new out of China regarding Richardson International. Chinese officials have yet to provide any evidence of Richardson’s canola shipments being contaminated.

Although trade negotiations between the United States and China have slowed, progress is still being made. U.S. President Donald Trump stated the next three to four weeks will determine whether negotiators come to an agreement or not. It’s widely believed Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will sign a deal by the end of April.

Dividend yields, more often than not, can be deceptive. Sometimes companies pay out more than they can afford, leading to a rush for a coveted yield. Other times, a company pays out much less than it can afford, leading to unattractive dividend yields that miss the attention of income-seeking investors.

In my opinion, Vancouver-based wealth management company Canaccord Genuity (TSX:CF) is one of the latter. If you’re an active stock picker, you’ve probably come across this company’s research on a wide range of Canadian and American stocks. What you’ve probably missed is the fact that equity research is only a small fraction of Canaccord’s operations.

The company provides wealth management, investment banking, and financial consultation services to companies and individuals spread across much of the developed world. While 80% of revenue last year was generated in North America, the company also has operations in the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, European Union, and Australia.

Although the company offers a dividend, the yield is barely 0.65% — one-third the rate on a 10-year Canadian government bond. However, my research indicates six reasons for investors to take a closer look:

Low dividend-payout ratio

Canaccord’s dividend-payout ratio is a mere 11%, which indicates the company is holding back and reinvesting much of the cash it generates. My guess is that the company is building its arsenal for further expansion and acquisitions, like the recently purchased Petsky Prunier LLC, a merger and acquisition specialist based in New York.

Insiders buying

Insiders have been net buyers of the stock over the past 12 months, deploying $2 million in net inflow. The biggest purchase was driven by Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer Stuart Raftus.

Earnings growth

Revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share are all up over the past three fiscal years. The company has swung from a $6 million loss in 2016 to a $82 million profit in 2018.

Share buybacks

The company has bought back and retired 1,028,700 shares over the past 12 months. Assuming the average price for these purchases was $6, the company has deployed 50% more cash in buybacks than dividends over the past year. However, some of this buyback is offset by the dilution caused by the company’s stock compensation to employees.

Buy ratings

The two analysts who cover the stock, Jeff Fenwick of Cormark Securities and Graham Ryding of TD Securities, both have buy ratings on Canaccord Genuity. The average of their respective price targets is $9.25, while the stock trades 33% lower.

Cash on hand

As of December 31, 2018, Canaccord Genuity reported $931 million in cash and cash equivalents. That covers the dividend and buyback more than 93 times.

Bottom line

I suspect that Canaccord Genuity is trying to drive growth through the mergers and acquisitions strategies it specializes in. Over the next few years, much of its cash hoard could be deployed in buying financial companies across the world.

If the company can boost the return on equity with this strategy, investors will ultimately reap the benefits of capital appreciation. Meanwhile, there’s always a chance management will be more generous with dividends and buybacks.",6 Green Flags Indicate This Dividend Stock Could Rally Soon,The Motley Fool Canada,https://www.fool.ca/2019/03/14/6-green-flags-indicate-this-dividend-stock-could-rally-soon/

Green, who finished third in Outremont behind the Liberal and NDP candidates, believes it’s possible Quebecers could once again choose to shift their vote en masse to a new party, as they’ve done previously, and send as many as five or six green party MPs to Ottawa.

“Quebec at the federal level has always voted in waves, which have changed Canadian history,” he said in an interview. “We did it with the Bloc Quebecois, we did it with the NDP. Now, it’s the Greens’ turn.”

Green earned nearly 13 per cent of the vote in Outremont, finishing ahead of the candidates from the Bloc Quebecois and the Conservative Party of Canada. It’s a big improvement over 2015, when the party won only 3.6 per cent of the vote.

He believes the numbers show Quebecers are starting to see the party as a “useful” group with concrete solutions to problems such as climate change.

The party, he added, is already scouting a team of experienced candidates for the next election.

“These are mature people, who have already seen snow, some have already done municipal politics, some have done federal politics, have been candidates for other parties,” he said.

As much as Maxime Bernier is cannibalizing the right, we can equally see that elsewhere in Canada, especially in the Maritimes and British Columbia, the left-wing, environmentalist vote is leaving the NDP for the Greens

With the Bloc Quebecois and NDP struggling in Quebec, and the Liberals mired in the fallout of accusations from the former attorney general, the Green party is hoping some of the left-wing votes will swing its way.

But how much chance does the party really have to elect its first Quebec MP?

Philippe J. Fournier, a columnist with L’Actualite magazine and creator of political site 338Canada, believes the party will need to attract a big star candidate in order to win a seat — and it had better be the right one.

“Mr. Green, in Outremont, who got 12.5 per cent, that’s a high point for the Green Party of Canada in Quebec,” he said. “To really make a breakthrough in Quebec, it will take a really big name, because there is no riding that’s takeable, or even close to being takeable.”

Actor and comedian JiCi Lauzon, who is well-known in Quebec, ran for the party in 2015 in a riding south of Montreal, but only managed to win 8.5 per cent of the votes.

But Fournier said the party could certainly play a role in the election, mostly to the detriment of the NDP.

“As much as Maxime Bernier is cannibalizing the right, we can equally see that elsewhere in Canada, especially in the Maritimes and British Columbia, the left-wing, environmentalist vote is leaving the NDP for the Greens,” he said.

He says that if the Green party manages to recruit a star, their best hope may be in two Montreal ridings, Laurier–Sainte-Marie and Hochelaga, which are both represented by NDP MPs who have announced they won’t be running in the fall.

According to a Leger poll in February, eight per cent of Quebecers said they would vote for the Greens if the federal election took place today.

But that number could go down on election day, since voters often tend to opt for the big parties that they feel have a better chance of winning.

“It could be a big balloon that bursts, but it’s been several months that we’re seeing in Quebec that’s it’s eight, nine, 10 per cent…that would be a very good score for them,” Fournier said.

Green is very aware that encouraging poll numbers may not materialize on election day, but he’s hoping to convince Quebecers that voting Green is worth it.

“The challenge in October, is to tell our Green voters to vote Green,” he said. “Vote Green, it’s Ok. It’s a useful vote, a Green vote. It’s a vote that’s necessary to send the message.”","Deputy Green Party leader Daniel Green finishes third in byelection, raising hope for political breakthrough",Windsor Star,https://windsorstar.com/news/politics/encouraging-byelection-result-has-greens-hoping-for-a-breakthrough-in-quebec/wcm/9143eb1d-bb0f-48f6-b615-1d73d099c71c

Angela Rehhorn: Angela Rehhorn, 24, was an enthusiastic conservation volunteer from Orillia, Ont., who was developing a citizen science project on bat conservation.

The Canadian Wildlife Federation says she had recently participated in its Canadian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program for Canadians ages 18 to 30. She was on her way to participate in the United Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi as part of the UN Association of Canada's Canada Service Corps Program, it said.

Rick Bates, CEO of the Canadian Wildlife Federation, said in an interview that Rehhorn was a well-liked ""outdoors girl"" who was also a great leader.

""She was full of excitement and the optimism of youth and wanting to change the world and work on changing the world. And that's what she was doing,"" Bates said.

Rehhorn recently completed a bachelor of science at Dalhousie University and was ""thrilled"" to take part in the conservation corps, the federation said.

Her experience took her to Alberta where she went backpacking in Kananaskis this fall, then to Pacific Rim National Park on Vancouver Island for her field training. At the time of her death, Rehhorn had just finished volunteering her time to do species surveys and was especially interested in expanding her experience working in the marine environment, the federation said.

Stephanie Lacroix: Stephanie Lacroix was passionate about youth education and life skills development in both Canada and southern Africa.

Lacroix was working with the United Nations Association in Canada to help engage young Canadians in the UN's work to grow global citizens as a project officer with the association's Canada Service Corps, her LinkedIn profile says.

She graduated in 2015 with an honours degree in international development and globalization from the University of Ottawa. She was a board member of the African Community Fund for Education Canada and previously volunteered with Free the Children.

In an interview, Jasveen Brar said she met Lacroix at COP24 in Poland.

""She was a mentor to me and the two other guys that were selected for the conference. Since the COP, we kept in touch over email, where she offered me lots of advice about my career and life, she really was a star,"" Brar said.

Darcy Belanger:

Parvati.org, a not-for-profit conservation group, says the former Edmonton resident was its founding member and director of strategic initiatives.

Belanger's LinkedIn profile says he was working as a United States director of professional development with PCL Construction in Denver. Parvati says Belanger had taken time off from PCL and was travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly.

The organization said he was a champion of the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary because he realized the importance of the Arctic Ocean in balancing global weather patterns. MAPS declares the entire Arctic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle a protected area, the group said in a statement.

""Admired for his courage, outstanding achievements, and noble qualities, Darcy was a hero in every sense of the word,"" Parvati said. ""He was passionately devoted to the protection of all life through the realization of MAPS.""

Micah Messent: Messent was an environmentalist from British Columbia who expressed his joy on social media at being able to attend the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi.

In an Instagram post, he said he had been selected by the United Nations Association of Canada to attend the assembly and was travelling to Kenya where he would ""have the chance to meet with other passionate youth and leaders from around the world and explore how we can tackle the biggest challenges that are facing our generation.""

""I'm so grateful for this opportunity and want to thank all of the people in my life who have helped me get this far.""

Prof. Laurie Meijer Drees taught Messent at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo and said he was committed to being a role model for Indigenous youth and was a trailblazer among his classmates and the faculty.

""He was a bright light among all of those bright lights,"" she said. ""He was very enthusiastic, a bright young scholar, very committed to the environment and the land.""

Drees said Messent was part of a group of about a dozen Indigenous Studies students who wanted to make the world a better place.

The First Nations Leadership Council said Messent was a member of the Red River Métis Nation in Manitoba and was raised as the youngest of five siblings in the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island. It said he had plans to return to school in the future to pursue a law degree.

Peter deMarsh: Described by a longtime family friend in New Brunswick as a dedicated community activist, deMarsh travelled the world as chair of the International Family Forestry Alliance.

The international group, based in Luxembourg, represents more than 25 million forest owners worldwide.

Genevieve MacRae recalled how deMarsh and his wife Jean Burgess helped establish the Taymouth Community Association in New Brunswick more than a decade ago.

""Peter and his wife Jean made a pretty powerful team,"" said MacRae, a friend of deMarsh's since her childhood. ""They were always looking for how to improve the lives of the people around them.""

MacRae said deMarsh was a pillar of the Taymouth community.

""He was warm, funny, passionate — you always felt listened-to with Peter,"" MacRae said. ""He was an intense person, except that doesn't signify the warmth that was behind it all ... It's a monumental loss for our community.""

Felix Montecuccoli, a board member with the International Family Forestry Alliance, said in an email that police shared the news of deMarsh's death with his family late Sunday.

DeMarsh was en route to Nairobi, where he and Montecuccoli had planned to attend a workshop on financing for small farms.

The CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada, Derek Nighbor, issued a statement describing deMarsh as a lifelong advocate for the Canadian forest sector.

Amina Ibrahim Odowaa and her daughter Sofia Faisal Abdulkadir:

The 33-year-old Edmonton woman and her five-year-old daughter were travelling to Kenya to visit relatives. Her brother, Mohamed Hassan Ali of Toronto, said he had planned to travel with them but had to cancel last week.

""(She was) a very nice person, very outgoing, very friendly — had a lot of friends,"" he said.

A family friend said Odowaa had lived in Edmonton since 2006.

Derick Lwugi: An accountant with the City of Calgary, Lwugi was on his way to Kenya to visit both his and his wife's parents.

""His mom was not feeling well,"" Lwugi's wife, Gladys Kivia, said in a brief interview from Calgary.

The couple have three children, aged 17, 19 and 20, all of whom live at home. The family has lived in Calgary for 12 years.

Lwugi's neighbours in the southeast suburban neighbourhood of Mohogany said they would honour him with a ribbon campaign in the Kenyan flag's colours of red, black and green.

Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said on Twitter he was ""crushed"" by news of Lwugi's death.

Jessica Hyba: Hyba's Facebook page says she was born in Ottawa and pursued a career in international aid work. She worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as an public relations officer, based in Mogadishu, Somalia. Prior to that, the UNHCR said Hyba worked for CARE Canada.

That agency issued a statement saying she had worked in Indonesia as part of the emergency response to the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.

""We remember her fondly as a dedicated humanitarian and loving mother,"" CARE Canada said on their website.

Danielle Moore: A 24-year-old marine biology student from Winnipeg, Moore graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax in 2017.

She posted on Facebook on Saturday morning that she would be travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly.

""Over the next week, I'll have the opportunity to discuss global environmental issues, share stories, and connect with other youth and leaders from all over the world,"" she wrote.

""I feel beyond privileged to be receiving this opportunity.""

Colby Deighton, who dated Moore for four years and was still a friend, said he has many fond memories of her.

""Danielle was fearless, she had an insatiable curiosity and kind of an unbelievable capacity to do whatever she wanted to do,"" he said. ""She was always looking for opportunities and not just for herself, but she would regularly send people job opportunities or ideas that related to her friend's interests or programs they might want to apply to because it reminded her of them.

""She would often tell me that her dream job was to work in a school and be a guidance counsellor.""

Prof. Kim Davies, her honours thesis adviser at Dalhousie, said Moore was an exceptional student.

""She excelled at her studies, she was a kind and friendly person, and she was deeply devoted to environmental and human rights causes,"" Davies said in an email.

Davies said after graduating from Dalhousie, Moore returned to Manitoba where she worked for several non-governmental organizations, including the Canada Learning Code, a group dedicated to improving the accessibility of educational and technological resources for Canadians.

The professor confirmed Moore's work was recognized by the United Nations, which is why she was invited to be a delegate to the environmental assembly.",Remembering the 18 Canadian victims of the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9224336-remembering-the-18-canadian-victims-of-the-ethiopian-airlines-plane-crash/

Ashka Dixit, Anushka Dixit, Prerit Dixit, Kosha Vaidya:

The family of six from Brampton, Ont., was planning to visit Kosha's birthplace in Kenya, said her brother, Manant Vaidya.

He said his 37-year-old sister hadn't visited Kenya for decades. Her daughters, 14-year-old Ashka and 13-year-old Anushka, were looking forward to going on a safari, he said.

The other family members on the trip were 45-year-old father Prerit Dixit, 71-year-old grandfather Pannagesh Vaidya and 63-year-old grandmother Hansini Vaidya.

Manant said his parents were from Gujarat, India, but they lived in Kenya for three or four years. The family later returned to India. Kosha moved to Ontario in 2004 after marrying her husband, who already lived in Canada.

The girls were strong students and enrolled in specialized science and technology courses, Manant said. Ashka was also known for her singing voice, while Anushka was talented in dance and was learning a traditional Indian form called khattak.

(CSE: TOKI; OTC PINK:TRKWF)(the ""Company"" or""TOK"")is pleased to announce that the Company has entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement) with Northern Green Canada Inc. (NGC), a licensed producer, to create a Strategic Alliance to serve the Medical Cannabis sector in Canada , with a longer term view to market expansion into the US and international markets through collaborating partnerships.

Northern Green Canada is a private, federally licensed cannabis producer based in Ontario , focused on providing high quality, pharmaceutical grade products for enhanced quality of life. NGC was founded by a drive to create a company dedicated to helping others through the responsible use and innovation of medical cannabis. They operate out of their 90,000 square foot location in Brampton, Ontario , equipped with state-of-the-art cultivation facilities. NGC is currently selling flower and is in the process of having its license amended to include oils. In addition to an expert grow team, NGC management includes medical doctors and pharmaceutical personnel. NGC is aligned with respected partners to develop cannabis-infused edibles and drinks to broaden its product portfolio as legislation permits.

Dr. Kevin Rod , Medical Advisory to TOK, commented: We were extremely impressed with NGCs facilities and its commitment to excellence. NGC shares TOKs passion for Opioid reduction and is currently involved in its own 2 year study. We see real synergies between the focus and goals of NGC and TOKs own research initiatives and proprietary Opioid reduction program MCORP (Medical Cannabis Opioid Reduction Program).

The Letter Agreement provides for the companies to work together on three strategic pillars to broaden their collective footprint in the Canadian Medical Cannabis market: (1) Medical Cannabis Research and Education; (2) Product Development and (3) Servicing of Medical Cannabis Patients. Subject to completion of due diligence, the Letter Agreement contemplates the parties entering into one or more agreements on or before March 29, 2019 , to achieve the following objectives:

The development of formulations by TOK and the licensing of those formulations along with TOKs proprietary delivery system (its AMP dosing system);

The cultivation, manufacturing and processing of the formulations created by TOK by NGC and the corresponding distribution in Canada by NGC to its regulated clients as set out in theCannabis Regulations;

Development of joint education materials and programs for Health Care Providers about the uses and benefits of cannabis;

Assistance from TOK with the registration of clients with NGC for the supply of medical cannabis, as permitted by law;

The provision of office space by NGC to TOK in its facility for TOK staff to be onsite and participate in the planning and production processes to be conducted by NGC under the agreements; and

NGC using its existing partner networks to assess the expansion of distribution beyond Canada to the US and International markets.

As consideration for the respective obligations of the parties and in order to align their respective interests, the Definitive Agreement will include the issuance of 10,000,000 common shares by TOK to NGC and the issuance of a 5% equity stake in NGC to TOK (subject to a valuation to be done for NGC).

The Letter Agreement with Northern Green Canada builds on TOKs commitment to deliver access to the highest quality care with its agreement with Pancare Consulting Inc. and Onsite Medical Group for the operation of a multi-specialty pain management facility located within the new Jack Nathan HealthMedical Centre launched March 7, 2019 at the Walmart store in Vaughan, Ontario (see Press Release March 5, 2019 ).

One of the greatest opportunities for Canada is the shift toward clean growth. Energy efficiency boosts competitiveness, lowers costs, maximizes profits and helps protect our environment. Promoting and rewarding energy-efficient practices are key components of Canada’s approach to a clean energy future.

Member of Parliament for South Surrey–White Rock, Gordie Hogg, on behalf of Canada's Minister of Natural Resources, the Honourable Amarjeet Sohi, today announced a $600,000 investment for the Pembina Institute to support two energy efficiency retrofit projects. These projects will lower energy costs, reduce pollution and support future energy efficiency retrofits in other Canadian municipalities.

Through the Energy Efficiency Program, our government invested $200,000 to develop a pilot program for energy retrofits of B.C.’s social housing stock. In partnership with the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association and the City of Vancouver, the Affordable Housing Renewal Pilot Program will retrofit up to five social housing complexes on the Lower Mainland.

Upon completion of the pilot project, the remaining $400,000 will go toward five to eight additional municipalities across Canada that are looking to develop strategies to retrofit their multi-unit residential building stock.

Retrofitting homes and buildings to make them more energy-efficient lowers costs, reduces maintenance requirements, creates a more pleasant living environment and increases the value of the home or building, all while reducing environmental footprints.

Energy-efficient buildings are part of Canada’s Investing in Canadainfrastructure plan, through which our government is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes and Canada’s rural and northern communities.

Through Generation Energy, Canada's national energy dialogue, Canadians expressed that they want to see Canada continuing to be a leader in the transition to a clean growth economy. Canada will continue to support innovative projects that create jobs, improve industry competitiveness, cut pollution and help address climate change.

329,ScienceAndTechnology,2019-03-14T08:00:00.0000000Z,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a visit to the ... tech companies are looking to be able to say that not only are they manufacturing (using) green power but the products themselves are low carbon in the emissions in the manufacturing.,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a visit to the annual convention of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) in Toronto on March 5, 2019, for a sit-in interview conducted by outgoing PDAC president Glenn Mullan.

Below is a full transcript of the 20-minute interview, edited for clarity. Topics that Trudeau and Mullan discussed included technological innovation, sustainable mining practices, federal regulatory changes and reconciliation efforts with Canada’s First Nations.

Glenn Mullan: We’re so much looking forward to the fireside chat without a fire. And we have a couple of topics that we thought would be agreeable for discussion, including Canada’s competitiveness, indigenous affairs and some of the regulatory things that we’re working on in collaboration with your government in particular.

There’s a lot of people that work in the mining industry in Canada — about 630,000 that come from every province, every territory, every community in Canada. And so competitiveness is a key part of our industry and we face challenges from a broad range of sources, some domestic — cannabis, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain — and international — Australia and many other countries that compete with us.

But one of the things that we were thrilled to see this year was the renewal of the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit for five years. Before, each year we met the renewal with relief more than enthusiasm since 2000?

Justin Trudeau: Eighteen straight one-year renewals.

GM: That means at one point you’ve got to say, “Okay. This is a good thing, let’s do it for five years.” And that’s what we did in the fall. And maybe you could explain a little bit about why your government thought it was important to the minerals industry and mining exploration in particular.

JT: Well, it’s more than just the minerals industry and mining, it’s about industry in general. It’s about businesses and commercial outfits who are doing more and more long-term planning as we want them to be. You’re making capital investments, you’re looking for the long-term. A mine isn’t something you can open and close in six months. Obviously, you’re looking over a longer period of time. Five years is, for me, giving a bit more stability and predictability and drawing in investors and building the partnerships and planning for your horizon.

What we want as a country is to demonstrate that Canada is a good place to invest, a good partner to have in your business, and that means listening to your concerns and responding to them and that’s where we’re giving more predictability on the METC, where we’re highlighting the stability that comes with the trade deals we’ve signed.

You’re obviously an international industry with operations around the world and in Canada that is exporting around the world.

The fact that Canada is now the only G7 country with a free trade deal with every other G7 country — we obviously have access to the United States, we have access to Europe, we have access to the growing economies of Asia. We are extremely well positioned as a country to continue to engage in the global economy and making sure we’re competitive within that is really important.

So, the METC for five years is a piece of it.

The accelerated capital cost allowance as well that allows you to write off capital investments in machinery and equipment a lot more quickly is the kind of things that we’re doing to incentivize you to invest in Canada and to know that we are your partners right now and for the long term.

GM: And met with such enthusiasm by our members and delegates in the aftermath. When you ask for three years and you get five, you can only be happy. So, thank you.

The new norm in the world economy is one of cycles, pressures, challenges, and competition. That’s no more true than in the minerals and minerals exploration industry. Commodities go up, commodities go down. We all check gold prices, we members in this room check gold prices, nickel, copper.

JT: I was asked about the price of gold on my way into the conference. “Prime Minister, any predictions on the price of gold?”

I’m like, “I’m not going anywhere near that question.”

But yeah, I can see it’s a concern. It was about US$1,288.50 an ounce. There’s a 50% chance it will go up.

GM: But the mining industry is such a key contributor to Canada’s economy. So, 5% of GDP which is actually a huge number in dollars, it’s about 90 billion Canadian dollars — in fact, a little more. About 20% of Canada’s domestic exports and a huge key contributor to royalties and taxes.

Not too many industries brag about the taxes they pay, but we do.

The mining industry is a key creator of jobs, and that’s especially true in Canada’s north and in the remote regions.

On the topic of competitiveness, what can Canada’s mineral industry do with your government to continue enhancing our role?

JT: Well, I think as in general across all different fields of the economy, people are understanding we’re in a time of change right now of transformation of new technologies, of global supply chains and everyone is trying to adjust to the new realities.

The pace of change accelerating so much over these past years that what we try to do as a country and what you certainly are doing as an industry is look where things are going. Go to where the puck is going to be, not where the puck is.

You know that the investments in innovation, in research, in science, in partnerships with indigenous people are all things that are going to stabilize and give you opportunities to be more competitive in the coming years.

It’s interesting because when we think about Canada and Canada’s economy in a historical context, we often go back to, “Oh, we used to be hewers of wood and drawers of water and now we’re investing in the knowledge economy and AI and robotics.”

But anyone who tries to make a distinction between the resource sector and the knowledge economy is completely missing the boat on what the resource sector in Canada is actually doing.

The level of innovation, the level of research you are doing, the level of investigation and innovation in terms of robotics to go deeper and further, using AI to be more successful in remote locations — that’s where the industry is going and these are ways that Canada is investing.

I made a big announcement last week on AI and robotics in regards to our space program, but that applies across many industries where you are innovating for the future.

At the same time, what you’re doing is also very much a part of the new economy. We can’t talk about electric cars without recognizing that there’s way more copper wiring in an electric car than in a traditional car. We know solar panels require all sorts of different minerals, a number of which are available and developed in Canada. We know that the kinds of innovations that are coming down the pipe are going to require more and more high-quality processes, productions, and products.

And this industry in a stable country like Canada which is stable politically, geographically, socially, economically, fiscally is a sound investment particularly because you can count on Canadians to be hardworking, innovative, ambitious, creative, and drive success for your industry and your investors.

GM: Thank you, Prime Minister. And you are certainly a great promoter of our industry as we’ve just heard, and you actually used a hockey metaphor in there.

JT: I know you’re a Habs fan, Glenn. So, we’re gonna bond on that one, even here in Toronto. There you go.

GM: And thank you for that. I was actually supposed to open by asserting that the PDAC is more or less our Stanley Cup, but without Connor McDavid or Sidney Crosby.

JT: There are far too many Canadians right now who’ve done well in the PDAC as opposed to at the Stanley Cup, but we’re gonna turn that around this year with a number of good teams.

GM: I hope that to be true. I’d like to move to a completely different topic now and one that I think is important to everyone in this room and was part of our opening from PDAC executive director Lisa McDonald when she paid tribute to the Credit First Nation.

So, the topic is indigenous partnerships and the way that the minerals industry in particular engages with northern communities, communities of Aboriginal people, not just in Canada but outside. But, in particular, in Canada where there’s over 500 such partnerships that we formed with communities and companies. Most have been done in the last 10 years.

I’d like to get your thoughts on the way that the mining industry engages with Aboriginal people in indigenous communities.

JT: First of all, we’ve seen over the past few years that Canadians care deeply, non-indigenous Canadians care deeply about reconciliation.

We can’t be the country we like to pretend we are on the world stage standing up for human rights, standing up for equality and opportunity and partnership and all the good things if we don’t transform for the better, the relationship that has been broken for far too many generations and indeed centuries with indigenous peoples, with the first peoples on our land.

So, in the 2015 election, Canadians asked our government very clearly to move forward in partnership and in reconciliation with indigenous peoples.

And the government hadn’t done a very good job over the past years of creating those partnerships.

But you know who had in many cases? The mining industry.

You all have been at the forefront of partnerships, of co-operation, of working together with indigenous peoples. Just by dint of being so present in remote areas of Canada, you’ve developed an ability to do that that has led to 16,000 indigenous peoples working in your industry which is among the top employers of indigenous Canadians across the country.

You’ve also developed and worked with them. So, it’s not just direct jobs, it’s supply chain jobs, it’s services that your mines require that are being delivered by indigenous-owned and operated companies and businesses in the area.

Increasingly, we’re moving towards, and you’re leading the way, on thinking about partnerships that go deeper than just service agreements but equity partnerships, partnerships on resource, development and sharing the kinds of things that is recognizing indigenous peoples as the original caretakers and stewards of this land. Those kinds of reflections.

There’s still more work to be done on that and, of course, the government will have an important role in making sure that we remain competitive, that we remain positive but that people who have been stewards of this land for a long time will be able to fully benefit in the economic output of that land.

These are the kinds of things that you will have already and consistently led on and we want to continue to work with you on them.

GM: Thank you, Prime Minister. I think the mining industry is pretty well disposed for this conversation in another respect as well.

Most mining companies are based in major urban centres in Canada: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, etc. But the mines, the operations are very much located in regions, remote areas which are connected to Aboriginal communities for the most part.

That’s true in the territories, it’s true in the provinces. I’ve been fortunate to spend a lot of my own experience in Nunavik, Quebec, in the very far north, 1,728 kilometres north of Montreal. And the Inuit in that particular part of Quebec are brilliant partners, collaborative partners, and very progressive to work with.

Where do you see room for improvement across the spectrum of minerals industry development in Canada’s north, in particular?

JT: I think better is always possible. And as you engage in thoughtful ways and look to create deeper and deeper partnerships that go beyond just, say, employer-employee relationship to be more partners in the development as you have more and more indigenous leaders and professionals engaging in this industry, I think that’s a logical step.

One of the pieces of it though is part of recognizing what this industry knows well, is that the way to get projects built now, whether it’s a mine or any sort of resource project, is to do it thoughtfully in partnership with the local communities and local voices.

That’s increasingly true everywhere around the world. There still are some places that try to ram things through and barrel through but they’re getting more and more resistance on the ground and they’re getting more and more questions from consumers as to what went into this product that I’m buying and how is it good for the planet or bad for the planet on multiple, different levels.

That’s something that we’ve recognized as a government, that the only way to get big things built is to do it in respect of science and in partnership with communities — particularly indigenous communities.

That’s something that we are moving forward with as a key part of our new regulatory frame on Bill C-69.

Quite frankly, the number of thoughtful submissions and amendments to that to improve it (came) from this industry. The measured support for what we’re trying to do is really appreciated because we know that government can’t just decree that something will be built there anymore in the absence of partnerships consultations, and rigorous processes. And that’s exactly what you’ve understood.

So, we’re moving forward with C-69 in a way that, first of all, takes care of the doubling impact. You no longer will have to go through separate processes that overlap at the provincial and the federal level. There’ll be one project, one assessment for one project, which is something I know the industry has asked for a long time.

One of the other things in Bill C-69 is we’re moving forward on something that is already best practices in many parts of your industry, which is doing early assessments, early engagement, that will look at the viability or the challenges around a project before you’ve sunk too much time and energy into it — early consultations and working with communities to be able to highlight and flag some of the challenges you’re liable to run into later in the development process but also give you clarity and investors clarity from early on.

And finally, the fact that it’s now a one-stop shop at the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency that you don’t have to run around answering random questions from eight different departments across government is going to be a significant improvement.

But there’s a lot of things that we’re doing to give you, as investors and as operators, the kind of certainty and clarity that you need when you’re moving forward and that’s a big piece of the future of this industry as well.

GM: Thank you, Prime Minister. I think many of our members recognize that we’re being heard by your government in a way that we perhaps weren’t used to. Bill C-69 is certainly a good manifestation of that and the METC as well.

I do want to go back for a moment to reconciliation because I think that’s an area that most of our members, most Canadians, most of the earth scientists and geologists that work within our industry are all too familiar.

There is an economic disconnect in northern Canada, in particular, between Aboriginal communities and southern Canada.

The mining industry has been working very hard to try to build bridges where there weren’t any before. That’s also true in parts of Canada where there’s very little infrastructure.

Mining companies bring infrastructure. And reconciliation, like diversity, can mean many different things, but reconciliation means much more to the mining industry than saying, “I’m sorry.”

It’s about building partnerships, building capacity, building improved infrastructure, healthcare, and housing in most of those northern communities.

What does your government see as its role with our industry and in enhancing reconciliation?

JT: We recognize that infrastructure investments in remote parts of the country in the north are essential for those communities to thrive. And there’s a lot of discussion of northern sovereignty over the recent years with climate change making Canada’s north and the Arctic more accessible to shipping and exploration.

Sovereignty in the north and in remote areas has always passed, not through who plants a flag or who has stationed scientists or even military, it happens of the people who’ve lived there for millennia. And supporting those communities with good schools, good roads, good jobs, good opportunities is key to actually being the country that we want to be where everyone has a real and fair chance to succeed regardless of where you are.

A big part of creating that sense of success and resilience within a community comes through jobs. And you can’t have a government determined that this community is going to thrive and take care of just pumping in money. You need economic activity around that, and the natural resource sector is a natural place where we actually draw the value from the minerals from the land that is there.

But if we’re going to do it, we have to recognize that for far too many generations, it was done without the consent, without the participation, without any benefits flowing to the people who had known this land and lived on this land from time immemorial.

What we look at now is recognizing that people want to be successful, they want to have agency over their communities and their success. And that happens in positive partnership with smart investors who are being responsible.

Now, there are always bonds of trust that need to be built and there have been examples of broken trust in the past that (we) are going to need to get beyond.

But the more the industry itself engages in a thoughtful, positive way with indigenous peoples and communities as partners who want the same thing, want to draw value from the land and have positive benefit on communities and on the world, then you will find that there are strong alliances and strong stability in future coming.

And I know that, because I’ve seen it many, many times — many examples of big companies and junior companies that are doing the right kinds of things that are win-win-wins across the board.

GM: Thank you, Prime Minister. I don’t think we can really talk about northern Canada and the remote regions without also talking about the environment and sustainability at the same time. And certainly with the PDAC, respect for land, access to land, responsible exploration are very dominant themes.

I’d like to get your thoughts on ways that the minerals industry can continue to work with your government to address and enhance sustainability in a low carbon future environment.

JT: A big piece of it is the innovation you’ve always invested in. As you’re looking for ways to lower your costs, inevitably, you’re also looking to waste less, to pollute less.

We know that is a big driver of costs in many situations, particularly in remote areas.

And our customers, clients, and partners around the world are expecting, particularly from Canada, high levels of rigour in terms of what you are doing is not negatively impacting on future generations…

So, the kinds of research and innovation you’re doing — a great example is what the aluminum industry came together to do Elysis, where Rio Tinto and the big companies came together to actually develop a new process that doesn’t emit any greenhouse gases, that is zero carbon in terms of creating high-quality aluminum.

Those are the kinds of innovations that people can be confident in, because we know more and more high tech companies are looking to be able to say that not only are they manufacturing (using) green power but the products themselves are low carbon in the emissions in the manufacturing.

So, zero carbon aluminum, for example, is going to be more and more of a value added to the products that people buy around the world.

As we look at ways of enhancing consumer choices in ways that protect our environment, that recognize the longer term impacts of what we’re doing, we actually create better value and are including the kinds of consequences and extra analogies that future generations otherwise might have been paying for.

People are looking for responsibility and I think the mining industry, like many industries, has been really, really thoughtful about saying, “Okay. Yes. We need to mine, we need to develop our minerals, we need more copper and rare earth minerals for the electronics we have today.”

But you can’t put a mine anywhere and when you’re putting a mine in a delicate watershed or a particular protected area, you might have to do more to protect it.

There is a bigger context that you have to be thoughtful about. And I think what citizens expect, what Canadians know is, you can’t separate what’s good for the environment and what’s good for the economy. You have to do them both together now, we have to create the jobs that the economic growth, the opportunities for future generations.

At the same time as you are not damaging the future of those next generations in terms of the air they breathe and the water they drink. That’s what all Canadians expect, that’s what increasingly people around the world expect.

The more we can think about and innovate in ways that are reaching that, the better off, the more competitive you will be as an industry.

That’s one of the reasons why as a country we’ve made decisions that are making things clearer for you in terms of long-term decisions we make.

We’re putting a price on pollution, for example. Where it’s no longer free to pollute, you will be incentivized as I know you will be to invest in cleaner technologies and to make longer-term investments knowing that if you don’t, your prices are going to rise in a way that is undesirable.

That’s how putting a price on pollution actually helps your industry in the long term because we know that the world is going that way, and the more we can do to create a context in Canada in which we’re not just participating in that, but we’re actually leading the way in developing these solutions around the world, then we know that we’re on the right track.

GM: Thank you, Prime Minister. And lithium, cobalt, and nickel, all come from the products of our industry. I can tell that I’m already getting signals from different sources, so I’d like to thank you for your attendance at our PDAC 2019 Convention, Prime Minister. And I look forward to continuing our collaborative discussions.

JT: Thank you very much, Glenn. Thank you all for the great work you all do.

REGINA – The NHL’s outdoor game in Regina may be a home game for the Winnipeg Jets, but the Calgary Flames are staking a claim to it.

The NHL lauded all things Saskatchewan at Friday’s news conference launching its marketing campaign for the 2019 Heritage Classic on Oct. 26 at Mosaic Stadium.

A non-NHL or “neutral” city will be the host of the Heritage Classic for the first time.

The Jets will be the home team in the regular-season game, but the Flames emphasized the franchise’s Saskatchewan connections including ownership group chair Murray Edwards, who hails from Regina.

Late owners Daryl “Doc” Seaman was from Rouleau, just south of Regina, and John “Bud” McCaig was born in Moose Jaw.

President, chief operating officer and Saskatoon product John Bean pointed to the number of the province’s expats who live in Calgary and show up to CFL games there en masse wearing green and white.

“Notwithstanding we are the visiting team for this game, we are without hesitation considering the 2019 Tim Hortons NHL Heritage Classic, a home game for the Calgary Flames,” Bean declared to assembled media in Regina.

“In this age of political correctness, we loyal Saskatchewan transplants like to say when it comes to sports in Calgary, we are red on the outside and green on the inside.

“For one night only, we hope to have a sea of red in Regina. We all know we’re still green on the inside.”

The NHL also marked Saskatchewan as its territory extolling the 514 men from the province who have played in the league.

Seventeen are Hockey Hall of Fame inductees, including Gordie Howe, Sid Abel, Clark Gillies and Bryan Trottier.

“Here in Saskatchewan, a province with a relatively small population, there are a remarkable number of great NHLers that have gone before us,” NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said.

“True hockey greatness has been passed down from generation to generation here.”

Regina-born players currently in the NHL include Anaheim Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf, Jordan Eberle of the New York Islanders, Chicago Blackhawks forward Chris Kunitz, Minnesota Wild goaltender Devan Dubnyk and Wild defenceman Mathew Dumba.

Daly projected the league’s 28th outdoor game and the fifth Heritage Classic will be seen by 1.5 million people.

Mosaic Stadium, owned by the city and operated by the Regina Exhibition Association, replaced 69-year-old Taylor Field as the home of the CFL’s Roughriders in 2017.

Regina is the host city of the 2020 Grey Cup after Calgary stages this year’s CFL’s championship game in November.

Winnipeg’s Investors Group Field was the site of the 2016 Heritage Classic, which the visiting Edmonton Oilers won 3-0 in front of 33,000.

“It was really in my view a tipping point for our organization,” True North Sports and Entertainment chair Mark Chipman said.

“It allowed us to re-connect to the history of the Winnipeg Jets for the first time and re-establish our alumni which is really strong and thriving now.

“It was a meaningful crossroads for us to be able to present the game in Winnipeg on the world stage and show the hockey world how vibrant hockey is in the prairies.”

Calgary held the 2011 Heritage Classic at McMahon Stadium, where the Flames shut out the Montreal Canadiens 4-0 in front of 41,000.

Current captain Mark Giordano and centre Mikael Backlund played in that game.

Our planet is fucked. We have 12 years to limit climate change before irreparable damage sets in, according to the authors of a sobering 2018 report commissioned by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If we don’t keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius, extreme and devastating weather will worsen. We’ve seen the signs: California’s largest wildfire ravaged the state last year; deadly heat waves are becoming more frequent across the world; and hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods are happening with more power and frequency.

The apocalyptic future climate scientists warn us about is avoidable, but significant changes to our everyday lives must be made. It would be easy for the Environmental Film Festival to program a bunch of films designed to scare you into living a more sustainable life. But this festival—now in its 27th year—is too smart for that. Instead, this collection includes more than 100 films from all over the world that portray how beautiful, precious, and remarkable our planet is, and the dangers it faces—from the threat of extinction of sharks to one Japanese family’s 100-year-old oyster farm.

At a time when global tensions are increasingly taut and agenda-setting governing bodies manipulate our fear and anxiety, the Environmental Film Festival doesn’t take a scared-straight approach to sharing its message. It instead aims to inspire. Because Earth is pretty damn awe-inspiring—and these films show that. —Matt Cohen





The River and the Wall

Directed by Ben Masters

U.S.

The Rio Grande stretches along the Texas/Mexico border from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico. There are parts where you cannot see the river because of the border wall already in place. This is one of the many simple, practical details in The River and the Wall, a political documentary that doubles as a travelogue of the Texas border. By focusing on the physical realities/challenges of the river, not presidential rhetoric, the filmmakers make a practical case for why the wall is a bad idea.

Director Ben Masters, along with a team of guides and scientists, decides to make sense of the river by traveling its entire length. They start in El Paso on bicycles, switching to horseback, and eventually settle on canoes. Throughout the journey, the team thinks about what the river offers the surrounding area, and how a wall would get in the way of its many benefits. There is abundant biodiversity along the river, for example, with many animals crossing it without much thought about the country on either side. They also speak to locals and politicians about the wall, including Beto O’Rourke, and while many of them want border security, none want a wall.

If The River and the Wall runs the risk of being too repetitive, Masters breaks up the argument with a sense of adventure. There are some stretches where the film unfolds like a Western, like when everyone hops on horses the first time. This also leads to throwaway comedy, since the team falls into Western archetypes, and one has to be the comic relief. The River and the Wall probably won’t change any minds, but it offers an engaging, effective point of view on what Trump’s bullshit ideas would functionally mean. —Alan Zilberman

The Fisherman and the Forest

Produced by NHK World-Japan

Japan

Shigeatsu Hatakeyama can see himself in his grandson. The pair explore nature together in Kesennuma in Japan’s Miyagi Prefecture so Hatakeyama can pass on his love of all living things. Culturally, their adventures feel like a father-and-son fishing trip, but instead of discussing the birds and the bees, Hatakeyama is passing on wisdom about the forest and the sea. If his grandson takes over his oyster farm, Hatakeyama calculates that his family business will be a century old.

Hatakeyama’s oysters aren’t anything like the bivalves from the Mid-Atlantic or New England that Americans slurp. The shells stretch on inch after inch and the oysters inside approach the size of tight fists. The perfect specimens are a reward of sorts for the love that Hatakeyama puts into caring for Mone Bay where he makes his home.

In 1964, the nearby Kesennuma Bay was at its worst. It became polluted as a result of Japan’s rapid economic growth in the aftermath of World War II. Hatakeyama remembers the year because it was also when Tokyo hosted the Olympics. The bay was swarming with red tide. Hatakeyama was determined to restore the bay to its original splendor and tapped a professor from Hokkaido to be his research partner. Together they learned that the sea and the forest are intrinsically linked.

“They’re locked in an eternal embrace,” Hatakeyama says. “The forest is the sea’s lover.” That’s because the forest produces phytoplankton that are vital to underwater ecosystems. Hatakeyama’s research proved critical again following the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011. After the disaster, 25,949 people were reported dead or missing, including Hatakeyama’s mother. For a movie principally about phytoplankton, The Fisherman and the Forest imparts an appreciation for the planet’s fragile symbiotic relationships as well as the Japanese culture of mastery. —Laura Hayes

When Lambs Become Lions

Directed by Jon Kasbe

U.S.

Following the success of animal wildlife docs like The Cove, Blackfish, and Trophy, When Lambs Become Lions arrives with the most titillating scenario. It is a crime drama examining the ivory trade in Kenya through the lives of two men on opposite sides of the law: Asan, a National Reserve Game Ranger who uses brutal tactics to discourage poaching, and the anonymous “X”, who manages an illegal and dangerous poaching operation.

Instead of choosing sides, it seeks commonalities. Viewers who love animals will want the poacher demonized and the ranger praised, but instead director Jon Kasbe sees them as brothers who have chosen different paths out of the same problem. Both are stricken with poverty, must risk their lives in a dangerous vocation to feed their families, and are traumatized by the trade. “Out here we are all hunters,” says Asan, and the film at its best examines the broken culture that has forced decent men to find dignity on either side of a monstrous situation.

It’s an irresistible hook, so why does so much of When Lambs Become Lions feel inert? Much like a military operation, there is a lot of waiting around before a sudden burst of action. As X’s team embarks on a hunt in the final minutes, there is finally some real tension—as well as a revelatory kicker—but with its brief 80-minute runtime, it shouldn’t drag so much. All the elements are there for a thrilling wildlife documentary with a strong human component, but a crime drama needs an actual crime. —Noah Gittell

Into the Canyon

Directed by Peter McBride

U.S.

You would expect the Environmental Film Festival to offer its fair share of dispatches from the eternal battle between man and nature. But if one of the perils of the documentary format is the tendency of a director to make themselves part of the story, that goes double for nature docs. Such is the conflict in this celebration of nature as a buddy movie travelogue. Photographer Pete McBride, who directed, documented his journey with Kevin Fedarko, who teamed up (with the help of seasoned guides) to make a 750-mile hike across the length of the Grand Canyon. Unfortunately, the end product is less about a natural wonder than about the friends they made along the way.

The movie is best when McBride turns the camera away from his team to document various crises that threaten the national park, from Navajo land endangered by developers to uranium mines that contaminate ground water to a thriving industry of helicopter tours whose constant whirring has turned the region’s peaceful vistas into a noisy tourist trap. Only when McBride just lets you see the “river of stars” and bask in its majesty does he truly let you... into the Canyon. —Pat Padua

Wildland

Directed by Kahlil Hudson and Alex Jablonski

U.S.

The world watched in horror last year as Camp Fire—the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California’s history—laid waste to 1,893,913 acres of the state. It would have been far worse without the tireless efforts of hundreds of wildland firefighters, who put their lives on the line to control the flames. Kahlil Hudson and Alex Jablonski’s meditative documentary, Wildland, chronicles a single firefighting crew—from the day of their first interview to become firefighters to their training to the moment they’re shipped out to the frontlines of a raging wildfire in California.

The cinematography of Wildland is gorgeous. The sweeping, slow-motion shots of the Oregon wilderness and the scorched earth California vistas are haunting, and give the film a poetic quality. But as far as documentaries go, Wildland falls flat when it tries to get viewers to engage with its subjects. Each of the people they profile has their own reasons for wanting to become a firefighter—from a young kid from Maine who’s looking for adventure to returning citizens and former addicts on the road of recovery—but the film’s lyrical nature doesn’t really allow you to connect with them. They’re presented more like characters floating in and out of the narrative than people whose lives you’re invested in. —Matt Cohen

Meow Wolf: Origin Story

Directed by Jilann Spitzmiller and Morgan Capps

U.S.

A recurring festival theme is one of an environment contaminated—by nuclear power, uranium mining, garbage. But can the environment be contaminated by art? That is the inadvertent lesson of this feature-length infomercial about the art collective Meow Wolf, who has set its sights on D.C. The group began as a response to the commercial art gallery scene in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which one Meow Wolf co-founder lambasts as “a bunch of marketing bullshit”—a complaint that becomes awfully prescient. A group of friends got together and rented cheap abandoned real estate for what amounted to a more intense version of Artomatic. The early days of Meow Wolf were anarchic and, as its members boast, “radically inclusive”—which leads one to ask why, then, does it seem like everybody involved is white?

But as the projects grew and began to make money, Meow Wolf needed structure, and this pull between chaos and order may well be a metaphor for man and the environment. While the installations are cool enough, Origin Story feels like hagiography; nobody questions their motives and priorities, such as convincing Game of Thrones author and Santa Fe resident George R.R. Martin to donate more than a million bucks to convert an abandoned bowling alley into a dazzling playground. (Doesn’t anybody need affordable housing in Santa Fe?) Still, directors Jilann Spitzmiller and Morgan Capps aren’t afraid to reveal what really drives these one-time DIY pioneers; by the end of the movie, Meow Wolf CEO Vince Kadlubek freely admits he wants to turn it into a billion- dollar corporation. Yay environment! —Pat Padua

Return to Mount Kennedy

Directed by Eric Becker

U.S.

After President John F. Kennedy’s death, the Canadian government honored him by naming a previously unclimbed mountain in his honor. In 1965, Robert Kennedy, with mountaineer Jim Whittaker, ascended the mountain for the first time. Return to Mount Kennedy is not about that specific journey, but an identical one undertaken 50 years later by Whittaker and Kennedy’s sons.

Bob Whittaker, Jim’s son, is a strange guy. Before life as conservationist, he was a tour manager for rock bands like Mudhoney, R.E.M., and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. He had a hard-partying lifestyle, which is why his desire to climb the mountain represents such a growth in character. Director Eric Becker makes no attempt to stay objective with this material: He feels like he’s pals with his subjects and talking heads, including Eddie Vedder, so the film has the polish and charm of well edited home movie.

Unlike most environmental films that focus on a specific issue, Return to Mount Kennedy is a look at how adventure and family can dovetail with conservation efforts. The Whittakers and the Kennedys found the outdoors as the source of their friendship, and their desire to honor the mountain highlights the rugged, austere beauty that only the natural world can provide. Mountains are one of the few things that will stick around long after we are gone, so making sense of their permanence is a way to reflect on the past, and what we owe our future generations. —Alan Zilberman

Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda

Directed by Stephen Nomura Schible

U.S., Japan

Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto came to fame in the 1970s with synth-pop pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra, and won an Oscar for the score to Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1987 film The Last Emperor. But in 2014, a cancer diagnosis led the electronic music legend to appreciate the sounds of nature more than ever.

Director Stephen Nomura Schible’s 2017 profile charts his subject’s passion, not just for music but for the environment (Sakamoto is a longtime opponent of nuclear power). Coda immerses us in a creative process that doesn’t always begin at the keyboard. Inspired by Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris, Sakamoto finds music in the sound of rain falling, and has even travelled to the Arctic to record the sound of melting snow. He makes haunting music out of a grand piano that was washed away by the massive tsunami that caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Musing over the decay rate of a single piano note that quickly fades, Sakamoto suggests that a perpetual music machine would be a metaphor for eternity.

But as we see vintage footage of the younger composer with jet-black hair, the artist’s now-white hair and grizzled face make one wonder about the very purpose of decay—and if the piano’s decay rate is no less than a metaphor for mortality. —Pat Padua

Silent Forests

Directed by Mariah Wilson

U.S.

The issue of ivory poaching gets a second perspective at the festival in Silent Forests, a feel-good story about a wide array of activists working to end the criminal practice. The film by Mariah Wilson is a lyrical nature documentary and a powerful issue movie at once. It profiles a female eco-guard in Cameroon who speaks of the “joy in [her] heart” when she sees an elephant; a Czech activist training puppies to sniff out ivory and other protected species; and a former poacher who has given up his life of crime to run a cocoa farm with his family, and nows speaks out against his former trade.

These are stories determinedly designed to inspire, but the hopefulness never feels contrived. Wisely, the filmmakers let the beauty of nature speak its own message. There is an unforgettable sequence halfway through in which a family of elephants emerges under the cover of night to drink from a river. The group includes a juvenile still young enough to nurse from its mother. Other films would create tension and force us to fear for their safety, but Silent Forests gives us the space to open our hearts and let our compassion out. Instead of trying to shock us into action, it organizes its story around the principles of love, family, and community. —Noah Gittell

Harvest Season

Directed by Bernardo Ruiz

Mexico

“All winemakers should be able to offer something about the grape that is hidden,” says one of the principles of Harvest Season, a documentary that examines the vineyards of Napa Valley through the prism of the Latinx experience. Such wisdom should also apply to documentarians, and while the film by Bernardo Ruiz offers its share of hidden stories, it is missing a consistency that would tie its flavors together.

Harvest Season shines a light on successful Hispanic winemakers, including a young female vintner who is proving herself in a male-dominated world. It also chronicles the journey of a Mexican laborer who comes to California for a summer of work, and tours the housing units he lives in set up by a coalition of vineyards. In the final third, it documents the crippling wildfires that destroyed more than 200,000 acres in 2017, and its tragic impact on the region and its inhabitants.

There are profound moments scattered throughout, such as the conversation between old-timers who recall having to sleep in the fields when they first arrived to work the land. I could have spent an hour with them, but the film moves on too quickly. Perhaps none of its subjects were quite compelling enough to stick with; the immigrant laborer seems like a sweet guy, but the smile never leaves his face, and the tale of hardship that the filmmakers were seeking never materializes. Something about Harvest Season feels unfinished, as if the product was bottled too soon, when it really needed time to breathe. —Noah Gittell

LOBSTER WAR: The Fight Over the World’s Richest Fishing Grounds

Directed by David Abel and Andy Laub

U.S.

When you think of border disputes your mind may not jump to the boundary between the United States and Canada, but that’s exactly where LOBSTER WAR brings us. Thanks to a quirk of history, both the U.S. and Canada claim a patch of sea in the Gulf of Maine. And thanks to climate change, this “gray zone” is now home to a record number of lobsters, leading lobstermen from both nations to the spot—and thus into conflict.

LOBSTER WAR takes a while to get started. Or rather, it gets started a bunch of times. The doc keeps hammering home the story’s stakes—both Americans and Canadians rely on the crustaceans caught in these contested seas—to the point that it gets redundant. Even if it’s slow going, the doc is full of beautiful shots of boats and the sea and morbidly engrossing footage of lobster butchering. The story picks up when we meet the communities for whom the gray zone is a daily reality.

Although the characters talk a lot about conflict, it doesn’t come across as particularly warlike. Fishermen recount things like cut lines, which may not mean much to land lubbers but amount to thousands of forfeited dollars to lobstermen, and thumbs lost to accidents caused by overcrowding—the impact of which should be obvious, even to non-seafaring folk.

The film ultimately pivots to climate change, noting that lobsters will likely disappear from these waters. What will happen to these communities then? it wonders. It’s a good question, but I’m more interested in the bit that comes before. As the globe continues to warm and ecosystems transform, people will increasingly be pushed against one another, struggling over scarce and valuable resources. The film gives us a glimpse of what’s to come, but the next war won’t be over lobster. —Will Warren

The Human Element

Directed by Matthew Testa

U.S.

Water, air, fire, earth—the four elements that comprise life on our planet. The Human Element adds one more to the list: people. “People are changing the other elements,” says nature photographer James Balog, the central talking head in this documentary. “At the same time, the elements are changing us.” Of course, he’s mostly talking about climate change, and visits places that have been particularly affected by it. There’s Tangier Island, Virginia, whose water levels are increasing so dramatically that one resident says, “We’re one storm away from becoming part of history.” Balog takes photos at a school in Denver that has a special program for students with asthma. And he embeds with a group of firefighters who are battling “megafires” in California, with one firefighter remarking on the unnaturalness of fires burning in 91 percent humidity: “You’re getting wet, but the fire’s still burning. It’s not something that’s supposed to happen.” The chapter that gets the least amount of attention is Earth, with Balog traveling to Pennsylvania coal mines and talking to his father about his grandfather’s mining death, as well as touching on how “our quest for coal has reshaped the landscape,” according to an expert. Throughout, one tenet rings clear, says Balog: “People are the only element that can choose to restore balance.” —Tricia Olszewski

This Mountain Life

Directed by Grant Baldwin

Canada

Before we see the mountains, we hear the wind. “75 percent of British Columbia, Canada, is mountains,” reads the film’s opening text, as the sound of snowy gales builds in the background. “Few people truly experience them.” The purpose of This Mountain Life—a documentary by director, cinematographer, and editor Grant Baldwin—is to amend that last claim, immersing us within shot after transcendent shot of the immense elevations that reign over Canada’s horizon. We follow Martina Halik and her 60-year-old mother Tania as they attempt a six-month, 2,300 kilometer journey from Canada to Alaska, the narrative diverting at points to introduce us to a handful of compellingly offbeat characters who live on the precipice. From the halcyon convent nestled within a valley to the perils of an avalanche, This Mountain Life is a breathtaking ode to nature’s most sublime metaphor.

Gorgeous visuals are this film’s bread and butter, but Baldwin is wise to pair aerial views with gritty handheld camera footage that archives the sometimes bitter struggle that occurs when people and nature converge to meet each other in hostile environments. Still, This Mountain Life feels like going to church, especially when the alpinists and artists who give the landscape voice are so eloquent, so philosophical about their communion. Mountains are “a return, a well-spring, or fountainhead;” places where men “can become heroes.” In one particularly heavenly shot, a nun paraphrases T.S. Eliot as she spins pottery in slow motion. “At the still point of the turning world, there the dance is,” she says. “If there was no still point, there’d be no dance.” The mountains are one of the grandest still points of life, this film seems to say. To experience them as such for 77 minutes is a wonder. —Amy Guay

The Most Unknown

Directed by Ian Cheney

U.S.

Somewhere in The Most Unknown, a great idea got lost. Opening text says that Ian Cheney’s film is an “experiment,” documenting nine scientists as they meet in pairs around the world and discuss their disciplines. The setting hops from Italy to Brussels to Nevada and beyond, with big questions such as “What is consciousness?” asked at each stop while the scholars try to explain their studies and methodologies to whomever they’re paired with. A word that seems to pop up more often than most is “cool,” with each researcher geeking out, particularly when in the role of student. As one says, “That’s what we’re trying to do with the brains we have, to try to understand our place in the universe.” This curiosity is the cornerstone of The Most Unknown, but it doesn’t succeed in making it compelling. The problem is that, although the topics themselves are interesting, it’s obviously impossible for anyone to go into much depth in a 92-minute film, resulting in generalities that hardly enlighten—and, ultimately, elicit a big “so what?” —Tricia Olszewski

The Green Lie

Directed by Werner Boote

Austria

Werner Boote just wants to eat his M&Ms. But when the director of The Green Lie puts a few in front of activist Feri Irawan to gauge his reaction, Irawan says, “They were made with the blood of Indonesians.” Scratch that. This documentary investigates what Boote and research partner Kathrin Hartmann call “greenwashing,” or the act of corporations stating that their products are sustainable. Though “investigates” is a generous term; Boote and Hartmann do travel around the world and meet various people who are involved in or protesting against manufacturing, but mostly they talk amongst themselves, with Boote acting naïve and Hartmann setting him straight. The sin most frequently discussed here is palm oil, whose production necessitates rainforests being destroyed. Hartmann repeatedly says that, unlike what labels on many products claim, there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil, and though a few interview subjects push back on this idea, she sounds like she knows what she’s talking about. Hartmann’s soapboxing gets a little tiresome, but Boote calls her out on it: “If your indignation could generate power, we’d all have light,” he says. She may be “a real killjoy,” as Boote says, but it’s enough to make you think twice about those M&Ms. —Tricia Olszewski

Wild Amsterdam

Directed by Mark Verkerk

Netherlands

It’s pointless for a classic-style nature documentary to aim for anything less than BBC-level cinematography, given that our high-def tastes have been locked-in since Planet Earth debuted in 2006. In that respect, Wild Amsterdam gets the job done: It trains the camera on urban vermin with the same level of care that a more snobby film might give to majestic sea mammals. The underbelly of the Dutch metropolis will look familiar to anyone with a taste for content about common rodents, birds, aquatic creatures, and their predators; like any city, Amsterdam is an archipelago of micro-habitats where people and critters live in fascinating proximity. The film itself, though, has a deeply corny side, most of which comes from the “narration” by a common house cat. Yeah, a cat. (With a human voiceover, duh.) The kitty is photogenic and cooperative—if that’s even the right word—and there’s some solid logic in the idea of showing rats and pigeons from a feline’s vantage point. But the real star here isn’t the animals. It’s Amsterdam itself, with its canals and spring sunlight, beckoning the viewer to come and revel in the cuteness of it all. There’s weird stuff, of course, including the escaped parakeets that have learned how to survive the winter, the bachelor toads that smother breeding females, and the invasive U.S. crayfish that thrive in the canals. But the city is the real stunner. I mean, why wouldn’t an animal want to call it home? —Joe Warminsky

Thirteen Ways

Directed by Ian Cheney

U.S.

Thirteen Ways is unlike anything else. It gets its name from the Wallace Stevens poem Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird, and after seeing it, you’ll never look at the natural world the same way. The entire premise of the film is an experiment: 12 scientists and nonscientists walk the same piece of Maine land and describe it, through winter, spring, summer, and fall. Nowhere is the power of the natural world more apparent than in this plot of land, with these people. Not one of them sees the natural world in the same way, and we are taken on a ride through each of their minds, exploring this world, our world, through them and their quirks and idiosyncrasies.

Directed by Ian Cheney, the film is a reminder that just beneath the surface of seemingly mundane surroundings, there is so much intrigue—and nothing is mundane when the surroundings are being described by passionate scientists, nature lovers, and creatives. There is talk of lichens and vole tunnels, as well as racism and sexism, and there is even paragliding. The forest is home to snow-covered tree branches in the winter, as well as the sounds of bustling insects in the warmer months. The eccentric, diverse cast of characters makes for wonderful eyes to see the woods through. And the four seasons, Thirteen Ways’ central characters, are most enchanting in this little part of Maine. Vivaldi would be proud. —Kayla Randall

The Woman Who Loves Giraffes

Directed by Alison Reid

Canada

In the 1950s, a young Canadian zoologist left for Africa to study giraffes in the wild. Anne Dagg traveled the continent alone in her small, shaky car. There were no cell phones, there was no infrastructure. She fought steep odds as a woman explorer pushing back against the scientific and academic community’s sexist resistance to her, and she would go on to be considered the world’s first giraffologist. Her story isn’t widely known, her boldness relegated to the footnotes of history—until now. The Woman Who Loves Giraffes is director Alison Reid’s love letter to Dagg, her life, and her work, and in this documentary, Dagg’s boldness comes through in spades.

A journey through Dagg’s past and present, the film paints a picture of a woman who is exceptionally knowledgeable about the long-necked apples of her eye. She admires their long necks, tails, and tongues, and is an endless wealth of giraffe expertise. After all, she’s loved them since she was 3 years old. But the film isn’t just about a woman who loves giraffes, it is about a woman who is a pioneer. She co-wrote what is today considered the bible on giraffes. Before Jane Goodall and the chimpanzees, there was Anne Dagg and the giraffes. Featuring lovely voice work by actors Tatiana Maslany and Victor Garber, The Woman Who Loves Giraffes gets to the heart of who this fascinating, peculiar scientist is, and why her own heart belongs to the giant endangered African grassland dwellers. With sweeping overhead shots of giraffes galloping in African plains and closeups of their beauty and quiet elegance, the stunning visuals take the viewer right into the savanna. At the end of this film, it’s easy to come away loving giraffes as deeply as Dagg does. —Kayla Randall

Sharkwater Extinction

Directed by Rob Stewart

Canada

To a shark, especially a great white shark, humans seem like adorable sacs of meat that do not swim very fast. Part of the reason that they’re so fun to eat is that, in the ongoing human/shark wars, humans are handily winning. According to the conservation documentary Sharkwater Extinction, millions of sharks are slaughtered every year for shark fin soup and miscellaneous fish products. As a great white shark, I find this infuriating.

Rob Stewart, the director and star of the film, is one of the good ones. Over many years, he has exposed illegal shark poaching that still happens all over the world. This film follows his efforts, whether it’s going undercover or catching poachers in the act. His point is a simple one: The mass killing of sharks is immoral, and will cause irreparable harm to our ecosystem. Maybe remember that before you buy a ticket to another dumb movie that demonizes sharks, you assholes.

Sharkwater Extinction is a hodgepodge of footage, with Stewart jumping from one activist campaign to another, strung together with admittedly gorgeous footage of shark-kind at our most graceful and serene. The reason for this approach is tragic: Stewart died in a diving accident in 2017. The film handles his death delicately, and while his spirit lives in the film, its unfinished quality diminishes its overall power. It’s a shame in multiple ways. If humans were more like Rob Stewart, sharks wouldn’t be so eager to devour you like some of you are eager to devour shark fin soup. —A Great White Shark

A Modern Shepherdess

Directed by Delphine Détrie

France

Plenty of people fantasize about leaving their nine-to-five doldrums behind and escaping to a farm somewhere off the grid, but Stéphanie, the subject of A Modern Shepherdess actually did it. A single mother and former graphic designer, she left her life in Paris to try her hand at running a farm and breeding sheep. Turning a profit in agriculture is a tall order in the best of circumstances, but Stéphanie’s been going it alone since her partner left, and since many in the community continue to see her as an interloper, she doesn’t have much of a support network.

What she does have is boundless optimism and a genuine love for what she does. Stéphanie offsets her sheep operations by educating groups of schoolchildren and agritourists, and in one such demonstration, she explains that her profession is technically designated as a “smallholder farmer,” but she prefers the quainter term “shepherdess.” The part of Normandy where she resides is an urban commune, which means she’s under stringent regulations, and isn’t allowed to put up fencing around her property, leading to the pilfering of her flock. Bristling against the bureaucratic interference in her pastoral life is a theme throughout the film.

A Modern Shepherdess is primarily a hangout doc—not a whole lot happens, but we slowly glean the details of how she works and the struggles she’s up against, which include random acts of vandalism from disgruntled neighbors and nonsensical decrees from local governing bodies. The film could benefit from emphasizing these stakes a bit more, or perhaps a bit more context of how farmers are regulated on an urban commune. Nevertheless, it’s an intimate portrait of a winning heroine, and though there’s not a clear conflict, audiences will be rooting for Stéphanie to come out on top by the end. —Stephanie Rudig

Welcome To Sodom - Trailer from BLACKBOXFILM on Vimeo.

Welcome to Sodom

Directed by Christian Krönes and Florian Weigensamer

Austria

Any documentary about trash pickers needs a good story about the trash or a good story about the pickers. Welcome to Sodom, set at the massive Agbogbloshie dump in Accra, Ghana, comes up short on both. The piles of electronic detritus are explained in only the briefest of terms, as we're told that much of it is illegally shipped from all over the world. It's hardly a new concept for rich-country audiences, even if this wasteland—nicknamed “Sodom and Gomorrah"" by the locals—is particularly immense. If we're inclined to have any deep anthropological thoughts about our trash, there's not much in the film to satisfy any curiosity. The pickers, meanwhile, are presented in a series of vignettes, speaking about persistence and survival via dry voice-overs. It's clear that the Austrian filmmakers weren't looking for a real protagonist. The dump-as-a-character is the focal point, and there's not much of a story arc possible for such a uniformly dusty expanse. What about the gay ex-academic who hides out at Sodom, fearing his country's anti-homosexuality policies? What about the kid who collects bits of scrap steel from the soil with the magnet from a giant stereo speaker? What about the guys who are fascinated by the snapshots on the discarded, unlocked phone of a far-away white guy? We gaze at them or their activities for mere moments, and then the film shifts somewhere else. In a vast, sickly, beige space of hidden details, Welcome to Sodom often stops looking just when things are getting interesting. —Joe Warminsky

The newest Island Mountain Arts (IMA) exhibition celebrates the beauty and heritage of barns.

Maple Ridge-based artist Kristin Krimmel is exhibiting her work, The Barn Project, in Wells for the next two weeks and will be launching the exhibition Friday, March 15.

When Krimmel moved to Maple Ridge 12 years ago, she started photographing the barns around her new home, and she says she was particularly attracted to the barns along Old Dewdney Trunk Road. She took every opportunity to photograph them, even though she didn’t know what she would do with the images she collected.

Her photographs became resource material for The Barn Project. Krimmel says she drew inspiration from the way light played on the barns she photographed in the Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows area, morning, noon and night, changing the geometric architecture, emblazoning the surface and deepening the shadows.

Krimmel says she immediately felt soothed by the landscape of rolling farmlands around her when she moved to Maple Ridge.

“The farmland culture is such a pleasant contrast to the urban culture,” she said in an email interview. “It is placid, serene, natural and nourishing for the soul. It’s visually harmonious.”

Krimmel describes herself as inquisitive and analytical. She couldn’t help but wonder about her reaction to the farmland culture around her.

“When I became a participant in this landscape, I asked myself these same questions,” she said. “I asked myself, ‘Why is it so soothing? Why do we prefer green spaces to urban concrete ones?’ In my opinion, it is because both the cultivated and the wild landscape brings us back to the earth, to the soul of our origins and our destination after death. The land is a part of our essential being. I’m sure a farmer will tell you that he or she is always at work and the crises on a farm are equally dramatic to those in an urban context. The urban landscape, on the other hand, is cold, hard (concrete) and the life is frenetic and demanding. It takes a practiced eye to find beauty in it. It is often a hodgepodge of visual ideas. It’s often practical but ugly.”

Krimmel says she was also drawn to barns because she is interested in Canadian history and in the lives of settlers.

“We have witnessed an extraordinary period of immigration in the past 200 years,” she said. “The poor and middle class were able to move to a place where living was what you made of it. People from many nations were able to come, settle, farm, become educated, become owners of their efforts, to prosper and to create their own immediate worlds through their own labours. This is becoming less possible now, as the easily arable lands have been bought up and fenced, and established farms are sold at unaffordable prices for middle and poor classes. Corporations are now owning a greater percentage of farmlands, or small-holding rural lands are being sold very profitably for housing.

The farms of the early 20th century are symbols of that early settler’s dream, of their work ethic and idealism. Farmers built structures to house their activities: shelter for themselves and for their animals, the processing areas, the storage of their products and the safe-guarding of their equipment.”

Krimmel has seen how times change, and how farms have adapted. Land is being sold, agricultural practices are changing with technology and the demand for new products, and built structures are being transformed for new uses.

“Barns, unusable for cows, now are becoming homes, much as mills did in earlier times, or they are simply being let go,” she said. “The fad of using barn boards for decor and furniture results in some abandoned barns being stripped of their essential outer walls and lumber, or they are rotting away.

“I feel that barns are now symbols of architectural heritage, first of all, and then of transformation and adaptability.”

With The Barn Project, like all her painting, Krimmel hopes to open the eyes of those who view her work to “the simple beauty which surrounds them.”

“I would like people to feel the beauty of the marriage between landscape and architecture, and to remember that the land is permanent, while man and his architecture is an ephemeral newcomer,” she said. “I would also like them to see barns as visual beauty. The individual structures are made with beautiful proportions, which are enhanced by the play of light and atmospheric conditions on their abstract three-dimensional forms.”

Krimmel first came to Wells last July to teach a workshop in drawing, and she is excited to be back.

“It was the first time I was in the Cariboo area, and I fell in love with it,” she said. “I was delighted to have the chance to bring my artwork for exhibition and to spend some time painting the landscape here. There is a strong farming culture in the Cariboo to appreciate these portraits of farms which I have painted. I see that local barns are adapted to the land which they serve and find them different from the Fraser Valley barns. They are calling on me to paint them, to record their place in time and their purpose in the community.”

Krimmel says she is an intuitive painter.

“I don’t always know beforehand what it is about a subject that draws me in,” she said. “With the barns, I have been photographing them for over 10 years , not knowing how I would express them. Then one day, I said to myself, ‘just start. Start with drawings until you know what it is that drives this interest.’”

The Barn Project features about 25 pieces, and Krimmel says she will soon embark upon “a more experimental way” of expressing these pieces.

Krimmel was born in Vancouver and trained at UBC as a specialist in the teaching of fine arts. Later, she received a Diploma Regional in Painting from the Ecole Regionale des Beaux Arts de Reims, France. After seven years in France, she returned to B.C. to become an instructor with Emily Carr College of Art and Design, teaching drawing, colour and design.

Throughout her career, Krimmel’s work has twice been selected for the Joan Miro Foundation’s International Drawing Competition and was included in their touring exhibition in Spain, Romania, Poland and Bulgaria. Her work has been seen in numerous international exhibitions in Holland, France, Canada and the United States, and in several Stephen Cannell television productions. As well, she was an Artist in Residence at the Scuola Internazionale di Grafica in Venice, Italy; the International Atelier de Seguret in France and in Vernon, B.C; and in 2018, she completed a four-week privately-commissioned residency in Flintbek, Germany.

Krimmel is a member of the Fort Gallery Artists Collective, and she lives and works in Maple Ridge.

Krimmel will be in Wells Friday, March 15 for an artist talk and the opening of The Barn Project. The exhibition opening takes place from 7-9 p.m. at the Island Mountain Arts Gallery at 2323 Pooley St.

The Barn Project exhibition will remain on view at the gallery through March 31.

Facebook will force Canadian political advertisers to prove their identity and reveal the source of their funds in an effort to prevent foreign interference in the upcoming federal election.

The Silicon Valley firm unveiled its plans Monday to comply with Bill C-76, federal-election legislation passed in December that includes additional restrictions on foreign spending in Canadian elections and new rules for online platforms.

Among other things, the Elections Modernization Act bans online platforms from knowingly accepting money from foreign advertisers; requires them to label ads from candidates, parties and partisan ads run by third parties; and compels them to keep a public registry of all political ads. Those found flouting the rules could face fines and potentially jail time.

Facebook will require anyone running political ads on both Facebook and Instagram in the months leading up to the federal election to go through a process to verify they are Canadian. Advertisers will also have to provide information to Facebook about who is paying for an ad. The ads will be published in a public, searchable online ad library for seven years after an election.

The social-media giant has also convened a cross-partisan group of high-profile Canadians to come up with a list of hot-button issues likely to be debated during the election, which Facebook’s automated systems will use to help flag unverified advertisers who might try to slip through the system.

They include Stephen Harper’s former chief of staff Ray Novak; David Zussman, a long-time adviser to Jean Chrétien; and former NDP MP Megan Leslie.

The social-media giant believes its plans could prevent the kind of foreign political interference that has put the company in the crosshairs of global regulators. At the same time, Facebook sees the incoming Canadian law as placing much of the legal burden to ensure that political ads aren’t being funded by foreign money on advertisers, rather than platforms.

“It’s quite clear that it places the onus of responsibility on political advertisers to provide online platforms with the information we need in order to comply,"" Kevin Chan, Facebook’s head of public policy for Canada, said in an interview.

Canada’s ad transparency rules, which take effect June 30, have caused headaches for some Silicon Valley giants operating in the country.

Earlier this month, Google said it would ban political ads during the federal election because it found it too difficult to change how its advertising networks operate to comply.

Story continues below advertisement

Twitter has yet to say how it plans to comply with the new rules. It is “not a topic we’re currently discussing,” spokesman Cam Gordon said in an e-mail.

Facebook was among the few U.S. tech firms to back the Liberal government’s legislation, which mirrors work the company started in the wake of revelations Russian trolls had abused its platform to spread divisive political messages during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Many of the details of the Canadian plans are still being worked out, Mr. Chan said, such as how Facebook will verify that advertisers are based in Canada and how much detail the advertisers will have to provide about their funding.

The social-media firm has come under criticism for too narrowly defining what constitutes political ads. In Britain, for instance, Facebook faced criticism for labelling ads related to Brexit, but not those related to broader topics considered politically sensitive, such as immigration. At the same time, Facebook angered some U.S. news outlets last year by flagging some promoted news stories as political ads before deciding in the fall to exempt legitimate news outlets.

Mr. Chan said Facebook will likely cast a wide net to identify political ads. ""If you’re talking about any issue that actually has some connection to a campaign, then I think we need to be cautious and we need to be broad in providing people with that level of transparency,” he said.

Facebook has also come under criticism for the amount of detail it shares publicly in its existing political ads library.

Story continues below advertisement

Users can typically search for ads based on keywords or names. They are given a broad breakdown of demographic information of who saw the ad, such as the gender, age range and location of users, along with a general range of how many people saw an ad and roughly how much an advertiser spent.

Facebook has yet to share information on the political or religious affiliations of people who saw an ad, what types of users advertisers intended to target or how many people shared and commented on an ad.

Mr. Chan defended the company’s decision to exclude some details from its public archive. The demographic details it offers are the same types of information advertisers typically request to judge the performance of an ad, and are good indicators of the kind of people advertisers were actually trying to target, he said.

In Canada, some analysts have raised concerns that Bill C-76 doesn’t fully capture how political actors use social media to spread divisive messages and does little to compel online platforms to crack down on unpaid posts and groups that spread misinformation.

“People and groups are using the internet in ways that challenge the notion of election advertising and circumvent even these new rules,” University of Ottawa communications professor Elizabeth Dubois and Anna Reepschlager, a student at the university, wrote earlier this year in Policy Options, an online magazine by the Institute for Research on Public Policy.

Teresa Wright, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Facebook is launching a new advertisement library that will capture detailed information about political ads targeted at voters in Canada, including who pays for them and whom they target.

The move is part of the social-media giant's response to changes the Trudeau government has made to Canada's election laws aimed at stopping bad actors -- foreign or domestic -- from interfering with Canada's upcoming federal election through advertising.

Bill C-76, which received royal assent in December, bans the use of money from foreign entities to conduct partisan campaigns.

It also requires online platforms, such as Facebook and Google, to create a registry of all digital advertisements placed by political parties or third parties during the pre-writ and writ periods and to ensure they remain visible to the public for two years.

Google recently said the demands of the new law are too onerous for its advertising system, which auctions ad space on the fly. It's simply refusing to take political advertisements in Canada around the upcoming election.

Kevin Chan, head of public policy in Canada for Facebook, says the company is trying to exceed the standards the Canadian law sets.

""C-76 is, in fact, very important and consequential legislation. It actually regulates online platforms, including Facebook,"" Chan said. ""In order to comply we actually need to build new systems and new products to be able to do this, so right now we have our product-engineering teams working very, very hard between now and the end of June to ensure that we will be in compliance with what C-76 requires.""

Advertisements that refer to political figures, political parties, elections, legislation or issues of national importance will have to go through an authorization process. This will capture the information of the entity or group buying the ad and ensure the buyer is based in Canada.

Political ads that appear on Facebook during the pre-writ and writ periods will be labelled with a ""paid for by"" disclosure. People will be able to click the disclosure and see the ad library. This library will include information on the ad's reach -- who saw it, their gender and location, as well as a range of its impressions.

Information in the library will be viewable and searchable online for up to seven years, which exceeds the period required in the new election laws.

Another effort to exceed the legislative rules will see Facebook using its artificial-intelligence technologies and algorithms to detect ads or content that tries to circumvent the rules.

""We recognize that there's going to probably be the potential for bad actors to try to work around the system -- in other words, they may want to run a political ad and not seek to self-declare and not seek to be authorized,"" Chan said. ""That is obviously problematic for us because we recognize that the spirit of what Parliament intended and what we intend, in terms of what we're trying to do, is provide the most transparency for political ads as possible.""

To help Facebook predict what issues might become key points of debate in the federal election, the company has amassed an group of policy advisers from a wide range of political backgrounds and expertise.

The group includes: former NDP MP Megan Leslie; former Stephen Harper aide Ray Novak, who is the managing director of Harper and Associates; Antonia Maioni, McGill University's dean of arts; Ry Moran, executive director of the truth and reconciliation centre at the University of Manitoba; and David Zussman, a professor at the University of Victoria's school of public administration.",Facebook announces changes to political advertising to meet new federal rules,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/facebook-announces-changes-to-political-advertising-to-meet-new-federal-rules-1.4340256

Those who want to run ads that reference political figures, parties, elections or issues of national importance will have to go through an ad authorization process, says a Facebook statement. They will be required to confirm their identities to ensure they are Canadian. They will also have to provide information about who is paying for the ad.

The information will be stored in a searchable online library where people can find out more about the ads they see. They will be saved for seven years.

Prominent Canadians will identify key issues

Facebook has also created a group of prominent Canadian leaders from across the political spectrum to help identify the key issues in the upcoming election. This will help the social medium to flag advertisers who try to circumvent the vetting system.

These measures are designed to help Facebook comply with a law passed by the Canadian government in December 2018 to deal with bad actors who try to manipulate election results or worsen societal divisions.

It was a province dominated by a single party. Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties ...","Regardless of who wins the 2019 provincial election, Alberta has been fundamentally altered by the results of the 2015 election and its aftermath.

This is one of the themes of Orange Chinook, a book I co-edited with my colleagues Keith Brownsey, Richard Sutherland, and David Taras at Mount Royal University.

In several chapters, the book highlights how the last provincial election brought to the fore a number of demographic and political changes that had been bubbling below the surface for years.

Alberta has a reputation as a conservative place, but a progressive evolution has been happening in its largest cities. The 2015 election also saw a breakthrough for women in politics, dramatically shifting what was once a male-dominated landscape. We witnessed, too, the rise of Indigenous activism, an undercurrent that is rising, increasingly, to the surface.

Many of these changes seem permanent, and the net effect appears to be the end of decades-long political dynasties that characterized this province for so long.

In short, Alberta politics is becoming more ""normal"" in the Canadian context.

Toward a two-party system

From 1905 to 2015, Alberta was unique in Canada. It was a province dominated by a single party.

Alberta's history was that it did not elect governments, it elected dynasties: Liberals (1905-1921), the United Farmers of Alberta (1921-1935), Social Credit (1935-1971), and the Progressive Conservatives (1971-2015).

Moreover, when the dynasty was finally defeated, it was never really a contender again. The once-dominant party often disappeared entirely.

Alberta PC leader Jim Prentice leaves the stage after election results came in on Tuesday, May 5, 2015, showing the NDP had won a majority, toppling the PC colossus that has dominated the province for more than four decades. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)

The 2015 election replicated this pattern. After their defeat, the PCs voted themselves out of existence when they merged with the Wildrose Party to form the new United Conservative Party.

But the situation is now different. If the UCP wins the 2019 election, as polls currently suggest, it's unlikely to govern for 44 years. And the NDP is unlikely to disappear.

Instead, Alberta is moving toward a two-party system, with the NDP on the left and the UCP on the right. With this structure, it more closely resembles the political landscape in other Canadian provinces.

Alberta has never had a party lose power and then come back and win another election. But that day is coming.

And the path to victory for any party, increasingly, runs through Alberta's largest cities.

The rise of cities

Rural Alberta had been the political bedrock of previous political dynasties, but the election of the NDP in 2015 was remarkable for its lack of a powerful rural minister in the vein of Hugh Horner, Marv Moore, Ken Kowlaski or Ed Stelmach.

The NDP, despite winning a handful of rural seats, was widely seen as ""the party of cities,"" as James Wilt describes it in one chapter of the book.

Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise, given the success of progressive candidates at a municipal level.

In the case of Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, Dave Bronconnier, Al Duerr, and even a young Ralph Klein could not be described as either fiscal or social conservatives. The situation was the same in Edmonton with Don Iveson, Stephen Mandel, Bill Smith, and Jan Reimer.

The longevity of the Progressive Conservative dynasty at a provincial level masked changes that were already underway in Alberta's two biggest cities.

For Roger Epp, who contributed another chapter to Orange Chinook, the fiasco over the NDP's farm workers bill and some insensitive remarks about the carbon tax showed a government that was, in his words, ""post-rural.""

The 2015 election, in Epp's view, put the electoral stamp on a number of trends that had been occurring in rural Alberta: a declining population, the increasing encroachments of urban life, the loss of health and education services, and the rural way of life quickly fading.

Indeed, the percentage of MLAs from rural Alberta has been in a slow but steady decline as urban and suburban populations grow. As recently as 2001, less than half of MLAs came from Calgary and Edmonton. For the 2019 election, when the suburbs are included, it will be two-thirds.

And in both 2012 and 2015, rural MLAs were mostly on the opposition side of the legislature. If the UCP forms government in 2019, a majority of rural MLAs will be back on the government side. But this will not bring back the political glory days. Those days are gone.

So too, are the days of politics being a man's game.

Alberta steps into the future

When Alison Redford won the PC leadership race in 2011, the Globe and Mail carried a notoriously condescending front-page headline: ""Alberta steps into the present.""

But as Lori Williams shows in her chapter comparing the leadership styles of Danielle Smith, Alison Redford, and Rachel Notley, Albertans have had several women succeed in a hitherto masculine environment.

These changes are permanent.

It was Notley — not Justin Trudeau — who introduced the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canada.

Meanwhile the UCP, which had been mocked for having more men in its caucus named Richard than it did women, has nominated dozens of women to run in 2019.

The days of Alberta politics being so heavily male-dominated are over.

A final demographic change is the rise of Indigenous political activism.

Indigenous votes

Brad Clark, in his chapter of Orange Chinook, demonstrates the NDP was overwhelmingly supported by Indigenous people in the 2015 election.

In fact, there were three ridings that were significantly impacted by First Nations and Métis votes: Lesser Slave Lake, Peace River, and Wetaskiwin-Camrose.

The potential for clashes over energy infrastructure, environmental considerations, revenue sharing, and the constitutionally mandated duty to consult means future Alberta governments need to respond to Indigenous people.

There are those who believe that the election of the NDP was an accident and that Alberta is really an ideologically conservative province going back to the Social Credit days.

But is that true?

Politics in the new Alberta

The concluding chapter by Anthony Sayers and David Stewart — using post-election survey data from 2008, 2012, and 2015 — shows that notion is more myth than reality.

On most questions of political values, they write, ""stereotypes notwithstanding, voters in Alberta appear broadly supportive of a substantial role for the state with respect to government spending.""

This was also replicated by a spring 2018 survey for CBC by Janet Brown and John Santos, who co-wrote a chapter on polling in the book.

The chapter on the fiscal situation in Alberta, written by Ron Kneebone and Jennifer Zwicker, provides more evidence that Albertans are not particularly fiscally conservative. In reality, they say, we like high government spending and low taxes.

For decades, Albertans could get away with that because the gap between revenue and expenses was covered by rich oil and gas royalties. When those royalties decline, as they did in 2015, budget deficits occur.

Whoever wins the 2019 election will need to make some hard choices to address Alberta's fiscal situation.

The titular Orange Chinook refers to the winds of change that carried the NDP to victory in 2015. But chinooks can be temporary. We could see the government voted out of office in 2019.

However, as the sub-title indicates — Politics in the New Alberta — what we witnessed four years ago represents a much more durable shift than just a change of governing parties.

With a federal election looming and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government facing its worst political crisis in four years, Canada’s ruling Liberals are expected to table a goody-filled budget in a bid to get back on course with voters.

At 4:05 p.m. (2005 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3341 to the greenback, or 74.96 U.S. cents. The currency, which advanced 0.6 percent last week, traded in a range of 1.3304 to 1.3365.

“Maybe we have seen a lot of the good news in Canada already as far as the currency is concerned,” said Hosen Marjaee, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. “If the deficit widens much more than expectations there might be a hit to the currency.”

Canada finances its fiscal deficit, which is about 1 percent of gross domestic product, by selling bonds to domestic and foreign investors.

Foreign investors bought a net C$28.40 billion in Canadian securities in January, led by federal government bonds, following a revised C$20.49 billion total divestment in December, Statistics Canada said on Monday.

The U.S. dollar declined against a basket of major currencies ahead of the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday. Traders expect there will be no Fed rate hikes this year, and are even building in bets for a rate cut in 2020.

The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, was supported by the prospect of prolonged OPEC-led oil supply curbs and signs of inventory declines in U.S. crude stockpiles.

U.S. crude oil futures settled nearly 1 percent higher at $59.09 a barrel.

Canadian government bond prices were little changed across the yield curve, with the 10-year flat to yield 1.716 percent. On Friday, the 10-year yield touched its lowest since June 2017 at 1.704 percent.

And Wolf, in his letter to the UCP caucus, says he is ""confident"" Kenney's team did not illicitly fund Callaway's campaign, which would violate Alberta's election financing laws.

Wolf, currently the deputy chief of staff for Kenney's caucus, could not be immediately reached for comment.

In documents published Saturday by CBC and later obtained by The Canadian Press, Wolf is shown in emails and other exchanges giving Callaway's organizers talking points, speech and policy advice attacking Kenney's main rival in the race, Brian Jean.

Kenney and Callaway have previously denied working together, and Wolf says while his emails may look ""unflattering,"" this is normal practice among rival camps in politics.

Sexism is still obviously persistent in politics and ...,"A lot of things have changed in this country since Brian Mulroney was its Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, namely that it’s no longer OK to call a female politician a “little girl”— unless of course she is a little girl. Stranger things have happened. In 2012, a 3-year-old boy named Bobby Tufts was appointed mayor of the tiny tourist town of Dorset, Minn., when his name was drawn from a hat at a town fair.

It’s hard to believe that Caroline Mulroney is pleased with her dad right now, writes Emma Teitel. The former PM’s remarks suggest he thinks she is as much a little girl as Amanda Simard is. ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Amanda Simard, however, is not 3 years old, nor was her name drawn from a hat. She is an elected official and an adult. Unfortunately Brian Mulroney didn’t treat her like one on Sunday. The former PM participated in an interview on Radio Canada’s Toute le monde en parle, where he went to bat for Ontario’s Francophone Affairs Minister, Caroline Mulroney, a.k.a. his daughter. “Caroline is always there to defend the interests of francophones in Ontario,” Brian Mulroney said on the program in French.

He said this because last year the Ontario Progressive Conservatives came under fire for eliminating the province’s French language commissioner and for cancelling plans to build a French language university. Read more: Former PM apologizes for referring to Ontario politician as a ‘little girl’ Simard, herself a representative of a heavily French-speaking riding, was so displeased with these cuts, she left the PC caucus to sit as an independent. It was an action some Canadians regarded as brave and principled. Brian Mulroney, presumably, was not one of them. In the interview in question he described Simard like this: “la petite fille qui a démissionné est partie.” Translation: “the little girl who resigned has left.” As far as sexist barbs go, it’s certainly an odd one, considering that Mulroney made it in a direct attempt to defend his daughter — a powerful female leader who no doubt has come up against similar sexist stupidity during her time in office, and who no doubt wasn’t a fan of it.

It’s hard to believe that Caroline Mulroney is pleased with her dad right now, whose remarks suggest he thinks she is as much a little girl as Simard is; a little girl who needs her father to fight her battles in the media. Meanwhile, the backlash to the former PM’s comments was, like most things in this era, swift and digital. This week, Simard tweeted the following statement in reference to the incident: “Mr. Mulroney attempted to defend his daughter Caroline, who completely dropped Franco-Ontarians. He has done great things for Canada, but his words belong to another time and have no place in a respectful and egalitarian society.”

Put another way, Brian Mulroney himself belongs to another time and he wouldn’t have much luck in this one with a mouth like that. The former PM was quick to issue an apology (though if he’s a mensch, he’ll reach out to Simard personally). “I had no intention of insulting anyone with this poor choice of words and would like to offer my sincere apologies,” he said in a statement this week. Some may decry the former PM’s comments as proof that sexism remains a serious problem in Canadian politics but look around. It’s hard to find anybody of note who is even vaguely supportive of them. Sexism is still obviously persistent in politics and elsewhere, but Mulroney’s personal brand of sexism is so plainly patronizing and demeaning, it’s hard to imagine any current North American leader endorsing it, except maybe Donald Trump. It’s nice knowing we’ve come far enough that when an old boy re-emerges from the ’80 like some sort of sexist mole, we whack him back into place. Mulroney recently celebrated his 80th birthday in Florida where he sang a duet with Michael Bublé. This seems more his speed these days.

""Understanding the importance of bill C-76 and what's potentially at stake ...","Facebook to launch Ad Library and confirm advertiser identities to comply with Bill C-76

TORONTO, March 18, 2019 /CNW/ - Expanding on its ongoing election integrity efforts, Facebook Canada announced new details about its ads transparency tools set to launch in Canada before the end of June 2019, ahead of the Canadian federal election.

In line with the requirements of Bill C-76, the Elections Modernization Act, Facebook will launch the Ad Library in Canada to help ensure that authenticity and transparency are at the core of paid election advertising on Facebook. Facebook will require advertisers to confirm their identities before running political, election related and issue ads, including those that refer to candidates. Additionally, to develop its policy for issue ads in Canada, Facebook is seeking input from an advisory group of prominent Canadian leaders from diverse political backgrounds.

""Understanding the importance of bill C-76 and what's potentially at stake, we're doing the hard and rigorous work to get our political ads transparency tools right for Canadians. We are approaching our efforts with a Canadian lens in building the Ad Library and other processes, while simultaneously applying learnings from similar efforts around the world,"" said Kevin Chan, Head of Public Policy at Facebook Canada. ""We take the protection of elections on Facebook very seriously, and we are committed to being a force for good in Canadian democracy. This is why we devote significant time, energy and resources to these issues.""

Ad Library: Bringing More Ad Transparency to Canada

It's important that Canadians know more about the ads they see — especially those related to political, and election related issues, including those that refer to candidates.

The Ad Library will store ads related to politics targeted to people in Canada and will be viewable and searchable by anyone globally for up to seven years, regardless of whether or not they have a Facebook account. The exact structure of the library is still being developed, but at a high level:

Canadians will notice these ads in News Feed because they will be labeled with a ""Paid for by"" disclaimer.

When they click on the ""Paid for by"" disclaimer, they will be taken to the Ad Library.

The library will share information on the ad's performance, like range of spend and impressions, as well as demographics of who saw it – like age, gender and location.

The Ad Library builds on Facebook's ""Info and Ads"" transparency tool, which currently allows people to see all the active ads that are running from a Page, whether or not the person is the intended audience for the ad.

Authorizing Advertisers Ahead of the Election

The Ad Library will cover not only electoral ads, but also 'issue ads' – ads which don't explicitly back one candidate or political party but that are major issues of national importance.

Advertisers who want to run ads in Canada that reference political figures, political parties, elections, or issues of national importance, will have to go through the ad authorizations process and comply with all applicable laws. And while the vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organizations, Facebook will work to systematically detect political, election related and issue ads that target people in Canada and confirm whether the advertiser has completed the authorization process. Ads run by advertisers who have not been authorized will be disapproved.

Identifying the Issues Important to Canadians

In Canada, where there aren't laws or agencies that list the key issues of national importance that need to be captured in the Ad Library, Facebook is engaging prominent Canadian leaders, representing Canada's broad political spectrum. Based on this feedback, Facebook is currently planning to train its systems to enhance detection of Canada-specific political, election related and issue ads, building on key learnings from around the world.

In Canada, there are 338 members of parliament, 751 members of provincial and territorial legislatures and some 25,000 municipal councillors and mayors. Add to that the number of people who ran for office but were not elected, and Max Cameron, the director of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI), says there are currently more than 75,000 people across the country who are actively thinking about entering politics.

But Cameron believes that number could be higher, and its cohort more diverse, if only Canadians had a better understanding of the entry points and inner-workings of politics.

“There are so many good people who would never go into politics because they don’t find it appealing. They’re deterred by the idea of living in a fish bowl where everyone is looking at you or not wanting to deal with the attacks,” says Cameron. “But without those good people, it’s affecting the way our institutions are functioning.”

With this in mind, through the CSDI, the University of British Columbia launched a non-partisan “boot camp” in 2013 that teaches participants about the day-to-day life of Canadian politicians at the federal, provincial and city level, as well as experimenting with new concepts to improve our democratic institutions.

This spring, Ryerson University’s Faculty of Arts is launching the Institute for Future Legislators Ryerson (IFLR), a program modelled after CSDI’s boot camp. Applications are now open and are due by April 1. The program, which costs $1,200, runs over three weekends in May and June and is open to anyone.

Unlike most professions, there’s no concrete training for politicians. The boot camp prepares the participants for the real world of politics, from learning the basics of parliamentary practices and procedures, to how to answer media questions, to how to pass legislation and work with other political parties. The participants also get advice from elected officials, scholars and political journalists who offer mentorship and share their experiences. So far, former NDP MP Peggy Nash and journalist Martin Regg Cohn are confirmed for the Ryerson program.

During the final weekend, participants will head to Ottawa for a mock parliamentary session at the House of Commons. The students will break into political parties, run caucus meetings and try to pass legislation, while also keeping up to date on breaking news and fielding questions from journalists.

Although some of the UBC program’s alumni have gone onto become politicians – like Heather Sweet who was elected to Alberta’s legislature, and Allison Patton, who is on Surrey’s city council – others have gone onto become elected officials in unions or as civil servants. “Whether a participant decides to run afterwards or not, they’ll know much better what the job of a parliamentarian entails,” says Cameron.

Hailey Graham participated in the UBC program in 2013 with political aspirations. “Politics is definitely for me and I think the Institute helped me realize it’s not for me right now, but one day,” says Graham, who is currently in law school in Vancouver.

One of the most enlightening experiences for Graham was learning how to become more self-reflective, something that’s prompted by the instructors throughout the program.

“One of my passions is to have more women in politics, so part of the reflective piece for me was thinking, ‘Who’s taking up space?’ or ‘Who is putting themselves forward into leadership positions right away?’ and ‘How do those people end up getting elected?’” says Graham. “The boot camp highlights those inconsistencies [between different groups of people].”

Cameron says integrating the self-reflective element – something the CSDI picked up from UBC’s medical school – is a way for participants to become better politicians. “It gives them the tools to listen, be more empathetic, find common ground and be able to work with people across party lines,” he says.

Instructors at both Ryerson and UBC’s programs believe that the boot camp is also an opportunity to help elevate groups who have historically been underrepresented in politics, like women, people of colour and LGBTQ- communities.

“For people who haven’t had a political voice or have been marginalized, [IFLR] helps them find ways in which they can articulate their own concerns and do it in the legislature,” says Pamela Sugiman, dean of Ryerson’s Faculty of Arts.

Cameron agrees.

“If you don’t encourage the people who are underrepresented to acquire the skills to be effective statespeople, then politics will be dominated by the same families and social classes as always. Part of our hope for the boot camp is to encourage more inclusion.”

The Canola Council of Canada calls the golden crop the most valuable one grown in Canada. In Alberta, it has been a staple for at least 30 years and accounts for around 70,000 jobs in the province. Ninety per cent of Canadian canola is exported, and China buys about 40 per cent of that, accounting for around $3.5 billion every year, according to the Council.

But on March 7, China’s customs agency announced it would be inspecting Canadian canola more vigorously after finding fungal pathogens in some shipments. China then revoked the export permit for Manitoba company Richardson International, one of the largest Canadian exporters of canola. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has investigated multiple complaints from China about Canadian canola exports, including nine since January, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau confirmed in a statement March 6. Six days later, CBC reported Bibeau said the Canadian government is still waiting for China to prove its pathogen claims. At a gathering at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, Bibeau said Canadian scientists have found zero evidence of the pests China reported.

Article Continued Below

Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada, said that while exports are stalled from time to time over inspections and potential pathogens, to his knowledge, this is the first time a company’s permit has been revoked. That’s why some are calling this a political issue, not a scientific one, linking it to the Dec. 1 arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, followed by the United States’ extradition request March 1. Alberta canola farmer Tom Coppock said he sees the issue as “100 per cent political and not at all scientific.” Though only one company has had its permit revoked, he said the uncertainty has reduced the price of Canadian canola across the country. “Of course we’re being affected,” he said. “If they can revoke it from one, who’s to say they won’t revoke it from four or more?” In a meeting of the House of Commons trade committee March 17, Conservative MP Randy Hoback put forward a motion to have Bibeau, International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr, and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland appear before the committee to address the situation.

Hoback was firm in his stance that the problem is not with Canadian canola, which he called the safest in the world. “This is a political issue,” he said. “We think it’s very important to have a game plan.”

Article Continued Below

Liberal MP Sukh Dhaliwal put forward an amendment to remove Freeland from the list, to which the opposition strongly objected — Hoback argued Freeland should be included because of the potential political nature of the issue. Dhaliwal said the responsibility of the file rests with the minister of international trade and reiterated the time-sensitive nature of the case. All five Liberal committee members voted in favour of the amendment, while the four opposition members voted against. The resulting motion, to have the two ministers appear the week of April 1, was unanimously passed. In a press release Monday, Hoback blamed the export block on the Liberals’ political relationship with China and again called for Freeland’s involvement. “Without an ambassador to deal with the situation on the ground in China, we need the minister of foreign affairs to tell Canadians what the government is doing to restore the market access that is vital for the livelihoods of canola farmers and their families,” he said. Ward Toma, general manager of the Alberta Canola Producers’ Commission, said farmers are currently in “wait-and-see mode.” Though only one company has had its permit revoked, he said the decision affects Alberta companies with ties to Richardson International, including a processing plant. “What will affect them, will affect everything. And if it spreads to other companies, it could have a greater impact,” he said. Around 25 per cent of Coppock’s annual crop is canola, but if this issue isn’t resolved in a few weeks, he said he’ll consider planting less this year. Most of his 2018 crop is already sold, he added, making him one of the lucky ones — many farmers have bins of yet-unsold canola that is now sinking in value. “We have more uncertainty now than ever before,” he said. Everson said he is concerned about the economic implications of the issue, but also about the effect it could have on Canadian canola’s reputation. “The faster we can get to the bottom of this and work with (China) to resolve it, the better,” he said.

The amendment is well overdue and is a political and economic winner for both governments and should be implemented immediately.

Fedeli is championing a change that protects consumers, creates jobs, increases gaming tax revenues, attracts American tourists to Canadian casinos and would hurt organized crime.

“It’s time to legalize single event sports wagering in Canada and we’re committed to working with the federal government to make it happen,” wrote Fedeli on Twitter.

Currently in Canada you cannot legally bet on a single sporting event like the World Cup or the Super Bowl.

Fedeli is leading the charge of several provinces who want the change.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford also sent out a tweet supporting the legalization of single events sports wagering. “Gaming can make a significant contribution to our economy. Our government wants to allow the people of Ontario to legally bet on single events like tonight’s @MapleLeafs game. @NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman thinks so too.”

Ford wrote “The @NHL, @NBA, @CFL and @MLS all agree – let’s regulate single game sports betting in a responsible manner to give consumers a legal alternative to illegal or offshore sports books and U.S.-based casinos.”

Legalizing single-event sports wagering is a simple change the Trudeau Liberals could make happen this spring before the next election.

This would stop criminals from taking advantage of the public, who are now given no other choices or options when it comes to single-event sports betting. It would also create much needed tax revenue for the provinces.

Readers should know my business partners and I currently have no clients with a financial interest in the single event sports betting industry. It is possible we could in the future if single sports betting becomes a reality.

Support for the change is broad based and also strong in Liberal-friendly union circles.

Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor and Dave Cassidy, president of Unifor Local 444 in Windsor, wrote in the Toronto Sun and National Post this week.

“For a government that wants to do anything and everything possible to secure Canadian jobs, amending legislation to allow for Single Sport Betting seems like the biggest no brainer of them all,” wrote Dias and Cassidy.

They went on to write, “It costs the federal government no money; it protects consumers by channeling current unregulated gaming into a regulated environment; it channels revenue, currently leaving the country, into the provincial governments and towards government programs; most importantly, it protects jobs and creates jobs. Michigan and New York are moving forward.”

Previously, professional sports leagues were opposed to single event sports wagering. Now many of the leagues support the legalization including the National Hockey League.

“The NHL believes that a level playing surface for sports betting is in the best interest of the NHL’s sports betting landscape. With two franchises in Ontario and two right on the border with the U.S., Ontario is a very important market for the NHL. Accordingly, the NHL does not object to the province of Ontario’s initiative to offer single event wagering when it is permitted,” wrote Gary Bettman, NHL Commissioner.

Ford and Fedeli should be applauded for requesting a change that is long overdue and a sure bet to protect consumers and create jobs.

Could it be more topical — a play about gender issues and power politics set in the corridors of Parliament Hill?

In Behaviour, a new play at the Great Canadian Theatre Company, a young political staffer manoeuvres her way through a maze of compromising situations that may or may not cross the line.

Playwright Darrah Teitel investigates the nuanced negotiations taking place everyday between those who wield power and those whose jobs depend on pleasing them.

""We're looking at the places where regular people enter potentially slippery-slope territories."" said Sarah Kitz, who plays a senior bureaucrat.

Studio Juzolie More

Kitz says the play does not demonize one side or another, but is more like a road map through the tricky landscape of the #MeToo era.

She expects that Ottawa audiences will especially relate to the characters and their dilemmas.

""They may say, 'That situation looks familiar,'"" said Kitz.

Where: GCTC, 300-1227 Wellington St. W., at the corner of Holland Avenue.

When: Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 4 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. The play runs until March 31.

Wild about Harry

It's all the shenanigans, spells, villains and fantastic beasts from the Harry Potter adventures — rolled into 70 minutes of hilarity.

Potted Potter has condensed and sped up the the seven volumes of the J.K. Rowling series into a two-man show that spoofs the young wizard's perilous upbringing.

Scottish actor Scott Hoatson, who plays Harry, says a performance of Potted Potter brings out a parade of fans dressed as their favourite characters — often in costumes that rival what the actors are wearing.

""It's like hanging out with your mates and laughing about your favourite book or movie,"" Hoatson said. ""There are a lot of inside jokes.""

Even those who somehow aren't familiar with Rowling's boy wonder, Hoatson added, should have fun taking in the antics.

351,,2019-03-17T04:19:00.0000000Z,"It was time to leave politics, he said: he’d served seven terms ... he also served as chairman of Halifax-based SeaFort Capital Inc., a Canadian private equity investment firm backed by the McCain and Sobey families in which he declared a “nominal ...","“If Scott Brison had not stepped down from cabinet, Jody Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice and attorney general.” That disclaimer has become the official chorus of l’affaire SNC-Lavalin. Justin Trudeau first uttered the talking point on Feb. 15, a week after his government faced allegations that he and senior government officials inappropriately pressured then-attorney general Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal case involving the Montreal-based construction and engineering giant. Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, reiterated it nearly word for word before the justice committee last week: “If Minister Brison had not resigned, Minister Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice today. That is a fact. And facts are very stubborn things.”

Facts can also take time to emerge. But from the outset of the SNC-Lavalin controversy, Brison’s resignation as president of the Treasury Board was marshalled by the government as the reason why Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to veterans affairs and replaced by David Lametti, a Montreal MP who we now know has left the door open to giving SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement. Thus, had Brison not resigned, it is likely that the SNC-Lavalin controversy would never have come to light—or indeed have even been a controversy, as the decision not to overturn the director of public prosecution’s decision not to give SNC-Lavalin a DPA would have continued to be Wilson-Raybould’s to make.

But Brison did resign. And that resignation, to spend more time with his family, raises questions. In January, those questions focused on Brison’s upcoming involvement in the criminal proceeding against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, once the commander of the Royal Canadian Navy, involving allegations of government interference on behalf of a major corporation. Then, only days after Brison left office, it was announced he had taken a full-time position in Toronto in the executive suite of the Bank of Montreal, the same institution where Kevin Lynch, board chairman of SNC-Lavalin, is vice-chairman of BMO Financial. There are interesting vectors worth noting between Brison, SNC-Lavalin and BMO against the backdrop of the Norman and SNC-Lavalin controversies, both of which stem from charges of inappropriate intermingling of politics and business.

In his testimony before the justice committee, Gerald Butts shared details of how Brison told Butts and Katie Telford, Trudeau’s chief of staff, on Dec. 12 that he planned to resign from cabinet. Brison would tell the PM later that day he “didn’t have to leave cabinet right away,” Butts said, but he was going to tell his constituents two or three days later. In his testimony, Butts said he was surprised: “We had no idea that he was even thinking about retirement.” That view is consistent with reports that only months earlier, when Trudeau canvassed his team at a summer retreat, Brison confirmed he planned to run in the next federal election.

Two days after Brison spoke with Butts and Telford, on Dec. 14, his name appeared on a list of witnesses for the Crown. The list, dated July 5, 2018, was submitted in Ontario Superior Court in the criminal proceeding against Vice-Admiral Norman. Norman faces one breach of trust charge for allegedly leaking cabinet documents related to a $668-million Navy supply ship contract between the federal government—then headed by Stephen Harper—and Quebec’s Davie Shipbuilding (now known as Chantier Davie Canada Inc.) The documents in question relate to a November 2015 cabinet decision by the newly elected Liberals to briefly suspend the contract. Court filings show Brison, a longtime MP for Nova Scotia’s Kings-Hants riding, urged colleagues to pause the project pending more study; he introduced a letter from Davie’s rival, Nova Scotia-based Irving Shipbuilding, asking the government to consider its proposal which would move work to that province. The government proceeded with the Davie contract. Brison has denied lobbying on behalf of the Irvings.

As Butts presented it, no one wanted to accept Brison’s decision to resign as final. A weeks-long full-court press to convince Brison to stay, at least until the summer, commenced. They asked Brison to “take Christmas to think about it, and at least give the Prime Minister a chance to talk him out of it.” Brison leaving would trigger a cabinet shuffle no one wanted, Butts said: “The Prime Minister was happy with the team he had.”

After Christmas, Butts said Brison confirmed he would resign, which meant his job needed to be filled. Trudeau “wanted to move the fewest number of people possible.” He detailed the logistics of the shuffle. These details included then-cabinet minister Jane Philpott stating that Wilson-Raybould would see being moved out of justice as a “demotion” and tied to her refusal to give SNC-Lavalin a DPA; showcased Butts and Trudeau reassuring themselves that the shuffle had nothing to do with the SNC-Lavalin DPA; and made clear Wilson-Raybould viewed her “demotion” as connected to the SNC-Lavalin file. Throughout, Trudeau would repeat that none of this would be happening were it not for Brison’s resignation. (Wilson-Raybould has not been given the opportunity to share publicly her version of events.)

The public knew nothing of these backstage frictions when Brison publicly announced his resignation on Jan. 10 via a two-minute video and Facebook post in which his young family featured prominently. It was time to leave politics, he said: he’d served seven terms; at age 51 he was “ready for new challenges.” Spending time with family—“being husband and daddy”—was his priority.

In media interviews, Brison denied that his role as a witness in the Norman trial, set to begin next August, two months before the federal election, was a factor in his leaving politics. “This is very much a family decision,” he said. Trudeau backed Brison on Jan. 11, saying he respected his decision, even as his government had apparently tried to talk him out of it: “As a parent, I know like so many know the difficult challenge of balancing a demanding job with time spent with young families, so I fully respect his decision.”

On Jan. 14, the day of the cabinet shuffle, Brison said he hadn’t yet made a decision about stepping down as an MP, and that he’d likely return to the private sector—but didn’t have a position lined up. “Nothing concrete,” he told the Globe and Mail. “No job offers or anything like that.” Brison previously ran an appliance store and worked briefly in investment banking. In 2000, as a Progressive Conservative MP (Brison crossed the floor in 2003), he relinquished his riding temporarily so new PC leader Joe Clark could enter the House of Commons. During his leave, he was named vice-president at Toronto’s Yorkton Securities Inc. (As a Liberal MP, he also served as chairman of Halifax-based SeaFort Capital Inc., a Canadian private equity investment firm backed by the McCain and Sobey families in which he declared a “nominal ownership interest.” He also sat on the board of publicly traded Norvista Resources Corp. a Toronto-based merchant bank focusing on junior mining companies (he resigned when appointed to cabinet in 2015).)

Brison’s ties with Bay Street saw him land in the middle of a 2005 scandal over an email he sent to an investment banker with the brokerage arm of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce one day before the Liberal government unveiled a policy decision not to impose a punitive tax on income trusts: “I think you will be happier very soon … this week probably,” Brison’s email read. Trading in income trusts spiked the following afternoon, prompting an RCMP investigation into a possible leak. Brison denied any insider knowledge of Ottawa’s plans; he was discussing rumours already in the public realm, he said. He expressed regret for sending the email and was never charged with an offence; a CIBC internal review found no evidence of any improper behaviour by any employees.

In his Feb. 6 farewell speech in the House of Commons, Brison announced he’d be stepping down as an MP the next week. Brison’s last day on the Hill was Feb. 10, three days after the SNC-Lavalin story broke. By then, we know now, he had concrete plans. On Feb. 14, four days after being photographed walking away from the Hill with his husband and daughters, the Bank of Montreal announced Brison was its new vice-chair of investment and corporate banking of capital markets based in Toronto. His main responsibilities will include “senior client coverage and business development,” according to a press release; he’ll report to the head of global investment & corporate banking. Whether he will relocate his family from Cheverie, N.S., some 1,800 km from Toronto, is unknown. Brison did not respond to Maclean’s questions.

Banks are frequent landing pads for former pols or top civil servants. Brian Tobin, former Newfoundland premier, was appointed Vice-Chair of BMO in 2013. Frank McKenna has a top job at TD Bank. Kevin Lynch, a former deputy finance minister and clerk of the Privy Council between 2006 and 2009, was named vice-chairman of BMO Financial Group in 2010. In 2017, he was named vice-chairman of the board of SNC-Lavalin; in 2018, he was named chair.

This week, Lynch’s interactions with the government on the SNC-Lavalin file have come under scrutiny, raising concern they could be in potential violation of federal lobbying rules. Wernick testified before the justice committee that he received an Oct. 15 call from Lynch who “expressed his frustration that he did not understand why a [deferred prosecution agreement] was not being considered…. My recollection of the conversation is that he asked, ‘Isn’t there anything that can be done?’ ” Lynch is not registered as a lobbyist for SNC-Lavalin; as such, there is no record of the call in the federal lobbyist registry. On Tuesday, the advocacy group Democracy Watch sent a letter to the commissioner of lobbying, Nancy Bélanger, requesting an independent investigation and ruling on whether Lynch violated the Lobbying Act and the Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct by failing to register as a lobbyist for SNC-Lavalin.

Whether Brison and Lynch, fellow Nova Scotians, discussed Brison’s BMO appointment when Brison was in government or after is unknown. (Lynch did not respond to Maclean’s questions and interview requests.) Brison sat on the finance committee in the early 2000s when Lynch was a deputy minister of finance. Early in his tenure as president of the Treasury Board, Brison repeatedly referred to Lynch, among others, as an expert who endorsed increased government spending: “David Dodge and Kevin Lynch, two former deputy ministers of finance, and Larry Summers, former Secretary of the Treasury in the U.S., have all commented on this,” Brison said in April 2016.

As a former cabinet minister, Brison is subject to post-employment obligations laid out under the Conflict of Interest Act. These are intended to prevent former ministers from taking improper advantage of their previous public office and providing advice to any person or organization using information obtained while in public office that is not available to the public. For one, any offers or acceptance of outside employment by office holders still in office must be reported to the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner within seven days of receiving an offer and within seven days of accepting. A minister of the Crown who accepts an offer of outside employment is obliged to disclose his or her acceptance in writing to the Prime Minister within seven days. Whether Brison did this, and on what date, is not public information, a spokesperson for the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner says in an email to Maclean’s: “The strict confidentiality requirements of the Conflict of Interest Act prevent us from discussing any public office holder’s disclosures to the Commissioner. This includes disclosures of firm offers of or acceptance of outside employment.”

The Act also prohibits former cabinet ministers from taking a job with any firm with which they had “direct and significant” dealings within one year of leaving office, a prohibition that remains in place for two years after the minister’s last day of work. Lobbying registry records indicate that there was no lobbying by BMO to Brison or the Treasury Board within the past year.

BMO and/or Lynch may well have communicated with Brison during the last 12 months of Brison’s time in office without having to disclose it in the lobbyist registry, says Democracy Watch co-founder Duff Conacher. Lynch is listed as one of BMO Financial’s in-house lobbyists under the category of lobbyists who spend less than 20 per cent of their time lobbying; his name falls under CEO Darryl White’s disclosure filing. But only the senior officer for BMO, in this case White, is required to be listed in the monthly communications disclosures, even if the senior officer is not at the meeting or does not participate in the communication.

Conacher says his organization plans to file a complaint about Brison with the ethics commissioner regarding Brison potentially acting in an advisory role for BMO, which is not allowed under the law. By definition, executive roles are advisory, Conacher says. (When asked whether Brison’s new role had an advisory component, BMO spokesman Paul Gammal directed Maclean’s to the bank’s announcement that he had been hired.) Conacher doesn’t expect change: “I don’t have much hope for a meaningful ruling because [the ethics commissioner] would have had to approve Brison taking the position under section 35 of the Act.”

For now, the SNC-Lavalin case has eclipsed coverage of ongoing pre-trial motions in the Norman case, which shares many of the same players, issues, and allegations of lack of government transparency. Norman’s defence, led by Toronto lawyer Marie Henein, has accused Ministry of National Defence officials of using elaborate code names in an attempt to bury documents the defence is trying to seek past access to information laws. Ironically, ATI was under Brison’s purview when he was president of the Treasury Board. Norman’s lawyers have gone to court to force the federal government to release them. Henein also has threatened to call Butts and Wernick to testify if they don’t produce documents. Brison figures in the defence’s arsenal in others ways; Norman’s lawyers have cited the 2005 income-trust scandal the MP triggered as evidence to prove that leaks in Ottawa are common—and rarely lead to a criminal prosecution. Meanwhile, Brison’s lawyers have sought “standing” for the former politician to ensure he “is not subjected to unjust and unfounded intrusion and attacks upon his privacy and reputation.” As questions mount, one more fact emerges: Scott Brison may have retired from politics, but politics has yet to retire from him.

Journalism programs from postsecondary schools across Canada have joined together to create J-Schools Canada, an organization meant to promote Canadian journalism education and collaboration among programs.

Susan Harada, associate director of Carleton University’s school of journalism and communications, spearheaded its creation. She said the idea for the organization came from a few journalism educators during a Canadian Communication Association conference a few years ago. She credits Ivor Shapiro, associate dean of undergraduate education and student affairs at Ryerson University’s faculty of communication and design, with first proposing the professional network.

“At a time when journalism is being challenged, Ivor thought that we should try to make some kind of pan-Canadian … organization that would bring journalism schools together,” Ms. Harada said.

According to Charles Hays, program coordinator for Thompson Rivers University’s journalism program and a member of J-Schools’ interim organizing committee, this new network is the first Canadian organization to do that.

Before J-Schools Canada “there wasn’t an organization that really spoke to, or for, or about Canadian journalism education,” Dr. Hays said. He noted that up until now, journalism educators would meet at the Canadian Communication Association conference once a year and then part ways.

He said it’s especially important for journalism educators to have cross-country connections to identify common issues across programs while also respecting different legal, political and cultural contexts found across provinces and regions.

“Our students go and work all over Canada and if we just teach them our own regional perspective, I don’t think we’re serving them well,” Dr. Hays said.

For Mark Hamilton, chair of the journalism and communication studies program at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, a J-Schools Canada member, one of the main draws for joining the organization was its links to J-Source, a trade website dedicated to providing news, research, and industry-related information for journalism professionals, scholars and students. J-Schools Canada produces and supports the website, and members will get access to a special section covering journalism education and pedagogy. Ms. Harada said the members-only section is currently in development.

The site is also accepting pitches for paid reporting assignments and republished content from students attending J-Schools Canada member institutions, and members can advertise on J-Source for no extra cost.

J-Schools Canada members currently include Carleton, Kwantlen, Ryerson, Algonquin College, the British Columbia Institute of Technology, the College of the North Atlantic, Lethbridge College, Mount Royal University, the University of British Columbia, the University of King’s College, the University of Ottawa, the University of Regina, the University of Toronto, and Wilfrid Laurier University.

Any postsecondary journalism program can become a member of the association, which will formalize its governing structure at the annual meeting of the Canadian Communication Association in June (held as part of the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, which this year is in Vancouver).",Canadian journalism schools partner in new association,University Affairs,https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/canadian-journalism-schools-partner-in-new-association/

The big night for homegrown music was hosted by cryfest generator/Canadian crooner Sarah McLachlan, who pulled double duty with an empowering performance later on in the night, and celebrated a variety of musical talents and genres, from hip hop and country to rock, pop and Indigenous music.

Let’s break down the good, the bad, and the Canadian of it all, shall we? For the full list of winners, head here.

The Good

Everything Corey Hart

We were all wearing our “Sunglasses at Night” when legendary performer and songwriter Corey Hart was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. A teary-eyed Hart accepted the award and dedicated it to his fans as his wife, Quebec musician Julie Masse, and his four children looked on with tears streaming down their own faces.

“I believe that music and love are the most powerful and enduring forces of good in the world,” he said. “Without music or the Junos, I would have never met my precious Julie. And without love I would have never experienced the miracle of cradling in my arms, my four precious babies… as a songwriter I can honestly say those are the greatest songs I will ever write.”

Cue the waterworks everywhere.

Hart has a long history with the Junos. As McLachlan pointed out, Hart’s “Sunglasses at Night” was the first video to ever win a Juno, but more importantly it was during the broadcast one year that he met Masse, as they presented together. They’ve been going strong ever since. #RelationshipGoals.

In 1993, Corey Hart was supposed to give out #JUNOs for video of the year.

He thought it was wrong for a musician to hand out a visual prize, and balked.

They offered to pair up with Julie Masse to give group of the year. He said yes.

They met that night.

London Calling

How a show opens is always a pretty important indication of how the evening is going to go and the Junos went for hometown hearts with a performance of “Body” by locals-gone-big Loud Luxury. They were joined by the Western Marching Band and the Western Mustang Cheerleaders, who wore their purple loud and proud.

It was an intricate number that undoubtedly sparked a few “They said London!” drinking games on couches across Canada, but it was sweet to see the hosting city get so much recognition. The swelled crowd certainly loved it, and exploded every time another artist coyly nodded, “Hey London,” from the stage.

What a feeling after that AMAZING opening to the #JUNOS. 💜💜💜@LoudLuxury pic.twitter.com/qu9VwoT6rF — The JUNO Awards (@TheJUNOAwards) March 18, 2019

Bülow lights up the stage

Sometimes it’s the simplest performances that resonate the most, as 20-year-old Bülow proved with a stripped down version of “This Is Not a Love Song.” The German-Canadian graced the stage with minimalist makeup and bare feet, using an array of lightbulbs as props while she belted out the hit.

It was only fitting when she won Breakthrough Artist of the Year a commercial break later, and tearfully accepted. We have a feeling she earned a few more social media followers as a result.

Jessie Reyez

After winning last year’s Breakthrough Artist of the Year, it was heartwarming to see the outspoken Reyez take home a statue for RB/Soul Recording of the Year 12 months later. Her speech was the cutest too, as she thanked fans over, and over, and over again.

“If there’s one thing that I leave tonight man, it’s that I am you and you are me,” she said. “If there’s one thing that you’re chasing and you’re willing to work hard for it, do it. Because you can do whatever you want man. Thank y’all so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you…”

And to have that award presented by Sting and super-producer David Foster? Not too shabby.

The Bad

Sarah McLachlan makes it political

The Junos have a long history of sometimes random but mostly musical hosts, like William Shatner, Michael Bublé, Brent Butt and Shania Twain taking on MC duties over the years. This year was Sarah McLachlan’s time to shine, 25 years into her career. And she did shine… for the most part.

As with any awards show, sometimes political speeches land and sometimes they don’t. Rather than address any of the current Canadian political turmoil making headlines or leaning into the music side, McLachlan opted to tackle Trump in her opener and viewers seemed a little thrown.

“You know when you live someplace peaceful and beautiful, and then get a crazy neighbour,” she said. “And they start causing all sorts of trouble like putting up weird walls, picking fights with all the other neighbours, telling your daughters how they should behave, all the while saying they’re making the area great again and you just watch feeling helpless… and hoping they’ll be gone by 2020.”

The remarks weren’t met with (much) anger, per se. Most people just seemed genuinely confused.

Paging Shawn Mendes

Sunday night was unquestionably Shawn Mendes’ time to shine. By the end of the broadcast he walked away with five wins out of his six nominations, including Single (for “In My Blood”), Pop Album and Artist. The only problem? He wasn’t there.

The global popstar is currently on tour and so he wasn’t able to accept any of the accolades in person. Or by proxy. Or by video. It left the show feeling a little hollow and lacklustre, especially when the producers tried to make up for his absence with a “special performance” of “In My Blood” from Amsterdam, which was taped on March 4.

Maybe a heartfelt, taped acceptance speech would have played better, but at least he showed up in some form since he was the night’s big winner.

the juno awards are in london but shawn mendes is doing his performance broadcasted from europe so i am sad — julie⇞anne (@juliebennettx) March 11, 2019

The fan favourite

Speaking of not showing up, the last award of the night is the we all wait for, and at the Junos, it was the only one voted on by the people who buy the music and the tickets and the merch: the Fan Choice Award. Given Mendes’ online support (hello #MendesArmy) and his big wins it seemed likely that he would sweep the bonus category too, but in the end Avril Lavigne fans showed up and led her to a win. But of course Lavigne wasn’t there either, so instead the night’s big moment just ended with a bit of a whimper.

At least Corey Hart’s show-ending performance was there to save the day.

THE CANADIAN

Indigenous rights

The night was full of tributes and performances, including Jeremy Dutcher’s performance of “Sakomawit” (he won best Indigenous music album during the pre-telecast and was asked to return to the stage by fellow winners Arkells after his thank-you speech was cut off), Elisapie’s ode to women delivered in Inuktitut, and indigenous journalist and author Tanya Telaga reminding everyone of the importance of language in a powerful speech.

Really cool to see Tanya Talaga on the Junos. Seven Fallen Feathers is required reading. And introducing Jeremy Dutcher, who is awesome. — Blake Murphy (@BlakeMurphyODC) March 18, 2019

A mashup of personalities

Sometimes Canadian artists and performers stop by just because they can. That’s how it felt when Rick Mercer, Tessa Virtue, Sting, and the OG grandfather of Canadian hip hop (and former Mr. D star) Maestro Fresh took to the stage at various intervals to present.

Now, Saskatchewan’s longest-serving Conservative Member of Parliament — and one of just a few left from the Canadian Alliance days — says he won ...","David Anderson figures he’s put around three-quarters of a million kilometres on a succession of vehicles, and flown a couple million more, over his 19-year career in federal politics.

Now, Saskatchewan’s longest-serving Conservative Member of Parliament — and one of just a few left from the Canadian Alliance days — says he won’t stand for re-election when Canadians go to the polls in the fall.

“We’ve put in six terms and at some point there’s a reason to go back to a normal life, particularly around family life,” Anderson said, adding that he spends about two-thirds of his time away from his wife, Sheila.

“It’s time that we started living our life together, not apart, and really enjoying our time together.”

Anderson was first elected to represent Cypress Hills — Grassland in 2000, and was re-elected with wide margins in five subsequent elections. In 2015, he won more than 25,000 votes, good for 69 per cent of the total.

In an interview on Monday, the veteran MP — among current members, only Liberal Ralph Goodale has held a Saskatchewan seat for longer — said he is most proud of the role he played in dissolving the Canadian Wheat Board.

At the time of the still-controversial decision, Anderson was Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and the Canadian Wheat Board, a supporting role for former agriculture minister and Saskatchewan MP Gerry Ritz.

It is not immediately clear who will seek the nomination in the riding, one of the safest Conservative Party of Canada seats in the country. A party spokesman said the date for a nomination meeting has not been set.

“David — thank you for your dedication and your service to SW Sask and to the country. It has been an honour to work with you over the years,” Anderson’s friend, former Premier Brad Wall, said in a tweet on Monday.

Anderson, meanwhile, said he looks forward to spending less time on the road, but leaving public life behind won’t be easy.

“I don’t think anybody leaves easily. There’s a lot of really good things about this job; it’s an incredible privilege to be able to serve. So yeah, I expect there will be some days where it’ll be difficult, but it is the right thing … for us.”

All his performances are leading up to the taping of his upcoming comedy album “Passport and Prozac” at Yuk Yuk’s in Vancouver from March 28 to 30.

Bertram recently signed on with the comedy record label 800 Pound Gorilla Records to help him get his comedy out to millions of people worldwide.

The company also represents Jim Jefferies, Michelle Wolf and George Lopez, and is also known for its work with the estates of Richard Pryor and Robin Williams.

Bertram’s journey as a comedian includes praise from Simon Cowell as he advanced on Britain’s Got Talent.

He also received critical acclaim at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and Melbourne Comedy Festival.

Other memorable moments in his career include performing for the president of Singapore and the time that Dame Judi Dench gave him a $50 tip.

Bertram has appeared on stages around the world as a finalist in the San Diego Comedy Fest and semi-finalist in the Boston Comedy Fest. He received a five-star review in the Australian Times for his one-man show Guilt Ridden Sociopath.

Bertram is also an actor who has appeared on shows and in movies such as Riverdale, Supernatural, Once Upon a Time, America’s Dirk’s Gently and Big Eyes.

He also has a current-events comedy podcast, The Dry Shave Show, that covers politics, news, and history with hilarious and controversial opinions.

Bertram grew up in Vancouver in a home that appreciated the arts. His father is a gold-record-winning saxophone player who played with the well-known Canadian group The Powder Blues and opened for ZZ Top, The Who, and Tina Turner.

His mother is a watercolour painter who took after her famous father Toni Onley.

Bertram went to an all-Asian high school in Vancouver, and he realized that although he was different from his classmates – he wasn’t academic and was overweight – he could gain acceptance by being the class clown.

He first learned how to be a juggler in a summer school for the arts. From there, he built his stage presence and comedy timing chops as a street performer.

Bertram has performed in 20 different countries doing a comedy, juggling and magic-style show.

He realized that he wanted to go the avenue of stand-up comedy, and hit up any stage he could get on, whether it was at home in Vancouver or on the road while street performing.

“Comedy is like a science experiment of words,” Bertram says. “The formula either works or it blows up in your face. You don’t know until you know, though. The best training is by throwing yourself into the lion’s den and learning from your mistakes.”

Settler or Indigenous, it’s impossible to approach Kent Roach’s Canadian Justice, Indigenous Injustice: The Gerald Stanley and Colten Boushie Case without baggage. As an Indigenous person, this might include still-fresh traumas – including the injury of being written about, in this case without informing or seeking consent from Colten Boushie’s family or communities. As a settler, this baggage is that of the Canadian condition: racism toward Indigenous peoples created and nurtured intergenerationally, through stereotype and the Canadian justice system.

Roach examines the 2018 criminal trial of Saskatchewan farmer Gerald Stanley, unpacking the legal and cultural ramifications of the white defendant’s acquittal on second-degree murder charges in the shooting death of 22-year-old Boushie of Red Pheasant First Nation. Firmly, Roach argues, “the Stanley/Boushie case will not and should not go away.” The Boushies, the Stanleys, and other first-hand participants in the case were purposely not interviewed for this book, as the author believes those stories belong to those people. Roach’s interest is “historical, political, social, and legal.”

The author, a professor of law at the University of Toronto, uses the case against Stanley, in which an all-white jury acquitted the farmer, as a lens through which to explore a pervasive problem plaguing Canadian justice and its application: a disparity that manifested in this case in unfair jury selection. Roach’s focus on polarization in the legal system is a significant one, as this has been active since settlers first colonized this land; as Roach puts it, “different perspectives on justice mean that the Canadian justice system has, almost from the start, resulted in injustice for Indigenous people.”

Roach presents support for his assertions – citing historical sources alongside contemporary Indigenous writers, thinkers, and lawyers – in focused, generally short sections. These allow readers to digest each part of the argument before moving forward, and provide an accessible approach to the large scope this book covers. Importantly, Canadian Justice, Indigenous Injustice provides crucial background that many who weighed in on Stanley’s criminal case failed to recognize: an analysis of Treaty 6, the legal agreements between Indigenous peoples and settlers on the land where Boushie was killed. Roach outlines the original misconceptions that occurred as Treaty 6 was debated, including the fact that miscommunications between nêhiyaw leader Mistahimaskwa and the settlers were not adequately addressed or were mistranslated in the English-language Treaty.

A historical understanding of law in Canada forms the basis of Roach’s analysis, and undergirds his approach in advocating for legal reforms that centre on justice for all, not justice for some. He argues that fundamental systemic change is needed if justice is truly to be served: “[W]hat would the outcome of the Stanley/Boushie case have been if it had been decided by a jury of six Indigenous and six non-Indigenous persons? In order to reach a verdict, there would have had to be a genuine appreciation of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives on what happened on the Stanley farm: a meeting of minds that has been all too infrequent after the Treaties were signed, and sometimes, even while they were being negotiated.”

Many Indigenous peoples and settlers alike do not believe the Canadian legal system can or should be reformed when it comes to Indigenous justice. Kent Roach does.","Canadian Justice, Indigenous Injustice: The Gerald Stanley and Colten Boushie Case",Quill & Quire,https://quillandquire.com/review/canadian-justice-indigenous-injustice-the-gerald-stanley-and-colten-boushie-case/

Wire service The Canadian Press published an article featuring anonymously sourced attacks on Jody Wilson-Raybould, a Canadian member of Parliament.

The Canadian Press apologized for the article’s inclusion of those anonymous attacks. In a statement, the Canadian Press said the article didn’t meet standards for anonymous sources. “The Canadian Press has detailed policies on the handling of anonymous sources,” the article said in part. “They were not followed in this case. We will redouble our efforts to ensure that our journalists use unnamed sources carefully, sparingly, and only when circumstances demand it.”

The Canadian Press’s James McCarten, the acting Ottaway bureau chief and stylebook editor for the Canadian Press, explained to iMediaEthics that while the Canadian Press has an anonymous source policy, it wasn’t “properly followed nor efficiently enforced.” He said the article was intended to profile Wilson-Raybould, a former justice minister and former attorney general, given the controversy surrounding her allegations she was “improperly pressured” by the government in handling a corruption case.

McCarten told iMediaEthics that Wilson-Raybould didn’t complain but another reader did.

The story didn’t just break guidelines for allowing anonymous sources to speculate or offer opinion, but also because it didn’t say why the sources were granted anonymity, McCarten added, noting “a senior manager was not consulted” before publication.

Moving forward, the Canadian Press reminded staff of its anonymous source policy. “Because anonymous sourcing tends to occur most often in political circles, we here in Ottawa have taken pains to re-emphasize with staff the importance of following the standards and clear and detailed guidance as it is laid out in the Stylebook,” he noted.

Toronto Star public editor Kathy English flagged the apology in her recent column about the Canadian Press report on Jody Wilson-Rayblould. She noted that the Star published the Canadian Press report, but edited it to remove some of the anonymous criticisms. According to English, Star staffer Patrick Ho raised questions about the article, telling her it was a “cheap potshot.”

The Star added an editor’s note to the article to reflect it removed the anonymous problems. That editor’s note reads:

Public Editor’s Note — February 10, 2019: This article, distributed by The Canadian Press on Feb. 9, was edited by the Star to align with the Star’s journalistic standards on granting anonymity to confidential sources.



English explained the Star‘s guidelines state:

“We do not provide anonymity to those who attack individuals or organizations or engage in speculation — the unattributed cheap shot. “People under attack in our publications have the right to know their accusers.”

The trip, fronted by B.C. Minister of Forests Doug Donaldson, was cancelled after the Dec. 1 arrest of Meng, who was detained on an extradition request from the U.S. while changing flights at Vancouver International Airport.

article continues below

And the cancellation happened despite advice from Canada’s Beijing embassy that there was no need to change plans.

The China leg of the Asian forest mission was suspended “due to the international judicial process under way relating to a senior official at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.,” the province said in a statement at the time. Donaldson did visit Korea and Japan.

Documents released to Glacier Media under B.C. freedom of information laws, however, paint a different picture.

“With the political situation developing re the Huawei CFO arrest, there are concerns being raised about bringing a minister and delegation into China next week,” said a Dec. 7 email from B.C. Forestry Innovation and Investment CEO Michael Loseth to Dave Murphy, a senior trade commissioner with Canada’s embassy in Beijing.

Documents show Donaldson wanted to speak with Canada’s ambassador to China, John McCallum, with Loseth attempting to facilitate such a discussion.

Murphy didn’t try to stop the visit.

“Business is as usual here right now, no reason to alter plans,” he wrote to Loseth Dec. 8. “If there were reason to change things for reasons of security/safety, advice to travelling Canadians would be updated. This is true for any country in the world.”

Industry delegates continued their visit to China without the government officials.

The decision for Donaldson and others to return to Canada was made after what Kevin Forseth of Forestry Innovation Investment called in a Dec, 9 email, “the end result of 72 hours of pretty intense discussion involving Ottawa, the embassy in Beijing” and the province at deputy minister, minister and premier levels.

Ministry of Jobs, Training and technology deputy minister Fazil Mihlar was also party to the discussions, trying to reach the delegation’s Chinese hosts for discussion of the situation.

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service was also involved with the Pacific region director general offering comments that were blacked out in documents.

When B.C. backed out of the visit, and Chinese organizations also cancelling, concerns were also raised about the security of sites McCallum was set to visit in Xiong’An, a development hub 100 kilometres southwest of Beijing.

McCallum was recalled from his post after telling a newspaper it would be good for Canada if the U.S. dropped its extradition request for Meng. He said if China and the U.S. could reach a deal on Meng’s situation, any deal should include release of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained in China in what many have called retaliation for Meng’s detention.

Between ducking responsibility for anything related to his office’s dealings on the SNC-Lavalin file, and managing the related fallout in his cabinet and caucus, the prime minister has been a busy man.

Sure, he’s had ministers do flyovers to airdrop funding for transit and flood mitigation and such.

But Ron Russell’s was a life far more about quality than quantity. It ended peacefully last week, and Nova Scotia lost a political icon.

When he retired from provincial politics, choosing not to reoffer in the 2006 election, he was just shy of his 80th birthday and by all accounts could still outwork and outwit politicians half his age.

A Herald editorial writer at the time captured something of Ron’s contribution to his adopted province:

“Ron Russell has become an institution in his own right. His longevity in office, his parliamentary skills, his good humour and dedication to serving the public good have set the gold standard. ... He will retire with the affection and appreciation of a grateful province.”

His life in Nova Scotia politics is the stuff of legend. His life before arriving in Nova Scotia is a tale of adventure Hemingway would have struggled to capture.

Ron wasn’t a big man physically, but he was fearless. He was a pilot in his native New Zealand’s air force during the Second World War and later flew for both the Australian and Canadian air forces.

Sometime earlier, he hunted crocodiles at night and worked for a time as a circus roustabout, eventually earning a promotion to elephant handler. After a dispute with the circus owner Ron left, taking the elephant with him.

His eventual arrival in Canada is shrouded in typical Russell mystique. Word is that after a rousing night somewhere in England, he awoke to find himself aboard a ship on the Atlantic bound for Canada.

He stayed and Nova Scotia is a better place for it.

Four former premiers — John Buchanan, John Hamm, Rodney MacDonald and Darrell Dexter – attended a memorial gathering for Ron in Halifax this week.

In 1978, newly elected premier Buchanan named first-time MLA Ron Russell as Speaker of the legislature. The Speaker’s ornate chair would become a comfortable spot for Ron. He held the job an unprecedented three times.

Hamm recalled that when his government was elected in 1999, Ron was far and away his most experienced asset.

Ron had already served 21 years in the legislature — 15 of them at the cabinet table or in the Speaker’s chair — and many politicians with that formidable resume might think they could write their own ticket in a new government.

Not Ron.

Dr. Hamm remembers that his friend came into the new premier’s office and asked only what he could do to help. Dr. Hamm named Ron minister of labour, the environment, government house leader and chairman of the priorities and planning committee of cabinet.

MacDonald recalled how Ron, the old hand in the Hamm cabinet, took him, then a 27-year-old political neophyte, under his gentle wing. “He called us the bookends, because he was the oldest and I was the youngest in that cabinet,” MacDonald recalled.

Ron won his West Hants seat in every election from 1978 though 2003, and in each of them he knocked on every door in the riding. When he got to the legislature, he never forgot who sent him.

“It was from Ron that I learned that you help everyone that asks. If they didn’t support you before, they may in the future. He treated everyone equally,” recalled long-time friend Dale Palmeter, who put that lesson to good use working for federal cabinet ministers Scott Brison and now Bernadette Jordan.

As Speaker, Ron had the rules of the legislature on the tip of his brain and he applied them evenly. His hard-earned reputation for fairness won him election as Speaker in 1998, under a Liberal government.

One of his closest friends in the Buchanan government – and one of a very few who could keep up with Ron both at work and after — Jack MacIsaac remembers his friend’s wonderful sense of humour and strong work ethic.

“He worked hard, and he played hard, but he never got the two mixed up.”

Just six months before his death, Ron was having a few beers and playing some pool with his sons in downtown Halifax.

“The Catholic community of the diocese of Quebec shares the pain and suffering of the Muslim families affected by the attack in New Zealand,” said Cardinal Gerald Lacroix of Quebec on Facebook. “Our humble prayer accompanies you. We continue to believe that it is possible to live together in respect and freedom of worship.”

In a rambling online manifesto, the Australian accused in the New Zealand shootings named the Quebec killer among mass murderers who inspired him. Alexandre Bissonnette was convicted of killing six men in the attack on Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre.

In a March 15 letter addressed to Muslim Brothers and Sisters, the president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) Bishop Lionel Gendron of Saint-Jean-Longueuil assured them of the solidarity and support of the Canadian bishops “during this terrifying time.”

“We are horrified that the attack injured and killed so many people, and left behind a feeling of fear and uncertainty in your homes and places of worship,” said Gendron. “For Canadians, and especially Muslim Canadians, this act of horrific violence is a painful reminder to the shooting which took place Jan. 29, 2017.

“As the Muslim communities and the entire population of New Zealand mourn the dead and care for the injured, the Catholic community of Canada extends to you its fraternal proximity and assurance of prayers and support,” he said.

The Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Quebec also reacted quickly with a statement March15 as they wrote they learned “with horror and pain” of the “terrible crime” committed in New Zealand “against people who only prayed” while meeting in their spring plenary in Trois-Rivières.

“The Bishops reaffirm that religious freedom is a fundamental right that everyone has the duty to respect and they unite their voice to all those who denounce and reject violence in all its forms,” the statement said.

“It’s an evil act, for starters,” said Anne Leahy, former Canadian ambassador to the Holy See who is now a professor at McGill University teaching Catholicism and public policy. “It’s something everyone needs to take a stand against.”

Leahy said more needed to be known about the motivations of the young Australian involved in the killings, but has found reports of the killer being motivated by white supremacy “quite worrying.”

“The political leaders can take a stand and condemn this sort of event for what it is, not to fudge it,” she said, noting that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “names the tragedy for what it is, an attack against Muslims.”

“It was an act of hatred against specifically Muslim worshippers,” she said. “We have to name the evil to specifically fight the evil.”

Leahy said the response of Quebec officials two years ago set the right tone. In the immediate aftermath, the mayor of Quebec, the Premier, the Cardinal of Quebec and the Imam of the mosque made “great shows of solidarity,” she said. “Their words, effectively made the right gestures and helped a lot in the healing.”

“That was far more important and relevant to citizens in a given place than debating in parliament.”

The reaction of Quebec after the Quebec shooting was “a cry of conscience,” and “an improvement in the attitude of people towards Muslims who have been living amongst Quebeckers for many years,” Leahy said.

In Toronto, hundreds of Torontonians turned up at Nathan Phillips Square on March 15 in response to the New Zealand shooting.

“The place where you practice your religion should be the place where you feel safest,” Ryerson University political science student Shehaz Shabbir told The Catholic Register.

Whether the massacre had taken place in a church, temple or synagogue, he would have brought his friends from the Ryerson student union to the square in front of City Hall to protest, Shabbir said.

“If something can happen over there, it can happen here as well,” he said.

Fatima Ahmed stood in the rain holding a “United Against Islamophobia” sign with her two young sons, Adam and Yasin, because she felt it was important that her boys see her city, her country and people of good will everywhere are not on the side of hate and violence.

“I’m here to say no to hate,” she said. “We need to know and love each other. I think the problem is that we don’t know each other.”

Representatives of all three levels of government and people representing a wide range of faiths were at the protest quickly organized on social media by TorontoMuslims.com, Muslim Youth Fellowship, Faith in the City and the Urban Alliance on Race Relations.

“Once you get past the utter shock and horror of such a barbaric act of mass murder, you have to focus in on what this man did and what was motivating him,” said Andrew Bennett, former ambassador of religious freedom and now director of the Cardus Religious Freedom Institute. “What was motivating him was evil and hatred of Muslims,” he said. “This man killed 50 people when they were being most fully themselves as human beings from a religious perspective.”

A place of worship, whether a mosque or church or temple, “should be the place where we feel most secure and are able to be most fully ourselves.”

The response has to be greater advocacy for religious freedom, Bennett said. People must be “able to publicly live their faith,” to “publicly worship” and be “free to act on what they believe and what they confess in worship in living out their daily lives.”

A heathy, pluralist society must have broad religious freedom, he said, but we must “draw a very clear distinction between violent acts of hatred which are never acceptable and when people out of genuine belief publicly privately disagree with others about what they believe.”

“The reality is that humans believe very different things, theologically, ethically, ideologically, but if we’re going to have a common life together, if we’re going to live next to one another, we have to be willing to accept difference,” he said.

A key is the respect for the dignity of the individual, despite disagreement. Bennett said Canada’s laws provide penalties for preaching hatred or advocating violence against individuals or a group of people or against the civil order.

However, Bennett said people “should be free to publicly differ about what they believe.”

“As a Catholic, I should have the freedom to publicly say I disagree with Islam,” he said. “I believe Islam is wrong and the fullness of Christ is to be found in Jesus Christ. Likewise, a Muslim friend of mine has every right to say to me, “You’re wrong and I don’t believe Jesus Christ is the incarnate Son of God. He was a prophet.”

“The hard red line is when people begin to advocate violence and open hatred,” he said. “There needs to be proper limits and we have got provisions already within the statutes.”

“There can be no toleration of violent acts against any human being let alone against human beings in public prayer,” Bennett said.

The New Zealand shooter is said to have been radicalized on social media, and that concerns Bennett.

Social media is “where a lot of this stuff thrives,” he said.

“Social media does not build up community; it breaks down community, because you are not in physical proximity to the people you are having a debate with,” he said. “It’s easy to dehumanize the person, when not having physical contact with them.”

“We need to be much more questioning on what is going on in social media, and build up genuine human community in our neighborhoods, not electronically but actually physically present with one another.”

Two weeks ago he was brandishing a document listing someone’s password to a provincial government database that some real estate operation had thrown away.

Last week he surfaced with an entire file folder of letters, memorandum, and other papers, all generated within the B.C. NDP government of Dave Barrett, circa 1975. Much of it was correspondence from the office of former B.C. attorney general Alex Macdonald.

Among the historical gold in this trove of 44-year-old documents was a mimeographed “handbook” for the then B.C. NDP caucus.

Using various progressive sources, including an essay by the great NDP parliamentarian Stanley Knowles, it went to some detail to explain the Canadian political system and how it differed from that of the United States.

For example, it was stressed how the vital need to enlist labour unions to help register voters in U.S. elections did not exist in Canada, where voters did not need to register in advance of the polls.

When I last saw this antiquarian Dumpster diver on Monday (March 12th), he had two more objets d’trash to show off.

First was a somewhat beat-up utensil decorated with Art Nouveau tendrils ending in shamrocks on the handle. It may have been a cake knife and it may have been made of actual (rather than just historical) gold.

Secondly there was an old original of a technical drawing that was breathtaking in its hand-drawn precision and proficiency. This he generously allowed me to photograph.

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill. Singh won his new Burnaby South ...,"OTTAWA — Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection — made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart — ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.","NDP's Jagmeet Singh steps into the House of Commons, making history",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/ndp-s-jagmeet-singh-steps-into-the-house-of-commons-making-history-1.23667038
