That's because the NDP is strongest in Edmonton, while the UCP polls best in the rural areas and small cities of the province.

Jason Kenney can form a government without significant representation in the capital, while Rachel Notley can afford to lose seats outside of Alberta's cities and still keep her job.

That's par for the course in Alberta's political history — you just need two out of three to win.

Since the 1944 provincial election, the party that has formed government has always won the most seats in at least two of three regions of the province (for the purposes of this analysis, the two urban regions are defined as ridings with Edmonton or Calgary in their name, with all the other seats grouped into a third category).

For much of the province's history, parties didn't even need the cities in order to form a government. The Liberal, United Farmer and Social Credit governments won enough seats outside of Edmonton and Calgary to secure a majority government. Those urban seats were just gravy.

That changed in 1971, when for the first time seats in Edmonton and Calgary made up more than a quarter of ridings up for grabs. That shifted the electoral calculations parties had to make, as urban voters got a fairer share of representation in the legislature. No longer could parties count on rural seats alone to put them over the top.

This was one of the factors that contributed to the size of Peter Lougheed's victory over Social Credit in 1971 — it was a close race between his PCs and the Socreds outside of the big cities, with only a few seats separating the two parties. But the Tories swept Edmonton and won two thirds of the seats in Calgary.

Calgary key to PC governments, and Notley's, too

During the PC years that ran from that 1971 win through to Jim Prentice's defeat in 2015, the PCs always won more seats than any other party in both Calgary and the ""rest of Alberta."" They also prevailed in Edmonton under Lougheed, as well as in the 2001, 2008 and 2012 elections, but it was the combination of rural and Calgary support that cemented the PC dynasty.

The crumbling of that foundation in Calgary helped Notley win in 2015. Though the New Democrats also did well outside of the two cities' boundaries — winning 20 seats, one fewer than Wildrose — theirs was the first government to be elected in Alberta without a plurality of the seats available outside of Edmonton and Calgary.

Rural seats were not part of the NDP's equation. Combined with the urban seats in Edmonton and Calgary, the suburban seats on the outskirts of the capital and the four seats in Red Deer and Lethbridge were enough to put the New Democrats over the 44-seat threshold needed for a majority government.

But Calgary was won by the skin of the NDP's teeth in 2015. It took 33 per cent of the vote in and around the city in that election, just edging out the PCs and Wildrose and winning 15 seats in the process. The polls suggest the New Democrats are on track to match or beat that popular vote score. But that won't be good enough now that their opponents are no longer divided.

It means that whoever wins Calgary wins the province. That's how it has been in every election since 1948. Whether or not those seats were needed to get to a majority, Calgary has backed the winner in every election since the end of the Second World War. It also means that Edmonton — if it does stick with the New Democrats — could find itself on the outside looking in.

Edmonton goes its own way

That's familiar territory for Edmonton. In only four of the nine elections held since 1986 has the party that formed government won the most seats in the city. During the Don Getty years, Edmonton backed Ray Martin's NDP while it elected more Liberals during three of Ralph Klein's four elections as PC leader — including in 1993, when Laurence Decore won every seat in the city.

Of course, the UCP wants to win seats in Edmonton — and the polls suggest they are on track to do just that. But if the UCP wins the most seats in Edmonton, it almost certainly means they have done very well in Calgary. An alternate scenario that sees the UCP do better in Edmonton than Calgary just isn't in the cards, based on both current trends and the electoral history of the two cities.

Alberta Poll Tracker: Check out the latest projections

So if it comes down to Calgary, the odds are stacked against the New Democrats. In only one seat did the NDP get more votes than the combined totals of the PCs and Wildrose in 2015, using current electoral boundaries. In only three others were the New Democrats within five points of the combined PC and Wildrose score.

While not every PC and Wildrose vote will be going the UCP's way, polls have indicated that the vast majority of them are currently heading in that direction. So, in order to win in Calgary — and hold on to power — Notley will need not only those who backed her four years ago, but plenty more on top of that.

""If it was necessary to defend the Canadian election, [CSE] could either defend Canadian ...","The man tasked with leading the Liberal government's monster national security bill through the choppy waters of the Senate is promising clear passage, despite fears that Bill C-59 won't get royal assent before the election.

""This bill will pass and it will pass in a timely fashion,"" said Independent Senator Marc Gold, the bill's Senate sponsor.

""This is not the kind of bill that should be the subject of partisan politics.""

Bill C-59, first introduced in 2017, proposes a major revamp of Canada's national security architecture — the first major changes in decades.

The bill tasks a new intelligence commissioner with overseeing espionage activities and sets up a watchdog to keep tabs on the agencies dealing with national security, including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Communications Security Establishment and the Canada Border Services Agency.

There's also a section giving CSIS the authority to collect, retain and use datasets — electronic archives of information.

One of the bill's more controversial sections creates the Communications Security Establishment Act, which would give the Communications Security Establishment — Canada's signals intelligence agency — new powers to both defend critical Canadian infrastructure (telecommunications, nuclear plants) from attacks, and launch cyberattacks.

Partisan worries

Leah West, who studies national security law at the University of Toronto, said it's critical to get CSE's new powers in place before the federal election campaign gets underway.

""If it was necessary to defend the Canadian election, [CSE] could either defend Canadian infrastructure from bot-net attacks or it could use an offensive operation, potentially, to shut down the site where [there are] lines of communication between Russia and Canada,"" she said.

(Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

""My emotions are frayed at this point because it has been so long ... I'm really a little bit fearful that, in the political climate right now ... politics will get in the way of a really important bill.""

Privacy and civil liberties groups have attacked the bill, arguing it comes close to authorizing mass surveillance.

""There's an ability to collect data that is publicly available, and 'publicly available' is defined in such a way that it could be interpreted to mean even information that's been hacked,"" said lawyer Meghan McDermott, who provides counsel to the B.C. Civil Liberties Association.

""This could be very sensitive information, and also metadata about us and our movements and what we're doing every day and who we associate with. That's really important and it's much too vague an idea that's been baked into C-59.""

But even McDermott feels conflicted about what will happen if the bill doesn't pass.

It's one of the biggest changes to national security laws that will happen in our generation. - Meghan McDermott, BCCLA

""It is not perfect and there are a lot of things that we do not like in it, that we do not think should become law,"" she said.

""But because it's correcting and filling so many gaps that we have seen exploited by our security intelligence agencies, I think on balance it's better for Canadians to have the laws [and] that [it] would be good if C-59 is actually enacted.

""It's one of the biggest changes to national security laws that will happen in our generation.""

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has called the bill ""a vital piece of legislation"" that ""needs to get done.""

Documents obtained under access to information show that, when the minister met last fall with Daniel Coats, the U.S. director of national intelligence, he was encouraged by his department to raise Bill C-59 as a topic of conversation and highlight CSE's new influence.

Months later, it still waits in Parliament's in-box.

The House of Commons kicked the bill over to the Senate in June 2018, with minor amendments from the lower chamber's Liberal-dominated national security committee. (Attempts by both the NDP and Conservatives to change the bill were voted down.)

Last week there was a flare-up when the chair of the Senate national security and defence committee, Sen. Gwen Boniface, tried to set a date to begin talking about the bill. That was shot down by Conservative Sen. Don Plett on procedural grounds.

Plett said his party is still eager to debate the bill.

""The Conservatives support many aspects of it. I will certainly listen with open ears at the committees and I will listen to the experts, and there may or may not be amendments coming as a result of that,"" he said.

That guarded support only goes so far; Plett said his caucus fears the bill doesn't go far enough to prevent attacks on Canadian soil.

In a special report for The House, the CBC's Catharine Tunney explores the proposed national security update bill and the fears that Bill C-59 won't get royal assent before the election. 6:35

""The threat of terrorism and extreme violence ... to Canada and to Canadians is very, very real. This bill would be irresponsible in the face of those threats,"" Plett said.

The Senate national security committee will finish its work on the Liberal government's firearms bill first before turning to Bill C-59.

While parliamentarians sort this out, several families have had to put their travel plans on hold.

'No fly kids' wait in limbo

For years, the government has been aware that innocent people — including children — face difficulties at the airport because their names are similar to those of individuals cited by the Passenger Protection Program, also known as the 'no-fly list'.

Zamir Khan's five-year-old son Sebastian has been held up at the border since he was an infant. He helped found the group No Fly List Kids to advocate for a redress system — something Bill C-59 promises, although the details are hazy.

Sebastian Khan, 5, has been stopped at the border since he was an infant because his name matches a name on a security list, his dad says. (Submitted by Zamir Khan)

The group's lawyer, Khalid Elgazzar, said the bill likely would give those falsely flagged as ineligible to fly for security reasons a special number they can use when booking airline tickets to prevent being blocked at the airport.

""There's a wide range of problems that I've heard, some include being stopped overseas, having passports confiscated in other countries, some where families didn't feel very comfortable,"" he said.

""There's also issues of stigma. Some of the families are racialized ... If you're a racialized family or come from a particular ethnic background or religious background, and you're flagged for national security reasons, then there's a stigma that attaches to that as well.""

For Khan, it's meant years of putting his family members' private lives on the front page of major newspapers.

""That's the sacrifice that my wife and I have agreed to make. We said, 'If we can fix this thing, that'll be worth it,'"" he said.

""But if it all goes to naught because of some ... political posturing and we're left with no improvements? That's a hard pill for me to swallow.""

Senators resume sitting on Monday. Gold is urging Canadians to be patient with them.

In the lead-up to the 2015 election, political leaders and pundits agreed that the economy was the top issue on the minds of voters. Oil prices had collapsed the year before, setting off a recession that threw tens of thousands of people out of work. And there was no clear path to a recovery – or a clear answer about which party would be best equipped to find one.

Four years later, it feels eerily familiar. The province is dealing with another oil price collapse that bottomed out in fall of 2018, and most of the major economic indicators – unemployment, bankruptcies, the housing market, employment-insurance claims – are terrible. That economic pain has bred resentment in all directions, from the current NDP government to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Alberta’s place in the country.

Story continues below advertisement

And, as in 2015, voters are probably having a difficult time deciding who would be able to lift Alberta out of its slump. Rather than the usual question of “Are you better off today than you were four years ago,"" voters are left wondering if there’s any chance things will get better four years from now.

Which is all to say that the mood in Alberta is not great. With that in mind, Gary Mason travelled around Alberta to see first-hand how the ongoing economic crisis has shaped how voters see their options for this election.

He visited Strathcona County, where the expanded Trans Mountain pipeline would begin (if it’s ever approved and built). He spent time in Edmonton, in NDP Leader Rachel Notley’s riding, where even people who think Ms. Notley’s government has done a competent job are pessimistic about her chances. He went to Leduc, where layoffs in the oil patch have fuelled demand for food banks and counselling. And he visited Calgary, where downtown office towers have been hollowed out.

And in the background sits Mr. Trudeau, who has become a target of both Ms. Notley and UCP Leader Jason Kenney. Mr. Kenney in particular has attempted to make the election about Mr. Trudeau as much as the current NDP government.

While everyone seems to have predictions about what will happen, Albertans are also acutely aware of how difficult these things are to call in advance. In the past two elections, the eventual winner was not the party who started the campaign leading in opinion polls (to say nothing of how flawed public opinion polling has been in election after election).

Sarah Hamilton, a city councillor in Edmonton, notes the paradox facing both leaders: Ms. Notley is well-liked, but her NDP is not. And while the UCP is popular, Mr. Kenney isn’t.

“But you have a strange inversion here and so I have no idea how it’s going to end up,” she says.

“I think a lot of people are undecided right now, especially women. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a minority government.”

Around the West:

ALBERTA ELECTION ROUNDUP: Here are a few other things from the second week of the campaign you might have missed:

– UCP Leader Jason Kenney released a health-care platform that would rely on private clinics to alleviate surgical wait times. He also said he would put a pause on supervised drug-consumption sites in order to study their impact.

– NDP Leader Rachel Notley promised provincial drug coverage for middle- and low-income seniors who earn less than $75,000 a year.

– Ms. Notley promised to expand a network of highways that can handle oversized loads.

– Mr. Kenney said a UCP government would get tough on rural crime and would throw out a policy that directs Alberta’s Crown prosecutors to abandon some criminal cases to make sure more serious ones get to court.

– Mr. Kenney is set to release the UCP’s full platform on Saturday.

ABORTION ON VANCOUVER ISLAND: The only abortion clinic on Vancouver Island will no longer offer surgical abortions, after strong demand for the abortion pill, called Mifegymiso, which is a less invasive way to end a pregnancy. Kelly Grant reports on the clinic’s founders, who were instrumental in the fight to bring Mifegymiso to Canada.

B.C. FILM INDUSTRY: British Columbia now steers the lion’s share of Canadian film and television production (40 per cent), followed by Ontario at 32 per cent and Quebec with 20 per cent, according to a new study. The study notes that the expansion in B.C. has been driven by the programming needs of streaming platforms such as Amazon, Netflix and Hulu.

CANOLA: Farmers in the Prairies say they’re extremely disappointed with Ottawa’s handling of the canola crisis, singling out Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for not moving quickly enough to prevent what they say is quickly turning into “the biggest disaster"" in living memory on their farms.

GRIZZLY ATTACK: A coroner says nothing could have been done to prevent the deaths of a mother and her infant daughter, who were killed by an emaciated Grizzly bear near their trapping cabin in the Yukon last November.

ICBC: B.C. is moving motor vehicle accident claims of $50,000 or less to an online dispute-resolution tribunal system as it seems to contain claims costs and delays at the Crown-owned insurance company.

TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE: A First Nations-led group is inviting communities in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan to join a potential bid for a 51-per-cent stake in Ottawa’s Trans Mountain oil pipeline. The Trans Mountain expansion has been stalled in part because of legal action with First Nations who oppose the project.

CALGARY FLAMES: The Calgary Flames’ presence in the NHL playoffs have become a pick-me-up for a city that has been battered by a five-year economic downturn linked to the oil patch. Marty Klinkenberg writes about the energy that has captivated the city, in many ways in spite of Calgary’s economic troubles and an ongoing provincial election that has been particularly nasty (and it’s not even half over).

HUMBOLDT BRONCOS: The owner of a transport truck involved in the deadly Humboldt Broncos bus crash has pleaded guilty to violating provincial and federal safety rules in the months leading up to the collision. Sukhmander Singh of Adesh Deol Trucking, which is no longer in business, was fined a total of $5,000.

Opinion:

Jen Gerson on how the UCP could still lose in Alberta: “The anger of Albertans is neither misguided nor misplaced. Jason Kenney has run a shaky campaign, but if he and the UCP remain a credible vehicle for that anger, then that’s who Alberta will elect. But it’s still too early for him to begin a fitting for a crown just yet.”

Gary Mason on Jason Kenney’s plan to reduce protections extended to LBGTQ students: “Mr. Kenney needs to ask himself whether he’s prepared to risk Alberta’s reputation over a move that is small, petty and mean-spirited, all to serve the interests of a close-minded, intolerant minority. Ahead of a provincial election, Albertans need to ponder that question as well.”

Tony Coulson on what the polls show in Alberta: “Most polling shows the UCP to be well ahead among decided voters, but it’s worth remembering that a significant share of voters remain undecided. The undecided are often factored out of horse race-style polling analysis, but they’re a large group and some could be enticed to the polls. Stranger things have happened in politics.”

David Coletto, chief executive of the Abacus Data polling firm, conducted the survey for the Broadbent Institute, and will discuss its findings at the left-leaning think tank’s annual Progress Summit in Ottawa on Thursday.

David Coletto, chief executive of the Abacus Data polling firm, says a new survey points to a “common concern” that life is getting less affordable in Canada. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO )

The national survey of 2,500 Canadian adults — conducted online between March 3 and 11 — found that 57 per cent of respondents named an affordability concern as the top issue that will determine their vote in this year’s federal election. These issues, identified as top concerns from a list of options, include cost of living, taxes, wages and housing affordability. A comparable, probability-based sample survey of 2,500 people would have a margin of error of plus or minus two per cent, 19 times out of 20. In a memo outlining the results, Coletto points to a “common concern” that life is getting less affordable in Canada, with 68 per cent of respondents saying the cost of things they use and consume daily has gotten “worse” within the last few years. At the same time, 59 per cent said they feel the difference between their personal salaries and those of the “richest one per cent” has gotten “worse,” while a majority — 62 per cent — said the profits of big corporations are better or about the same as they were a few years ago.

“This anxiety seems to be growing and fuelling the rise of populist movements — both on the left and right — which are responding to the pressure and frustration people are feeling,” Coletto writes. For instance, survey respondents who indicated they worry about the cost of living were more likely to agree the economy is creating more threats than opportunities to their quality of life, and that immigrants are a “burden” on jobs, housing and health care. These respondents were also more likely to agree that rich people don’t pay enough taxes and that the government is wasteful and inefficient.

“In short,” Coletto writes, “affordability anxiety causes people to feel like they are being left behind and distrust institutions.” Katrina Miller, director of research at the Broadbent Institute, said the survey tells a “cautionary tale” for political parties in this election year. Even if big picture data suggests the economy is doing well — with low unemployment, continued projected GDP growth, and Statistics Canada showing fewer people live below the poverty line — Miller said political parties should heed signs that many people feel life is getting tougher to afford. “There’s deep anxiety out there about the ability to pay for the things you need in your everyday life,” she said. “Political leaders, political movements, even corporate Canada — if they choose to ignore the very real affordability concerns people have in their lives, they do so at great risk.” In his memo about the survey, Coletto points to results that suggest avenues for political parties to tap into these sentiments. Most respondents who said they worry about affordability said they would choose lower costs over higher wages to assuage their concerns, indicating an openness to pocketbook policies that cut individual and household costs, Coletto writes. Forty-six per cent chose the government forcing companies to reduce the cost of goods as one of three responses to affordability concerns, followed by 45 per cent who said it can cut taxes, and 42 per cent who said it can extend public health care to cover more services. For Miller, some of this aligns with what a progressive party like the NDP — the party most closely associated with the Broadbent summit — can offer voters, whether it is creating a national pharmacare program or cracking down on tax havens used by the rich. But the survey also links almost a third of respondents most worried about the future — dubbed “anxious populists” — with higher levels of support for Conservatives, a finding that Miller said indicates progressives still need to find a way to connect with those most concerned about affordability. “What (the progressive movement) need to do is double down on those areas of alignment,” she said of the NDP. “If we go and listen to where this anxiety stems from, we’ll be better able to tune our offers and proposals.” Clarification: This story was edited on March 28, 2019 to reflect that Katrina Miller was speaking about the progressive movement and not the NDP, when she talks about finding ways to connect with those concerned about affordability.

Using data from Alberta Health Services, the UCP’s official Twitter account, @UniteAlberta, said wait times for open-heart surgery increased 50 per cent from 2014 to 2018; cataract and hip-replacement surgery waits went up 30 per cent; and knee-replacement surgery waits climbed 23 per cent.

What are the facts?

The UCP’s figures are correct. According to Alberta Health Services’ 2017-2018 annual report and performance measures, wait times for some procedures have gone up since 2014 (page 136):

For a coronary artery bypass, the wait was 14.9 weeks in 2014-15 and 22.2 weeks in 2017-18.

For cataract surgery, the wait was 29.9 weeks in 2014-15 and 38.4 weeks in 2017-18.

For hip replacement surgery, the wait was 28.7 weeks in 2014-15, and 36.7 weeks in 2017-18.

For knee replacement surgery, the wait was 33 weeks in 2014-15, and 40.7 weeks in 2017-18.

The report shows wait times for several operations and treatments also went down.

While waits for radiation therapy dropped from 3.1 weeks in 2014-15 to 2.7 weeks in 2017-18, the time to see a radiation oncologist went up, from 4.9 weeks in 2014-15 to 5.3 weeks in 2017-18.

Between 2016 and 2018, the wait time for breast-cancer surgery dropped 66 per cent in Calgary — from 22.2 days to 7.5 days — and 34 per cent in Edmonton — from 14.1 days to 9.3 days.

The percentage of patients receiving urgent hip fracture repair within 48 hours improved from 86 per cent in 2014 to nearly 93 per cent in 2018.

Under the NDP’s Alberta Referral Pathways initiative, the wait time to see a gastrointestinal specialist in Calgary went down 98 per cent.

The Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) released new wait time data on March 28, which also shows patients in Alberta waited longer for hip and knee replacements and cataract surgery in 2018 than two years earlier.

Just 49 per cent of Albertans received cataract surgery within the recommended wait time of 16 weeks in 2018. In all of Canada, it was 70 per cent.

Public policy think-tank Fraser Institute also released a study on Thursday, which found long waits for surgery and medical treatment cost Canadians $2.1 billion in lost wages last year. The study found the average value of time lost during the work week in 2018 for Alberta patients waiting for treatment was $2,538.

The Fraser Institute says factors like aging and growing populations are contributing to the problem across Canada.

What do the experts say?

Wait times are a problem across Canada, according to Ron Kneebone, the scientific director of the social and health policy research program at the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy.

“Wait times are basically the result of a number of factors: how much money you throw at the system, how much time you allow operating rooms to be available. It might surprise you to know that operating rooms do not operate 24 hours a day because they’re expensive to run. A government will sometimes only allow operating rooms to be running for eight or 12 hours a day.

“It’s not an easy solution. It’s not just a matter of: ‘Let’s hire more doctors,’ because then you don’t have enough ORs. It’s not enough to just build more ORs because now you have to have the staff to run them.”

WATCH BELOW (March 21): What to do about health care is an issue that often divides Albertans. Fletcher Kent takes a closer look at the debate and why it’s about more than just health.

The Alberta government budgeted $22.7 billion for health for 2019-2020. That’s up from $19.6 billion in 2015.

READ MORE: Report finds health spending in Canada to reach $242B in 2017

And, according to Kneebone, spending more doesn’t seem to reduce wait times.

“Throwing more money at it does not guarantee a solution,” he said.

“What you need to understand is where are the bottlenecks? What can we do to reduce those bottlenecks? It’s not necessarily money that will solve it. It might just be a better process for recording patients’ records. It might be a better process for getting a patient from one doctor to another so you don’t have to wait for weeks at a time to get a consult.

“They may not cost you any money; it’s just efficiencies and I think that’s what governments need to be looking at… There’s a lot of push back on those sorts of efforts.”

READ MORE: Unstable households account for over a third of health care spending in Saskatoon

“One of the solutions that a lot of people are pushing now is that health should be more broadly defined. Rather than just thinking about fixing things, we should be investing more money in keeping people healthy so they don’t break in the first place.”

READ MORE: Health expert calls for new debates on health-care spending in Alberta

Kneebone says it’s not just the current government that has contributed to this problem.

“Alberta has been under PC governments, too. They’ve been pushing a lot of money towards health care but wait times are not coming down. I’m not sure I’d be blaming the NDs for this. I’m looking at all governments for allowing this to happen. Let there be no mistake: this is not an easy problem to solve.”

Using data from AHS’ 2013-14 annual report, wait times for heart, cataract, hip and knee replacement surgeries went down between 2010 and 2014.

“I know Canadians and Albertans don’t like to think about two-tier health care but do you not think there is two-tier health care with those sorts of wait times?,” Kneebone asked. “I’m not going to wait six months to get a surgery I need. If I can afford to do it, I will go to another province where I can get it done more quickly or I might even have to leave the country.

“These sorts of wait times, when they get that long, it just encourages the evolution of two-tier health care and it’s something governments really need to take seriously and start to address.”

WATCH BELOW (March 21): When the Alberta NDP introduced Bill 1 just before the writ dropped, they made it clear that protecting public health care was a priority. But as Heather Yourex-West reports, Alberta health care as it stands is far from universal.

What are the parties’ positions?

NDP

NDP Leader Rachel Notley has promised to spend another $90 million a year to further reduce surgery wait times if the party is re-elected April 16. Notley says the money would also go toward getting patients quicker care in emergency wards.

With that injection of cash, almost 40,000 Albertans would get faster cancer, open-heart and cataract surgeries over the next three years, she said.

The party also pointed to the $40 million its government invested in wait time reductions in the last budget, which UCP members voted against.

UCP

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney has said he wouldn’t cut health budgets, but would work to reduce bureaucratic bloat in health care and explore private delivery options. Private delivery for minor procedures has improved wait times in other jurisdictions, he said.

Kenney said a UCP government would launch a third-party review of Alberta Health Services to target redundancies and inefficiencies in its 4,000 management positions. The review would include talks with front-line staff and would help determine ways to improve health-care delivery, he said.

A UCP government would mirror Saskatchewan’s surgical model that Kenney said reduced surgical wait times there by 76 per cent by, in part, inviting third-party surgical clinics to bid into the publicly-insured system.

“We will seek to replicate the phenomenal success of the Saskatchewan surgical initiative to meet our goal of a four-month maximum wait time for surgeries.”

Alberta Party

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel said, if elected, his party would decentralize a lot of the decision-making in health care and give that power back to communities.

“It’s allowing communities to make decisions about the priorities they have,” he said. “We would like to see more integration regionally. So for example, Red Deer Hospital needs to be expanded but Red Deer wants to have a catheter program and they should be able to put one in if they can show, within their budget or process, that they can do it. And that goes in other areas.”

The Alberta Party would also invest more money in the specific surgeries that are falling behind and “put the operating time together, so that surgeries can move forward quicker.”

Mandel said he would maintain front-line staff and evaluate the current processes and supports.

“Our health-care system is spectacular. We’re not going to privatize it. There’s a lot of things that could be done to make it more efficient, which we will do.

“Nobody should have to wait the kind of times we’re having in the province of Alberta right now, especially with the money we’re spending on health care. So we need to get to the bottom of that because, it’s not that we’re not putting enough money into the system.”

Liberal Party

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan said, if elected, his party would review how public dollars are spent.

“We would institute full-value-for-money audits across the health system to figure out where we can spend money more wisely and how we can get those wait times down by spending money on the surgeries and less on the bureaucracy.

“One thing we’ve got to look at is: are we using our operating rooms to the most efficient way possible? I know some operating rooms in some hospitals in Alberta are being left unused for large periods of time.”

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada’s energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to “the Notley-Trudeau alliance,” emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada’s former justice minister.

“If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it’s all Rachel Notley,” said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. “The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.”

The UCP’s focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

“(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,” said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta’s energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada’s economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp’s Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley’s camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

“The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn’t call it an alliance,” said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. “A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.”

Where the leaders were Thursday on the campaign trail:

NDP Leader Rachel Notley

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley was in Calgary Thursday where she promised to hire nearly 1,000 more teachers this fall if her party returns to power after the April 16 election.

Notley said an additional 15,000 students are projected to be in classrooms when the next school year starts and it’s critical to give them the supports they need.

She said an NDP government would hire 600 teachers and another 400 would come through a $23-million increase in the province’s classroom improvement fund.

The fund is delivered to schools based on student enrolment and is meant to help retain teachers, hire new ones and pay for resources to help students with complex needs.

Notley also promised that the NDP would spend $1.3 billion to build and upgrade another 70 schools. There would also be money to ensure every new and modernized school came with a playground.

Another $5 million a year would go to replace 100 aging and outdated play areas.

She criticizes her opponent, United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney, for failing to promise to fund enrolment growth. She says that would mean cuts and bigger classrooms.

“Parents need to know when they take their kids to school, they want to know that their child is going to be in a class that’s an appropriate size,” Notley said Thursday.

“(Failing to fund growth) will create chaos and will undermine the quality of education that our kids receive. There’s no need to do that. It’s just the wrong priorities.”

Kenney has said he would keep funding at current levels, and possibly increase it, but would be looking to find savings in administration to get more money to teachers.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney

The leader of Alberta’s United Conservatives said that, if elected, they would open more beds and expand treatment programs to help people battling drug and opioid addictions.

Jason Kenney said a UCP government would not approve new supervised drug consumption sites without extensive consultations with affected communities.

He also said those sites would ideally be accompanied by treatment services.

Kenney said it’s critical to balance help for users with safe neighbourhoods free of discarded needles and to avoid an increase in drug-related crime.

The opioid plan is part of a broader package of health reforms promised by Kenney in the campaign for the April 16 election.

He is promising that he would review health spending to find $200 million in administrative savings.

He said wait times for surgeries under the NDP are falling behind, and he would explore ways to have more day procedures done by private clinics under the public system to improve service and save money.

READ MORE: Alberta Election Fact Check: Did surgery wait times increase under NDP?

Such a system has been successful in Saskatchewan, he said.

“We will seek to replicate the phenomenal success of the Saskatchewan surgical initiative to meet our goal of a four-month maximum wait time for surgery,” Kenney told a news conference Thursday.

Rachel Notley’s New Democrats are running on a promise not to expand private care within the public system, because that can lead to queue-jumping and even higher costs.

The NDP has promised to keep health-care funding sufficient for a growing population and said Kenney’s refusal to match that promise means hardships and delays for patients.

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan

Liberal Leader David Khan was in Calgary on Thursday where he unveiled his party’s fiscal plan, which includes the implementation of an eight per cent provincial sales tax.

Khan said a Liberal government would increase the tax-free limit to $57,250 to eliminate personal income tax for “most Albertans.”

“For couples, $114,500 will be tax-free. Almost two-thirds of Albertans will be exempt from personal income tax under our plan. We will cut personal taxes on the rest of Albertans’ income by one point across the board,” Khan said.

The party would also lower the corporate income tax rate from 12 per cent to 10 per cent. A revenue-neutral eight-per-cent sales tax would also be implemented, Khan said.

“Taxes on Albertans will not increase. We are simply shifting our tax burden from income taxation to a sales tax,” the party said.

“Our bold plan will raise nearly $1 billion a year in additional revenue from out-of-province visitors. It will boost economic growth because reducing personal and corporate taxes encourages hard work and investment. It will give our Alberta government a less volatile and more resilient revenue stream.”

Khan planned to door-knock in Calgary-Mountain View for a few hours Thursday afternoon before taking part in a march supporting gay-straight alliances in Calgary on Thursday evening.

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel said his party would create the first corridor for self-driving vehicles in Canada by adding more lanes to the QEII.

“It’s needed A) upgrading and B) investing in,” Mandel said. “So we’re going to add a third lane to QEII going north and south. We think it’s vitally important and the Red Deer section is an important part of this — the QEII — and I think it’ll help Red Deer a great deal and also help move goods and services through the province of Alberta.”

Mandel said the triple lanes would run all the way between Calgary and Edmonton.

“It’s essential. There’s no sense in doing two lanes part way, it’s just not the way to do it. So we’ll put in a third lane,” he said. It’ll also put a lot of people to work.

Mandel said the work the project would create is especially needed “at a time where business is slow and companies need work.”

“There’s not a lot of municipal work being done as far as servicing land and developing land, so we think it’s a good time to get some reasonable prices too.”

He is a former analyst with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service in Ottawa.

Although it has not stated this explicitly, Beijing in the past week appears to have taken additional retaliatory action against Canada over the detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver last year.

Following the sudden detention of two Canadian nationals on questionable espionage charges and the trumping-up of charges against another jailed Canadian appealing his sentence, the Chinese government is now believed to be weaponizing trade to ramp up the pressure on Ottawa to intervene politically in the Meng case. Beijing has blocked orders of canola seed from two Canadian sellers, Regina-based Viterra Inc. and Winnipeg-based Richardson International Ltd., on the claim that Chinese authorities have discovered dangerous pests in the products. The ban occurs mere weeks before farmers are expected to plant their seed for the season, with potentially disastrous financial consequences for the targeted firms should they be unable to sell their product to a market on which they have become increasingly reliant.

Story continues below advertisement

By singling out the private sector, Beijing hopes to turn the inconvenience and financial harm caused to companies into groups that will lobby the government into abandoning a specific policy that is believed to be detrimental to China. When the government fails to change its policy – in this case, standing its ground in the Meng dispute – affected firms and local and regional economies will increasingly blame politics and the perceived obstinacy of their government for their misfortune. It will lead to temptations to support parties and candidates who advocate for a more conciliatory stance vis-à-vis China. The lesson is simple: Abide by Beijing’s wishes, with their concerns ranging from territorial disputes to differences on politics, and there will be plenty of money to be made through the lifting of bans and the promise of more purchases, and other inducements. Refuse to give in, and your economy will suffer.

If the canola dispute isn’t resolved soon – and we can expect that it won’t – there is good reason to believe that Beijing will further escalate those efforts to take aim at something even more sacred than our economy: Canada’s October federal election. And why not? It’s worked before, in other parts of the world.

In 2012, Beijing took aim at the Philippines – China is a huge market for produce from the country – by cancelling orders of bananas and restricting Chinese tourism amid an escalating territorial dispute in the South China Sea. Once it won its dispute over the Scarborough Shoal following concessions by President Rodrigo Duterte, Beijing lifted the ban and promised to ramp up orders of commercial crops.

And in Taiwan, where I have lived for the past 13 years, I have witnessed first-hand Beijing’s repeated use of financial sticks-and-carrots and how that approach is used to affect electoral outcomes in the democratic island-nation. Taiwanese jurisdictions, such as the southern port city of Kaohsiung where the mayor takes a pro-Beijing stance, are often rewarded with the purchasing of agricultural products, tour groups and investment, while others are punished for being governed by critics of the Chinese ruling party. Taiwan is just one place where Beijing fuels regionalism by playing one province, city, or county off against others.

Given this practice, it is not difficult to imagine that Beijing could adopt a similar divide-and-conquer strategy to polarize Canadian society ahead of the elections, rewarding candidates and provinces that adopt a more Beijing-friendly attitude while refusing to engage those who argue that Canada must continue to abide by the law and stay the course on the Meng issue. Should Beijing opt to ramp up its targeted economic retaliation against vulnerable sectors in the Canadian economy, it is perfectly conceivable that, ahead of October, we could see the emergence of a candidate who encourages Ottawa’s direct involvement in the Meng case by calling for her immediate release, as Beijing has requested.

And while social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become targets of outrage in the wake of their reported use to interfere in elections and incite violence in places like Myanmar and Sri Lanka, Canada cannot ignore WeChat. The social media and messaging app has one billion Chinese-speaking users around the world, and a reputation for spreading fake news and censoring politically sensitive content. A large number of Chinese expatriates and Chinese-Canadians rely on the app, which was in the middle of the controversy around federal Liberal candidate Karen Wang’s efforts to mobilize Chinese-Canadians in Vancouver to vote for her rather than Jagmeet Singh in Burnaby South.

The risk of interference can only grow, with Sino-Canadian relations at a nadir.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney is in Calgary Thursday where he made an announcement regarding “gaps” in the province’s health care system, and providing details of the party’s plan to tackle the opioid crisis.

Part of the UCP’s plan is to reduce increasing administrative costs, Kenney said, adding he expects to find 1-2 per cent of savings in doing a management review.

“We believe there are too many managers managing managers,” Kenney said.

In an effort to combat fentanyl and opioid use, Kenney said the UCP would fund a dedicated opioid investigation team and call on the federal government for mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers and stricter drug controls at the borders.

On safe injection sites, Kenney said the UCP would take a “sensible and compassionate” approach, and would only endorse new sites if extensive consultations with affected communities and socio-economic studies were conducted.

Premier Brian Pallister has dropped another hint that he may push for an election in 2019.

The Manitoba leader dropped the possible idea Friday afternoon at the Met after the Manitoba150 brand launch, which revealed plans for the province’s 150th anniversary celebration in 2020.

“I’ve actually had a lot of Manitobans tell me they don’t want us to combine political stuff with our party [Manitoba150 celebration],” Pallister said.

“They want to celebrate something that unites us.”

Pallister has said in recent months that he has the right to call an early vote.

The Premier said he thinks it's a great idea to put the province ahead of politics, and he thinks partisanship should be separated from the celebrations.

“I agree with us partying like it’s never happened before in 2020, and making sure Manitoba is the focus of our attention,” Pallister said.

The next election is currently set for Oct. 6, 2020.

PROVINCE PROVIDES FUNDING BOOST TO ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION

Meanwhile, the Premier announced that the province will contribute $2.5 million towards next year’s festivities.

In addition, it will match private donations that could lead to up to $5 million in funding.

“This is a very generous gift,” said Stuart Murray, chair of the Manitoba150 Host Committee.

“This is an opportunity for the proud companies who call Manitoba ‘home’ and give them a chance to participate.”

The Manitoba150 Host Committee unveiled a new logo, website and theme – “United in Celebration” for the province’s sesquicentennial, a theme focused on Indigenous culture. The event will commemorate the anniversary of The Manitoba Act receiving the royal assent, followed by the province joining the Canadian Confederation.

Murray said the committee aims to attract a local and national crowd.

“We want you to be local tourists,” Murray said.

“We will invite Canadians to come to the best province, the heart of Canada, to celebrate in 2020.”

Murray said the event’s budget is in the process of being finalized and expects announcements to be made as 2020 approaches.

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada's so-called ""tax gap"" to show it can finance big campaign commitments — in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare — by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

article continues below

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40 billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

""The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,"" Julian said in an interview.

""You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion or higher... And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people's lives.""

Details about the NDP's fiscal approach follow last week's release of the final federal budget before October's election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget's release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn't say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party's poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP's ""social democratic economic vision.""

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party's plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness — and he expects this time to be different.

""I think what we needed in 2015 is what we'll have in 2019 — which is the PBO report on the tax gap,"" Julian said. ""In a sense, we're coming with far more evidence to support what we're saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.""

Other political parties have shown interest that the forthcoming tax gap report could be a source of new fiscal space for election promises, said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer.

But Giroux warned any federal government would need to make considerable efforts before they can turn the tax gap estimate into a source of revenue.

""We have to be somewhat prudent because even if we come up with an estimate that's high — and I'm not saying it's the case — it's only the beginning,"" Giroux said in an interview.

""It's been four years. We had a mandate and fulfilled it,"" MacLauchlan told reporters when asked about the early call. ""This is an opportunity to ask Islanders for their confidence to build on that record.""

Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Greens seen as a legitimate contender for power.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Progressive Conservatives a party of chaos and opposition -- saying they've had five leaders in four years -- and suggested the Greens would be too risky.

""The Green Party is untested, and the future of our province is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments, led by a career politician,"" he said.

Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, a dentist, became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and the Greens snagged a second seat in a 2017 byelection.

A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan -- a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier -- is personally unpopular.

""It's about people. It's about you -- and it's about time that the government of the people of P.E.I. understand, respect and live by that message,"" the PC party said in a tweet as MacLauchlan was making his election call.

The Greens, meanwhile, posted a clip Tuesday night of Bevan-Baker playing ""First Call"" on his trumpet.

""What a wonderful way to begin the writ period -- with a blast from Peter's trumpet,"" the party said on Facebook.

In his speech, MacLauchlan touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half.

""Prince Edward Island is working,"" he told the enthusiastic partisan crowd. ""There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and thrive.""

The standings at dissolution in the Island legislature were 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories. The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890.

MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day.

He is scheduled to make his first campaign stop Wednesday morning in Charlottetown.

The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform -- asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model.

It won't be the first time P.E.I. voters have been asked to consider electoral reform.

In fact, they voted 52 per cent in favour of switching to mixed member proportional reform during a plebiscite in 2016, but MacLauchlan rejected the results because of a low turnout of about 36 per cent.",Liberal premier calls Prince Edward Island election for April 23,Atlantic CTV News,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/liberal-premier-calls-prince-edward-island-election-for-april-23-1.4353298
12,World,2019-03-27T23:13:00.0000000Z,"Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist ... But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday. Her father was charged with first degree murder and died a few days later in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We’re mere weeks into a new year and there have been at least four femicides across Canada already. It’s time for us to demand that the lives of women and girls in Canada be prioritized.",The Election Issue That Isn’t Even On Politicians’ Radar,Chatelaine,https://www.chatelaine.com/opinion/femicide-the-election-issue-that-isnt-even-on-politicians-radar/

Subscribers from elsewhere in Canada will get Markusoff’s daily briefing beneath all the need-to-know from Ottawa. Sign up below. (If you subscribe to the Maclean’s Politics Insider, you’re already registered.)

To get you caught up on Alberta politics and to give you a taste of what to expect from the newsletter, here are some of our recent Maclean’s features and articles:

This is Notley and her NDP on pre-election footing, polling well behind Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives and their more aggressive posture toward pipelines and anyone who dares not to advocate for them. She’s largely denied critics the opportunity to label her anti-pipeline, and perhaps it’s her best shot at regaining acceptance—Notley has taken the NDP’s old reputation for Prairie pragmatism and dunked it in oil.

In question period, the governing side often attacks more than it defends, as if it’s auditioning to be the official opposition. With this massive advantage, Kenney plans to test how much of a rightward correction Albertans are willing to make. More than just angling to erase the NDP’s four-year imprint on Alberta, he wishes to roll back the political moderation of the Progressive Conservatives before that, too.

Jen Gerson: We may yet see another oil boom, or two. There will probably be applications for oil and plastics over the next century, and Alberta should be doing everything within its power to supply that demand. But it’s a pretty safe bet that global demand for oil is going to abate within my lifetime, as climate change policies, decarbonization efforts and new technologies come to the fore. These shifts are already starting to happen. My child—a toddler today—will probably drive an electric car. He may never learn to drive at all. So what, exactly, is the plan?

For nine years, Kenney sat in a Harper cabinet beset by competing impulses: on one hand, avid conservatism, on the other, incrementalism—the idea that Canadians had to be brought along gradually to accept the Conservative agenda on taxes and programs. A deﬁning question in the run-up to Alberta’s next election is how much cautious incrementalism Kenney will employ, or how free he’ll feel to untether his conservative id.

As a midterm examination of sorts, Maclean’s interviewed dozens of voters in some parts of Alberta where NDP support surged in 2015. In those pockets of give-them-a-shot open-mindedness, many feel whipsawed by the degree of change Albertans got, and fairly certain some corrective action must loom ahead.",Alberta Politics Insider: Special newsletter edition for the petro-province’s election,Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/politics/alberta-election-2019-politics-insider-newsletter/

This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs ...","Politicians talk about what they want to talk about and not what’s necessarily important and relevant to Canadians. There are taboo subjects that no political party will address. Tax laws that legally allow affluent Canadians to use tax havens to avoid paying tax are highly relevant to all Canadians. They’re also at the top of the list of taboo topics political parties refuse to talk about. Canada’s tax regulations have created a two-tier tax system, one for the rich and one for everyone else. Some have called this economic discrimination.

It’s estimated by some experts that the annual lost government revenue due to the legal use of tax havens by individuals is $5 billion, or $25 billion over five years. These billions could fund numerous elections promises without adding to Canada’s deficit. This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs over five years. It represents the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs. This lost revenue would enhance the lives of all Canadians, instead of benefiting only Canada’s affluent.

These affluent Canadians are not tax-cheats or tax evaders, nor are they abusing our tax system. They are adhering fully to Canada’s tax laws. These laws need to change.

These lost billions represent the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs.

The October 2019 election represents the only opportunity for Canadian voters to prohibit affluent Canadians from using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. We need to demand political parties engage in discussions about this “taboo” issue before the October election. For instance, in next week’s federal budget.

Politicians don’t talk about the Panama and Paradise Paper disclosures, in which thousands of affluent Canadians were identified as having used tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This represents only a fraction of the number of affluent Canadians who benefit from offshore tax havens.

The difference between tax evaders and tax avoiders is that tax avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is illegal. Tax evaders are hunted down by the Canada revenue Agency and face the possibility of going to jail.

By contrast, affluent Canadians who use tax havens are law-abiding citizens, free to continue doing the same year after year. This will only change if Canadians demand our government close tax loopholes. But we are reluctant to take to the streets and challenge political parties to address this issue.

Tax reform that prohibits the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians is not radical. U.S. citizens are forbidden to use tax havens to avoid paying taxes. It is a criminal offence. They respect the sacred principle of tax fairness, under which all citizens must pay their fair share of taxes. In Canada, we have a two-tier tax system, which is unfair and unjust.

The losers in all of this are “average” Canadians. Tax avoidance is a dominant factor for Canadians having inadequate health care and social programs. Investments are not being made to growth industries that would allow them to compete domestically and globally. “Average” Canadians are paying more taxes while our government debt is growing at a staggering rate. This should not be allowed to continue.

A 2017 Environics poll found that nine out of 10 Canadians say the use of tax havens is morally wrong, and 87 per cent said they would like to see tax-haven use criminalized. This poll is an indication as to how voters in October’s federal election might respond to a political party advocating for tax reform.

Both individual and corporate tax avoidance laws are crippling Canada. Solutions to tax avoidance by individuals can be addressed by voting for political parties committed to closing tax loopholes. The nature of corporate tax avoidance is complex and requires long-term solutions.

The goal of The Grassroots Coalition for Tax Reform, is to pressure political parties to address the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians, in their election platforms. Let’s all tell them how we feel. This policy issue should no longer be taboo.

NDP leader Rachel Notley so far has pledged to spend roughly $4.5 billion over a number of years, notably $1.5 billion over five years to expand a $25-a-day child-care program province-wide and $1.35 billion over six years to build a new highway out of Fort McMurray.

Notley has said the child-care program would increase employment, largely with more women entering the workforce, adding $5.95 billion to Alberta’s gross domestic product.

The Fort McMurray road plan, she said, would create 7,500 jobs and ensure Alberta roads will be able to handle the expansion of oil and gas development.

But the UCP is concerned with the high-spending commitments, arguing Alberta is facing accumulated debt of $58.6 billion and can’t handle more deficit spending.

Notley has said her spending plans won’t break the bank, but the UCP believes she has a secret plan to increase taxes, which so far is an unsubstantiated claim.

Other commitments of Notley’s include $110 million annually to give seniors with annual incomes of less than $75,000 full-coverage for prescription drugs and eliminating co-payments, $90 million per year to reduce surgical wait times, a $23 million-per-year boost to the Classroom Improvement Fund and $5 million per year to replace 100 aging playgrounds.

She has also pledged to double incentives for petrochemical companies from $3.6 billion to $7 billion through royalty credits, loan guarantees and grants, which she believes would leverage $70 billion in investment and create 70,000 jobs by 2030.

Rural crime:

The UCP officially unveiled its crime platform this week, notably announcing details that will affect rural communities.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he would pursue ways rural Albertans could use reasonable force as self-defence, which would require changes to the Criminal Code of Canada.

“We’re not advocating for vigilantism here. People should not take the law into their own hands, but they have every right to use reasonable force in self-defence, especially when they’re in a remote area and feeling vulnerable,” he said.

Kenney said a UCP government would spend $37 million on crime reduction initiatives, with $20 million of those funds for the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams, $10 million for more crown prosecutors and support staff, $5 million to expand drug treatment court and $2 million for electronic monitoring technology.

He said he would shred the provincial directive that mandates crown prosecutors to triage cases based on the Jordan principle, a Supreme Court decision that requires cases to go to trial in a timely manner.

Under the NDP government, the province spent $10 million on a rural crime strategy, hiring more RCMP officers to address chronic offenders and hiring more crown prosecutors.

RCMP say the strategy is working so far, with property crime falling 11 percent and officers laying more charges against offenders.

Kenney said he would keep the NDP’s plan intact if the UCP forms government.

Health:

The UCP announced it would maintain or increase health spending, reviewing the performance of Alberta Health Services.

Any savings found in reviewing AHS, Kenney said, would be re-invested back into the health-care system.

The platform also addresses the province’s opioid crisis, which sees people die daily from drug overdose.

He said a UCP government would spend $100 million over four years to expand mental health and addictions services, as well as provide additional funding for a tele-health program, allowing rural Albertans to receive prescriptions for opioid treatment.

Any safe consumption sites, which allow users to safely consume opioids and access treatment, would have to go through a socio-economic analysis under a UCP government before they could begin operating.

The UCP would provide an additional $1 million to the Alberta Health Quality Council, which measures outcomes for patients, as well as increase the number and scope of nurse practitioners, opticians and paramedics, and lift the cap on midwifery services.

The party also pledged to reduce wait times for surgery by 75 percent for those waiting three months or longer.

Gay-straight alliances in schools:

Large rallies against an aspect of the UCP’s education platform took place this week in Edmonton and Calgary after Kenney outlined a plan that would roll back some protection for LGBTQ youth in schools.

The plan overshadowed other aspects of Kenney’s education platform, given gay-straight alliances (GSAs) are a charged topic in Alberta.

GSAs are peer-support groups that offer safe spaces in schools, similar to many school clubs, and let LGBTQ students and allies connect with another to discuss life challenges.

The NDP government ensured under law that teachers couldn’t tell parents that their kids were attending GSAs, given some LGBTQ kids wouldn’t want their parents to know their sexual orientation. They also say they would not want teachers to possibly out them in public.

Under Kenney’s proposal, however, teachers would be able to tell a parent if their kid is attending a GSA.

He said in some circumstances it makes sense for the parent to be involved in the child’s life, particularly if the child has severe mental health issues and needs professional medical attention.

Many teachers support the NDP law, arguing they wouldn’t feel comfortable telling parents about their child being involved in a GSA.

Youth at the rallies in Edmonton and Calgary were also adamantly opposed to Kenney’s plan, chanting, “Hey Jason, leave our kids alone.”

Kenney’s proposal would also allow charter schools, some of which are private Christian schools, to not have GSAs. He said the party supports GSAs but religious views must be taken into account. Under his proposal, public and catholic schools would still need to have one.

Under the NDP law, all schools, including charters, are required to have GSAs if a student requests one. Charter schools receive large amounts of provincial funding.

As for other aspects of the UCP education platform, Kenney said it would review the funding model for rural schools, implement provincial achievement tests for Grade 3, and introduce standardized math tests for Grade 1, 2 and 3.

RCMP investigating Kenney campaign:

The RCMP is looking into uncorroborated claims of voter fraud during Kenney’s 2017 leadership campaign.

Former UCP MLA Prab Gill, who was turfed from the party for his own ballot-stuffing scandal, wrote in a letter to RCMP alleging the Kenney campaign obtained fake email addresses, which were attached to names of real Albertans, and used those email addresses to obtain passcode numbers to vote in the UCP leadership race.

Votes were done in bulk batches at computer kiosk stations, Gill alleged in the letter, and were set up to work around voting limits per computer.

Kenney has maintained the party has followed all rules and that the UCP legal council has offered assistance to RCMP in the investigation.

“I have not been contacted personally or asked for an interview, but I would comply if I was,” Kenney said earlier this week.

Kenney has also been embroiled in a scandal involving irregular political contributions to Jeff Callaway’s campaign during the UCP leadership race, which the RCMP is also investigating.

Kenney has denied any personal involvement in contributing or funding the Callaway campaign, though it is evident that members of Kenney’s campaign team communicated with Callaway members to undermine former Wildrose leader Brian Jean, who ran for the UCP leadership but lost.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

Scroll through your Facebook feed and you’ll see it’s the Wild West for political advertisers on Facebook, communication experts say. As Alberta heads to the polls on April 16, political parties and third-party advertisers are corralling votes through mobile apps and online advertising.



All of this comes as online advertisers and platforms face increasing scrutiny from federal regulators concerned with interference that could ultimately influence election results.

Going Mobile

However, new federal rules won’t impact Albertans who will see their fair share of targeted political messages this coming provincial election.Targeted Facebook AdsFacebook ads are excellent for reaching audiences advertisers want to connect with. But, it’s the ability to target ads at specific demographics that has some experts, like analyst Sara Bannerman, worried.“What’s concerning to me is the lack of transparency. That we really don’t have a tool for monitoring what kind of advertising is out there,” says Bannerman, the Research Chair in Communication Policy and Governance at McMaster University.Bill C-76, introduced by the federal government last December, is attempting to force online platforms to maintain a sharable database of political advertisements.Google Canada has already decided they won’t be hosting political ads for the next Federal Election due to that requirement. In the U.S., U.K., India, and Brazil, Facebook maintains ad libraries that track who purchases political ads, how much they paid, and how the ads performed.Facebook promises to launch a Canadian ad archive in June, before the next federal election, but after Alberta’s provincial election.Under Alberta law, political advertisers only need to disclose their expenses to Elections Alberta. However, Bannerman insists more information, including how organizations are aiming particular messages to certain groups and which groups are being targeted with specific ads, should be shared with the public.“If ads are only seen by the people who [are meant to] see them, then we’re not even participating in the same conversation.”

Mobile apps are one of the newer tools being made available by political parties. Apps can be used to communicate directly with supporters, gather data, and organize campaigns.

Peter Ryan, public relations professor at Mount Royal University, says Albertans should be concerned about how easily these apps collect users’ private information.

The Alberta NDPs app Forward is the only mobile app made available to the general public.

“If they’re downloading a partisan app, we don’t know what information is getting collected by that party … we don’t know how [the data] is being used, and what effect it will have on the election.”



Ryan added there is also no way of knowing what security is in place in the event of a hack.



So far, the Alberta NDP’s app, Forward, is the only one available within the Google Play and Apple app stores.



The app requests biographical information such as name, constituency, phone number, and email.



However, as of March 14, the app wasn’t completely accessible to the public, as users who provided basic information, and granted notification and text message permissions were never sent the invitation code needed to access any in-app content.

Third-party advertisers

While political parties will be doing their share of advertising online, they’re not the only ones with a stake in this election.

Organizations not affiliated with political parties can spend up to $150,000 on advertising, per legislation introduced by the current government back in 2017.

Third-party advertisers and other groups not directly linked to political parties have the capacity and legal ability to advertise as well, which Ryan says is going to show us a lot about their role in our politics.



“We will learn which political parties will be able to leverage the third-party space to effectively amplify their messages to strategically frame their opposition and drive voters to the polls to support their election policies.”



While these third parties can advertise, they are required by law to register with Elections Alberta but can spend no more than $150,000 on advertising.



The Alberta Federation of Labour, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, and political-action organizations like Shaping Alberta’s Future are three examples of groups registered as third-party political advertisers with Elections Alberta.

Unregistered groups

Public Facebook groups with thousands of members can spread suspicious news articles to non-members through sharing.

While registered third parties will have their spending monitored by the province, Ryan raises the issues of groups who may not be receiving or spending any money at all, but still exerting great influence.



“If you aren’t receiving any money you can still have a [Facebook] group and post away,” says Ryan.



“A huge group right now is the Yellow Vest movement online, over 100,000 people are following it. That could influence a provincial election.”



Yellow Vests Canada identifies itself as a group that supports the building of pipelines and opposes carbon taxes, globalists and ‘treason’ committed by Canadian politicians. The group’s Facebook page is filled with posts by members sharing from sources such as Debate Post which makes unsubstantiated claims, often about immigration or Prime Minister Trudeau.



Ryan encourages voters to be critical of posts they see online and attempt to verify what they see with trusted media outlets and official government sources, like Elections Alberta.



“If it’s not the mainstream media reporting or circulating information to you, I would say consumers beware of that information.”

For many people living with dementia — and their informal caregivers — cognitive decline is a crushing disease that slowly destroys intellect and memories.

Dr. Samir Sinha in the Acute Care for Elders Unit at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. ( Nick Kozak / Toronto Star )

Amidst this heartbreak is another sad reality: society so fears dementia that it stigmatizes people with the disease, adding to their isolation. Now, after years of waiting, Canadians have the start of a national dementia strategy that could alleviate some of that pain. The recent federal budget contains a $50-million, five-year commitment for a strategy to support Canadians with cognitive decline, their caregivers and the health professionals who manage or research the disease. Details will be announced later this spring, and the Public Health Agency of Canada is to oversee the roll-out of the strategy.

It had better be worth the wait. In Canada, half a million people now have dementia, with the number expected to top 900,000 in 15 years. By that time, in the 2030s, cognitive decline will cost the health-care system and families more than $20 billion a year. This isn’t a disease that only impacts “others.” A surprising number of us know someone touched by dementia. Many have given up jobs to care for a loved one at home, only to grow exhausted, accept the finality of a nursing home and watch a mother, father or spouse grow isolated in the rush of institutional care. Some watch those families struggle and declare a preference for Canada’s medically assisted suicide, if they were to get the same disease. Perhaps it’s just gallows humour, but too many people see only a bleak future with limited options for support. Globally, Canada is joining 32 other countries that already have strategies in place, a late entry precipitated by legislation called the National Strategy for Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias Act. Now that there’s money in the (pre-election) budget to back the strategy, Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor must ensure that dementia is declared a national health priority. And that’s just the start.

To her credit, Petitpas Taylor has created a strong foundation, with a ministerial advisory board that includes leading geriatricians, a scientist, nurse and advocates, as well members living with dementia and caregivers. All their perspectives are important. Their recommendations will help form the national vision for the strategy, enhancing the work of provincial strategies such as those in Ontario, Alberta and Quebec. Board members like the CEO of The Alzheimer Society of Canada, Pauline Tardif (who is co-chair), and Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics for Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto, have long spoken of ideas for change.

For example, the Alzheimer Society rightly wants a public awareness campaign that talks about the possibilities of dementia prevention, telling us about the relationship between brain health and exercise, a heart-healthy diet, life-long learning and socialization. Clearly, we still need education on cognitive decline to end its terrible, isolating stigma. A 2018 online survey commissioned by the society found that half the 1,500 participants said they would not want others to know if they had dementia; one in four said they would feel ashamed or embarrassed if they had the disease. Let’s use the national strategy to change our views of the disease. Explain how cognitive decline begins, with the high school math teacher, the real estate lawyer or the manager of the local grocery store. Make it real. Help us understand that people with dementia are our next-door neighbours, our parents, ourselves. Allow us to grow familiar and unafraid so we can help people with the disease feel included in life — and the local coffee shop or art gallery — instead of afraid and alone. And as Dr. Sinha says, leverage the money for research seeking a cure but also, research the best options for care, like emotion-focused programs that show promise in a few nursing homes. Those best practices should spread to home care or adult day programs, which can help people live at home. Training for health care professionals is key to the strategy’s success. New education must include vitally important soft skills like empathy and emotional intelligence. Workers must learn how to relate to people who are living in memories from say, 1942, seeking comfort from a parent, or waiting for a child to come home for dinner, reliving the days when there was a vibrant purpose to life. Consider it a second language, a way to communicate with people who live through their feelings, not intellect. If the public awareness strategy has one prevailing theme, it should be this: one day dementia will become personal. Research shows that after our traditional retirement age, the odds of developing cognitive decline will roughly double every five years. Sinha, who created much of Ontario’s dementia strategy, says Canada now has the opportunity create a vision that is “not just great on paper, but truly impactful. Not just transactional, but transformational. “Because, we all need it. Any of us who expect to make it to 65? There’s a good chance we will actually be living with dementia down the road.” Canada needs to turn its strategy into action.",Canada’s national strategy on dementia must break the cycle of shame,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2019/03/29/canadas-national-strategy-on-dementia-must-break-the-cycle-of-shame.html

When Donald Trump was elected in 2016, many of us Canadians wagged our fingers smugly at our southern neighbour. “What were they thinking?” we said to one another in line at Tim Hortons. We spent the next year or so glued to CNN, more captivated by American politics than what’s happening here.

We might have wanted to pay more attention.

The tide in the Great White North appears to be shifting right — but not in the way we’re used to. This isn’t a typical liberal-conservative tug-o-war, the ebb and flow we’ve seen throughout election cycles. This new movement is one that has already swept through Hungary, Poland, the U.S., it’s fuelled Brexit in the U.K. and has seen the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, who have been compared to the Nazi regime. And it’s tilted so far to the right that it threatens to upend our democracy and the very liberties we’ve fought for.

While conservatives have historically called for less government regulation, lower taxes and a stronger military, today’s Canadian right-wing politics has rebranded itself to include more visible intolerance. Bigotry isn’t just bubbling under the surface these days, it’s out in the open and proudly displayed for when the guests come over.

This ugly, newfound boldness threatens to dominate the next federal election, impacting not only the world’s view of us a fair, diverse and welcoming country, but also the lives of all marginalized Canadians. That keeps me up at night.

As a gay mother with a trans child in the Ontario school system, and as a human rights advocate who spends a lot of time on social media, I’m on the receiving end of a lot of messages from people who think it’s “about time” politicians start standing up to “special interest groups.” We’ve been coddled for too long, they say, and we don’t deserve special treatment. They mock, namecall and outright threaten those of us who fight for the rights of marginalized people to be preserved. They’ve always done this, of course, but their voices, now embolded by the very politicians and public figures they support, are growing in number and getting angrier. I’ve had to file two police reports after my life was threatened — and those are only the incidents I reported.



This swing to the populist right is both in our face and insidious. Donald Trump might be loud and brash, but his win was unexpected by most. We surveyed the damage from up north, thinking it couldn’t possibly happen here. Surely, Canadians know better. We didn’t.

Modern populism has grown quietly, from the pages of right-wing websites to the birth of new neo-fascist groups such as the Proud Boys, now designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Support for the populism movement gained traction through one protest, one meeting, and one tweet at a time. Now it’s loud and it’s everywhere. It unseated Premier Kathleen Wynne and her Ontario government, with Premier Doug Ford and the Conservatives promising little more than a buck-a-beer and the end of teaching gender identity in schools.

And then, in October 2018, Premier Ford met privately with university professor Jordan Peterson. While the premier openly discussed other meetings that had taken place around that time, the public only learned of this one after the CBC obtained his itinerary through a freedom of information request.

Wildly popular in some right-wing circles, Peterson’s views have been slammed as retrograde, problematic and dangerous. He became well-known after taking a stand against using trans people’s chosen pronouns, claiming being forced to do so is an attack on free speech. He argued vehemently against the federal Liberal government’s now-passed trans rights bill, speaking in front of the senate committee overseeing the bill, and warned his followers about the dangers of “compelled speech.” Peterson has also proposed “enforced monogamy” as a way to reduce male violence and believes “crazy women” can’t be controlled by men because men can’t resort to physical violence against them.

Despite, or, perhaps, because of these views, Peterson, who teaches at the University of Toronto, earns tens of thousands of dollars monthly from his Patreon account, a site where fans can pledge financial support to creators of all stripes. These donations are given to him by admirers, many of them Canadians.

Ford, meanwhile, campaigned heavily on the removal of Ontario’s most current incarnation of the sex-ed curriculum, and followed through — a move that has earned much criticism and more than one lawsuit. However, it was also, in part, what earned his party a majority government. A slew of Ontarians has proudly come out in support of Ford’s policies, including the removal of mandatory student funding for certain college and university services, such as pride centres.

A week before meeting with Premier Ford, Peterson had spoken out in a tweet against the Ontario Human Rights Commission, claiming it to be the most “dangerous” organization in Canada, and calling for the Ford government to abolish it. Peterson has previously said he doesn’t agree with the OHRC’s support of gender identity and gender expression. The OHRC had just joined the legal fight against the Ontario provincial government’s removal of the sex-ed curriculum, which covered LGBTQ+ issues, consent and cyber-bullying.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission does exactly what the name implies: using the Ontario Human Rights Code as its guide, it strives to protect all Ontarians from discrimination and harassment. Those who are fiscally-minded might also appreciate how the OHRC first tries to resolve issues between parties out of court, taking the less-expensive mediation approach. It is not the country’s most dangerous organization, but its dismantling could certainly be very dangerous.

The timing of this secret meeting should ring alarm bells for liberals and conservatives alike. Protecting human rights is, after all, supposed to be a closely-held Canadian value.

Trump’s 2016 victory was a dog whistle for bigotry that reached the ears of Canadians. Doug Ford has proven Ontario will welcome similar politics, while Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, a federal right-wing party formed in 2018, has over 30,000 members and a social media presence that speaks out against “political correctness” and “diversity nonsense.”

Taking a page from the Yellow Vest movement in France, the Facebook group “Yellow Vests Canada” has more than 100,000 members. What began as a place to organize protests around the country quickly became a spot where anti-Liberal sentiments and memes are circulated around the clock, several going so far as to call for the Prime Minister’s death. Immigration is regularly condemned, and Islamophobia is dismissed as a made-up word.

While some of the most offensive posts have been removed over recent weeks, the views are still crystal clear. This group isn’t just anti-tax and pro-oil, it’s filled to the brim with intolerance. This message is consistent throughout provincial groups as well, such as BC Proud, Alberta Proud and Ontario Proud. With a combined total of hundreds of thousands of members in these groups, cries of fake news and the danger of refugees abound.

These sentiments don’t just live online.

Statistics Canada reported hate crimes had reached historically high levels in 2017, rising 47 per cent over the previous year, with Ontario and Quebec leading the pack on reported incidents. Black, Jewish and Muslim people were targeted most. Quebec saw a 50 per cent increase in hate crimes overall, and crimes against Muslims tripled between 2016 and 2017. In January of 2017, a shooter killed six men and injured several others in a Quebec City Mosque. Meanwhile, Ontario saw a 207 per cent increase in hate crimes against Muslims, and an 84 per cent increase against Black people. Crimes against LGBTQ+ people have also climbed. Swastikas have been spray painted on synagogues and other buildings across the country. Intolerance is growing.

Populism has many sources. Perhaps there are people who are tired of looking inward and are now lashing outward. Maybe, for some, it’s simpler to blame immigrants when they can’t find work than the companies who cut minimum wage jobs and still pay their executives millions in bonuses. Maybe it’s easier to find a scapegoat, to call someone like me a child abuser for supporting my transgender teen, than it is to grow and broaden our ideas of what’s normal.

Societal change can be hard and it can make people uncomfortable, but that’s a flimsy excuse for discrimination.

Intolerance has never gone away, it was simply out of fashion for a while. Now it’s back with a fresh new look and a boost from fake news and social media.

We should all care deeply about this frightening political shift and where it could take us.

I know I care, which is why I’m so scared about what’s happening in this country, and what’s yet to come.

Wernick said he is concerned somebody will be assassinated in the upcoming ...","On Monday, Trudeau appointed former Justice Minister Anne McLellan as a ""special adviser"" to examine the question of whether or not the two roles should be made separate.

""The events of the last few weeks have raised important questions about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice and Attorney General of Canada,"" a statement from Trudeau's office read.

""Ms. McLellan will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and Attorney General of Canada … She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the (minister).""

Opposition MPs also took issue with Wernick's alarming statements on foreign interference in the upcoming election, as well as the tone and tenor of political discourse in Canada.

Wernick said he is concerned somebody will be assassinated in the upcoming campaign. He also tabled seven angry messages sent to him after his first committee appearance, saying they constituted ""intimidation of a witness.""

As clerk, Wernick was the most senior member of a five-person committee tasked with assessing possible foreign intervention in the upcoming election — and whether or not the Canadian public should be warned.

Last week, the opposition parties expressed no confidence in his ability to do that.

The task now falls to Ian Shugart, who Trudeau named as Wernick's replacement on Monday. Shugart is a lifelong bureaucrat and the current deputy minister of foreign affairs.

Global Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that Shugart is ""someone I trust completely, someone who is 100 per cent devoted to the Canadian national interest, and someone with excellent judgment.""

""I can't think of a better person to fill the role,"" Freeland said.

""I want to thank Michael Wernick for his extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades,"" Trudeau told reporters outside the House of Commons.

""We've accomplished a lot as a government over these past three and a half years, and it was definitely in large part because of extraordinary public service and Michael Wernick's leadership.""

The Calgary city councillor didn’t hesitate to respond to the calls of political allies when the provincial election was called earlier this month. When he’s not tied up with city business, Chu will spend the next few weeks door-knocking with United Conservative Party candidates.

He says it’s better for councillors to be transparent about where their loyalties lie. “I’m a conservative and so aligned with the UCP. I have always said that, I am who I am,” Chu says.

“Something I’ve learned: if everybody knows that you’re this kind of person, admit it. Some people don’t like it, but at least I can sleep at night.”

For most councillors, a provincial election campaign is a welcome chance to escape the spotlight temporarily focused on the fight for power among organized parties. But council has also never been immune to partisan politics.

Since the campaign kicked off on March 19, several councillors have waded into the fray to defend political allies or to bolster projects and issues.

Some have been vocal about their loyalties, including councillors Chu, Joe Magliocca and Jeromy Farkas who have openly endorsed the UCP’s Jason Kenney.

On the opposite side of the political spectrum, Coun. Druh Farrell says she’s tried to avoid explicitly partisan positions in past elections, but not this time. On Twitter, she has publicly praised the NDP’s platform on flood mitigation for the Bow River and universal childcare, stopping short of explicitly endorsing the party — though she has donated to them in the past.

The inner-city councillor has also been strident in her social media criticism of the UCP, particularly after it was revealed that two high profile UCP candidates, who have since quit, had made racist, homophobic and transphobic comments online.

“There are so many issues that impact the city that it’s impossible to sit this one out,” Farrell says. “I can’t be neutral with this particular election, there’s too much at stake.”

A handful of the current crop of council members have past partisan experience or connections at the provincial level. Chu and Diane Colley-Urquhart have both run unsuccessfully for elected office under the former Progressive Conservative party banner.

A card-carrying member of the UCP and the federal Conservative party, Farkas formerly served as president of the Wildrose constituency in Calgary-Elbow. He says he feels strongly about municipal politicians being “up front” about their views.

“Every single politician has these leanings, some people just prefer to be more transparent about it than others,” he said.

Farkas, who is openly bisexual, also made the biggest splash of any councillor in the campaign so far by defending the UCP leader this week on Twitter after Kenney’s record on LGTBQ issues came under fire.

“The issue just kind of touched a nerve for me,” he said. “I hate when conservatives are cast as bigots when we aren’t.”

I never make mention of my personal orientation, but I feel compelled to make an exception. As an #LGBTQ+ Albertan, I want to make clear that there are few leaders who have done as much as for the global LGBTQ+ community as @jkenney. #abvote #ucp — Jeromy Farkas (@JeromyYYC) March 22, 2019

Farkas, who suffered bullying as a youth, has defended Kenney’s proposal which would roll back privacy protections for kids who join gay-straight alliances (GSAs). He says the UCP policy will ultimately be in line with similar protections in jurisdictions like Ontario and B.C.

“I take this very seriously and I think we should leave that decision in the hands of very highly trained professionals — the teachers who would do nothing besides (what is in) the best interests of the kids involved,” Farkas said. “I think a balance needs to be struck.”

Other councillors have donated money and time to candidates running in the provincial election. As recorded by Elections Alberta, councillors Magliocca, Chu and Peter Demong have donated to the former PC party. Farrell is a past contributor to the NDP and George Chahal was a contributor to the now-defunct Wildrose party.

Most councillors have assiduously avoided making their partisan preference publicly known on the grounds that it complicates things once the election is over.

Councillors like Shane Keating, Jyoti Gondek and Demong have, instead, raised the public profile of specific projects or issues, including funding for the Green Line and the Springbank dry dam, or pushing for modernization of rules on waste and recycling.

Gondek has been advocating for provincial candidates to consult municipalities on where future schools should be built. She says she scrutinizes candidates based on their knowledge of the riding and neighbourhoods they’re hoping to represent.

“I’m spoiled. I had a very good experience with my elected representative pushing for things that we needed,” Gondek said, praising outgoing Calgary-Northern Hills NDP MLA Jamie Kleinsteuber.

“I don’t know what that’s going to look like after April 16. I’m hoping it’s someone that’s from the community, (who) understand it and is passionate — but I don’t know.”

Coun. Gian-Carlo Carra says he tries to be non-partisan but admits there is a “Re-elect Joe Ceci” lawn sign in front of his home in southeast Calgary.

“My wife’s passionate and I’m not going to stand in her way. I can’t stand in her way and I wouldn’t stand in the way (of) her expressing her political opinions,” Carra says.

The three-term councillor says he’s grateful that partisan politics don’t dictate decisions at the municipal level.

“I think that partisanship is killing us,” Carra says, referring to persistent political divisions at the provincial and federal levels of government that interfere with practical decision-making.

When it’s come up in the past, Carra says, city council has resisted calls to increase the number of wards — despite the fact that Calgary currently has the same number of city councillors that it had in the 70s when the population was around 600,000 — largely in order to avoid the influence of slates and party politics on city hall.

“I relish the fact that city council is a non-partisan place. We might get feisty from time to time in our disagreements about specific things. But I relish the fact that our votes are generally all over the place. I think that that’s very healthy governance.”

China, a major market for Canadian canola, is no longer importing the product, citing contamination concerns, something producers say is unwarranted.

But some have suggested that the block has more to do with Canada’s decision to arrest Meng Wanzhouin in December, vice-president of Chinese tech giant Huawei and daughter of the company’s CEO.

“Right now the focus is very much canola because it’s so symbolic. . . . It is the one commodity that is so linked to the Canadian brand across the world, but I wouldn’t exclude embargoes or measures affecting other commodities like beef pork, wheat and of course lobster or seafood,” Sylvain Charlebois, a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University, told The Chronicle Herald.

Though technically countries cannot issue embargoes for political reasons, Charlebois said it’s a tactic many countries, including China, employ.

“China can’t go out and say because you arrested Ms. Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver we no longer want your product. It’s illegal. ... You’ll be warned by the World Trade Organization or you could even be fined and reprimanded,” he explained. “You have to [cite] other reasons and food safety is often the safe way to do it.”

Charlebois said he expects China’s plans will depend heavily on what happens in the fall federal election.

“If we have a change in government, everything could change, but if we actually stick to what we have now I think a lot of people in Ottawa will need to go back to school and take some diplomacy 101 classes as soon as possible,” he said.

According to government figures, of the $1.5 billion in Atlantic Canadian goods exported to China in 2017, over 43 per cent were seafood, fishing and aquaculture products, with lobster topping the list in terms of value.

“... I think a lot of people in Ottawa will need to go back to school and take some diplomacy 101 classes as soon as possible."" - Sylvain Charlebois

And governments have been putting significant effort into keeping that relationship strong — a joint trade mission to China in the fall that included Atlantic premiers and federal ministers saw a major focus on seafood exports.

Speaking with The Chronicle Herald, Fisheries Minister Keith Colwell said ,while Nova Scotia’s seafood industry hasn’t seen any reduction in sales in China, his department reached out to some key Chinese purchasers as recently as last week to put forward some of these concerns surrounding tensions between China and Canada. Colwell said the conversations were encouraging.

“[According] to discussions we’ve had with them it’s business as usual. ... We’re here to do business, that’s the message we’ve delivered and they’ve told us the same thing,” Colwell said.

“We don’t want to be part of the continuing issues that are happening between the U.S. and China and Canada and China. We look at China as a preferred customer for our products and we really enjoy working with them, it’s been a very good experience for us and we hope it stays that way.”

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for International Trade Minister Jim Carr said the Canadian government is “committed to expanding opportunities for Canadian businesses of all sizes to compete and succeed in fast-growing markets around the world, and that includes China.”

A perfect storm?

The Canadian seafood industry benefited significantly from the trade war between the U.S. and China, as tariff-free Canadian lobster and other seafood products are now significantly more affordable. In Nova Scotia alone, seafood exports to China increased by 36 per cent in 2018 to $524 million and remains the second-largest market for seafood exports after the U.S., the provincial government said in a news release this month.

But, Stewart Lamont, managing director of Nova Scotia-based Tangier Lobster Company, warned that all could change.

Lamont said, because of China’s retaliatory tariffs on American seafood, which have created an unprecedented 25 per cent comparative advantage over American lobster since they were imposed in July, Atlantic Canada has become extraordinarily dependent on the mainland China market.

“We have priced Chinese demand into our shore pricing for live lobster since October. We are paying fishers two to three dollars more per pound on average above more recent pricing. This is terrific as long as we can pass the greater cost to the marketplace,” Lamont said. “Unfortunately from December to this minute all markets have struggled to pay the new pricing. Canada, America, Europe and Asia all take the position in the marketplace that our pricing is now too high for their clients.”

“We have priced Chinese demand into our shore pricing for live lobster since October."" - Stewart Lamont

Sooner or later, Lamont said, China and the U.S. will end the trade and tariff war that is costing both counties trillions, and live lobster exports from America to China would resume overnight. And because American live lobster is dramatically less expensive than Canadian, U.S. suppliers would go from having a 25 per cent disadvantage to a three dollar per pound advantage almost immediately.

Lamont said he wouldn’t be surprised to see an embargo placed on seafood similar to the one China has placed on canola, as both industries have a similar value. He said if China and the U.S. resolve their trade issues at the same time, the result could spell disaster for Atlantic Canada’s seafood industry.

“If we had a ban, 40 per cent of our international market, in theory, would disappear immediately, the worst nightmare is if the two things happen simultaneously,” Lamont said. “We would not be serving ourselves well in Atlantic Canada if we didn’t factor these [geopolitical concerns] into our model going forward. We should try and mitigate our risk, and we should try to pursue additional markers so we’re not so reliant on any given market.”

Nearly 25 years later, Alberta finds itself in a similar situation.","Albertans go to the polls on April 16, choosing between Don Getty and Ralph Klein for premier. Or close enough. The incumbent New Democrats are Don Getty come back to life, with a side serving of Trudeau-esque identity politics. The United Conservative Party might be the return of Ralph Klein.

That’s more or less the message of one of the most interesting books on fiscal policy I have read. Yes, I grudgingly concede that it is possible that some of my readers may not find fiscal policy quite as interesting as we economists do, but I would recommend giving Mark Milke — an old Calgary friend of mine — a try. His latest, Ralph vs. Rachel: A Tale of Two Alberta Premiers, is a relatively easy read; it is not impenetrable academic prose. A newspaper columnist who can write for a wide audience, Milke challenges a lot of what we think we know about recent fiscal policy.

The United Conservative Party might be the return of Ralph Klein

The heart of Milke’s argument is that historically profligate Alberta — which still has the highest per-capita government spending in the nation — cannot, when energy revenues fall, tax its way back to fiscal responsibility and greater business investment. Spending restraint is the answer.

Milke submits that Getty’s Progressive Conservatives, 1985-1992, attempted the former and failed. Klein, 1992-2006, implemented the latter and succeeded. The Rachel Notley New Democrats have followed the Getty model, Milke argues, with the same results.

“In 1993 and 2015, two Alberta premiers faced similar economic and fiscal challenges: low or declining energy prices, a weak economy and relatively high government spending by their predecessors,” writes Milke of the situations facing Klein in 1993 and Notley in 2015. “The differences: Notley was forced to grapple with a steeper oil-price drop just as she entered office and anti-Alberta policies from politicians elsewhere in the country; Klein played cleanup for every fiscal problem the Progressive Conservatives let lapse or exacerbated since 1986 and faced significantly higher interest rates.”

Klein and Notley provide about as close a comparison as one can get in the real world of economic fluctuations. Klein was helped by modestly recovering oil prices but hammered by high interest rates on accumulated debt; Notley’s deficit spending has been with cheap debt and more slowly recovering oil prices. Call it a wash and compare the results.

Klein introduced deep spending cuts, as much as 20 per cent. Many Albertans howled, though Alberta’s cuts were simply a return to what most other Canadians, per capita, had long been accustomed to. The fiscal results were impressive.

Klein introduced deep spending cuts, as much as 20 per cent. Many Albertans howled

“Candidate Klein promised a balanced budget in four years and Premier Klein delivered in two,” notes Milke. “Candidate Notley promised three deficit years and then a $25-million surplus by 2019. Premier Notley’s commitment was dead on arrival once the NDP gained power. In power, the NDP modified their balanced budget promise to 2020 and then 2023. It was the late 1980s Progressive Conservative Getty government all over again.”

Klein’s balanced budgets and then surpluses permitted the government to go debt-free by 2005. A government free of debt-service costs can keep taxes low, attracting investment and economic growth, or expand spending. In his first years as premier, Klein faced annual debt-service charges of close to $3 billion. When Alberta became debt-free, that was $3 billion more that Albertans had in tax savings or new spending.

The extravagant spending of Klein’s PC successors — Ed Stelmach, Alison Redford and Jim Prentice — left Alberta with a debt service cost of $722 million in 2015. By 2018, with expanded NDP spending and higher taxes — corporate taxes and carbon taxes — the debt service was up to $1.9 billion. By 2021, it is projected to reach $3 billion. By way of comparison, that would be 15 per cent of health spending, or nearly 50 per cent of social service spending in 2021.

Debt service is a killer of public confidence — it drives a wedge between revenues raised and services delivered, a guarantee that taxpayers do not get what they pay for. If oil prices rise sharply, Alberta’s finances will recover quickly. But if interest rates rise even modestly, Alberta’s fiscal health will be dealt a mortal blow.

While Milke’s book focuses on Alberta, the lessons of Klein after Getty had national implications. Canada’s national finances, which were headed into desperate territory, were saved by the Chretien/Martin cuts of 1995. Nearly 25 years later, Alberta finds itself in a similar situation.

China, citing the discovery of pests, expanded its ban on canola seed imports on Tuesday to include shipments from a second major exporter, Viterra.

Viterra is owned by Glencore’s agricultural arm. Earlier this month, Beijing halted shipments from Richardson International, Canada’s top exporter of canola seed.

Canada’s Liberal government and China have been locked in a trade and political dispute since the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies was arrested in Vancouver last December on a U.S. extradition request.

China accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to the Canola Council, with seed exports to China worth some $2.7 billion a year.

Canada’s official opposition Conservative party, which opinion polls show could win an election in October, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not done enough to help canola farmers and is bungling ties with China.

“The restrictive measures imposed by China are said to be rooted in science. We have asked for the evidence,” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in a statement.

“To date, none has been supplied. We will keep pushing as hard as we can on this vital point,” added Goodale, an MP from Saskatchewan, Canada’s biggest canola-producing province by tonnage since 1990.

Trudeau said on Wednesday he was concerned about the ban and could send a delegation to Beijing. He met with Richardson executives on Tuesday.

Goodale, using sterner language, said “measures that defy science and contravene sound business and trading practices detract from the good reputation for reliability which all trading nations seek to maintain.”

The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment.

Canadian food inspection officials say they have found no problems with canola seed exports.

“We will intervene at the right level of seniority and intensity — scientifically, strategically and diplomatically — to have the best possible impact,” said Goodale.

Conservative legislators on Thursday sent a letter requesting an emergency meeting of the Commons agriculture committee on Friday.

“We fear that if this issue is not resolved expeditiously, farmers will suffer significantly because of the prime minister’s ongoing mishandling of the Canada-China relationship,” they said in the letter.

Affordability expected to dominate federal election campaign

New research has found that affordability will likely dominate the upcoming federal election.

A new public opinion poll has found 48 per cent of Canadians are worried about the rising cost of living and not having enough income to cover their expenses.

A total of 57 per cent listed issues of affordability, economic inequality, wages and taxes, as their top vote drivers for the upcoming federal election. Pharmacare and healthcare costs also rated highly. When shown options to improve affordability, good jobs, healthcare costs, fairer taxes, reducing costs of products and services received the strongest level of support

The survey also found a strong link between affordability anxiety and broader opinions and attitudes about the future economy, immigration, tax rates for the rich, and government regulation of corporations.

The poll was conducted by Abacus Data and presented at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit in Ottawa to shed light on the roots of rising populism and explore progressive solutions to the problems that worry Canadians most.

“Most Canadians believe that while the cost of living and income inequality has gotten worse over the last few years, corporate profits are doing fine,” said David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data. “What’s quite striking in the results is that both political leaders and corporate Canada are being held responsible for the worsening financial circumstances many Canadians are experiencing.”

“It’s clear both from the polling and from events here and around the world, ignoring rising affordability fears comes with great risk,” said Katrina Miller, Program Director for the Broadbent Institute.

“Many of the affordability concerns people have are natural ground for progressives,” and stagnant wages,” said Miller. “The research tells us we need to offer concrete proposals on issues like housing, healthcare, good jobs, fairer taxes to address affordability in the short and long-term.”

“We have to be careful. If affordability anxiety grows and people feel left out of the economic shift underway, they will be suspectable to divisive rhetoric that pits people against each other,” said Coletto. “There’s a growing group of what I call ‘anxious populists’ who will have a big influence of the next election. They are the least partisan and most persuadable group, so in a sense, they are up for grabs for whoever can make them the best offer.”

“We can’t stand by and allow the politics of division to take hold,” said Miller. “Progressive movements and leaders must listen closely to what ‘anxious populists’ are saying and provide a well-marked path to economic inclusion that gives them hope for the future.”",Affordability expected to dominate federal election campaign,Blackburn News,https://blackburnnews.com/midwestern-ontario/midwestern-ontario-news/2019/03/28/affordability-expected-dominate-federal-election-campaign/

Posted on March 27, 2019 by Sunny South News

Government budgets often offer some benefits for voters, but when the budget precedes an election, there’s a lot in common with Christmas — there are plenty of gifts, and you try not to think about having to pay for them later.

So it is with the Liberal government’s federal budget tabled last week that will dole out billions of dollars in new spending on all sorts of goodies for Canadians — many of them aimed at helping middle-class voters save money.

The Liberals were aided by the fact that a stronger economy has produced higher-than expected revenue — a projected extra $27.8 billion over the next six years.

Based on Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s plan, the Liberals will spend $22.8 billion of that additional money.

The budget includes: $1.7 billion over five years, and $586 million a year after that, for a Canada Training Benefit to help workers upgrade their skills and learn new ones while staying in their current jobs; $1.18 billion over five years to tighten border security, including hiring more judges to handle judicial reviews of asylum applications; $3.9 billion for farmers (the majority of them in the vote-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec) in supply-managed industries affected by new trade agreements with the U.S. and Asian countries; $2.2 billion for municipalities’ and First Nations’ infrastructure projects; $950 million for municipal governments to make their buildings more energy-efficient and to provide subsidy programs to help homeowners do the same; $300 million over three years for rebates of up to $5,000 on electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles.

The budget also calls for putting money toward lowering the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to the prime rate, and to create a new Canadian Drug Agency to centralize evaluations of new drugs and to buy in bulk nationwide, instead of province-by-province.

The provisions include measures to make housing more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers, by increasing the amount they can borrow from RRSPs and by having the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. contribute a small share of equity for down payments.

The budget also provides new rules that will let working seniors keep more of the money they earn before triggering a claw-back in the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The Canada Training Benefit will provide a tax credit of up to $250 per year to help with covering up to half the cost of job training, such as fees for a college course or other professional training programs. Such training is increasingly becoming crucial to help workers keep their skills up to date in a fast-changing workplace.

Similarly, helping working seniors keep more of their earnings in their pockets will be useful in a world where more seniors are having to remain on the job in order to make ends meet.

Of course, all these goodies have to be paid for, and the money for that ultimately comes from taxpayers’ pockets.

The Canadian Press points out the new budget will result in a 2019-20 federal deficit projection of $19.8 billion, including a $3-billion “risk adjustment,” an increase of $200 million from last year’s forecast. The Liberals’ plan includes a gradual reduction in the deficit, but that will happen more slowly than the government anticipated last year.

Morneau’s 460-page budget is titled “Investing in the Middle Class,” but it could perhaps be more appropriately called “Investing in Middle-Class Voters.”

Rather than using the unexpected windfall to reduce the debt or balance the budget, the Liberals have opted to spend the money like a carefree Vegas vacationer who just got lucky at the slot machines.

You can read about it or listen to the recording yourself here.

He's back.

One of Canada’s most notorious climate deniers landed a job from Premier Doug Ford this week. Joe Oliver, former Harper cabinet minister, was appointed to the board that oversees Ontario’s electricity system.

The appointment came just one day after Oliver penned a no-holds-barred climate denial screed, published by Postmedia’s Financial Post.

Oliver claims that predictions of temperature change, ice melting and other climate impacts have failed to materialize. He cites just one scientist — a noted physicist... who died in 1988. The day after Postmedia published Oliver’s invective, the World Meteorological Association released its annual report showing “accelerating climate impacts” which have already caused an increase of many millions of people suffering from climate impacts and “displaced” from their homes.

Also in Ontario, the independent environment commissioner issued her last report (the office, along with two other watchdogs, has been axed by the Ford government). Dianne Saxe called the current situation “very frightening,” noting that both pollution and energy bills are on the upswing under the new government.

There’s never a dull week for Doug Ford. The premier also made a big splash at the country’s preeminent annual gathering for conservatives. National Observer takes you inside the Manning Networking Conference where conservatives embraced populism, raged at Trudeau, and talked separation.

Chrystia Freeland targets white supremacists



Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland didn’t mince words at the UN Security Council, calling out white supremacism as “one of the most serious terrorist threats of the current age.”

Freeland said she felt an obligation to speak out following the attack in New Zealand:

“In the wake of acts of terrorism carried out by Muslim extremists, Western countries often call upon Muslim countries and Muslim leaders to condemn those attacks in the name of their people and their faith,"" she said.

""It should follow that, as the foreign minister of a majority white and majority Christian country, I feel a specific and personal responsibility to denounce white supremacist attacks in the same way.”

Freeland’s remarks come one day after Facebook announced it would ban support for white nationalism from its social media platforms. Last week, a far-right protest in Toronto by Patriots of Canada Against the Islamization of The West (Pegida Canada), was overshadowed by a counter-protest which stopped the anti-Muslim group from spreading its message.

This scene has been repeated around the world; in Nigeria, Ecuador, Indonesia and elsewhere. In what economists call the “resource curse,” countries with minerals or oil are exploited by foreign powers and end up with damaged land, poisoned waters and sullied air.

In a new twist to an old tale, however, the foreign power in this case is Canada, and the indebted nation is the United States. Specifically, Boulder County, Colorado.

It began in October 2015, when the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the $368 billion behemoth that invests payroll withholding taxes from Canada’s workers on behalf of 20 million contributors, announced a $609 million USD deal to purchase all of the oil and gas assets in the Denver-Julesburg Basin owned by Canadian oil and gas giant Encana.

Many of Encana’s holdings were located in rapidly growing suburban areas near homes and schools north of Denver astride the Interstate 25 corridor between Colorado’s capital and its fourth-largest city, Fort Collins. Others were in communities that had banned hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, such as Broomfield and Boulder counties. The oil and gas industry challenged those bans, and the legal fight reached the Colorado Supreme Court as the Encana deal was being negotiated. The fracking bans were overturned, and when the dust settled, CPPIB had picked up a chunk of sub-surface Colorado real estate and wells producing approximately 30 per cent less than had been announced just months earlier.

It was moving full-steam ahead into a Colorado firestorm of opposition. With all the investments in the world available to them, why would widows in Winnipeg, retirees in Richibucto and teachers in Toronto choose to invest in Colorado’s escalating fracking wars?

× Expand Ted Wood/The Story Group Crestone's 15-well Wooley Sosa development.

TOXIC ASSETS

It may simply be that the CPPIB was willing to go where other companies wouldn’t – the pension board thought they scored a deal from a distressed seller that would yield strong long-term results for their beneficiaries.

The fact that the CPPIB created a new oil and gas company in Colorado, the CPPIB-registered Crestone Peak Resources LLC, rather than simply investing in an existing Canadian-owned one added another quizzical twist to the deal.

John Bennett, a senior policy advisor at the environmental group Friends of the Earth Canada, suggests it may be because fracking is highly controversial in Canada, where three of 10 provinces have banned the practice.

“I don’t think they would ever have invested in a fracking company in Canada,” says Bennett. “Most Canadians would be surprised to know they own a fracking oil company in Colorado.”

Denise Melanson, 70, is one such Canadian. A retired medical social worker who lives in Richibucto, New Brunswick, Melanson had been involved in passing the moratorium in the province. Melanson also receives two pensions from the CPPIB: one that she paid into during her years of employment, and the other she calls an “old-age” benefit that she started receiving when she was 65.

When she learned that some of her benefits might be coming from fracking operations in Colorado, she said in a phone interview, “I was horrified. I’d much rather not be receiving money that was earned by making other people miserable.”

Most Coloradans would also be surprised to know that Canadian pensioners are invested in drilling operations in suburban backyards.

“I have to wonder if the beneficiaries of the pension fund’s investments understand what they’re investing in,” says Boulder County Commissioner Elise Jones. As far as she knows, virtually every elected official in the county – including those from its municipalities – as well as the overwhelming majority of people who live here, oppose the kind of residential drilling plans Crestone is proposing.

Concerns range from the planned drilling around homes and schools, to negative health effects from the industrial facilities’ emissions, to the oil and gas industry’s impact on the Denver metropolitan area’s persistently poor air quality.

FOLLOWING THE MONEY

Along with its purchase of these controversial assets, Crestone was also invested in Colorado’s 2018 election.

Oil and gas issues figured prominently up and down the ballot, from the governor’s race to several ballot initiatives. And Crestone contributed $607,500 to support groups that directly or indirectly opposed Proposition 112, the failed initiative that would have required new oil and gas development to be placed at least 2,500 feet from homes and schools.

Crestone, for example, donated to the pro-industry group Protect Colorado, which campaigned to defeat 112, and other political groups backing Republican state legislature candidates that unswervingly support the oil and gas industry.

Austin Graham, legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, DC, reviewed Crestone’s contributions for their legality.

Federal law requires that foreign-owned companies’ contributions to state campaigns meet a two-part test: the contributions must be drawn from money made from U.S. operations; and the person making the decision to donate must be a U.S. citizen.

But since Crestone is a privately held, Canadian-owned company, it is not obvious where the money came from or who made the decision to contribute to the election.

Crestone states in an email that it follows all state and federal laws, and as a company operating in Colorado, “Crestone allocates a certain amount of funds each year to dedicate to organizations and initiatives that are important to our team. Crestone leadership ultimately makes the decision on which organizations these funds are donated to.”

Those organizations include “independent expenditure committees,” which are also allowed to receive contributions from foreign-owned corporations.

“Regardless of whether any laws were broken,” says Graham, the CPPIB “spent a substantial amount of money trying to influence Colorado voters.”

RESIDENTIAL IMPACTS OF OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT

Crestone has applied for a Comprehensive Drilling Plan (CDP) to move into Boulder County, but the applications for drilling permits are still awaiting approval from the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), which is slated to meet about Crestone’s CDP in late April in Boulder.

If approved, the plans will have to survive an ongoing lawsuit filed by Boulder County that a judge recently ruled must wait for the COGCC’s final approval to move forward. The company will be subject to Boulder County’s new oil and gas regulations that went into place in March 2017. A bill that would impose greater regulation upon the industry, in part by beefing up local control of drilling, may bolster Boulder County’s position. However, industry representatives have vowed to develop their mineral rights in accordance with whatever Colorado law permits.

Although Boulder County has not seen any new drilling since its ban was lifted in 2016, the impacts of residential oil and gas development are plain to see.

In Weld County, there are 21,694 active wells, according to COGCC. At the same time, new homes have been built within 120 feet of existing oil and gas facilities.

Pressure has been mounting for years around the state to put some brakes on the industry. There have been repeated fires at oil and gas sites, as well as a deadly explosion in 2017 from an abandoned pipeline located less than 200 feet from a home in Firestone, which killed two people. Recent scientific reports state that Weld County’s hydrocarbon production is sullying Boulder County’s air and contributing significantly to pollution in the Denver metro region, which has placed Colorado in the crosshairs of the Environmental Protection Agency for its worsening “non-attainment” of federal clean air standards.

WELCOME TO ""EERIE""

Perhaps no place illuminates these conflicts better than Crestone’s operations in Erie, a former farming community in Boulder and Weld counties with a population of about 2,000 that has grown to a bedroom community of about 25,000 residents today. The first citizen complaint against Crestone’s operations with the COGCC was filed just three months after the CPPIB/Encana deal was finalized.

Noise from a drilling operation smack in the middle of Erie was so loud it was “like a huge semi truck parked in our driveway,” according to one complaint. Others reported rumbling and shaking of Erie homes, pictures falling from walls and disturbing vibrations night and day for weeks on end. Dank smells emanated from the drilling sites, which were just a few hundred feet away from rows of homes, parks, schools, a skate park and even the city offices. Residents joked that their town should be renamed “Eerie.”

Monica Korber who works from her Erie home as a consultant, recalls trying to sleep while her bed was shaking through the night. Soon dozens of people were sharing stories on social media and asking what Crestone was doing to rattle their lives so viscerally. “We never got a straight answer,” Korber said.

After the rumblings stopped the project, Crestone pressed on. Soon, Erie residents were complaining at COGCC meetings and on the agency’s website about noxious smells, leaks, nosebleeds, headaches, industrial noises and lights burning all night outside their bedroom windows.

Erie’s experience with Crestone isn’t isolated. More than 1,000 complaints against Crestone’s operations were filed with the COGCC between November 2016 and February 2019 – almost twice as many as the next five oil and gas companies conducting business in Colorado combined.

Crestone spokesperson Jason Oates has repeatedly stated that residents have abused the complaint process in Erie by organizing complaining campaigns.

In its email response to my questions, Crestone’s public relations department says that, “while none of the complaints resulted in a violation of state standards by the COGCC or the CDPHE [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment], we knew we needed to make some changes in our operations. We took an above-and-beyond approach to further lessen the temporary impacts that we may have on neighbouring communities.”

One flurry of complaints came after Crestone’s operations caused a release of toxic gases at a site in Erie just 25 yards from the Aspen Ridge Preparatory School playground in September 2017. Crestone was plugging and abandoning a set of wells, and had been venting large quantities of volatile organic compounds before a resident smelled noxious fumes and complained to the COGCC. Those toxic emissions wafted directly onto the school playground of the Kiddie Academy Childcare Center and the elementary school, according to the COGCC’s report on the incident.

The COGCC ordered Crestone to cease operations until the problem was fixed, but parents say they didn’t hear about the leak for months. Mark Kadlececk, who has three children who attended Aspen Ridge, found the “Notice of Alleged Violation” posted on the COGCC website more than six weeks after the violation.

The COGCC fined Crestone $10,000, according to Mike Leonard, the agency’s community relations manager.

Christiaan van Woudenberg, one of Erie’s newly elected trustees, says that when companies like Crestone come into small communities such as Erie, dangling potential tax revenue and arguing (as Crestone spokesman Oates told a community meeting) that there are “no health impacts” from fracking, it is almost impossible not to be steamrolled. He says local elected officials are also hamstrung by state laws that limit their ability to say no to new oil and gas development.

“Erie is fracked,” van Woudenberg says. “We lost. We’re the cautionary tale.”

INVESTMENT QUESTIONS

Besides the fact that Crestone is seeking to operate in communities that oppose it, there’s a larger question for the CPPIB: is residential drilling in Colorado a smart investment?

Crestone continues to face legal challenges that are increasing the cost of doing business in Colorado. The company has been involved in lawsuits, protests, leaks and alleged violations of state regulations in multiple communities. Crestone, in turn, has sued the state and at least one other oil and gas company, alleging interference in its operations.

While Crestone is private, there are several clues that the CPPIB’s Colorado investment may be problematic. As of last month, the CPPIB’s website stated that the value of the investment had dropped to $543 million from the purchase price of $609 million.

Analysts are also divided about the future of shale development, with some predicting slow growth in 2019 and others convinced that many parts of the industry are burdened with debt and uncertainty regarding future regulatory regimes, international price fluctuations and the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy technology. Other investors remain bullish on oil stocks but are moving away from riskier investments in politically volatile countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and are looking to U.S. fracking operations as a safer alternative. Both Noble Energy and Anadarko reported record Colorado oil production in 2018.

Then there’s climate change. Canada, a signatory to the Paris climate agreement, faces some cognitive dissonance with the CPPIB’s fossil fuel portfolio. Financial and legal analysts as well as climate activists point out that Canada cannot export its fossil fuel investments and still claim it is moving to reduce its carbon footprint.

In a report released in January entitled Time To Act, Canadian law professors Janis Sarra (University of British Columbia) and Cynthia Williams (Osgoode Hall Law School at York University) conclude that, “The CPPIB has enormous potential to help shift governance practice to meet the issues discussed in this report.”

That potential has yet to be unleashed, says Williams in an interview. Canada is heavily invested in the oil and gas sector, and all recent indicators are that those investments “already have a lot of risk,” she says, partly exemplified by the drop in value of the Canadian dollar and declining returns from oil and gas investments in comparison to other sectors. “Why would the CPP double down on oil and gas developments?”

Various organizations in Canada have tried to push the CPPIB towards a more sustainable, lower-carbon portfolio, without much success, says Bennett. The CPPIB has expressly avoided committing itself to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments, stating that, “Consistent with the CPP Investment Board’s belief that constraints decrease returns and/or increase risk over time, we do not screen stocks or eliminate investments based on ESG factors. The CPP Investment Board considers the securities of any issuer all of whose businesses are lawful, and would be lawful if carried on in Canada, as eligible for investment.”

As many of the affected residents have noted, what is lawful in Colorado isn’t necessarily admirable. Many state laws were written in an earlier era of oil and gas exploration. They never anticipated new horizontal drilling and fracking techniques that allow companies like Crestone to build pads of 10, 20 and 30 wells and drill underneath hundreds of people’s homes for miles in every direction. These well pads are accompanied by rows of storage tanks, condensers, combustors and separators, as well as thousands of truck trips a day in and out of these mini-industrial complexes.

BURNING UP THE PLANET

Groups looking to aggressively address climate change are targeting pension funds around the world. As concerns resonate across the globe, investments in fossil fuel companies are increasingly seen as bad bets. Viable alternatives are emerging – with better financial rewards.

In the U.S., the divestment movement has made great strides in the past few years ever since Stanford University made headlines by selling off its coal stocks in 2014. Clara Vondrich, global director of DivestInvest – a philanthropic movement that encourages large institutional investors to move away from fossil fuels in favor of more sustainable investments – says that since 2014, more than 1,000 institutional investors have committed to fossil-free investments, with growth of capital investments rising from $52 billion to more than $8 trillion today.

Various backdated investment comparisons such as those done by the U.S. divestment advocacy group As You Sow confirm that portfolios without fossil fuel investments would have performed better than those with them. Says Vondrich: “These are underperforming assets that are also burning up the planet.” Now, she says, the CPPIB and other large investors “increasingly have a fiduciary duty to explain why they don’t divest, rather than the other way around.”

CALLING EDMONTON

At a January 2019 conference hosted by the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, Crestone’s Oates told the audience that the company had met all of the requirements laid out by the COGCC for its drilling plans, and Crestone would forge ahead into Boulder County despite resident and local governments’ objections. “It is how, not if, we are going to drill,” Oates told the audience.

Sara Loflin, executive director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans, attended the conference and was taken aback by the “arrogance” of Oates’ remarks. In response to multiple communities’ concerns ever since it started doing business in Colorado, Loflin said, Crestone has only proposed moving “closer to homes, in higher risk areas, in larger scale developments.”

In its email to this reporter, Crestone disputes this and says it aims “to operate safely, responsibly, efficiently and with minimal impact on local communities, while acting as good stewards for the land, air and water. This is a priority for us because as Coloradans, we value these natural assets, and we live here, too.”

Back in Erie, grandmother Monica Korber says that she and her neighbors suffer not just the proximity of the industrial operations, but also from the discord that they have unleashed on her community. She has joined a lawsuit against her elected officials for not doing more to protect Erie citizens.

Korber’s message to the CPPIB? “Why don’t you drill next to the homes of the people where you’re sending those retirement checks?”

This is likely the Liberals' way of stating that the deal is damaging for many agricultural sectors ...","Most people expected an electoral budget, and that is exactly what Canadians got. For the agrifood sector, the budget was underwhelming at best, and provided little hope for the near future.

Let's start with supply management. It was interesting to see that the Liberals opted to do exactly what the Harper government did in the middle of an election campaign, back in 2015. At the time, the Conservatives hastily announced an out-of-nowhere $4-billion compensation package for supply-managed sectors, amid signing the defunct Transpacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, now known as Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As in 2015, the Liberals provided no hint as to how they intend to make our supply-managed sectors more competitive in the future. Monies will be allocated based on speculation and presumptions, just to buy peace, since no timeline for the compensation was provided.

This time, the sum of $3.9 billion in funding is budgeted, which includes $2.15 billion in direct compensation. The sum also includes another $1.5 billion for a Quota Value Guarantee Program that would be applied on an on-demand basis when the quota has been sold. In other words, Canadians will be acquiring quotas back from farmers, initially given out years ago, and at no charge. The motivation to procure votes in Quebec for the upcoming election was extremely obvious. To do this right, the budget should have also looked beyond supply management, to support other sectors that are also negatively affected by trade.

So, this is the path chosen by the Liberals. We get to keep an outdated system while subsidizing farmers who have prided themselves for years on not accepting public subsidies. Compensating farmers without a plan for the future of supply management is the worst possible scenario for everyone, starting with the farmers themselves. They will only see their sector shrink further, especially in dairy, and many more farms will disappear with no strategy for less populous regions in the country, like the Prairies and the Atlantic. This will be a slow and painful way to go.

Nothing is planned for other commodities, including canola, pulses and others, affected by quasi-embargoes and trade disputes. There is a small budget, at least, set aside for African Swine Fever, a disaster-in-waiting for our hog sector. It is just a matter of time before the disease hits North America. Once it does, we'll need to brace ourselves for another mad cow type of scenario.

What was interesting is that the compensation program does not extend to concessions made under NAFTA 2.0, also known as the United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement. This is likely the Liberals' way of stating that the deal is damaging for many agricultural sectors and therefore stands little or no chance of being ratified. This is as good an admission as we will get from the Liberals, and we should not expect more. It is also probably the only thing which made sense for the agrifood sector in this budget.

Some provisions were made for a food strategy. If Canada wants to make good on the aspirations of our newly-minted Food Guide, our agricultural landscape will need to change, and follow a new, much needed strategy. We need more fruits and vegetables in this country. However, a budget of $134 million over five years toward this end is hardly anything. Quebec, a province with a population of under nine million and which has just adopted its own food strategy, is spending more than double that sum, in this year alone.

Our food processing folks, who represent the largest manufacturing sector in the country, were given peanuts. The budget plans to award $100 million to support innovation and plant upkeep projects. Given that the cradle of food innovation has always been food processing, that sum is almost insulting to the 250,000 people working in this sector.

A total of $24 million is dedicated to food fraud, in support of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)'s effort to crack down on the cheaters. It is estimated that food fraud is costing our agrifood sector anywhere between $10 to $30 billion a year. This problem is massive, so the CFIA needs all the help it can get.

For agrifood, this budget regrettably doesn't accomplish much, other than admitting that the USMCA trade agreement was a bad deal. But everyone knew that already. For the rest, the budget feels like the Liberals, an urban-focused government, are simply checking boxes to please a sector that it barely understands. But Canadians are smarter than that.",Sylvain Charlebois: Federal budget leaves Canada’s agrifood sector with worst possible scenario,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9235612-sylvain-charlebois-federal-budget-leaves-canada-s-agrifood-sector-with-worst-possible-scenario/

Miramar, Florida, mayor declares Democratic presidential bid

A mayor you have never heard of is running for president — and believes he has a shot. Florida Democrat Wayne Messam announced his candidacy on Thursday

By TERRY SPENCER

Associated Press

Unless you are a Florida State University football fan, chances are you have never heard of the newest Democratic candidate for president — but Wayne Messam is hoping to quickly change that.

The mayor of Miramar, Florida, Messam announced Thursday that he is joining the crowded field seeking to unseat President Donald Trump in next year’s election.

Messam, who played for the Seminoles in the 1990s, believes Miramar has much that the rest of the United States would like to have — environmentally-friendly development, high-end manufacturing and major corporate operations.

The 44-year-old construction company owner also knows why pundits say he won’t win: low name recognition and funding; no sitting mayor has ever won the presidency; his lack of political experience and more.

But he is quick to respond with why he can.

Why does he have to be governor or a senator first? Trump wasn’t.

Who says mayors don’t have the necessary experience? Messam says he deals with infrastructure and business needs on a micro level in his Fort Lauderdale suburb in ways governors and senators don’t. Most politicians also haven’t run a small business for 20 years, he says, learning how to balance government regulations needed to protect the environment while allowing room for companies to prosper.

Messam also points out he is the only candidate from battleground Florida and the strategically important Deep South and his positions align with liberal voters. He favours universal health care, student loan forgiveness, infrastructure improvements, working to alleviate climate change and focusing education toward a high-tech future. He would repeal Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy to pay for it. He also would ban military-style rifles and tighten background checks for gun purchases.

“When people get elected into Washington with no local government experience, they are so high in the stratosphere that they have no concept, no consciousness of some of the local challenges that cities and communities face. And America is basically a network of cities and communities,” Messam said.

Miramar, with 140,000 residents, is larger than the city of the more attention-getting mayor eyeing the race, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. And while South Bend, population 103,000, is known for the University of Notre Dame, Miramar holds the headquarters of Spirit Airlines and has satellite operations for Carnival and Royal Caribbean cruise lines and American Express.

Messam said the United States needs an economic plan that emphasizes educating adults and children to thrive amid ever-increasing automation, and one that better competes internationally.

“China just released a manifesto, a 50-year plan about their dominance and how the world is going to need China’s exceptionalism and greatness and leadership. Where is our plan?” Messam said this week while cruising Miramar in his Cadillac Escalade.

Andy Oxenhorn, the president of JL Audio, said his 570-employee company manufacturers its high-end audio speakers in Miramar because Messam has maintained policies that predate the mayor, who was recently re-elected to a second four-year term. He said Messam, because of his proximity, understands the damage Trump’s tariffs are causing his company, which now pays a 10-per cent tax on imported parts.

“He is business-friendly, he has people working for him who are encouraging to our business and are not putting up obstacles to us getting the job done,” Oxenhorn said.

Messam grew up in South Bay, an agricultural town of 3,500 adjoining Lake Okeechobee. His parents emigrated from Jamaica — his father cut sugar cane before becoming a farm mechanic. His mother was a cook and housekeeper. He starred at Glades Central High, a football powerhouse, before coach Bobby Bowden recruited him to Florida State.

A wide receiver, he played on the Seminoles’ 1993 national championship team and had six catches for 103 yards in their 1996 Orange Bowl win over Notre Dame. After graduating with a degree in management information systems, he and his wife, Angela, started Messam Construction, which focuses on energy-efficient schools and government projects. They have three children in college.

His strategist, Phillip Thompson, believes Messam’s story will resonate in South Carolina, a key early primary state the campaign is focusing on to create momentum elsewhere. The Democratic electorate is 60 per cent African-American, much of the state is rural, college football is king and Messam is visiting the state frequently, courting local party officials.

If Messam gets traction there, Thompson believes, he will qualify for the party’s televised debates, putting him in front of a national audience.

Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina Democratic strategist not aligned with any campaign, said Messam faces tough competition in the state. Sens. Corey Booker and Kamala Harris, both African-Americans, are popular, as are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Buttigieg is working South Carolina hard.

“I don’t know what group his supporters would be,” Seawright said. “I’ve learned never to count anyone out because you’ll learn you can’t count, but he faces challenges.”",Correction: Election 2020-Florida Mayor story,Leader-Post,https://leaderpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/correction-election-2020-florida-mayor-story/wcm/71063efe-dff2-43a4-a743-5df02667a99b

I have tried to bridge a gap there, the election is over, Drew Dilkens can’t take his finger off — there are two crown jewels in this ...","Sluggish sales of the Windsor-built Chrysler Pacifica have prompted Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to eliminate the third shift at the Windsor Assembly Plant and with it about 1,500 jobs and hundreds of others at feeder plants.

It will be the first time the plant has operated with just two shifts since 1993.

“It’s devastating,” said a visibly emotional Unifor Local 444 president Dave Cassidy at a Thursday afternoon news conference at the Turner Road union hall.

“It’s devastating for everybody.”

They go up and down, we have layoff weeks, there’s inventory adjustment and at that point there was no discussion of that at all

Cassidy and secretary-treasurer James Stewart were summoned to a meeting with Chrysler officials at 2 p.m.

“In our collective agreement they have to provide six months notice, so September of 2019 there could be, potentially, 1,500 jobs lost at Windsor Assembly Plant, going down to two shifts,” said Cassidy.

“This is not a General Motors/Oshawa issue, this is a sales and a business decision. I can tell you we are going to keep pressure on FCA … to fully utilize our facility.”

FCA Canada head of communications LouAnn Gosselin confirmed the news in an emailed statement.

“In order to better align production with global demand at its Windsor Assembly Plant, FCA notified Unifor today that it intends to return the plant to a traditional two-shift operation, beginning Sept. 30, 2019,” Gosselin wrote.

“Retirement packages will be offered to eligible employees. The Company will make every effort to place indefinitely laid off hourly employees in open full-time positions as they become available based on seniority.”

On Tuesday, FCA announced that Windsor Assembly, which currently employs 6,100 people, would be on shutdown for the weeks of April 8 and 15.

It will be the third time the plant is on shutdown this year, but Cassidy said he was blindsided by Thursday’s announcement.

“No, I had no indication,” Cassidy said.

“They announced the two-week shutdown and that’s all we knew. It’s cyclical, right? They go up and down, we have layoff weeks, there’s inventory adjustment and at that point there was no discussion of that at all. At 2 o’clock today James and I received the notice, the company asked us to come to a meeting, we went to a meeting.

“It’s so new.”

Asked about Mayor Drew Dilkens’ state of the city speech earlier this year where Dilkens stressed Windsor’s need to diversify, Cassidy became enraged.

“(Expletive) Drew,” Cassidy said.

“Seriously. Drew Dilkens, I have reached out to Drew Dilkens so many times, I have tried to bridge a gap there, the election is over, Drew Dilkens can’t take his finger off — there are two crown jewels in this city right tied to this local, Windsor Assembly Plant and Casino Windsor. Drew Dilkens needs to pay attention to this. This is devastating for the City of Windsor and I hope that Drew Dilkens might reach out to me.

“That’s it. I’m good.”

Cassidy then abruptly ended the news conference and bolted out of the union hall.

Yearly Canadian sales of the Pacifica were down 186 vehicles to 5,999 in 2018 while Caravan sales slipped by about 14,700 units to 32,253. Sales of the Pacifica in the U.S. (118,322) in 2018 were virtually unchanged. Caravan sales jumped from 125,196 in 2017 to 151,927 last year.

Within hours of the announcement provincial and federal politicians of all stripes weighed in on the news.

“In the face of this extremely disappointing announcement from Fiat Chrysler, our government will not waver in our support for the thousands of men and women that go to work in Ontario’s auto sector every day,” Premier Doug Ford said in a statement.

“I want the employees at the Windsor Assembly Plant to know that my government stands with you and your families. We will fight tooth and nail to protect the jobs of the autoworkers in Windsor.”

Ford said he will be speaking with FCA Canada president Reid Bigland and Unifor president Jerry Dias to urge them to work with him to protect those jobs.

“My message to Fiat Chrysler is this: do not make this decision based on the anti-business policies of the former government over the past 15 years,” Ford said.

“Our government is lowering taxes, lowering electricity rates and slashing red tape. There has never been a better time for auto manufacturers to invest in the Province of Ontario.”

NDP Opposition Leader Andrea Horwath urged the government to move quickly.

“We can be a world-leader in manufacturing the cars of the future for generations to come, but it won’t happen by accident,” Horwath said in a statement.

“We need the provincial government to take action to keep Ontario on the cutting edge of the auto sector. Tens of thousands of Ontario jobs in auto, auto parts and spinoff industries, are at risk if the province fails to take action.”

The federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Navdeep Bains also issued a statement.

“I am very disappointed by the news coming from the Windsor Fiat-Chrysler Automotive plant,” Bains said.

“My immediate thoughts are with the affected employees, their families and the community of Windsor. I will be travelling to Windsor tomorrow to offer our government’s unwavering support for these workers and their families, and our commitment to fight for their jobs.”

The three local NDP MPs also released a joint statement about the shift elimination.

“The prime minister and the innovation minister love to talk about innovation and a high tech economy but they have done noting to implement the national auto strategy that would ensure that Canadians actually get jobs,” said Windsor West MP and NDP Innovation, Science, Economic Development and Auto Critic Brian Masse.

“This is what abandoning manufacturing has led to. Prime Minister Trudeau campaigned on transitioning away from manufacturing and apparently he is getting his wish as workers lose their jobs.”

They say that instead of repaying the federal government, that money can now be reinvested in programs, wellness, governance and youth.

Chiefs from the Dehcho, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in, Sahtu, Tlicho and South Slave regions were in Detah on Tuesday to meet with Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett.

The Liberal government earmarked $1.4-billion over seven years for loan forgiveness across Canada in the 2019 federal budget.

Yellowknives Dene First Nation Chief Ernest Betsina said the decision is welcomed.

“This forgiveness grant will be provided to our future generations … and provide more opportunities that can support First Nations,” he said.

Betsina said past federal cutbacks under previous governments affected core funding, negotiations, language planning and housing.

Loan system to negotiate land claims not ‘successful’

In 2018, the federal government adopted a grant system to capture the “actual costs of self-government,” Bennett said.

The 2019 budget also sets aside $40 million over five years for First Nations to research and develop claims.

“Getting to self-government shouldn’t be based on loans anymore. People spending 20 years and then $30-million in debt to not quite get there, has just not been successful,” she said.

Negotiation on a loan basis was a hard-sell for communities, she said.

“If people don’t feel that things are fair then it’s pretty hard for them to get their communities behind them to do the work,” Bennett said.

‘Long ways to go’

Tlicho Grand Chief George Mackenzie told Bennett self-government will improve the future for young Indigenous people.

“Us in the Aboriginal world have a long ways to go yet, but we will not get there if we don’t have the federal support that we are seeking,” he said.

As the federal election approaches, Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”

“Our young people today, everywhere, are crying for help … we lack resources … we lack the funding,” he said.

Other negotiations proceeding

Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina announced that Akaitcho First Nations could have an agreement in principle this year. They have been negotiating since 1992.

Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian reminded Bennett that the Dehcho First Nations have been in talks with Canada for nearly 20 years, and negotiations are stalled over surface and subsurface resource rights.

The Dehcho First Nations want to temporarily set aside land and resources and work on issues like education and self-government, Norwegian said.

“We are trying to decide how that looks like for us. It is a struggle and we really would like to move forward, but make sure that it is on our terms, that we are moving toward self-determination,” Norwegian said.

Meanwhile, K’atl’odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel says the community is leaning toward self-government, but has concerns about keeping reserve status under the Indian Act.

“That’s really powerful to our people because we don’t want to lose that. I want you to recognize that,” she said to Bennett.

The monthly Business Barometer index, by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, increased by 1.8 points in the province but Alberta business owners remain the least confident in the country.

“With a provincial election in full swing, Alberta’s entrepreneurs are looking for the parties to make meaningful policy commitments to help our province’s small and medium-sized business sector shake off the recession and start growing again. Having solid economic policies will be key to reinvigorating Alberta’s business confidence” said Richard Truscott, Vice-President, Alberta and BC, in a statement.

While small business confidence rose to 42.1 points in March, it continues to fall short of the national average of 55.9. The CFIB says the 65 to 75 point range (on the 100 point scale) indicates a healthy and growing economy.

The CFIB survey in Alberta also found that 11 per cent of business owners are expecting their full-time employment levels to go up in the near future, representing a two-point increase from February’s results. Also, 60 per cent expect their full time employment level to remain the same, and 29 per cent expect it to decrease.

The provincial numbers for March were: Nova Scotia (66.8), Quebec (65.3), Prince Edward Island (59.7), Ontario (59.5), New Brunswick (56.6), British Columbia (55.9), Manitoba (51.4), Saskatchewan (50.8), Newfoundland & Labrador (48.7), and Alberta (42.1).

“Small business confidence continues to disappoint. The index moved sideways, near 60, for most of 2018, but has averaged 57 so far in 2019. This subdued performance is consistent with a moderating economy and downwardly revised growth forecasts. Reinforcing this point is an easing in indicators of capacity constraints, including lower gauges of inflationary pressures and reduced incidence of labour shortages as a factor limiting production,” said Omar Abdelrahman, an economist with TD Economics.

“The resource-heavy provinces and natural resource sectors continue to weigh down on the index’s performance. With Alberta’s (oil producation) curtailment plan supporting prices in the near term, some of this weakness should be reversed. That said, confidence in the sector and the province are likely to remain weak for some time given structural issues related to market access, uncertainty related to global oil prices, and weaknesses in the outlook for some other commodities that will impact the Prairies more broadly.”

Issues of law and order are always ripe for political debate. But in recent years, there’s been much discussion of an increase in rural crime across the province.

In March 2018, the provincial government issued a seven-point plan, along with $10 million in funding, to mitigate rural crime.

Brooks-Medicine Hat NDP candidate Lynn MacWilliam says this plan created specialized Rural Crime Reduction Units and adds 39 new RCMP officers, 40 civilian staff and 10 prosecutors to focus on rural crime.

According to her, there’s been a 16 per cent reduction in rural crime between December 2017 and December 2018, with 480 fewer homes broken into, 3,500 fewer thefts and 1,200 fewer vehicles stolen.

“I need to stress that not every community has seen the same level of decreases and the problem won’t be solved overnight, but Rachel Notley and the RCMP have been making real progress,” said MacWilliam.

Michaela Glasgo, the UCP candidate in Brooks-Medicine Hat, says combating rural crime would be a major priority of a UCP government, pointing to their July 2018 report, “A Safer Alberta: United Conservative Strategy to Tackle the Rural Crime Crisis.”

“The recommendations contained in the report are actions that can be taken to strengthen police response capability, effectively deal with repeat offenders, improve data collection, combat court delays, improve services for victims, strengthen crime prevention efforts, and reduce property crime in rural communities,” said Glasgo.

She says a UCP government would also introduce a bill modelled after “Clare’s Law” in the U.K., which allows police to notify women if their partner has an abusive past.

According to Statistics Canada, Alberta has the third-highest rate of reported domestic violence in the country, behind Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

The riding’s Alberta Party candidate Jim Black – a former police officer – says the Alberta Party’s shadow budget includes funding for policing in rural municipalities.

“We’ve been saying this for over two years as part of our policy platform, so I think we’re ahead of the NDP in this area by a substantial margin,” he said.

Black says many rural police forces are understaffed and overwhelmed, which makes it harder to dedicate the resources necessary to effectively fight crime.

“That’s not a very pleasant position to be in, when you’re running from scene to scene. You end up chasing your tail because you don’t have enough manpower to support the community’s needs,” he said.

Todd Beasley, the independent conservative candidate for Brooks-Medicine Hat, says he wants to “re-allocate resources so we can improve the response times” for police in rural areas.

“I think we need to put law and order first, and law breakers second,” he said. “Our criminal justice system seems to have it wrong at times.”

He called it “ridiculous” that rural landowners who shoot intruders are criminally charged, the result of a “liberal law system that is protecting the criminal over protecting people in rural areas.”

Beasley says the province should pressure the federal government, which is responsible for amending the Criminal Code, to take a more “punitive” approach.

“I stand by the landowners,” said Beasley. “If you break the law, I’m not on your side. In fact, I’m your enemy.”

He said he likes the UCP’s plan, but “maybe it needs to be a little bit tougher.”

WINNIPEG, March 27 (MarketsFarm) – ICE Futures canola contracts were weaker at the end of trading on Wednesday, as tensions between Canada and China has continued to weigh on values.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday he will consider sending a high-level delegation to China to discuss the ongoing situation between the two countries. His announcement came after China banned Viterra from selling canola to the country.

China took the action against Viterra yesterday in the same fashion it banned canola shipments from Richardson International earlier this month – in that Chinese authorities alleged they found hazardous pests in the shipments.

The dispute stems from the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou by Canadian authorities in December at the request of United States authorities. Meng is now facing extradition to the U.S., where she faces fraud charges.

The Canadian dollar was down at 74.57 U.S. cents by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, which provided some support.

Support also came from canola now being more competitive with other vegetable oils and improvements in the crush margins.

About 13,555 contracts were traded on Wednesday, which compares with Tuesday when approximately 24,000 contracts changed hands.

SOYBEAN futures at the Chicago Board of Trade were weaker on Wednesday.

Trade talks between the United States and China are set for Thursday and Friday in China, with a Chinese delegation travelling to the U.S. next week for further negotiations. While a final deal is still expected by the end of April, there are indications it might be delayed. U.S. President Donald Trump wants a deal completed no later than the 2020 Presidential Election, which kicks off early next year.

There are indications that tariffs the U.S. and China have imposed on each other in their trade war will not cease immediately with a final agreement. Rather, the tariffs could be gradually eliminated.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture releases two reports on March 29, its Prospective Planting report and its Grain Stocks report. Traders have been positioning themselves ahead of Friday.

The American Farm Bureau has estimated there is US$76 billion of corn and soybeans in the Mississippi and Missouri River basins that could be at risk to flooding. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has forecast unprecedented flooding this spring in those basins.

CORN futures were also weaker on Wednesday, as Ukraine’s exports are up. As of March 21, Ukraine’s exports stand at 302.3 million tonnes for an increase of 22.7 per cent year-over-year.

WHEAT futures were stronger on Tuesday on news that Russia’s wheat exports were down. The country’s exports dell 5.2 per cent in 2018-19 compared to a year ago.

It proved to be ... immigrating to a less-than-welcoming Canada a hundred years ago.","Dog-whistling politicians don’t usually inspire great art. But inspiration can be a strange thing.

Halifax-based singer-songwriter Ben Caplan says one of the earliest sparks for both his album ""Old Stock"" and the theatre production based on the same songs came from an unlikely source, albeit in a negative way. In 2015, then Prime Minister Stephen Harper used the term “old stock Canadians” in a national debate during his failed attempt at re-election.

It proved to be a controversial and polarizing remark, particularly since it was made when discussing refugees. It immediately brought accusations that Harper had purposely used the term to energize his base and engage in identity politics. Harper denied this. But Caplan was among many Canadians who found the remark deeply unsettling. Why separate new and “old-stock” Canadians, particularly during a debate about health care for refugees?

“It really sounded like a dog-whistle to me,” says Caplan, in an interview with Postmedia during a tour stop in Victoria. “It sounded to me like a call to make an us and a them, to be othering new Canadians.”

Caplan found himself applying it to his own family history, which included his Jewish great-grandparents immigrating to a less-than-welcoming Canada a hundred years ago.

“They were others,” says the songwriter, who will be performing a sold-out show at Festival Hall on April 3. “They were not considered to be the natural Canadian stock and they were not considered the sort of people who could become old-stock Canadians.”

All of this would eventually come to inform both ""Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story"", the theatre piece Caplan co-created with playwright Hannah Moscovitch and songwriter Christian Barry, and Old Stock, the album Caplan adapted from it.

Caplan and Barry teamed up to write a musical — or a “concert-theatre mashup” — with the guiding principle that all the songs should be able to stand on their own outside of a narrative. But initially they struggled with what that narrative should be.

“Partially in response to Harper and partially in response to seeing the image of the young child Alan Kurdi washing up on a beach in Turkey, we realized we wanted to make about refugees and about immigrants,” Caplan says. “That hadn’t been clear to us before, we had been searching for some story. As we began to hone in on a refugee story, Hannah discovered the story of her great-grandparents which had been unknown to her. Having just given birth to her first child, she went on a trip with some relatives to the Pier 21 museum in Halifax and realized she was standing on the very ground that her great-grandparents had passed through in order to make her own life and the life of her child and the life of her child possible for her in Canada. It was a real moving moment for her and really became the underpinning for this theatrical production.”

""Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story"" opened in Halifax in 2017 with Caplan in the lead role. It would later enjoy successful runs in New York and at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Calgarians will get a chance to see it in full next February when Caplan will return as part of Alberta Theatre Projects’ 2019-2020 season.

But on April 3, the singer-songwriter will be performing more of a straight-forward concert, albeit one that draws heavily from the new album and is backed by a five-piece band well-versed in the traditional Jewish and Eastern European strains, including klezmer, that the new songs require. The show will also feature Vancouver singer-songwriter Geoff Berner, a master of klezmer-punk whose songs Widow Bride and Traveler’s Curse are covered by Caplan on Old Stock.

Caplan was born in Hamilton, Ont., but has been based in Halifax since his college days. ""Old Stock"" is his third record and reflects his growing interest in the music of his ancestors.

“I didn’t grow up with Klezmer music as such as much as I grew up going to synagogue and hearing some of these musical modes through liturgical services,” he says. “I really didn’t have a deep sense of the musicality of those kinds of sounds until my early 20s when I had this epiphany listening to a brass band and realizing that this Balkan brass sounded deeply familiar and personal even though it’s totally different than anything I had every heard before. That began a process of exploration and research and digging into those musical styles, which have crept more and more into my musical output from album to album. This album, ""Old Stock"", and this project was really an opportunity for me to dig in with both hands and explore what was there.”

If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were so inclined, he could send Canadians to the polls before Canada Day. He would not ...","But until this week, it was not clear that the option of a presummer federal vote was even available.

Per Alberta law, Notley could have called the election for a vote to be held as late as May 31 — blocking off in the process most of the spring's political calendar.

It is easier to make a case for the Liberals using all the time at their disposal to allow the dust to settle on SNC-Lavalin than to explain why the Conservatives are not clamouring for an election.

Polls show the affair has taken a toll on Trudeau's electoral prospects. Still whether that damage is permanent remains an open question.

On balance, Tuesday's budget was well received. Anyone looking for a visionary document was left hungry. Finance Minister Bill Morneau's fourth budget will not go down in history for its structural impact on the country. As a rule, few pre-election budgets do.

But nor did it come across as the product of a government on its last legs, at a loss to spring back from the hits it has been taking for more than a month.

If anything, Morneau seemed more comfortable with his latest budget than with some of the previous ones. In his first years as a minister, he might have been destabilized by Conservative efforts to shout down his budget speech. That did not happen on Tuesday.

The opposition parties may want to prevent the government from moving on from this crisis, but anecdotal evidence suggests public fatigue with the SNC-Lavalin is already setting in. The federal budget alone will not change the conversation on Parliament Hill but other issues are moving up on the radar.

If the past is any indication, public patience with parliamentary guerrilla wars and those who instigate them tends to be limited.

For the better part of the past month Scheer has been arguing that the prime minister no longer has the moral authority to govern. On Trudeau's role in the SNC-Lavalin affair, he has already come to a conclusion.

The Conservative party is committed to paralyzing Parliament for as long as it takes for the government to cave to its demands — something that seems unlikely to happen between now and the election.

If Scheer believes his own rhetoric, should he not be calling for Canadians to be given the earliest possible opportunity to kick the Liberals out?

And yet, prior to and since Tuesday's budgets, he has had plenty of opportunities to call for an earlier election and he has so far passed on all of them.

Scheer is betting that weeks of parliamentary warfare will enhance his pre-election standing. As it happens so — at least for now — is Trudeau.

He’s also planning to join a group of students for a midday tour of the Maker Space at the Pickering Public Library, which, according to the website, includes a recording studio, design centre and “maker lab,” as well as a full selection of “loanable items” — GoPro and DLSR cameras, green screen kits and WiFi hotspots that can be borrowed for use outside the confines of the library itself.

According to media reports, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of border security, is attempting to close a loophole in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).

The agreement allows Canada to send asylum-seekers back to the United States without hearing their refugee claims (and allows the U.S. the same option for those going in the other direction). The loophole is that the STCA only applies to asylum-seekers who present themselves at official land ports-of-entry.

Since President Donald Trump was elected, around 40,000 asylum seekers have used this loophole by crossing into Canada from the U.S. at places other than official ports-of-entry. They are not trying to sneak into Canada undetected. Rather, they cross the border irregularly to avoid being turned away under the STCA and then approach Canadian authorities to make refugee claims.

The number of irregular border-crossers has declined recently, with fewer than 1,000 in January 2019. What’s more, while the overall number of refugee claims made in Canada has been higher than usual in the past two years, it is not far off historical norms.

Nonetheless, the additional 40,000 refugee claims have produced pressures on the refugee determination system and on provincial social programs. There has also been political pushback, with calls from the Conservative party for the government to stem the flow.

However, closing the STCA loophole is a complicated proposition.

Blair reportedly wants irregular border-crossers to be taken to official ports-of-entry and processed as if they had presented themselves there directly. In other words, the STCA would apply both at official ports-of-entry and elsewhere.

To make this work, the U.S. would need to agree, which is the first complication.

More asylum-seekers come to Canada

The purpose of the STCA from a Canadian perspective was to force the U.S. to take responsibility for asylum-seekers who travel to Canada via the United States. Canada had long wanted the STCA because the flow of asylum-seekers is asymmetrical. Far more asylum-seekers come to Canada from the U.S. than the reverse.

For the same reason, the United States has long refused to agree to the STCA. That only changed after 9-11, when Canada offered the U.S. greater border security integration in exchange for the STCA.

Canada now wants to expand the STCA, so the question is: What will Canada have to give the U.S. to get them to agree?

One might expect quite a lot, given that Trump has shown little interest in taking steps that would result in thousands of asylum-seekers who would otherwise go to Canada remaining in the U.S.

The need for a quid pro quo raises a second complication. The STCA is being challenged in Canadian courts by human rights organizations who say that the U.S. is not safe for refugees and that the STCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Given the anti-refugee policies of the Trump administration, there is a good chance that courts will strike down the STCA. By negotiating expansions to the STCA without waiting to see whether the regime is upheld, there is a real risk that anything Canada gives to the U.S. in exchange will be for naught.

A third complication: Even if Canada gets the U.S. to agree to expand the STCA, and even if the regime is upheld by the courts, the impact of any expansion is likely to be both counterproductive and dangerous.

A dangerous incentive

If asylum-seekers who are intercepted at irregular border crossings are returned to the U.S., this will create a strong incentive for such asylum-seekers to cross the border without being intercepted.

Currently, irregular border crossings are manageable and organized. Most occur in a single, well-monitored location in Quebec. That crossing is not dangerous. Border officials and RCMP are present. Irregular border-crossers immediately enter into immigration and refugee processing, which includes health, criminality and security screening.

Other countries that have tried to stem flows of asylum-seekers by closing off safe and manageable routes have had a common experience. The flows do not stop but are instead diverted into more remote and hence more dangerous routes. Organized crime gets involved, bringing increased security risks and violence. The inevitable result is lost lives and decreased border security.

In the end, the political pressure on the government to be seen doing something on this file may outweigh these policy considerations. But politics lead to a fourth complication.

During the last federal election campaign, Justin Trudeau distinguished himself from former prime minister Stephen Harper partly through a more compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the death of Alan Kurdi — himself a tragic victim of cat-and-mouse games between smugglers and governments seeking to keep refugees at bay.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Prime Minister Trudeau further sought the moral high ground when, in response to the president’s anti-refugee policies, he famously tweeted Canadians will welcome those fleeing persecution.

There is no way to close the STCA loophole without the Liberal party turning its back on those progressive values, on the eve of a federal election campaign.

In this context, attempting to expand the STCA may not only be bad policy, it may also be bad politics.

Now, along with Agua Rica, which would make use of Alumbrera’s infrastructure, Canada’s First Quantum Minerals Ltd. is mulling ...","Argentina is eyeing its first major new mining project in two decades, nudged forward by President Mauricio Macri’s market-oriented policies. But there’s no guarantee he’ll be around to take credit.

Argentina’s economy is tanking with the central bank hiking interest rates to ease inflation and save the peso, the worst-performing currency in emerging markets. That could put Macri on shaky ground as he heads toward a presidential election in October where he could face his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a populist who may peel back many of the policies Macri has undertaken.

No matter who wins in October, the ground’s now tilled for a series of mining investments

No matter who wins in October, the ground’s now tilled for a series of mining investments, said Mariano Lamothe, Argentina’s Undersecretary for Mining Development. Two weeks ago, Yamana Gold Inc., Goldcorp Inc. and Glencore Plc said they’re studying a plan to jointly develop the Agua Rica gold and copper project in the country’s northwest. A decision to invest could come within months, Lamothe said.

“We’ve built a solid base,” Lamothe said in an interview in Buenos Aires. “So when President Macri’s term ends, it won’t be subject to the sharp turns that populism has generated in the past.”

The three companies will complete a feasibility study next year. The plan is to combine Glencore’s Alumbrera mine, which began operations in 1997, with the Agua Rica project, with estimated reserves of about 4.5 million tons of copper and 6.5 million ounces of gold. The hoped-for result is an estimated life of 25 years with an annual production of 236,000 tons of copper-equivalent metal for the first 10 years.

Macri has created a safer investment climate for miners by improving ties with authorities in provinces, which own the minerals in their territory, Lamothe said, adding that there’s also been efforts to reduce costs and red tape for prospectors.

Moves to improve regulatory frameworks, push transparency and address environmental issues were “important work, and it makes Argentina’s mining sector more attractive,” said Fiona Mackie, Latin America director at the Economist Intelligence Unit. But potential shifts in currency policy or a return to capital controls have investors on edge, she said.

“The first thing investors ask you is what will happen with Argentina, and that’s an unsolved mystery,” said Gustavo Koch, executive director at Argentina’s mining chamber Caem. “We’re hoping for some kind of continuity of sensible policies.”

Argentina hasn’t seen a significant new mining project since 1997, when work started on Glencore’s Alumbrera gold and copper mine. A new large project in the South American nation would come at a moment when supply is tight and few new mines are being built. Morgan Stanley listed copper as its top pick among metals in a quarterly report and said it expects the market will post a deficit of 406,000 tons this year and of 187,000 tons next.

Multi-billion plans

Now, along with Agua Rica, which would make use of Alumbrera’s infrastructure, Canada’s First Quantum Minerals Ltd. is mulling Taca Taca, a $3 billion gold and copper project in Salta province. Company executives will decide whether they develop Taca Taca or another project in Peru after construction finishes on a mine in Panama.

“Taca Taca would be the easiest one, and it’s more advanced,” First Quantum President Clive Newall said in an interview last month. But that affirmation came with a caveat: “Argentina politically is still not entirely straightforward. Elections are coming up. So clearly there’s this political decision: Do we want to invest there?”

Macri’s best chance of re-election will come if its only Macri and Fernandez de Kirchner running, pollsters say. But the outlook becomes more complex if a third candidate emerges, luring voters who are disillusioned with Macri but unwilling to turn back the clock. In that case, Roberto Lavagna, a former economy minister, may be another option.

No matter who governs at the federal level, one ally for miners in Argentina could be provincial officials looking for revenue from royalties and employment opportunities

No matter who governs at the federal level, one ally for miners in Argentina could be provincial officials looking for revenue from royalties and employment opportunities, the mining chamber’s Koch said. He pointed to San Juan, home to Barrick Gold Corp.’s Veladero gold mine.

At the same time, local governments can add an additional layer of complexity that worries investors. The clearest case in point is Chubut, where provincial mayors have been in talks to lift a prohibition on open-pit mining that’d pave the way for a $1.2 billion silver project.

“The past four years have been about building a base,” according to Victor Rodriguez, a senior consultant for CRU Group in Santiago, Chile. “We should start to see the results of that over the next four years.”

Moe has no such problem. This week, the right ...","A budget 19 months in advance of the next provincial election campaign should be starting to give us a clue as to what that campaign will be about.

But it’s what we heard in Monday’s question period, rife with snarling over past arrests and political ties to radicalism, that really gave us a clue as to what the October 2020 provincial election campaign may be like.

Scott Moe and Ryan Meili may not personally dislike each other. But it’s pretty clear the Saskatchewan Party and NDP don’t share much love.

And when the premier and Opposition get into issues like the yellow vest rallies, it’s only likely to fuel that political animosity until the writ is dropped.

Interestingly, the one whose image is likely to suffer the most from this is Moe, which makes one wonder why he wouldn’t see the wisdom of abiding by Meili’s reasonable request that the Saskatchewan government cut all ties to potentially image-harming elements like the yellow vest movement.

Why Moe wouldn’t do this anyway is confounding.

After all, the Sask. Party is an alliance of old PCs and Liberals, and keeping that alliance intact requires occasionally leaning at bit left, as they may have done in Wednesday’s budget.

While it’s a shoddy excuse for failing to always immediately denounce right-wing racism or other extremism, it can be argued that federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer may have to worry about bleeding far-right support to Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada. Moe has no such problem.

This week, the right thing for Moe would have been to at least start messaging that extreme views like the ones we are seeing on the yellow vest Facebook page are both unwanted and actually detrimental to the Sask. Party government’s central message that should be focused on the need for pipelines.

Instead, Moe opted to bicker with reporters whether Facebook messages on the yellow vest page — messages he said he hasn’t seen — were all that reflective.

In politics, when you are apologizing for extremist views that aren’t even really your own, you are losing.

Moe then made matters worse by tapping his designated political enforcer — in this case, Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre — on the shoulder and sending her over the boards to do battle with Meili over his two-decade-old arrest at the 2001 Summit of the Americas in Quebec City.

One gets why there may be a burning desire in the Sask. Party ranks to paint Meili in the far left corner of Saskatchewan politics — a task eased by Meili’s own desire to hang around that corner, anyway.

So was it really all that necessary or advisable for Eyre to prattle on about Meili hanging around radically dangerous elements — the Sierra Club — at a legitimate public protest where people weren’t threatening harm? Should it have been all that tough for Jeremy Harrison — responsible for immigrant investment — to say this week the yellow vesters’ obsession with with the UN migration compact is a little deranged?

And how smart was it for Eyre to bring up Meili’s “criminal record” when Moe and few other backbench MLAs have a more lasting criminal record involving driving under the influence?

Sure, Eyre and company have had success at getting under Meili’s rather thin skin, evident in his complaints about the Sask. Party’s political ads. And, yes, it was maybe a little greasy of Meili to draw the longbow between Highways Minister Lori Carr and Rural and Remote Health Minister Greg Ottenbreit attending yellow vest rallies and those who would “celebrate” last week’s Christchurch attacks where a white suprematist gunned down 50 innocent people in New Zealand.

But in end, it was Eyre, Moe and the Sask. Party who came out looking the worst. If the Sask. Party is playing the long game, how did this help their own brand?

There again, maybe this is just what Saskatchewan politics is destined to be like for the next 19 months. Buckle up, folks.

Bottom line: Either ...,"Stephen Skyvington is on a mission to have an adult conversation about the dire state of health care in Canada and the need for revolutionary change.

Hired as manager of government relations by the Ontario Medical Association in 1995, Skyvington opened his own PR company PoliTrain Inc. in 2001 — he’s a lobbyist, consultant, pundit, veteran of the health care wars.

“Unfortunately, my detractors would have you believe I have a hidden agenda, that my goal is to foist on Canada a U.S.-style, two-tier health care system,” he quipped.

“The irony, however, is that if we continue to keep our heads buried in the sand like we have for the past 50 years, trying to prop up a system that simply isn’t sustainable, then we’ll indeed end up with exactly what our neighbours to the south have: a health care system that’s a bloody mess.”

In his new book, This May Hurt A Bit: Reinventing Canada’s Health Care System, Skyvington concludes it is time to properly fund Medicare or “free it,” citing the long-running Cambie constitutional trial as a potential watershed moment that might prompt the long-needed transformation.

Or not.

With the face of the challenge, Dr. Brian Day, founder of the private Cambie Surgery Centre and a former president of the Canadian Medical Association, supplying a cheerleading foreword, Skyvington offers a 200-odd-page indictment of the current health care system.

He has nothing but scorn for the present crop of politicians — too mealy-mouthed to tell the truth and too spineless to act.

“Remember those kids who used to sit at the back of the classroom?” Skyvington asked. “The troublemakers? The slow learners? The social misfits? Well, guess what? They’re the ones in charge now.”

In his view, the most vulnerable are put at risk and governments dodge responsibility.

“The solutions are seen in best practices of the many countries that deliver universal care far more effectively and efficiently than we do in Canada. Governments have, with the support of special interest groups, abrogated their duty to care for patients,” Skyvington said.

He pointed to Walid Khalfallah, from Kelowna, a paraplegic thanks to his encounter with the health care system.

“All because those running the show felt it was a reasonable risk for a young boy of thirteen to wait 27 months — that’s right, I said 27 months — for surgery on his spine. By the time Walid had the surgery in 2012, at Shriners Hospital in Spokane, Wash., it was too late.”

Young people better pay particular attention, he warned.

“Baby boomers like me will get $4,000 more health care services than we pay for in our lifetime through taxes, Millennials will pay $18,000 more in taxes than in services received for health care, and the iGens will pay $27,000 more in taxes than in services received because we are always paying for our parents, the generation ahead of us,” Skyvington said.

“The problem is there are too many of us (baby boomers), not enough of the iGens and Millennials, plus they have all this school debt, they’re working two jobs, they’re living in their parents’ basement instead of having a house and building equity.”

How many ministries of health do we currently have in Canada?

“Believe it or not,” he fumed, “the answer is 14! Ten provincial, three territorial, and one federal. Each province and territory has a health minister and a health ministry chock full of civil servants, most of whom never see a patient. That’s a hell of a lot of dollars being spent on things other than frontline patient care.

“How much sense does it make to have all these different ministries negotiating separate deals with Big Pharma? Is it any wonder the cost of prescription medicines is eating up so much of our health care budgets?”

With all the surety of a scientist lamenting climate change, Skyvington is convinced Medicare’s doomsday is around the corner.

“We’re going to have a U.S.-style, two-tier system by 2030 because that’s what happens if we don’t make the changes I’m talking about now.”

He identified three treatment “tsunamis” — diabetes, obesity and dementia — that will swamp the system.

Introduced in 1968, Medicare is showing its age and there is not enough money to keep it from collapsing under its own weight, Skyvington explained.

Canada’s population has more than doubled — from 18.2 million in 1961 to 36.6 million in 2017 — while per-capita spending on health care increased more than 60 fold: From less than $100 per person in the early 1960s to a whopping $6,604 in 2017.

Even with all that money, there are historically long queues for care: Nearly a million patients waiting for treatment in 2016 lost $1.7 billion in wages alone.

Skyvington has a program of 10 solutions, but his book’s strength is not so much his prescription but his etiology and diagnosis.

And he hopes his analysis will spur a realistic discussion: “We have a bad insurance scheme masquerading as a working health care system, a system that is broken and unsustainable because it wasn’t built right in the first place.

“The reality is it puts the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society in a much worse place than if we actually had a hybrid system. The government should either properly fund health care or — if they can’t or won’t — free it.”

In 2017, he said the Fraser Institute released a report estimating that some 63,000 Canadians traveled abroad for medical care, a 40-per-cent hike from 2016.

“The rich don’t need a second tier,” Skyvington noted. “They already have one. It’s called America.”

Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland all provide universal health care, he said. Unlike Canada, none prohibits user fees or ties the funding of health care to “some kind of sick, perverse ideal of patriotism.”

Instead, each expects patients to share in the costs of health care and imposes either deductibles, co-payments or both on everyone except the poor and most vulnerable.

“If Canada’s health care system is so good, so worth fighting for and preserving, then why hasn’t anyone else copied what we’re doing?” he asked.

“The answer, my friend, is simple: Our system sucks. While we’ve been standing around for the past 50-plus years, admiring our collective navels, everyone else has been embracing not the status quo but change. Real change. Real innovation. Real solutions for an ever-evolving world.”

He hopes to make the crisis a key campaign issue this fall. “We haven’t talked about health care during an election for years. It’s high time we did. This is catastrophic. Bottom line: Either we accept this new reality and change or we’re doomed.”

By Emily Macdonald, Staff Writer



Federal election time is coming up quickly here in Canada and every vote matters. A recent poll following the SNC-Lavalin affair has placed the Conservatives in the lead, 7 points ahead of the Liberals. So how does leader Andrew Scheer, leader of the federal Conservatives since 2017, stack up as a potential Prime Minister?



A quick background on Scheer: he spent four years on Parliament hill during Stephen Harper’s majority government as Speaker of the House of Commons. Scheer is currently a member of Parliament as he holds the riding in Regina and is the leader of the opposition. He attended the University of Ottawa before switching to the University of Regina to finish his degree in history and political science where he met his wife. Scheer and his wife together have five children and he is often referred to as a “family man.” He was originally in the insurance business before entering politics 2004.



Not straying from the norm for any conservative government, Scheer hopes to balance the books within two years if voted in. However, he has not specified how this will be done, leaving Canadians to wonder where the cuts would be coming from. The deficit is estimated to be at 15.8 billion dollars by 2021-2022.



Other plans include a cut to HST/GST on home heating bills and the introduction of a tax benefit for those who send their kids to private school or chose home-schooling to help families who wish to educate their children outside of the public system.



A controversial item on Scheer’s to-do list is to recommit the Canadian Forces to the fight against “radical Islam,” something that the Trudeau government has pulled away from. An anonymous first-year student who is in the military commented on the issue, telling The Argus: “I don’t mind if we provide [a] small logistical support role or even assist with air support by sending CF18s, but boots on the ground would be a terrible idea.” He went on to say, “basically we are too busy and it would be a waste of our resources.”



PC – Municipalidad de Cipolletti – Flickr Creative Commons

Scheer has also insisted on the Free Speech mandate, something floating around since early 2018. In Ontario, universities and colleges have already been told to create and implement policies, but he would like to make it nationwide within the post-secondary education system. He has taken a similar approach to Ford, saying that funding will be cut for universities who do not have a full range of free speech. Scheer would also like to cut the unified carbon tax that the Trudeau government, this policy will be implemented in April.

Scheer has been known to be against abortion and same-sex marriage. He voted in favour of a private member’s bill in 2016 that would make it a criminal offence to cause injury or death to a fetus when committing a crime against a pregnant woman and voted against the same-sex marriage bill in 2005. He has stated however, that he will not reopen either issue for debate.



Scheer does not seem to divert from the conservative norm — he wants to make family life easier and balance the books.



No matter how you choose to vote, be sure to do your research. Remember, every vote counts and it is a privilege to choose our government.

TORONTO – A newly arrived refugee who once helped shelter whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong is calling on Canada to welcome others who helped the American fugitive.

Vanessa Rodel says five other people, including her daughter’s father and her two step-siblings, remain in Hong Kong after their refugee claims were rejected.

She says all her fellow members of a group known as Snowden’s “Guardian Angels” are like family and says she hopes they can join her in Canada, where she secured refugee status two months ago.

Rodel’s comments came at a news conference held after she and her daughter Keana landed in Toronto on Monday night.

They will head to Montreal later today to move into their new home.

Snowden is also calling on Canada to grant refugee status to others like Rodel, who helped him when he fled to Hong Kong after exposing the scope of surveillance operations at the U.S. National Security Agency.

In less than two months, B.C. will have a new MP to fill the seat vacated by new NDP MLA Sheila Malcolmson.

Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that a by-election in Nanaimo-Ladysmith will be held on May 6.

Whoever is elected will only sit as an MP for just over five months before a general election will be held on October 21.

The NDP has not yet nominated a candidate.

There are two high-profile declared contestants:

* Lauren Semple, the event director for the last three Nanaimo Pride festivals, a former Nanaimo Pride president, and former riding assistant to Malcolmson;

* and Bob Chamberlin, vice president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and elected chief of the Kwikwasut'inuxw Haswa'mis First Nation.

Chief Bob Chamberlin is also trying to win the NDP nomination in Nanaimo-Ladysmith. Amanda Siebert

Four other parties already have nominated candidates:

* Financial-services worker Jennifer Clarke for the People's Party of Canada;

* Management consultant Michelle Cornfield for the Liberals;

* Sun Life Financial manager John Hirst for the Conservatives;

* Filmmaker Paul Manly of the Green Party of Canada.

Last year, Hirst soundly defeated Clarke to become the Conservative candidate.

Paul Manly ran for the Greens in 2015 after being rejected by the NDP.

The Green candidate, Manly, ran in 2015 and is the son of former NDP MP Jim Manly, who represented Cowichan-Malahat–The Islands from 1980 to 1988.

In 2014, Paul Manly said the NDP federal executive denied him the chance to seek a party nomination because of concerns over his position on Israeli-Palestinian issues.

Manly's father was arrested in Gaza in 2012 after being part of group of protesters aboard the MV Estelle that tried to break through an Israeli blockade.

“We had hoped that the New Democrats and other parties also would speak out. Not particularly for me but for the people of Gaza and of Palestine,” Jim Manly told the Straight in 2015. “And they didn’t and this has never been Paul’s central issue. It’s been a very important issue for Eva—my wife—and myself. But it’s never been Paul’s central issue.”

In 2015, Jim Manly said that his son would have done very well as an NDP candidate, ""but he was not approved by the Ottawa apparatchiks"" in the party.",Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calls by-election in Nanaimo-Ladysmith in midst of NDP nomination race,The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1218361/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-calls-election-nanaimo-ladysmith-midst-ndp-nomination

By Keith Currie, President, Ontario Federation of Agriculture

There’s something in this year’s federal budget for everyone, at least that’s the government’s intent ahead of a federal election this year. The good news for Canadian agriculture is the emphasis on food, developing a food policy and new school food programs. Dedicated funding support for farmers in supply managed sectors in response to recent trade agreements and the promise of rural broadband also highlight the 2019 budget announcement for farmers.

Listen here:

The Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA), along with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) submitted budget recommendations outlining what we believe the agri-food sector needs to be competitive and sustainable. A number of these requests were included in the March 19 budget announcement.

Food security is a must for Canadians and the budget allocation to create a National Food Policy is a welcome promise. OFA is especially encouraged by the 3-year agricultural immigration pilot that will help address year-round agricultural labour shortages, the development of a national school food program and a $25 million commitment to a buy Canadian promotional campaign that are all included in the proposed strategy. A National Food Strategy is a landmark announcement for Canadian agriculture and together, OFA and CFA will be working directly with the federal government to understand how this program will be implemented in support of the whole agri-food sector.

OFA maintains rural access to reliable, high-speed broadband is a must. The federal budget announcement unveiled a plan to implement targets of 95% of Canadians to have high speed internet by 2025 and 100% by 2030. As likely the last 5% to get the service, many farmers and rural communities are looking at another 11 years before being able to actively participate in the digital age. This is not acceptable and defies the real economic potential of rural Ontario.

The $3.9 billion allocated to assist supply managed sectors responds to the market access concessions made through recent trade agreements signals the federal government understands the significant impact our farmers make to the Canadian economy. This monetary support is meant to sustain the incomes of eligible dairy, poultry and egg farmers. While this revenue recovery announcement is good news, relief for those farmers affected by the US-China trade war is missing from the federal budget. It’s hard not to look south of the border where US grain farmers are receiving billions in compensation from their government and not ask Canada’s leaders why they aren’t supporting Canadian farmers.

The housing initiatives aimed at housing affordability and incentives for first-time home buyers will appeal to many Canadians. However, OFA is concerned the real impact of these incentives will see a rise in housing prices in areas where very limited housing supply is already an issue. The housing crisis in Ontario’s Golden Horseshoe will only get worse. OFA maintains the best solution to help Ontarians realize home ownership and alleviate the housing crisis is to enable opportunities across Ontario. Investment in rural areas including realistic broadband targets will create jobs, attract new residents and see our communities outside of the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area flourish.

OFA believes some of the 2019 budget investments in Canadian agriculture will see economic returns for all Canadians. Many budget details have yet to be determined but together, OFA and CFA will work closely with government to ensure effective policies and programs are implemented that will benefit our agri-food sector, one of Canada’s largest economic industries.",OFA: Federal election budget fuels investments in agri-food,Blackburn News,https://blackburnnews.com/agrimedia/commentaries/2019/03/25/ofa-federal-election-budget-fuels-investments-agri-food/

So the top guy at SNC says they never mentioned any numbers for job losses to anybody … so that means someone made up the 9,000 jobs lost if SNC moves, and would that not mean someone lied at the justice committee on the record? More than once that story was uttered as truth. But how can it be the truth if it is denied by the top man at SNC-Lavelin? Justin’s lies just keep catching up with him day after day. Even his most staunch supporters are running into huge logic conflicts that they cannot even deflect away with stupid, repeated talking points and slogans.

It’s possible Jason Kenney did make a mistake in the leadership race but come on Rachel Notley, how can you expect anyone to take you at your word when you turn the truth, eg. a single toll road to be built for heavy oilsands traffic, who will also be the only ones paying the toll, into a complete lie by telling people they will be paying a toll to get anywhere. Let’s see what the investigation comes up with to see if Mr. Kenney is half the liar you are.

TOUGH CHOICES

I will not, nor have I ever voted for the NDP. As for the Liberals, as long as we have a bleeding heart, apologetic for everything, throw tax money away prime minister, the Liberals will never get my vote. As for the UPC and Jason Kenney, I have not voted for him when he was running in my riding, and the candidate that is now running in my riding will probably not get my vote. It’s too bad that the politics in this country both provincially and federally have fallen to the low credibility it has. It’s not about running the province or country, it’s about finger-pointing, the childish bickering, the accusations, the opinions the other guys are wrong and we are right, the my-way-or-no-way attitude, and it’s all BS, political BS that costs us taxpayers. If the UCP wants my vote, then they need someone that can be trusted, honest, accountable, responsible, and has integrity. Unfortunately the last person I feel that fit this bill was Danielle Smith of the former Wildrose Party. Too bad she didn’t stick it out as she would have probably been premier and we probably wouldn’t be in the mess we are now. If the UCP are going to win this election, they need to get someone in position that the voters can support and respect, now!

It’s too bad that Caylan Ford resigned from the Calgary Mountain View election race. It is quite apparent that if one offers a legitimate contrary perspective to any liberal leftist view you are branded a racist, a bigot or an Islamophobe. The irony is that the Liberals claim to be tolerant and inclusive of all ideas when in fact the opposite is true. The leftists in this country are so intolerant, such that when you have dissenting opinion they are unable to debate and can only resort to a fallacious argumentative strategy avoiding discussion of the topic and instead attacking the character or motives of the person making the argument. The leftists are only interested in being right and disinterested in healthy democratic debate. By suppressing genuine free speech democracy dies and all of us will suffer in the end.

UNACCOUNTABLE

There is something terribly and fundamentally wrong with Canada’s justice system when the Liberal government under Justin Trudeau can shut down the SNC-Lavalin inquiry when they know they have been caught with their fingers in the cookie jar. Now the whole truth will never be made public. It’s like asking a caught-in-the-act bank robber how many years he wants to spend in prison and he replies, “none!” That’s exactly what the Liberal Party did when they shut down the inquiry. There should be some world court to hold a country’s government accountable for their actions and allow the truth to be heard. This fall’s federal election is when Canadians can have their say like the song goes, “Nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye.”

HATE BREEDS HATE

I’m very saddened by the events that occurred in New Zealand, I honestly feel for those innocents and their families. Things like that should never happen. However, I believe it is a double edged sword. Hate breeds hate, this man had an agenda (even if it was misguided) because of Islamic actions in other parts of the world. I don’t condone it at all, but I also notice how the entire world is up in arms about this killing, but when an Islamic radical goes on a killing spree it’s just another news day, nobody is up in arms, nobody is protesting, especially within the Islamic community. It’s very sad, but it’s the truth. (I know you will never print this because it’s the truth.)

SHARE SOME LOVE

In light of the horrific Christchurch shootings, here’s my take on the hatred and violence we face in the world today. I was just contemplating about the shootings in two mosques in New Zealand as well as all the other recent shootings in places of worship. If you visit these places of worship, you’ll notice that there’s no hatred being preached in any of them. However, if you look at the world today, you’ll notice there’s less unity among people. I believe the culprit for all this hate is divisive politics, polarizing media, and lack of understanding between people. Many have lost the ability to listen to those who’re different from them. This is where all hate begins. When one person feels they don’t need to hear the other side. Let us all show each other love and unity. If you know someone of a different race or culture or faith, reach out to them, show some love and make sure you stand up for them.

BUT WHAT IF …

So Jody Wilson-Raybould is seeking re-election as a Liberal so that she can change the culture of conflict, partisanship etc. in government, which was one of her goals the first time. This is providing PM Justin Trudeau accepts her nomination and allows her to run under the Liberal banner, and we have heard that many times before from all kinds of political hopefuls. She claims that she never expected the national focus even though she is an accomplished lawyer. If she would have agreed to an independent, high-level retired judge advising her on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the end choice would still be hers but any controversy may not have been. She might still have her old job but now even if re-elected it could take a while to get off the backbench.

WAGE DISPUTE

Ricky Leong: Teenage workers deserve same minimum wage as adult. This article was written by someone with zero business experience. Came out of college indoctrinated with the lefty, socialist ideologies pushed throughout our school system. Everyone should be paid the same, why keep score during a game, someone’s feelings might get hurt, give him a good grade for doing bad in school. It really makes me sick. Not one thought of common sense in this article. All he keeps saying is it’s not fair. Well, whaaaa! Go cry in your beer. He mentions nothing of experience. Only age, race and gender. Typical liberal talking points. As an employer, I put huge stock in experience. I don’t want to retrain a new employee if I don’t have to. I will pay good employees more money to stay but you have to show me you’re worth the added investment. The article says “teenagers deserve the same wage” based on what? Why do they deserve the same wage? What have they done to show they deserve the same wage? What responsibilities do they have that requires the same wage? The writer suggest that kids need to earn more money to support their families? Really! That’s your MO. Do you know how silly that sounds. This thought process is a socialist ideology. People should be paid what they are worth to an employer and for a youth with zero experience and zero responsibilities, it’s worth very little.

A ROUGH GAME

So the NDP wants to make a mountain out of a molehill regarding the PC leadership campaign that saw Jason Kenney win. I have a news flash for them, that’s how the game is played. Remember Ed Stelmach? Third place on the ballot behind Jim Dinning and Ted Morton. Morton threw his support behind Stelmach and boom, Dinning is out. Too bad, really, Jim Dinning would have made a hell of a good premier. Look at B.C. The NDP were losing and the Green Party throws in behind them and it’s bye bye Liberals. As I said, it’s just the way the game’s played and all the parties do it. I’m not saying it’s right, but that’s just how it is. Don’t let Notley’s misfits get in your head over it. They’re sucking in the polls and will try anything to gain some traction.

Hilarious to see Roy Peterson say “on election day, vote as you please, but for the sake of our kids, not NDP.” So somehow the Notley NDP government has been detrimental to the youth of Alberta? The government that finally got shovels into the ground on many badly needed schools? The government that raised the minimum wage to help bring the youth and working poor out of poverty? Somehow Jason Kenney’s racist and bigoted policies will better serve the youth of Alberta? Kenney really needs to pick up a book on how trickle down economics has never worked. Perhaps reading a book on being a decent human being might be a boost for Jason, too.

OUT TO LUNCH

This whole mess with the added fee for every bag of garbage outside of your bin is insane. The fact that the citizens of Calgary are becoming jaded sheep is beyond insane. The reason why I say this is because in the March 18 issue, people actually said that they agree with people paying more who generate more trash, 62% in fact. Are these 62% of the people forgetting that our lovely council downtown slashed the service in half while keeping the price the same?! Take my extra $3 out of the money that you are keeping for doing half the job, better yet, go back to collections every week and we won’t have to worry about extra bags. Not to mention the green cart (which I don’t use) also had its service cut in half over the winter but the rates also stayed the same. It’s always so easy for council to just charge more money instead of thinking of ways to make the system more efficient and doing their jobs properly. I wonder if they have put very much thought into how much it will cost to clean up all the illegal dump sites in ditches and such that will pop up because of this. It already exists as there is scum out there too cheap to take their garbage and dispose of it properly so this will only increase the problem further and they will be kidding themselves if they don’t think this.

(Photo by Creative Touch Imaging Ltd./NurPhoto via Getty Images) A political meddling scandal threatening Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's re-election bid was given fresh impetus Friday with the release of messages and a secret recording supplied by his former attorney general.

The House of Commons justice committee, looking into the explosive allegations that Trudeau officials pressured attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin from trial, released the materials from the now former official.

The controversy comes just months ahead of a re-election bid that looks increasingly uncertain for Trudeau, whose progressive, golden boy image had previously been unblemished.

In the 43 pages of documents, Wilson-Raybould seeks to link her demotion to another portfolio in January to her resistance to allegedly undue pressure to settle the SNC-Lavalin case -- which Trudeau and his staff have denied.

And she hints about why, a month later, she resigned from cabinet, saying she had decided ""that I would immediately resign if the new attorney general decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter.""

Her replacement as attorney general, David Lametti, has so far only said he is considering the issue.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 with corruption over alleged bribes paid to secure contracts in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould, Canada's first indigenous attorney general, refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

But she later testified to lawmakers that she had faced ""consistent and sustained"" political pressure to intervene, including receiving ""veiled threats"" over her stance.

Trudeau recently addressed the allegations, telling reporters in Ottawa that he had learned ""lessons"" from the crisis -- but denying any wrongdoing.

Another minister quit in protest, and two senior officials in Trudeau's office accused of bullying Wilson-Raybould also resigned since the scandal erupted in February.

Secret recording

The secret recording made by Wilson-Raybould of a 17-minute call in December with Canada's top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, supports her testimony to the justice committee last month.

On the tape, she says Trudeau's inner circle was on ""dangerous ground"" by attempting to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

© Lars Hagberg Canada's former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould says she was pressured by the prime minister's inner circle to shield engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from prosecution She also explains that she is only trying to protect Trudeau from charges of political interference after the head of prosecutions had already decided to go ahead with the trial.

Wernick says the prime minister is ""in a pretty firm frame of mind about this.""

""I am a bit worried,"" he goes on to say. ""It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads.""

He highlights Trudeau's concerns about the possible loss of 9,000 jobs and ""a signature Canadian firm"" if SNC-Lavalin is found guilty at trial and sanctioned, coming soon after a GM plant closure and Canadian oil sector woes.

""The PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within a legitimate toolbox to try to head that off,"" he said. ""He is quite determined.""

""I think he's gonna find a way to get it done one way or another.""

Divisions within the Liberal party have started to emerge as a result of the scandal, with several MPs publicly calling for Wilson-Raybould to be kicked out of caucus.

Opposition parties, meanwhile, renewed their demands for a public inquiry and for Trudeau to resign.

""The prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign,"" Tory leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement.

According to the latest poll by Angus Reid, the Liberals have fallen nine points behind the main opposition, to 28 percent, versus 37 percent for the Tories.

Smaller parties such as the New Democrats (17 percent), Greens (eight percent) and the upstart libertarian People's Party (four percent), however, have been the main beneficiaries of the Liberals' loss of support.","New docs, recording released in Canada PM meddling scandal",AFP on MSN.ca,https://www.msn.com/en-ae/news/world/new-docs-recording-released-in-canada-pm-meddling-scandal/ar-BBVpuL5?li=BBqrVLO

Those of us who don ... it is no more a “Socialist” country than say Canada or Australia to name but two examples of US allies ...","By George Ades – Why do I bother with who gets elected in US elections? Why do any of us who have no right to vote in that country bother?

That’s a question I’m frequently asked by some Americans who see my posts as “meddling” in their domestic affairs.

The answer is simple. Who you (Americans) vote for, affects me, it affects us, all of us irrespective of where we live. There may be little chance that you, as Americans, will have Bombs dropped on your heads from American planes, but that has been standard practice for the rest of us for at least the last 7 decades…. .

….and its not just your planes, ships, tanks and missiles. It’s your sanctions and embargoes that can starve us to death or expose us to the appetites of your minions whom you shield against legal repercussions on an International level. Your representatives can and often make use of the political and economic powers that the overgrown child known as the USA affords them.

Why do you think US Embassies are the biggest in every country and built like fortresses? Even in countries where there’s no significant American ex-pat community. What do you imagine takes place in those fortresses. Why so much security surrounding your diplomatic missions? I can assure you, it is not because we “envy you your freedoms” and wish to harm you out of spite.

It pains me to see that so few Americans are actually aware of what their country does to the world. It’s frustrating to realize that those that have the power of life and death over us all, have the maturity and arrogance of spoiled 8 year-olds.

It’s disappointing to read from otherwise decent Americans that “we will win this time” and know that the “we” does not refer to “we the people” but to “our chosen team” . A team that will play its own game and, win or lose, neither the American public nor the world at large will benefit from the outcome; quite the opposite in fact. It’s disheartening to hear them echo what those in power drum into their heads through the carefully controlled MSM.

” Trump is a joke and an embarrassment.” I won’t argue with that but, what did “your side/team” offer the world as an alternative? Did you give yourselves and the rest of us a better choice? I can laugh with a joke, but nothing Hillary Clinton did would even bring a smile to my face; except maybe lose elections.

Those of us who don’t live in the US couldn’t care less whether you’re free to parade with plastic vaginas on your heads. You want to keep killing each other with guns that your Constitution permits you to possess? That’s OK by us too. We are more concerned about you killing us who have done nothing to you. Some of us live in countries the names of which the average under-educated American cannot pronounce properly and very few can even find on a map.

LEAVE US ALONE, and we will restrict our interest in your politics to that of idle curiosity. BUILD YOUR WALL and build it high, build it long. Not to keep us out, so much, as to keep your homicidal insanity in.

Until then, your politics is my politics, your chosen “leaders” are my tyrants and your vote is my vote, so I’ll try to influence you as much as I can.” —

The long-standing Premier of Alberta has seen a sharp jump in favourability over the past year, shooting up from 33% last March to 40% — landing her sixth out of Canada’s nine premiers, according to a recent study from the Angus Reid Institute.

In case you were thinking “hey, aren’t there 10 provinces in Canada?” You would be right — however, the Angus Reid Institute decided that, because of its small population, data from PEI could not be released on account of its inability to draw discreet samples over multiple waves.

BC’s John Horgan dropped down to third place (even though he sustained his 52% rating from last year) as newly elected Quebec Premier François Legault and Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe took the top two spots with 60% and 59% respectively.

The Angus Reid Institute is pulling these numbers from an online survey they conducted between March 11 and 24, using a representative, randomized sample of 5,807 Canadians.

Bringing up the rear is Nova Scotia’s Stephen McNeil, who has seen a significant dip since his high at 66% back in June 2014.

Given that the general trend shows a decrease in approval within the first year of premiership, Notley hasn’t done too bad a job of holding onto what approval remained after her dip back in 2015 — though she’ll need every bit of favour she can get heading into the provincial election this April.

TransAlta will “review Mangrove’s notice and consider the suitability of its nominees and ...","(Bloomberg) -- Brookfield Asset Management Inc. will invest C$750 million ($559 million) in power producer TransAlta Corp. and nominate two directors to its board.

Brookfield could also increase its stake in the Calgary-based utility to about 9 percent under certain conditions, according to a statement Monday. The deal allows Brookfield to convert its investment into an equity interest in TransAlta’s Alberta hydro assets at a later date.

The investment is being made through Brookfield’s publicly traded renewable-energy arm, Brookfield Renewable Partners. Shares of TransAlta rose 3.9 percent in Toronto trading Monday, closing at the highest level since July 2015 and giving the company a market value of about C$2.7 billion.

The two parties have held conversations over the years about various transactions but ultimately decided to proceed with the deal because it allows TransAlta to crystalize the future value of hydro assets and speed up its transition to clean energy, said Dawn Farrell, TransAlta chief executive officer, in an interview.

“Brookfield is a big and sophisticated company that has huge ownership in renewables and hydro,” Farrell said. “No amount of pressure would make this kind of transaction come together. It requires people who understand the industry, understand infrastructure, and understand each other.”

Clean Energy

Brookfield holds a 4.9 percent stake in the company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal will see the Canadian asset manager’s vice-chairmen, Harry Goldgut and Richard Legault, nominated to TransAlta’s slate of director nominees at its annual general meeting. Robert Flexon, the former CEO of Dynegy Inc., will also be added to the slate.

The move comes as Calgary-based TransAlta faces pressure from investors Mangrove Partners and C. John Wilder’s Bluescape Energy Partners, which disclosed a 10 percent stake in the company this month and said they planned to push for changes including a potential board revamp. The deal with Brookfield had nothing to do with the activists knocking at its door and is in keeping with its strategy to transition to clean energy, Farrell said.

In a statement on Monday evening, TransAlta said Mangrove plans to nominate five candidates for election to its board at the upcoming shareholder meeting. TransAlta will “review Mangrove’s notice and consider the suitability of its nominees and communicate more fully with its shareholder in due course,” the power producer said in the statement.

Share Buyback

TransAlta began selling shares in its renewable-energy unit in 2013, forming TransAlta Renewables Inc. as a separate company. It’s still the biggest investor in that company, with a stake of about 51 percent -- held jointly with a generation partnership -- that’s valued at about C$1.8 billion based on current share prices.

TransAlta will use about $350 million of the proceeds from the investment to advance its strategy to move from coal to gas generation by 2025, and as much as $250 million on a share buyback, it said.

“We look forward to contributing our capabilities, particularly our long-term expertise in the hydro sector, to enable the company’s growth over the long-term,” said Sachin Shah, Brookfield Renewable Partners’s chief executive officer.

Shares in TransAlta fell about 25 percent last year, but have made a rapid recovery since the start of 2019 as the company generates cash after reporting two straight years of net losses. The stock is up 69 percent this year.

After the court case is ... top two candidates in last October’s mayoral election. In its own presentation to city council ...","A case that has implications for the cost and distribution of electricity in eight Northwest Territories communities, including the capital Yellowknife, is now in the hands of a judge.

The N.W.T. Supreme Court case is part of an ongoing battle by the town of Hay River to transfer Northland Utilities’ power distribution franchise for the town to the Northwest Territories Power Corporation.

The town made the decision to switch three years ago but, so far, breaking up with Northland has been complicated and costly.

And promises of rate reductions — the whole point of the switch — have softened since the town decided to go with NTPC.

In a joint press release issued that day, March 3, 2016, the corporation and town council stated unequivocally the switch would result in an overall reduction of 20 per cent on electricity bills.

A few months later, Louis Sebert, the minister responsible for the corporation, told CBC the price of power with NTPC as distributor was “somewhat of a moving target, but we’re optimistic that once this process is concluded, rate payers in Hay River will see significantly lower power rates.”

In an email last week, an NTPC official said the corporation “continues to believe it can provide lower overall rates in the town of Hay River than the current distributor.”

The power corporation refused CBC’s requests for an interview for this story, saying the town was in the best position to comment on the corporation’s involvement and its ability to deliver on the 20 per cent reduction.

The town did not respond to CBC’s requests for an interview.

Deal-breaker

The central issue Justice Andrew Mahar must decide in the case is how to set a price Hay River must pay to get out of its franchise agreement. Under the agreement, the town must buy all of the infrastructure (power poles, transformers, buildings, vehicles, etc.) that are part of Northland’s distribution system.

Northland is challenging an arbitrator’s decision to allow Hay River to pay market value, plus a 30 per cent premium to recognize the business revenue Northland would lose through the transfer.

“The decisions of the arbitrator are entirely inconsistent with what the case law says,” said the company’s lawyer in court last week. Loyola Keough said one example of that inconsistency was taking into account the cost impact on the town and its ratepayers, “which the courts have said is not relevant.”

Northland argues the price the town should pay is how much it would cost to build a brand new system — including everything from constructing new buildings, transporting and installing generators, and the cost of setting power poles and stringing lines — less depreciation. That method yields a figure of about $40 million, almost three times what the arbitrator suggested.

The lawyer for Hay River said there is nothing in the court decisions Northland referred to that suggests the method it’s proposing is the one that should be used.

Thomas Marriott said using Northland’s formula would render the clause allowing the town to buy out of the agreement meaningless.

“Is it appropriate to say: ‘you have the right to purchase those assets but, if you do, you have to use this methodology that requires you to pay three times book value?'” Said Marriott.

“Why would anybody exercise that right? That has no practical application.”

The town has said if the court decides Northland’s methodology must be used, it will not terminate the franchise agreement.

Whatever the judge decides, Northland will continue distributing power in Hay River for the foreseeable future. Each side has the right to appeal any decision to the N.W.T. Court of Appeal and, after that, the Supreme Court of Canada.

After the court case is decided, the public utilities board will have to approve the cost, the transfer of the franchise agreement and the setting of new rates, if any, for the town.

Other cities to come?

In a presentation to Yellowknife city council earlier this year, NTPC said part of its three-year strategy is to complete the merger of its generation and distribution functions in Hay River and pursue more distribution franchise opportunities.

The only other power distributor in the N.W.T. is Northland, which delivers power to homes and businesses in Yellowknife, Ndilo, Enterprise, Fort Providence, Samba Ke, Wekweti and Kakisa, as well as Hay River.

Yellowknife is the biggest distribution franchise in the territory and one Northland has held for decades. It generates about $45 million in revenues annually.

The city’s franchise agreement with Northland expires on Dec. 31, 2020. Reducing the cost of power (the N.W.T. has the highest in the country) was a campaign commitment of the top two candidates in last October’s mayoral election.

In its own presentation to city council, Northland pointed out that the money it pays to NTPC to purchase the power it distributes in the city accounts for 77 per cent of the price Yellowknifers pay.

Another cost is the $1 million franchise fee Northland pays the Corporation of the City of Yellowknife annually, a cost that is passed on to residents and businesses in their monthly power bills.

Northland says the best system for Northerners is one in which it and the power corporation combine forces. It says that will reduce duplication and, ultimately, lower costs to customers.

Others, including previous ministers responsible for the power corporation, have suggested another way would be to eliminate Northland — and the need to return a profit to its shareholders.

Bert Paul, a long-time Liberal, says a non-partisan inquiry that includes testimony under oath is the only way to find out what happened.

""I believe Canadians should know the truth,"" Paul said in an interview with CTV News Vancouver's Mi-Jung Lee this week.

Developing story: New evidence released Friday

Paul served as the chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency, the chief agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

The party has been under the microscope for weeks after allegations surfaced suggesting political influence in a corruption and fraud case against the Montreal-based engineering and construction company.

There are already two investigations into the affair, being conducted by the justice committee and the federal ethics commissioner.

But Paul feels there should be a third, non-partisan review of what exactly occurred.

""It would be done independent of the parliamentary system,"" he said.

""It would have powers associated with the ability to subpoena, so they could request information, they could request documentation. They could also require individuals to come and to give testimony so that Canadians can find out what the facts are.""

The allegations of obstruction of justice are serious, he said, and should be dealt with before the federal election.

When asked how he thought the scandal was being handled by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Paul said most Canadians find it perplexing.

""The question is, what did he know and when did he know it? I think Canadians are frustrated, as am I, because I believe we have not had a full and independent investigation of the issues, and I think we owe it to the Canadian public to do that,"" he said.

New evidence from former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould regarding SNC-Lavalin is set to be made public Friday.

Additional documents include copies of emails and text messages as well as a new written statement, which Wilson-Raybould is providing to supplement testimony she gave one month ago. Read a recap of that testimony on CTVNews.ca.

Paul also spoke out against recent leaks about the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, calling them an attempt to undermine Wilson-Raybould's credibility.

Some MPs who don't want to be identified say that if the matter of the two MPs' caucus status isn't on Wednesday's caucus agenda, they'll stand up at the meeting and ask their colleagues to vote on ejecting Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

Liberal MPs from all regions of the country tell CBC News they feel the two former cabinet ministers can't stay.

""I've come to the conclusion that they both have lost any right to be a part of this team,"" Quebec MP Alexandra Mendès wrote in an email. She said serving in a party caucus requires ""loyalty and team spirit.""

Many caucus members who once said they thought Wilson-Raybould and Philpott could remain now say they don't understand how they can continue to identify as members of the Liberal Party given the damage done to the government by the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Trudeau punts on question of caucus status

At an event in Halifax yesterday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked if he thinks the two MPs should be permitted to stay.

""As for what Dr. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould intend to do as next steps, people are going to have to ask them,"" he replied.

CBC sent emails to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott; so far, neither has responded.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking an agreement that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4, saying she had lost ""confidence"" in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

Other senior Liberals have suggested that while the caucus is inclined to expel them, they feel the better option would be for Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to leave of their own accord, as did Whitby, Ont. MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes. She quit the Liberal caucus March 20 to sit as an independent.

Some Liberal MPs aren't ready to say one way or the other.

""Both of them have been great colleagues and, you know, we'll see how that evolves. But again, decision's not going to be mine. I'll be, of course, part of the caucus, but we'll just wait and see how things evolve from here,"" said New Brunswick MP Pat Finnigan.

'It would be a mistake to expel them' — MP Wayne Long

""I mean, any member who wants to stay part of the caucus has to say that they support the prime minister and, obviously, they support the Liberal agenda. We all got elected under the Liberal Party of Canada. I mean, I'll leave that question up to Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, whether or not they want to remain part of the caucus,"" said Ontario MP Francis Drouin.

Some caucus members say they still think the two MPs should be permitted to remain.

""I strongly believe that our caucus is made stronger by the continued presence of Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott within it, and that it would be a mistake to expel them from caucus,"" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long said in an email.

""I'm proud to be a member of a caucus in which members who share the same set of progressive values are free to express their views, and those of their constituents, on the issues that matter to them, even when they disagree with our leader or the majority of caucus members on those issues.""

Grassy Narrows First Nation held a protest and demonstration in Toronto on Wednesday evening during a Liberal Party fundraiser to press the Trudeau government on its promise to fund a specialized mercury treatment facility in the northwestern Ontario community that's about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora.

During the event, the protester appeared to be escorted out of the room while Trudeau thanked her for her ""donation.""

""From time to time, I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday morning.

""I didn't do that last night — last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize.""

Grassy Narrows also is pushing for federal help for remediation of the polluted English-Wabigoon River system and better compensation for people affected by the toxic element.

In a video posted to the Council of Canadians' verified Facebook page Wednesday evening, a woman is shown standing in front of the stage where Trudeau is standing; she appears to unfurl a banner that references the prime minister and compensation for the ""mercury crisis."" She is heard saying ""people in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this crisis,"" while appearing to be removed from the room.

Trudeau, still on the stage, is heard saying, while facing the direction in which the woman was taken out of the room, ""Thank you for being here, thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate it,"" which draws cheers and applause from the crowd.

The Grassy Narrows protest in Toronto was at the Omni King Edward Hotel, where Trudeau was scheduled to appear at a Laurier Club donor ""appreciation event.""

Former Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott pledged in late 2017 that Ottawa would fund the development and construction of a treatment facility for people exposed to mercury-related illnesses in Grassy Narrows. A number of studies have linked the comparatively poor health of people in the community to the dumping of mercury-contaminated effluent by Reed Paper, former owners of the mill in Dryden, into the river where members of the First Nation have traditionally fished.

The dumping also affected Wabaseemoong, another First Nation, about 100 kilometres northwest of Kenora.

""The situation in Grassy Narrows is one that we have been following for quite awhile,"" Trudeau said Thursday. He said representatives from his office will be in touch with the office of Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan.

Grassy Narrows submitted a feasibility study for the treatment centre in late 2018, said the community's environmental health co-ordinator, Judy Da Silva. But the community is now waiting for Ottawa to commit to funding a detailed work plan — the next step in the project, she said.

""We're really worried this promise won't be fulfilled,"" Da Silva said, with the 2019 federal election drawing closer. ""The crunch is coming ... and we need something concrete in place ... for the mercury home to be a reality.

""As we speak, our people are having to suffer in the Kenora hospital, or in Thunder Bay or in Winnipeg, and the numbers are growing,"" Da Silva said.

Judy Da Silva was in Toronto to help protest what the community is calling a lack of action by the federal government on the Grassy Narrows mercury treatment centre. (CBC)

""We're hoping that ... [Ottawa] will put something in place that will fulfil that promise for a mercury home and for mercury justice for our people.""

Da Silva said Grassy Narrows has also yet to secure a visit from Trudeau, despite chief and council requesting he come to the community.

William Olscamp, a spokesperson for Indigenous Services Canada, said in an email to CBC News that the department has reviewed the mercury treatment centre's feasibility study ""and is actively engaged with the community, the province and other technical experts to continue to effectively map out the required services against the technical requirements of the building.

""Once the requirements have been finalized, the next steps can get underway.""

The elevated levels of mercury in the river that runs adjacent to Grassy Narrows also closed a once-thriving fishery in the 1970s, decimating the local economy. Community leaders have called on senior levels of government for better compensation, saying the existing Mercury Disability Board, established in the 1980s and under provincial jurisdiction, has only resulted in about six per cent of Grassy Narrows members getting any compensation.

While the province has committed to indexing payouts to inflation, there's been little talk about changing the eligibility criteria.

Grassy Narrows highlighted by Amnesty International

The situation in Grassy Narrows was highlighted by Amnesty International on World Water Day in March as one example in Canada of ""environmental racism.""

""There are communities, particularly communities of colour and Indigenous peoples, who daily have to live with threats to their health and well-being from environmental contamination that would be unthinkable for so many other wealthier communities,"" said Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada's Indigenous rights campaigner.

""Really, there's no clearer example of this than Grassy Narrows.""

Amnesty International has been working with the community for close to 20 years, he said, adding specialized health care should have been on the table years ago.

""This isn't something that should be delayed.""

Olscamp said in his email that Indigenous Services Canada ""continues to work collaboratively with the communities of Grassy Narrows First Nation, Wabaseemoong Independent Nations and provincial partners to address the specific health needs in these communities and reform the Mercury Disability Board.

""The timelines for completion of the treatment facility will depend on the project requirements and the final design agreed upon by the federal and provincial project participants and the Grassy Narrows community,"" he added.

Grassy Narrows is about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora, Ont. (CBC)

""It is too early at this point to provide a definitive date for the project completion.""

Benjamin acknowledged the commitments made by both the federal and provincial governments as being much-needed positive steps that need to be adhered to.

""We also have the fact that there have been these long struggles for justice that, at this point, we finally see them bearing fruit,"" he said.

""This is the moment which really seems like — moreso than ever before — justice could be possible.""","Trudeau apologizes to Grassy Narrows protester thanked for 'donation,' kicked out of Liberal Party fundraiser",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/grassy-narrows-mercury-centre-1.5073665

Premier Wade MacLauchlan called an early election Tuesday night, announcing an April 23 vote that polls suggest could produce Canada’s first Green Party government. “This is Prince Edward Island’s time,” MacLauchlan told a nomination meeting for a local candidate at a Charlottetown hotel. “We are experiencing a sense of opportunity like never before in our long and distinguished history.”

The Liberal government didn’t have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7 under the province’s fixed-date election provisions, but there was an apparent desire to avoid overlap with the federal election this fall. “It’s been four years. We had a mandate and fulfilled it,” MacLauchlan told reporters when asked about the early call. “This is an opportunity to ask Islanders for their confidence to build on that record.” Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Greens seen as a legitimate contender for power.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Progressive Conservatives a party of chaos and opposition — saying they’ve had five leaders in four years — and suggested the Greens would be too risky. “The Green Party is untested, and the future of our province is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments, led by a career politician,” he said. Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, a dentist, became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and the Greens snagged a second seat in a 2017 byelection. A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February. The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan — a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier — is personally unpopular. “It’s about people. It’s about you — and it’s about time that the government of the people of P.E.I. understand, respect and live by that message,” the PC party said in a tweet as MacLauchlan was making his election call.

The Greens, meanwhile, posted a clip Tuesday night of Bevan-Baker playing “First Call” on his trumpet. “What a wonderful way to begin the writ period — with a blast from Peter’s trumpet,” the party said on Facebook. In his speech, MacLauchlan touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half. “Prince Edward Island is working,” he told the enthusiastic partisan crowd. “There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and thrive.” The standings at dissolution in the Island legislature were 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member. The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories. The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890. MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day. He is scheduled to make his first campaign stop Wednesday morning in Charlottetown. The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform — asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model. It won’t be the first time P.E.I. voters have been asked to consider electoral reform. In fact, they voted 52 per cent in favour of switching to mixed member proportional reform during a plebiscite in 2016, but MacLauchlan rejected the results because of a low turnout of about 36 per cent.

Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter in response to Martyn Brown’s insightful article dated March 21 entitled ”Pardon my French, Prime Minister, but you’re f#*ked”.

I am a former thirty-year director and chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency of Canada ""(FLAC)"". FLAC, is the Chief Agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

I am in full agreement with the comments of former cabinet minister Jane Phillpott. She justifiably complained in MacLeans about “an attempt to shut down the inquiry”. I agree with her assertion that “Canadians would like to know the whole truth.” It is obvious that as Martyn Brown quoted ""There’s much more to the story that should be told.""

I would strongly support that an independent public inquiry be initiated. The powers pursuant to the Inquiry Act permit summoning of witnesses to provide testimony under oath, requiring them to give evidence and produce documents.

A non-partisan inquiry can then address the issues of bearing false witness, contravening the Shawcross Doctrine and Section 5 of the OECD Convention as it relates to anti bribery provisions.

It is vital we protect the public interest relating to the rule of law and address these serious allegations including contravention of our international obligations. Canadians deserve the best government possible.

The next step is a formal vetting process by a green-light committee, which could take more than a week to complete.

Rene Ephestion, leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Multicultural Inclusion Commission, has also expressed his interest in seeking the leadership. He could not be reached for comment.

A leadership convention has been scheduled for June 21-22 in Saint John.

Vickers issued a statement Friday saying he is looking forward to speaking with Liberals “about a new path forward.”

He has drafted a five-point plan that calls for growing the province’s economy and population, improving health care, “transforming” education, ensuring environmental protection and making sure provincial finances are well managed.

His statement also took a shot at the governing Conservative party.

“With this year’s provincial budget, we saw the finance minister raise his hands in despair against the economic and demographic headwinds that New Brunswick faces,” Vickers said.

“We’ve also seen no provincial action on climate change, despite the fact that we’re a year removed from record flooding in key parts of the province.”

Article Continued Below Prior to 2015, the Liberal party held two seats in British Columbia. But after “Trudeaumania” took the country, the Liberals ...","That’s according to Martyn Brown, a former BC Liberal — a provincial party that has no ties to the federal one and is often aligned with small “c” conservative values — who was chief of staff for the province’s premier during the 2000s.

VANCOUVER—Though British Columbia should be fertile ground for the Liberals to grow support ahead of October’s general election, the party’s biggest asset in 2015 is now its biggest liability: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Brown’s comments follow a new Research Co. poll released on Tuesday that found a majority of British Columbians believe a new party leader would be better. A third of B.C. residents who voted for the Liberals in 2015 also believe a different party leader would do things better in Ottawa than Trudeau.

“As long as Trudeau is their leader, the party is bound to suffer big time.”

“B.C. is critical to the Liberals’ fortunes, as their strength in Quebec seems to be waning and in Atlantic Canada they’re grossly under attack. They have to look for where they can gain seats,” Brown said in an interview.

And that animosity toward Canada’s current prime minister is pervasive across the province, though strongest outside of the Metro Vancouver region, said Mario Canseco, president of Research Co.

“That’s the danger the Liberals are facing,” Canseco said. “This is more worrisome in urban areas where you can see people gravitate more to the NDP, which places a lot of seats in jeopardy.”

Meanwhile, half of British Columbians think a different party is needed to lead in Ottawa. Notably, a majority of all age groups polled — from millennials to boomers and beyond — felt that way, as well as a quarter of 2015 Liberal voters.

Prior to 2015, the Liberal party held two seats in British Columbia. But after “Trudeaumania” took the country, the Liberals went from third place in the House of Commons to holding a majority government. Now, they hold 17 seats in B.C.

Canseco questioned whether they could sustain that momentum.

And while there wasn’t much of a gender gap in 2015, men are now more likely to be critical and dissatisfied with the Liberals.

Canseco is closely following the millennial reaction to Trudeau, as the previous election saw a significant spike in the youth vote. For Canseco, the big question ahead of the fall election will be exactly where those votes go.

“It’s no longer the idea of Trudeau as a great unifier, and if they find a shinier object out there, will they support it?” he said. “If you’re disenchanted because of environmental decisions, or maybe electoral reform, or the SNC-Lavalin affair, do you stay home or vote Green or NDP?”

Poll results were based on an online study from March 8 to 10 among 800 adults in B.C., with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.

Left-leaning progressives offended by the SNC-Lavalin affair may be tempted to vote for the NDP or Greens, Brown said, while centre-right leaning and “swing Liberals” will now be swayed to vote Conservative.

Disenchantment with Trudeau — particularly in B.C. — has risen because he has “failed” on so many files, according to Brown, such as proportional representation, balancing the budget, reconciliation and the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“(All that has) dramatically reduced his party’s fortunes in Greater Vancouver on progressive, environmentally conscious voters,” he said. “On so many files, he’s proven himself to be the opposite of what he purports to be.”

Braeden Caley, a Liberal party spokesperson, says Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on a strong plan for British Columbians “to build more affordable housing, invest in better roads and transit, grow the economy and protect a healthier environment for our kids and grandkids.”

A decline in support for the Liberals is exaggerated, according to Caley. He says grassroots support for the party continues to grow.

“More than 15,000 British Columbians have singed up as new Liberals in the past two years alone,” he said in an email. “The Liberal party is also continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming Team Trudeau candidates throughout British Columbia, building on the strong growth that we’ve seen in our B.C. team and caucus in recent years.”

Brown has been publicly calling for Trudeau to step down to improve the Liberal party’s chances in October, amid the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair which he said has “dramatically undercut” Trudeau’s personal brand of having the ethical high-ground.

He predicts an RCMP probe on the matter in the near future and told the Star the Liberal party will only have a chance in October if they find a new leader. Brown said that would be in their best “political self-interest,” especially with the support of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott.

“If they went into an election with those two women behind them saying we’re cleaning up our act and we mean it,” Brown said, “it would suddenly turn the table and make the new Liberal leader potentially the voice of a new ethical government instead of the opposite.”

The Conservatives capture 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote – essentially unchanged from where they stood last month – but it is the governing Liberals who have dropped three points to 28 per cent as the SNC-Lavalin affair has remained in the headlines.

These parties are seeing their fortunes rise as the Canadian public expresses unfavourable views of the main parties and their leaders.

But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and ...,"The Walrus/flickr

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conversations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence. She entered politics with her mind set on transforming the country and, after three years, came to believe she couldn’t do it as a Liberal. An early party switch meant trying to make the most of what could be her last year in office, she says, noting she had the support of her family and many constituents. But it also meant alienating supporters and staff who fought to get her elected and who now have reason to want to see her lose. Later this year, they will get their say on whether her actions were genuine and, above all, justified.",The Politics of Switching Parties,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/the-politics-of-switching-parties/

Within minutes Monday afternoon, two good reporters had stories (here and here) about the Chief Justice of Manitoba, who was a candidate to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and who, later, wasn’t. Both reporters unfurled similar yarns about a lone Prime Minister standing athwart the tide of conservatism by blocking—shudder—a Harper appointee from sitting on the top court. Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

We’ve all seen the video of the Viking Sky cruise-ship disaster.

The water rushing in. The chaotic scenes from the bow as the ship is tossed to-and-fro. The helpless tub, dead in its tracks, threatening to crash on the rocks.

Ah, yes. The Leaky Ship Liberal.

Perilously listing. Its passengers screaming for help. A showpiece of negligence and neglect, going nowhere fast.

With Captain Trudeau asleep at the wheel and his first mate Lametti lounging as it leaks. Both are completely confounded by the sudden turn of events that has set their once proud and seemingly invincible ship-of-state reeling.

Holy crap. Now we learn that the former chair of the Liberal Agency of Canada audit committee is bolstering calls for a public inquiry into the LavScam debacle.

Do they even know how ridiculous they look, trying to maintain a stiff upper lip while doing diddly squat to respond to their government’s latest self-inflicted catastrophe?

Do they have the faintest clue how inept, insensitive, and foolhardy they appear in posing as mere bystanders in the accident-in-the-making in the name of the partisan flag now in tatters?

I am referring of course to the appalling attempt by some unknown miscreant to discredit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by leaking confidential information aimed at painting Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as an avowed enemy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

If you are not yet quite up to speed on that fiasco—perhaps, because you’ve been too busy throwing up from the other endless sickening swells in the LavScam disaster—you can learn all about it here, here and here.

The attacks on Justice Joyal were vicious, malicious, and possibly criminal in their motivation, in their abuse of power and position, and in their potentially defamatory content and design.

They were enough to prompt him to respond with remarkable self-restraint, “I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

They were enough to prompt Conservative MP Lisa Raitt to write to Marc Giroux, Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs, urging him to investigate the matter.

He responded by stressing that “The release of any such confidential information is wholly inappropriate,” but that “in light of [his] particular role and [its] enabling statute, he is “not in a position to accede to [Raitt’s] request to investigate”.

The deputy leader of the Conservatives, Lisa Raitt, wants an investigation into the leak concerning the chief justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal.

And what of the intended target of the Liberals’ scurrilous leaks intended to present her as a de facto anti-Liberal, whose own first choice as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada was supposedly someone who stood to undermine Trudeau’s father’s proudest legacy?

Puglaas has proved yet again that she is a woman of dignity, sound bearing, and righteous resolve who is not to be trifled with or so easily disparaged by those on her Liberal “team” (“more united than ever!”) who are so intent on doing her harm.

She forcefully responded with a call to investigate the breach of confidence, to find the leaker, and to hold him or her or them duly accountable. We should expect no less of her, as someone who could give current attorney general David Lametti lessons in what the office she held really demands in its leader.

“I do feel compelled to say that I have not—as some have suggested—been the source of any of these stories, nor have I ever authorized any person to speak on my behalf,” she said.

“I strongly condemn anyone who would speak about or provide information on such sensitive matters. Any commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC [Supreme Court of Canada] appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process, our institutions and potentially sitting justices.”

And JWR and Raitt were far from the only persons sending out an SOS.

Others called out the nefarious leakers and urged the prime minister and Lametti to act.

The Canadian Bar Association offered this condemnation:

“There is a process to get informed input about the merits of the applicants. It rightly goes on behind closed doors. Keeping the deliberations confidential respects the privacy of applicants and guards against interference,” said CBA president Ray Adlington.

“Breaching confidentiality by releasing the names and commenting on the suitability of the other applicants after the appointment demeans the selection process and ultimately all those who hold the office of judge.”

The Law Society of Manitoba issued this statement:

“The Law Society of Manitoba is very concerned when circumstances arise that will weaken the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. A highly confidential process has been established to encourage the best and brightest candidates to put their names forward for appointment to all levels of courts.

“The integrity of that process is called into question when the confidentiality of deliberations and discussions about candidates appears not to have been maintained.

“Confidentiality is critical to protecting the reputation of all applicants including sitting judges, who are not able to respond to unjust criticism. The aspersions cast in recent media reports on Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench represent an unwarranted attack on a distinguished judicial career.”

Oh, yes. Trudeau’s leakers also had no compunctions about compromising CTV’s journalistic best interests in choosing that esteemed forum as the most suitable outlet for their spurious counter-rationale for JWR’s supposed longstanding friction with the prime minister.

A false twist on the true treachery, as it were, that was supposed create new cover for Trudeau’s firing of the main person who could be trusted to protect the rule of law and the independence of her office as Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

David Lametti was sworn in as attorney general and justice minister at Rideau Hall as Justin Trudeau looked on. Adam Scotti/Prime Minister's Office

Yet despite that crescendo of outrage crying out for action, echoed by so many pundits, columnists, and others, what have we heard in response from Trudeau and Lametti?

After three days, no less?

Absolutely nothing of hard consequence.

Neither Trudeau nor Lametti apparently have any intention of investigating that wanton breach of public trust.

They have so far failed to take any action to investigate that egregious violation of personal privacy and that calculated smear on a sitting justice and on JWR, which is at its core yet another deliberate affront to justice.

Lametti’s Twitter response was pathetic.

It was as weak as Trudeau’s mealy-mouthed prattle that could be interpreted as he damn well knows or suspects that the leaks came from within his own office. And it seems he won’t be doing anything to try to identify and potentially prosecute the person(s) responsible.

Video of Raitt demands investigation into SCC appointment leaks Watch Lisa Raitt tell CTV why she thinks there needs to be an investigation.

This, from the guy who only last month waxed on about his father’s deep commitment to justice.

Who bleated that “those principles of justice are fundamental to me in what we are as a country, what we want to be as a society. And I have spent my entire political career fighting for justice and for people … the SNC-Lavalin file was not an exception.”

Some fight. He has done more in his single term in office to erode Canadians’ confidence in justice and the rule of law than any other prime minister in living memory.

Meanwhile, the whole Liberal crew hides behind the ludicrous tweets of Sheila Copps, who seems to be quite comfortable debasing herself with no end of attacks aimed at discrediting JWR and former treasury board president Jane Philpott and driving them both out of caucus.

The party that once held itself above all others as a moral force of international repute is now a rudderless vessle awash in its own bilge water.

It doesn’t look, act, or smell anything like its former “renewed” post-Adscam, self. And that won’t change as long as the guy with the real dirt on his hands is at the helm.

His arrogance knows no bounds, as he demonstrated yet again at the Liberal fundraiser in which he laughed off protesters from the Grassy Narrows First Nation who were concerned about mercury contamination in their communities with the sarcastic dismissal: “Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.”

This is what it’s come to, really? Making jokes aimed at disparaging Indigenous peoples whose health is being threatened by mercury poisoning and tainted water supplies that successive governments have done nothing about?

Yeah, that’ll go a long way to advancing the goal of reconciliation.

Despite his belated apology after getting pounded by all who watched the clip, that type of “leadership” goes a long to explaining why Trudeau’s approval rating is now lower than Donald Trump’s, according to one new poll.

I say again, it ought to be Trudeau who walks the plank if his battered ship is to have any chance of winning back the public confidence needed to convince Canadians it’s safe to ride for another term in government.

And if the contrast between Puglaas and Lametti previously flattered the former, the latter is now also looking like he might be unworthy of the independent office that he was invited to uphold.

Get off your sorry butt and at least pretend that you are not so afraid to offend your sinking captain by getting to the bottom of this matter that was so wrongly initiated under his watch and in his perceived partisan interests.

Like the greater LavScam scandal that gave rise to this new wrongdoing, this fiasco threatens to corrode and degrade all it touches in its filthy wake.

The NDP’s standard bearer in the riding will be selected on Saturday.

The byelection already features an interesting cast of characters, including a jilted Conservative who lost a bid for her party’s candidacy and jumped to Maxime Bernier’s Peoples Party of Canada (PPC); a Green candidate who had a falling out with the NDP ahead of the last federal election; and a Liberal Indigenous candidate with as big a profile as Jody Wilson-Raybould when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited her for the Liberals in 2015.

Singh, who took a seat in the House of Commons for the first time last week after winning his own byelection in the greater Vancouver riding of Burnaby South last month, will greet the NDP candidate in Nanaimo on Sunday, his office told iPolitics.

A roster of four NDP candidates suggests the New Democrat’s confidence in the riding, despite a late entry into the race and a hike in Green Party support in the past years. Prime Minister Trudeau announced the byelection on March 24.

A day after Trudeau set the byelection date, he surfaced in Nanaimo to circulate and draw attention to a star Liberal candidate, who the party had announced only a week earlier. That candidate, Michelle Corfield, is a prominent and highly successful Indigenous leader who holds a doctorate from Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business.

Corfield is also chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of Ucluelet First Nation and a founding member of a settlement trust at Ucluelet First Nation on the western coast of Vancouver Island. Corfield is an executive resident at the Beedie School’s Indigenous Business and Economic Development Knowledge Exchange.

Despite the credentials of his party’s candidate, or perhaps to ensure Corfield was the one in the limelight during an ongoing confrontation between Trudeau and one of his star 2015 candidates, Vancouver Liberal MP and former justice minister Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau declined to take questions from local news media.

Even with as prominent a candidate as Corfield, the Liberal party faces an uphill battle toward May 6.

Vancouver Island resisted the Liberal wave of 2015, voting in New Democrats in six of the island’s seven federal electoral districts. The seventh, Saanich—Gulf Islands, was won by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for her second term in the House of Commons.

The contests were close and Angus Reid Institute’s polling analyst Shachi Kurl notes that Vancouver Island has been a tug-of-war between New Democrats and Conservatives over the past years.

“The island has a tendency to swing orange or blue,” Kurl said in a phone interview from her Vancouver office.

Nanaimo News Bulletin reporter Nicholas Pescod says he expects the NDP will continue to hold Nanaimo—Ladysmith. “I suspect the NDP will do well,” he said in a telephone interview from the News Bulletin newsroom.

Kurl noted low-turnout byelections can hinge on local organization, for which the NDP is famous in B.C.

Nanaimo—Ladysmith was left vacant after popular former NDP MP Sheila Malcolmson, announced last fall that she was making the jump to provincial politics. She resigned her Commons seat on Jan. 2 to contest and win a byelection in the provincial electoral district of Nanaimo. That Jan. 30 byelection was crucial for the survival of the province’s NDP coalition government.

For the May 6 federal byelection, the NDP field of four candidates also includes a prominent Indigenous candidate, Bob Chamberlin, who is vice-president of the long-established Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and chief councillor with the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation at the north end of Vancouver Island.

The other three NDP hopefuls include Lauren Sample, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson, a past president of Nanaimo Pride, and a women’s rights advocate; Maeve O’Byrne, a founder of the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation who coaches volunteers working in refugee camps; and Fred Statham, whose electoral experience includes two attempts at election to Nanaimo city council.

The nominated field for other parties is just as unique.

The Green Party and Conservative candidates launched their nomination bids last fall, after Malcolmson announced she would not seek re-election federally.

Green candidate Paul Manly, who came third against Malcolmson in 2015, was acclaimed as the Green candidate on Feb. 3, after launching his nomination campaign last Oct. 25. According to commenters on a Reddit forum and other media, Manly tried to contest the NDP riding’s general election nomination in 2015, but claimed later his candidacy was rejected because he protested Israel’s treatment of his father, former NDP MP Jim Manley, who was arrested after taking part in an attempt to breach Israel’s 2012 sea blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The nominated Conservative candidate for the byelection, Sun Life office manager John Hirst, won his nomination on Nov. 17 last year. His opponent for the Tory nomination, Jennifer Clarke, was picked up to run for the PPC.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ben Nelms The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

She outlined a two-pronged strategy beginning with a rebate of up to $5,000 to purchase a vehicle powered by an electric battery or hydrogen fuel cell and with a price up to $45,000. The government has committed $300 million over three years to that program.

Added to that, businesses who buy them will be eligible for a full write-off on their capital cost allowance in the year of purchase, compared to 30% per year allowed for gas-fueled vehicles. And the limit will be $55,000 plus sales tax, up from $30,000.

""This can become a hugely, hugely important incentive for fleets to change over to zero-emission vehicles,"" Bennett said during a media event at the University of Northern British Columbia.

In answer to a concern the $45,000 cap will limit the choice of vehicles people can purchase and still get the incentive, Bennett said those looking at pricier vehicles, ""probably don't need the rebate to make that choice.""

However, she said it's possible the made-in-Canada Chrysler Pacifica minivan could be included at a future date.

The incentive was included in the federal budget released earlier this month, as was a $130-million commitment over five years to establish more charging stations across the country. It comes on top of $182.5 million committed to that cause in previous budgets.

""We want to make it easier for Canadians to make greener choices by making it more convenient to use electric vehicles,"" Bennett said, speaking from a podium placed between two electric-powered vehicles and in front of one of the two charging stations on the UNBC campus.

Suzanne Goldberg of ChargePoint, who also attended the event, said a target for the number of charging stations the $130 million should deliver has not yet been set but the previous commitment of $182.5 million was to support about 900 of them.

The aim is to have all vehicles sold in Canada being zero-emission by 2040. In the lead up, gas-free vehicles would make up 10% of market by 2025, and 30% by 2030 under the strategy.

The transportation sector accounts for 25% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions and three-quarter of that come from trucks, cars and commercial vehicles, Bennett said.",Federal Liberal showcases electric vehicle strategy in Northern B.C.,Alaska Highway News,https://www.alaskahighwaynews.ca/regional-news/federal-liberal-showcases-electric-vehicle-strategy-in-northern-b-c-1.23775622

By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A former cabinet member at the heart of a crisis that could cost Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau his job on Friday released documents to back up her case that she had been pressured to help a large corporation avoid a corruption trial.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a trial by paying a fine instead.

The crisis may well threaten Trudeau's reelection chances in a vote this October. Polls show his center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

Wilson-Raybould made public around 40 pages of documents revealing more details of what she said were attempts by officials to force her change her mind even after she insisted they desist.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and resigned the following month, first made the allegations in almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month.

Trudeau says officials were trying to make Wilson-Raybould understand that thousands of jobs would be at risk if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty of bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau insists he and his team did nothing wrong.

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest personal aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy, Michael Wernick.

Wilson-Raybould included a recording of a phone call with Wernick last December in which he told her he was worried about ""a collision"" between her and Trudeau ""because he is pretty firm about this.""

Wilson-Raybould, who stressed she thought the call was inappropriate, told Wernick she was waiting ""for the other shoe to drop"" because she was under no illusion about how Trudeau ""gets things that he wants.""

Opposition legislators said the documents reinforced their demand for a public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau says is not necessary.

""She is actually trying to speak truth to power, trying to say, 'You can't do this,' ... and it keeps happening,"" New Democratic Party parliamentarian Nathan Cullen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau's office was not immediately available for comment.

The crisis is opening rifts inside the Liberal Party and some legislators want Wilson-Raybould to be kicked out of the parliamentary caucus, a move Trudeau has so far resisted.

77,Politics,2019-03-26T22:39:00.0000000Z,Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line ... “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit ...,"OTTAWA — Liberal MPs have blocked the latest attempt to provide a venue for former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to testify on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

On Tuesday, the battleground moved to the Commons ethics committee, which considered a Conservative motion to launch a study after the Liberal-dominated justice committee voted to conclude its investigation without calling more witnesses.

But the six Liberals on the ethics committee out-voted the Conservatives, who had two votes, and the NDP, who had one, and the motion failed.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre called the result especially ironic given recent comments from some Liberal MPs that it was time for Wilson-Raybould to just say her piece, rather than dribbling out news day-by-day. In the most prominent example, Liberal MP Judy Sgro said in a radio interview over the weekend that Wilson-Raybould needed to “either put up or shut up.”

“Today, the Liberals got together and voted against giving her the chance to say it,” Poilievre told reporters. “You know, this is a cavalcade of contradictions and cover-up.”

Parliament has been seized by the SNC-Lavalin affair for nearly two months now, after The Globe and Mail published an allegation on Feb. 7 that Wilson-Raybould had been politically pressured while attorney general to intervene and defer the corruption prosecution of the construction company.

Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line, and had even previously cast a vote in favour of holding a public inquiry on the matter, he told the committee he felt launching the study was premature.

He noted Wilson-Raybould planned to provide a written submission to the justice committee that included further evidence, including text messages and emails.

“To me, it makes far more sense to see what is said in that public statement, to see how justice (committee) reacts to that, frankly, and whether they think any of that new information is something worth reconsidering their previous decision to close off their study,” Erskine-Smith said.

The NDP’s Tracey Ramsey rejected that, saying the Liberals blocked multiple attempts to keep the investigation going. “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit that,” she said. “There is absolutely no indication that they will entertain any further conversation.”

The Conservatives offered an amendment to call Wilson-Raybould only after her submission to the justice committee, but Erskine-Smith said it was too early to make decisions before seeing what she provided. It is not known when Wilson-Raybould will make her submission, but justice committee chair Anthony Housefather has said it will be made public.

Erskine-Smith also pointed out that Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is already studying the matter, and said the committee should support Dion’s study rather than launch a parallel process.

Finally, Erskine-Smith argued that the waiver provided by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Wilson-Raybould on cabinet confidence privilege and solicitor-client privilege only covered testimony to the justice committee, not the ethics committee.

That waiver has become its own source of conflict, however. Wilson-Raybould has pointed out it does not apply to events after she was removed as justice minister, and opposition parties have demanded Trudeau provide an expanded waiver to cover that time period. Philpott also said in an interview in Maclean’s magazine last week that there was “much more to the story that should be told.”

This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own

After the meeting, while other Liberal MPs left without making their position clear, Erskine-Smith stayed and said he believed an expanded waiver may be necessary — depending what Wilson-Raybould’s evidence to the justice committee showed.

“If still, to get at the truth, there is additional information that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott need to provide that they are unable to provide because of the confines of the existing waiver, then yes, to get at the truth there should be a broadening of that waiver,” he said.

He said he believed that was only a fair position, given the comments from some of his colleagues that “we should get all of this information out in the open as quickly as possible and deal with it and move on.”

Both the Conservatives and NDP — and even Erskine-Smith — condemned two stories that came out Monday that contained leaks about the Supreme Court of Canada appointment process. The stories cited confidential sources to allege that tension had arisen between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould when she recommended the appointment of Glenn Joyal, a Manitoba judge who Trudeau felt to be too conservative.

“This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own,” said Conservative MP Peter Kent during the meeting.

Speaking earlier in the day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not respond directly when asked by a reporter whether his office leaked the story.

“Canadians can have confidence in our government’s respect for the institutions, for the Supreme Court,” he said. “Canadians have confidence in the strength of our judiciary in this country. And I have no further comment to make on this issue.”

Mr. Turtle said the Prime Minister’s dismissive remarks to protesters, Ottawa’s treatment of former minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and a general sense of inaction on Indigenous issues are producing widespread disappointment with the Liberal government.

“Looking at the whole picture … I would say that the Prime Minister has lost confidence with a majority of the native people,” he said in an interview with The Globe and Mail Friday.

Mr. Turtle said the Prime Minister’s reaction to the protesters this week “felt like an insult” and he urged Mr. Trudeau to do more than apologize.

“We acknowledge the apology, but that’s about it. I guess I would say actions speak louder than words. I’ve been asking him to come to Grassy Narrows to visit our community and he’s always brushed it aside, so I guess if he started showing some action, then I would be more impressed,"" he said.

Mr. Turtle raised the issue of Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney-general who resigned from cabinet in February, and has accused the Prime Minister’s Office of applying inappropriate pressure in relation to a criminal prosecution. Ms. Wilson-Raybould, a former regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, also expressed frustration last fall with her government’s lack of progress on Indigenous files.

“It’s just the way he handled it,"" Mr. Turtle said. “In terms of reconciliation, [Mr. Trudeau] should have done his best to accommodate her.”

Francis Kavanaugh, Grand Chief of Grand Council Treaty #3, which includes Grassy Narrows and 27 other First Nations, said Mr. Trudeau hasn’t lived up to the expectations set by the Liberals in 2015.

“I’m just very, very disappointed. I had high hopes when he first became the Prime Minister. He ran on a platform of reconciliation – he was going to fix this, he was going to fix that – and I’m just starting to think that he’s a liar,” he said Friday in a phone interview.

Health problems facing residents of Grassy Narrows and neighbouring Wabaseemoong in northwestern Ontario were the focus of a protest that disrupted a speech Mr. Trudeau was delivering Wednesday evening in Toronto at a Liberal Party fundraising event.

When two protesters in the room shouted out that the people of Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning and that his government had promised to do something, Mr. Trudeau dismissed them.

Video of Mr. Trudeau’s response spread quickly online, prompting widespread condemnation from First Nations leaders and others.

Mr. Trudeau apologized Thursday morning in Halifax, saying he had showed “a lack of respect.”

Members of both communities have long experienced health problems linked to toxins released into the river system in the 1960s by a paper mill in Dryden, Ont. The contamination affected the local fish population − a regular source of food and commerce. The waters remain contaminated decades later.

Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong are waiting on the federal and Ontario governments to deliver on two key promises that were both made in 2017: a provincial pledge to clean up the contamination and a federal promise to build a new health facility to treat patients affected by mercury.

The Ontario Liberal government’s 2017 announcement promised to place $85-million in a trust fund to pay for cleaning up the mercury contamination in the region. A spokesperson for the current Progressive Conservative government said officials continue to work with the communities on how to spend the money set aside for remediation. However, no firm project plans have been announced.

From the federal government, then-Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott promised in November, 2017, that a specialized health facility would be built in the area to serve people affected by mercury poisoning.

The federal government is assuming responsibility for building a facility, but is looking for provincial help in areas such as health-care staffing.

Indigenous Services Canada received a draft feasibility study for the treatment centre on Nov. 28, 2018, which covered issues such as location, design and estimated operational costs.

Federal Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan said in a statement that the department continues to work with the communities and the province on plans.

John Morris/The Canadian Press

Prince Edward Island’s Green leader is contemplating making history – as the party’s first Canadian premier.

Islanders will go to the polls April 23 in a provincial election announced late Tuesday.

Recent polls have put the Greens out in front, and Leader Peter Bevan-Baker believes his party can win a province that has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

Story continues below advertisement

“That possibility is there. Emotionally, politically and intellectually, I feel like I’m ready for that challenge, in a way that I wasn’t perhaps a year ago,” he said.

“This could be a truly historic moment not only in Canadian politics but for the future of our grandchildren.”

Bevan-Baker, 56, grew up in Scotland and immigrated to Canada in 1985, living in Newfoundland and then Ontario before settling in Prince Edward Island in 2003. He became a Canadian citizen in 1992.

A dentist by profession, he became his party’s first member of the P.E.I. legislature in 2015, following nine unsuccessful bids provincially and nationally for the party.

Since then, the Greens captured a second seat on the Island, and have been successful in getting members elected in other provinces, including three during last year’s New Brunswick election.

Bevan-Baker – who celebrated Tuesday’s election call by playing “First Call” on his trumpet at a nomination meeting – said he believes the time for the Green party has arrived.

“That sort of global movement away from conventional politics and unimaginative politicians, you see that expressed everywhere,” he said, citing recent elections in U.S. and Ontario as expressions of disgruntlement with conventional politics.

“I think what’s happening on P.E.I. is a local expression of that global phenomenon,” he said.

A Corporate Research Associates opinion poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

Bevan-Baker said that both delights and surprises him. He said he has to accept the possibility of forming government.

“We’ve crafted a platform, that for perhaps the first time ever in Canada, a Green platform that might have to be implemented. You come at it with a different lens. You can’t be just aspirational and vague and uncosted. You have to have a detailed and costed platform, which we have,” he said.

But Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan has issued a caution about the Green party, saying the province’s future is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments.

Story continues below advertisement

Bevan-Baker said he’s not sure what MacLauchlan is referring to, but believes it could be his suggestion that P.E.I. would be a good place for a pilot program for a universal basic income. He said that would be expensive at first, but pay off in the long run.

For his part, MacLauchlan used the first full day of the campaign to promise at least 3,500 new jobs over the next four years.

He said that’s in addition to the 5,000 full-time jobs added over the last four years.

“As I have said numerous times since I became premier, the creation of jobs and job choices for Islanders has to be the number one priority of government.”

“Our record in this field is strong. However, our present success is no reason to take the foot off the gas. Support for workers, for employers and for the next generations of workers needs to continue.”

The announcement includes a $4.5 million P.E.I. Worker Benefit to assist 12,600 low-income Islanders.

The Liberals would also spend $750 million on infrastructure programs to improve roads, bridges and schools, with a focus on job creation.

MacLauchlan said money would also be spent on a number of training programs, including new vocational facilities at Island high schools, and the small business tax rate would be reduced to 2.5 per cent by 2020.

Repeated calls requesting an interview with Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King were not returned Wednesday.

Bevan-Baker said his party’s platform will be released in its entirety – likely next week.

While the parties have begun to pitch their issues, Don Desserud, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said he believes the election will come down to personalities.

“It’s going to be an election based on the personalities of the leaders and people are going to vote according to whether they like or dislike the leaders of the parties,” Desserud said.

“The Progressive Conservatives are rising in the polls. The Liberals are falling in the polls and the Greens are staying quite steady high in the polls. I think it all has to do with the leaders and how well they’re liked,” he said.

The Island economy has been strong and the Conference Board of Canada recently said P.E.I. would lead the country in economic growth for the year ahead.

Desserud said voters blame the government when the economy is bad, but unfortunately for the Liberals, they don’t often credit the government when the economy is good.

“The Green party has been prudent in the way in which they have presented themselves and their policies and have appealed to the small ‘c’ conservatism of the Island. That’s worked really well for them, but I think right now they’re benefiting from the fact they are the alternative,” Desserud said.","PEI Green Leader says he is ready to form government, make party history",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-pei-green-leader-says-he-is-ready-to-form-government-make-party/

Wilkinson starts by saying “British Columbians have seen right through Premier Horgan’s last minute “public consultation” on caribou recovery efforts. It is clear that staging a half-hearted public engagement was the only thing the NDP deemed necessary to move forward with their pre-determined plan. Forget listening to local residents with years of experience and deep knowledge of the wildlife and land base, this sham consultation is meant simply to placate every rural and northern British Columbian who lives, works, and plays in the backcountry while ignoring their voices.”

The B.C. Government shared in a press release Tuesday, March 26th, 2019 they have scheduled community engagement sessions allowing the public to provide their feedback on two draft agreements to conserve southern mountain caribou populations.

“Thankfully, nobody is buying it. For months, regional districts and provincial MLAs begged the provincial government to hold meaningful public consultations on how British Columbia would work with Ottawa to put together an effective plan to increase the dwindling caribou population. Despite promises to engage the public, the Horgan government announced that a draft plan had been reached between the province, some First Nations, and the federal government before any consultation occurred. With a draft plan already agreed to, the NDP declared a short five-week consultation period ending on April 25th only a few days before Ottawa’s deadline.

It is said that staff from the Provincial and Federal Governments as well as the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations will share information about the draft agreements and will answer questions.

Wilkinson shares his concern of this plan will have a major impact on the forest, mining, and tourism industries, noting recreational users may also find themselves unable to access the backcountry as a result.

“We all want caribou numbers to rebound to a healthy level, but this can only be achieved if the public becomes an active part of the conversation. The fact that local knowledge and on-the-ground experience has been so overlooked, and only brought into the picture as a token afterthought once the plan had already been drafted, should trouble any observer,” said Wilkinson

Local MLAs are voicing their concerns about the plan for public consultation;

MLA for Peace River South, Mike Bernier, says he is concerned that the Government took a long time to release a draft and will not provide a long enough time frame for public consultation on the agreement.

Peace River North MLA, Dan Davies, echos the concerns that Bernier has on the issue saying that the Government is not providing enough time for public consultation on the draft and that stakeholders should have been included in the process.

When Donald Trump was elected in 2016, many of us Canadians wagged our fingers smugly at our southern neighbour. “What were they thinking?” we said to one another in line at Tim Hortons. We spent the next year or so glued to CNN, more captivated by American politics than what’s happening here.

We might have wanted to pay more attention.

The tide in the Great White North appears to be shifting right — but not in the way we’re used to. This isn’t a typical liberal-conservative tug-o-war, the ebb and flow we’ve seen throughout election cycles. This new movement is one that has already swept through Hungary, Poland, the U.S., it’s fuelled Brexit in the U.K. and has seen the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, who have been compared to the Nazi regime. And it’s tilted so far to the right that it threatens to upend our democracy and the very liberties we’ve fought for.

While conservatives have historically called for less government regulation, lower taxes and a stronger military, today’s Canadian right-wing politics has rebranded itself to include more visible intolerance. Bigotry isn’t just bubbling under the surface these days, it’s out in the open and proudly displayed for when the guests come over.

This ugly, newfound boldness threatens to dominate the next federal election, impacting not only the world’s view of us a fair, diverse and welcoming country, but also the lives of all marginalized Canadians. That keeps me up at night.

As a gay mother with a trans child in the Ontario school system, and as a human rights advocate who spends a lot of time on social media, I’m on the receiving end of a lot of messages from people who think it’s “about time” politicians start standing up to “special interest groups.” We’ve been coddled for too long, they say, and we don’t deserve special treatment. They mock, namecall and outright threaten those of us who fight for the rights of marginalized people to be preserved. They’ve always done this, of course, but their voices, now embolded by the very politicians and public figures they support, are growing in number and getting angrier. I’ve had to file two police reports after my life was threatened — and those are only the incidents I reported.



This swing to the populist right is both in our face and insidious. Donald Trump might be loud and brash, but his win was unexpected by most. We surveyed the damage from up north, thinking it couldn’t possibly happen here. Surely, Canadians know better. We didn’t.

Modern populism has grown quietly, from the pages of right-wing websites to the birth of new neo-fascist groups such as the Proud Boys, now designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Support for the populism movement gained traction through one protest, one meeting, and one tweet at a time. Now it’s loud and it’s everywhere. It unseated Premier Kathleen Wynne and her Ontario government, with Premier Doug Ford and the Conservatives promising little more than a buck-a-beer and the end of teaching gender identity in schools.

And then, in October 2018, Premier Ford met privately with university professor Jordan Peterson. While the premier openly discussed other meetings that had taken place around that time, the public only learned of this one after the CBC obtained his itinerary through a freedom of information request.

Wildly popular in some right-wing circles, Peterson’s views have been slammed as retrograde, problematic and dangerous. He became well-known after taking a stand against using trans people’s chosen pronouns, claiming being forced to do so is an attack on free speech. He argued vehemently against the federal Liberal government’s now-passed trans rights bill, speaking in front of the senate committee overseeing the bill, and warned his followers about the dangers of “compelled speech.” Peterson has also proposed “enforced monogamy” as a way to reduce male violence and believes “crazy women” can’t be controlled by men because men can’t resort to physical violence against them.

Despite, or, perhaps, because of these views, Peterson, who teaches at the University of Toronto, earns tens of thousands of dollars monthly from his Patreon account, a site where fans can pledge financial support to creators of all stripes. These donations are given to him by admirers, many of them Canadians.

Ford, meanwhile, campaigned heavily on the removal of Ontario’s most current incarnation of the sex-ed curriculum, and followed through — a move that has earned much criticism and more than one lawsuit. However, it was also, in part, what earned his party a majority government. A slew of Ontarians has proudly come out in support of Ford’s policies, including the removal of mandatory student funding for certain college and university services, such as pride centres.

A week before meeting with Premier Ford, Peterson had spoken out in a tweet against the Ontario Human Rights Commission, claiming it to be the most “dangerous” organization in Canada, and calling for the Ford government to abolish it. Peterson has previously said he doesn’t agree with the OHRC’s support of gender identity and gender expression. The OHRC had just joined the legal fight against the Ontario provincial government’s removal of the sex-ed curriculum, which covered LGBTQ+ issues, consent and cyber-bullying.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission does exactly what the name implies: using the Ontario Human Rights Code as its guide, it strives to protect all Ontarians from discrimination and harassment. Those who are fiscally-minded might also appreciate how the OHRC first tries to resolve issues between parties out of court, taking the less-expensive mediation approach. It is not the country’s most dangerous organization, but its dismantling could certainly be very dangerous.

The timing of this secret meeting should ring alarm bells for liberals and conservatives alike. Protecting human rights is, after all, supposed to be a closely-held Canadian value.

Trump’s 2016 victory was a dog whistle for bigotry that reached the ears of Canadians. Doug Ford has proven Ontario will welcome similar politics, while Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, a federal right-wing party formed in 2018, has over 30,000 members and a social media presence that speaks out against “political correctness” and “diversity nonsense.”

Taking a page from the Yellow Vest movement in France, the Facebook group “Yellow Vests Canada” has more than 100,000 members. What began as a place to organize protests around the country quickly became a spot where anti-Liberal sentiments and memes are circulated around the clock, several going so far as to call for the Prime Minister’s death. Immigration is regularly condemned, and Islamophobia is dismissed as a made-up word.

While some of the most offensive posts have been removed over recent weeks, the views are still crystal clear. This group isn’t just anti-tax and pro-oil, it’s filled to the brim with intolerance. This message is consistent throughout provincial groups as well, such as BC Proud, Alberta Proud and Ontario Proud. With a combined total of hundreds of thousands of members in these groups, cries of fake news and the danger of refugees abound.

These sentiments don’t just live online.

Statistics Canada reported hate crimes had reached historically high levels in 2017, rising 47 per cent over the previous year, with Ontario and Quebec leading the pack on reported incidents. Black, Jewish and Muslim people were targeted most. Quebec saw a 50 per cent increase in hate crimes overall, and crimes against Muslims tripled between 2016 and 2017. In January of 2017, a shooter killed six men and injured several others in a Quebec City Mosque. Meanwhile, Ontario saw a 207 per cent increase in hate crimes against Muslims, and an 84 per cent increase against Black people. Crimes against LGBTQ+ people have also climbed. Swastikas have been spray painted on synagogues and other buildings across the country. Intolerance is growing.

Populism has many sources. Perhaps there are people who are tired of looking inward and are now lashing outward. Maybe, for some, it’s simpler to blame immigrants when they can’t find work than the companies who cut minimum wage jobs and still pay their executives millions in bonuses. Maybe it’s easier to find a scapegoat, to call someone like me a child abuser for supporting my transgender teen, than it is to grow and broaden our ideas of what’s normal.

Societal change can be hard and it can make people uncomfortable, but that’s a flimsy excuse for discrimination.

Intolerance has never gone away, it was simply out of fashion for a while. Now it’s back with a fresh new look and a boost from fake news and social media.

We should all care deeply about this frightening political shift and where it could take us.

I know I care, which is why I’m so scared about what’s happening in this country, and what’s yet to come.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

That piece is “Harper: Serial Abuser of Power, The Evidence Compiled: The Tyee’s full, updated list of 70 Harper government assaults on democracy and the law.”

You can find it here.

The article lists dozens of serious abuses of power racked up by former prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservatives from the time they formed government in 2006 until the date the article was published, Aug. 10, 2015.

The list was not concerned with Tory laws, policies or positions disagreeable to people whose politics don’t lean right.

Instead, The Tyee defined abuses of power to be the opposite of good government, acts ranging from “scams to smears, monkey-wrenching opponents to intimidating public servants… some offences are criminal, others just offend human decency.”

The article drew on suggestions from Tyee readers as well as journalists. Each carefully researched item in the list is linked to credible journalistic sources, including newspapers such as the National Post and the Globe and Mail whose editorial boards had backed the Conservatives in the previous election, and would do so in the fall of 2015.

The article quickly became one of The Tyee’s most read ever, and was one of the most widely read pieces by any news organization covering the federal election. After the contest was won by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, traffic for the article faded and it resided in The Tyee’s digital archives.

With another election coming, Trudeau and his party deny improper pressure was applied to former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in hopes of stopping a criminal trial of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Pilpott, who say the political interference was real, have resigned from cabinet. Trudeau’s top advisor Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick have quit their posts, as well.

After Wilson-Raybould gave testimony to the House justice committee on Feb. 27, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for an independent investigation into the affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was more aggressive, demanding that Trudeau step down.

Trudeau had “lost the moral authority to govern,” he charged, and was a “prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.”

Perhaps not coincidentally, that’s when The Tyee’s rap sheet on the last Conservative government began gaining a lot of new readers.

In the past month, the piece has received more than 14,000 page views, a near 2,000-per-cent jump over this time last year. Its numbers topped almost all other Tyee stories this month.

Who is suddenly reading and sharing the article and why?

It’s not hard to imagine why members of both the federal Liberals and NDP would find it apt to promote. The Liberals could point to the bad record of the Conservatives as evidence they were just as scandal-plagued when in power, or more so. The NDP might offer the piece to people souring on the Liberals as proof their party offers a cleaner alternative to the Tories.

Scheer was a Conservative MP throughout the Harper government, rising high in its ranks before becoming House speaker. He was first elected as a Saskatchewan MP in 2004, after accusing his opponent of being soft on child pornography because, in Commons debate, he’d warned against censoring art such as Nabokov’s novel Lolita.

A recent tweet by Tyee web director Bryan Carney noted the article has been popular of late.

This four-year-old Harper power abuses story almost kept up with SNC-Lavalin stories in traffic last weekhttps://t.co/y7z2rcmTjF — Bryan Carney (@bpcarney) March 4, 2019

The story has never flatlined, but Carney points out that the day after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, traffic began to ramp up. First, the hits came from Google.

Keywords like “did Stephen Harper break campaign rules”, “Harper + ethics violations”, “Harper government members with criminal convictions”, “Harper government scandals” and “what lies did Harper tell the Canadian people” started to show up from Google traffic.

Next, the traffic started to arrive from social media.

People posted reminders:

BC Liberal MLAs are joining forces with the governing NDP to assure that legislation that will guarantee tax breaks for the liquefied natural gas industry in B.C. will become law.

On Monday, the provincial government presented the legislation in the legislature, which immediately faced opposition by B.C. Green Party’s three MLAs – with 83 of the 87 of the MLAs in favour of the legislation, its passage through the legislature is ensured.

“British Columbians are counting on us to attract LNG investment to B.C. This legislation completes the process of creating a fiscal framework that invites investment while creating economic partnerships with Indigenous peoples and protecting our clean air, land and water,” said finance minister Carole James.

The tax breaks are part of a broader range of benefits for the LNG industry announced by premier John Horgan in March last year, including an exemption from provincial sales tax (PST) and being billed for electricity by BC Hydro at the same rate as other industrial users in B.C.

Making the announcement last year, Horgan said the breaks were conditional on a final investment decision (FID) before November 2018 – LNG Canada made its FID in October, a month before the deadline.

From January next year, the new natural gas tax credit will be available to qualifying LNG corporations, calculated at 3 per cent of the cost of natural gas. The tax credit can be used to reduce B.C.’s corporate income tax rate from 12 per cent to 9 per cent.

In addition, the PST break will save LNG Canada nearly $600 million during construction.

LNG Canada CEO Andy Calitz said the measures announced by Horgan last year provided LNG Canada’s joint venture participants with confidence that B.C. supported the project and facilitated its competitiveness against other LNG projects under development or in operations.

“The province’s support for LNG development will result in significant financial benefits over the 40-year operating life of the project. This includes operating performance payments, corporate income tax, carbon tax, royalty payments on gas, motor fuel tax, income tax from labour, PST, municipal tax and payments to First Nations,” said Calitz.

He said the benefits of the project were already beginning to show in B.C. in the form of jobs, training and skills development, social investments and the purchase of local goods along with utilizing B.C. services and trades.

“The value of LNG Canada’s financial contributions goes beyond the money that will become available to government to fund education, healthcare, childcare and the like – but also to the many individuals who will work in well paid skilled trades jobs, and the many apprentices that will begin their careers in the skilled trades working on the LNG Canada project,” added Calitz.

James said the LNG Canada project is currently rated as the cleanest LNG project in the world, despite the consortium’s decision to power its refrigeration and compression equipment by burning natural gas.

Weaver said an LNG plant in Louisiana is already moving to all-electric LNG production for export, meaning LNG Canada will not be the cleanest by the time it begins shipping in 2024.

James said as of December, there were 600 people working on the LNG Canada project, and more work on the pipeline route. Discussions continue with protesters who have built a camp on the route near Houston.

The LNG industry would pay the same income tax and BC Hydro rates as any other industry, the government said.

article continues below

But enabling legislation introduced today, March 25, on the government’s new LNG tax regime appears to give large projects like LNG Canada a subsidy in the form of a special tax break.

The legislation grants large projects that have project development agreements with the province – like LNG Canada – a special 3% tax credit on the cost of natural gas. This will bring the company’s corporate income tax rate down from 12% to 9%.

It appears smaller projects like Woodfibre LNG won’t be eligible for the tax break, since it only applies to projects that have signed agreements with the province.

Even before the legislation was tabled, Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver slammed the tax incentives being offered the industry as a “general sellout.”

He said the Green Party will not vote in favour of the legislation, which means the NDP government will need at least a few Liberal MLAs to vote in favour of it.

“I think it’s pretty clear the Greens will not vote in support of this legislation,” B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said in a press conference.

“But this is an important investment for British Columbia, and I think certainly the comments that I’ve heard from the BC Liberals show that they’re in support of LNG. You’ll have to ask (Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson) about that, but I expect that this legislation will go forward.”

Asked to defend what amounts to a subsidy, James said other industries also get special tax breaks.

""Whenever government takes a look at industry for British Columbia – whether we're talking about the film industry, whether we're talking about other industries – you take a look at how you can remain competitive to ensure that you continue to see continue to see investments in your province. That's exactly what we did with the LNG industry. We sat down with LNG Canada, we looked at how we could ensure our competitiveness as a province, which meant incentives...when it comes to the LNG tax credits.""

Business groups welcomed the new legislation for taxing the LNG industry.

“Today's announcement acknowledges the competitive realities facing many B.C. export industries,“ Greg D’Avignon, CEO of the Business Council of British Columbia, said in a press release.

The changes being made to the Liberal LNG tax regime not only eliminates a special LNG tax, it also offers the industry the same industrial rate for power that other industries pay, and it provides a $596 million deferral on PST on the project's capital costs.

The deferral applies to the capital spent on the LNG plant in Kitimat, export dock, storage facilities and work camps.

The company will only start paying PST back after the LNG plant in Kitimat is operating, or within seven years, whichever comes first, with payments starting out small and getting larger towards the end of the 20-year payback period. Other manufacturing facilities in B.C. get PST exemptions on capital investments, with no obligations to pay it back, government officials said in a technical briefing.

Despite the incentives being offered, the government estimates it will generate $23 billion in taxes and royalties over a 20-year period.

Under the NDP government's new CleanBC plan, LNG plants that are able to demonstrate that they meet or beat low emissions benchmarks, will also get a break on carbon taxes. They will still pay $30 per tonne. But as the carbon tax rises, they will be eligible for the incremental amount they pay to come back, if they demonstrate their plants meet or beat certain emissions intensity benchmarks.

Work is already underway in Kitimat and along the Coastal GasLink natural gas pipeline.

Author: Sean Rehaag, Associate Professor, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Canada

According to media reports, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of border security, is attempting to close a loophole in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).

The agreement allows Canada to send asylum-seekers back to the United States without hearing their refugee claims (and allows the U.S. the same option for those going in the other direction). The loophole is that the STCA only applies to asylum-seekers who present themselves at official land ports-of-entry.

Since President Donald Trump was elected, around 40,000 asylum seekers have used this loophole by crossing into Canada from the U.S. at places other than official ports-of-entry. They are not trying to sneak into Canada undetected. Rather, they cross the border irregularly to avoid being turned away under the STCA and then approach Canadian authorities to make refugee claims.

The number of irregular border-crossers has declined recently, with fewer than 1,000 in January 2019. What’s more, while the overall number of refugee claims made in Canada has been higher than usual in the past two years, it is not far off historical norms.

Nonetheless, the additional 40,000 refugee claims have produced pressures on the refugee determination system and on provincial social programs. There has also been political pushback, with calls from the Conservative party for the government to stem the flow.

However, closing the STCA loophole is a complicated proposition.

Blair reportedly wants irregular border-crossers to be taken to official ports-of-entry and processed as if they had presented themselves there directly. In other words, the STCA would apply both at official ports-of-entry and elsewhere.

To make this work, the U.S. would need to agree, which is the first complication.

More asylum-seekers come to Canada

The purpose of the STCA from a Canadian perspective was to force the U.S. to take responsibility for asylum-seekers who travel to Canada via the United States. Canada had long wanted the STCA because the flow of asylum-seekers is asymmetrical. Far more asylum-seekers come to Canada from the U.S. than the reverse.

For the same reason, the United States has long refused to agree to the STCA. That only changed after 9-11, when Canada offered the U.S. greater border security integration in exchange for the STCA.

Canada now wants to expand the STCA, so the question is: What will Canada have to give the U.S. to get them to agree?

One might expect quite a lot, given that Trump has shown little interest in taking steps that would result in thousands of asylum-seekers who would otherwise go to Canada remaining in the U.S.

The need for a quid pro quo raises a second complication. The STCA is being challenged in Canadian courts by human rights organizations who say that the U.S. is not safe for refugees and that the STCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Given the anti-refugee policies of the Trump administration, there is a good chance that courts will strike down the STCA. By negotiating expansions to the STCA without waiting to see whether the regime is upheld, there is a real risk that anything Canada gives to the U.S. in exchange will be for naught.

A third complication: Even if Canada gets the U.S. to agree to expand the STCA, and even if the regime is upheld by the courts, the impact of any expansion is likely to be both counterproductive and dangerous.

A dangerous incentive

If asylum-seekers who are intercepted at irregular border crossings are returned to the U.S., this will create a strong incentive for such asylum-seekers to cross the border without being intercepted.

Currently, irregular border crossings are manageable and organized. Most occur in a single, well-monitored location in Quebec. That crossing is not dangerous. Border officials and RCMP are present. Irregular border-crossers immediately enter into immigration and refugee processing, which includes health, criminality and security screening.

Other countries that have tried to stem flows of asylum-seekers by closing off safe and manageable routes have had a common experience. The flows do not stop but are instead diverted into more remote and hence more dangerous routes. Organized crime gets involved, bringing increased security risks and violence. The inevitable result is lost lives and decreased border security.

In the end, the political pressure on the government to be seen doing something on this file may outweigh these policy considerations. But politics lead to a fourth complication.

During the last federal election campaign, Justin Trudeau distinguished himself from former prime minister Stephen Harper partly through a more compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the death of Alan Kurdi — himself a tragic victim of cat-and-mouse games between smugglers and governments seeking to keep refugees at bay.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Prime Minister Trudeau further sought the moral high ground when, in response to the president’s anti-refugee policies, he famously tweeted Canadians will welcome those fleeing persecution.

There is no way to close the STCA loophole without the Liberal party turning its back on those progressive values, on the eve of a federal election campaign.

In this context, attempting to expand the STCA may not only be bad policy, it may also be bad politics.

Reid polled the province in December 2013 after McNeil’s Liberal Party formed the government earlier that year.","Nova Scotia’s long-serving premier Stephen McNeil has the lowest approval rating of any premier in Canada, while Quebec’s François Legault is the most popular provincial head of government with roughly six-in-ten Quebeckers approving of him.

The figures come from a new poll released on Tuesday by the Angus Reid Institute.

The institute says Legault’s approval is likely a sign that he’s still enjoying a honeymoon period after the Coalition Avenir Quebec formed government in the wake of Quebec’s provincial election in October.

His support is statistically unchanged from Angus Reid’s poll in December, despite facing criticism over comments that there is no Islamophobia in Quebec and that his government plans to scrap a backlog of more than 40,000 immigration applicants.

Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe has essentially the same approval rating as Legault, with 59 per cent of 842 Saskatchewanians polled saying they approve of his stewardship of the province.

Angus Reid says Moe’s approval has received a seven per cent bump since he succeeded Brad Wall as premier last year.

British Columbia’s John Horgan is the only other premier whose approval remains above 50 per cent, with Horgan receiving 52 per cent of support from B.C. residents.

Horgan’s approval has increased nine per cent since December and ties his highest mark as premier, set in March 2018.

New Brunswick’s Blaine Higgs, Canada’s newest premier, sits one point below a 50 per cent approval rating.

Even with a minority government, the first in the province since the 1920s, Higgs’ approval has risen by nine points since December.

Higgs has recently introduced his first budget which was characterized as tightening the belt in the province in an effort to balance the province’s budget.

With an election on the horizon, Alberta’s Rachel Notley has experienced an increase in popularity for the fifth consecutive quarter.

Angus Reid attributes this to an increase in personal appeal despite being a long shot to retain control of the government when Alberta heads to the polls on April 16.

Manitoba’s Brian Pallister has also had his popularity rise, with it reaching the highest level since March 2017.

Angus Reid’s polling data indicates that 44 per cent of the Manitoba electorate currently approves of him.

McNeil at the bottom of the pack

McNeil’s approval has hit the lowest figure since Angus Reid polled the province in December 2013 after McNeil’s Liberal Party formed the government earlier that year.

Nova Scotia’s premier sits at only 24 per cent support among those polled. In 2013 he sat at 57 per cent approval.

Despite tabling his fourth straight balanced budget on Tuesday McNeil has received criticism for perceived failures to follow through on health-care improvements and allocating $22.3 million on a ferry between Yarmouth, N.S., and Bar Harbor, Maine.

Newfoundland’s Dwight Ball and Ontario’s Doug Ford round out the three premiers who have an approval rating below four-in-ten.

Ford’s approval has dropped four points this quarter to 38 per cent, following criticism of his government’s decision to increase class sizes and an overhaul to the province’s autism funding.

However, a recent ruling by Ontario’s integrity commissioner found that the premier didn’t break the rules that govern legislators when one of his close friends was hired as the province’s top cop last fall.

Canada’s official opposition Conservative party, which opinion polls show could win an election in October, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not done enough to help canola ...","Ottawa | Reuters — Canada on Thursday took a notably tougher line with China over its ban on Canadian imports of canola seed, saying Beijing had provided no scientific evidence to justify the move and was hurting its own reputation.

China, citing the discovery of pests, expanded its ban on canola seed imports on Tuesday to include shipments from a second major exporter, Viterra.

Viterra is owned by Glencore’s agricultural arm. Earlier this month, Beijing halted shipments from Richardson International, Canada’s top exporter of canola seed.

Canada’s Liberal government and China have been locked in a trade and political dispute since the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies was arrested in Vancouver last December on a U.S. extradition request.

China accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to the Canola Council, with seed exports to China worth some $2.7 billion a year.

Canada’s official opposition Conservative party, which opinion polls show could win an election in October, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not done enough to help canola farmers and is bungling ties with China.

“The restrictive measures imposed by China are said to be rooted in science. We have asked for the evidence,” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in a statement.

“To date, none has been supplied. We will keep pushing as hard as we can on this vital point,” added Goodale, an MP from Saskatchewan, Canada’s biggest canola-producing province by tonnage since 1990.

Trudeau said on Wednesday he was concerned about the ban and could send a delegation to Beijing. He met with Richardson executives on Tuesday.

Goodale, using sterner language, said “measures that defy science and contravene sound business and trading practices detract from the good reputation for reliability which all trading nations seek to maintain.”

The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment.

Canadian food inspection officials say they have found no problems with canola seed exports.

“We will intervene at the right level of seniority and intensity — scientifically, strategically and diplomatically — to have the best possible impact,” said Goodale.

Conservative legislators on Thursday sent a letter requesting an emergency meeting of the Commons agriculture committee on Friday.

“We fear that if this issue is not resolved expeditiously, farmers will suffer significantly because of the prime minister’s ongoing mishandling of the Canada-China relationship,” they said in the letter.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses ...","OTTAWA – Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was cautioned about a potential “collision” with the prime minister over the SNC-Lavalin file by outgoing Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, a newly-released audio recording reveals. This caution came a month before she was shuffled out of her role, and nearly two months before the scandal began unfolding publicly.

According to an audio recording of a conversation that the pair had, submitted to the House Justice Committee by Wilson-Raybould, Wernick said he was worried what might happen if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould remained at “loggerheads” about whether or not to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to the Quebec engineering firm.

In the audio, Wilson-Raybould can be heard issuing repeated and stern warnings that senior officials pressuring her over the SNC-Lavalin case would “look like nothing but political interference” if the Quebec construction and engineering company were granted deferred prosecution. By the time of her recorded conversation with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould says she had already endured months of intense lobbying from such officials.

She said in the audio that she was absolutely confident in her decision -- to back the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision not to grant the agreement and to continue pursuing the criminal charges -- and in response, Wernick said he was “worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

In a statement late Friday, Trudeau’s office said that he was “not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” and that the PMO was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

The PMO statement reiterates that Trudeau wishes she would have gone to him directly about the matter, reinforcing his message that there “was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months” between all key actors in this affair.

“I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,” Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario said in a statement, according to The Canadian Press. According to his lawyer, Wernick was not aware the call had been recorded until it was released on Friday.

“She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar,” CP quotes him as saying.

The 17-minute audio file was provided to all members of the House Justice Committee on Friday, as part of the new and supplementary evidence related to the SNC-Lavalin scandal that she handed over days ago.

The 43-pages of additional material also includes a 21-page written statement, as well as screen shots of text messages and copies of emails that she referenced during her initial testimony, adding more fodder to the continuously developing controversy that’s dominated political headlines for the last two months.

The secret recording is of a Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick that both parties have previously testified to. In the recording Wilson-Raybould can be heard saying that she was trying to protect Trudeau by issuing these cautions about prosecutorial independence.

She said the way the case was being handled “screams of” political interference and that while she agrees jobs are important, the issue is how it would look if federal prosecutors dropped the criminal charges of fraud and corruption, in exchange for a remediation agreement.

Throughout the scandal -- which touched off on Feb. 7 when The Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to interfere in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin -- the federal Liberals have cited the 9,000 jobs at stake as their main motivator for any actions in this case.

Should SNC-Lavalin be found guilty, they could face a 10-year ban on applying for federal contracts, leading to the company having to move out of Canada.

“I feel that I am giving him my best advice. And if he doesn’t accept that advice then it’s his prerogative to do what he wants. But I’m trying to protect the prime minister from political interference, perceived or otherwise,” she said.

Wernick -- who was not made aware during the recording that he was being taped -- can also be heard saying that he “respects” where Wilson-Raybould was coming from, but that Trudeau’s view was that “he’s not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He’s asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal, Wernick said.

“You’re not just being attorney general, you’re the minister of justice and a cabinet [minister] – and, you have context within which you exercise your roles and your responsibilities. Like, I’m not seeing anything inappropriate here,” Wernick can be heard saying.

Chair of the committee, Anthony Housefather, has said that ""no redactions have been made"" to Wilson-Raybould’s submission by the committee, though there are portions of the submission that appear to have been redacted by Wilson-Raybould before it was submitted.

Wilson-Raybould, who is still a member of the Liberal caucus, provided this evidence to further bolster the testimony she gave to the committee on Feb. 27, and to respond to contradicting stories that others have offered since her appearance.

RECORDING OF CALL WITH WERNICK

During her initial testimony on this phone call, Wilson-Raybould said she was alone and took the call from home. She said that Wernick wanted to communicate where Trudeau was at regarding the file, and spoke about the company potentially moving its headquarters.

She quoted him saying “I think he is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another....So he is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.”

When asked about this call during his follow up testimony, Wernick said that it was not his recollection of that call. “I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” Wernick said.

“I never raised partisan considerations at any time. I reminded her repeatedly that she was the final decision-maker. I did not attempt to influence her decision. I was giving her relevant context about public interest considerations for a decision that was hers to take. I never suggested consequences for her,” Wernick testified.

The audio call largely confirmed Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, but also backed up Wernick’s assertion that he did not make any direct partisan considerations, like Quebec votes, which Wilson-Raybould has alleged she was consistently reminded of while the file was on her desk. Though he did cite a “rising anxiety” following job losses in Oshawa and tough times in Calgary.

In the recording you can hear her taking a deep breath before the conversation begins.

“I actually feel really uncomfortable having this conversation because it’s wrong,” Wilson-Raybould says on the tape.

“Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? This is not just about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like, breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence,” Wilson-Raybould asks Wernick about Trudeau.

“Well I don’t think he sees it as that,” Wernick said, offering that it was a case of people talking past eachother.

“Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael,” she replied.

The conversation ended with Wilson-Raybould saying that she was “waiting for the other shoe to drop,” and that ""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just stuck doing the best job that I can.""

After she got off the call, the new evidence shows that she texted her then-chief of staff Jessica Prince that “the s**** is going to hit the fan.”

In her written submission Wilson-Raybould said she recorded the conversation because she “I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She said she had never done this before, and has not done so since, recognizing that her recording of this conversation would otherwise be inappropriate

Law societies in Canada prohibit lawyers from knowingly recording conversations with clients without their knowledge, including the Law Society of Ontario, which Wilson-Raybould belongs to. In a statement the Society told CTV News that it “does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

“I did this simply to ensure that my notes were accurate and given the ongoing pressure and attempts to interfere in this case, the nature of conversations that had occurred… and my strong suspicion that this matter would continue to escalate in even more inappropriate ways,” she wrote.

Her unprecedented decision to then make the recording public as part of her submission was done, she says, to allow Canadians to decide for themselves whether Wernick’s comments amount to the “veiled threats” that she alleges, and which he denies.

Wernick will soon be retiring from his job as Canada’s top public servant, a decision he says is because there ""is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties,"" after both the Conservatives and New Democrats have called for his resignation given his role in the still unfolding controversy.

COPIES OF TEXTS, EMAILS

In her initial hours-long committee appearance she offered an in-depth account of approximately 20 exchanges --10 phone calls and 10 meetings -- specifically on the SNC-Lavalin case. She also worked through a chronology of communications, ranging from in-person meetings and phone calls, to text messages and emails, from 11 senior staffers from the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and the finance minister's office.

Throughout her testimony, she cautioned there were limitations in her ability to speak broadly about the case because of the specifics of the waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had issued.

What she has handed over to the committee stays within the lines of what is permitted in the waiver, which includes any relevant information related to the case against SNC-Lavalin over her years-long tenure as attorney general.

Contained within the new documents are transcripts as well as screen shots of conversations she or Prince had. These include email exchanges with members of Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office who the documents describe as being involved in the “mucking around” on the case.

In one it details a phone call Prince had with Morneau’s deputy chief of staff Justin To, in which he allegedly said that Wilson-Raybould had “a philosophical problem” with the entire promise of a deferred prosecution agreement, which remains a yet-to-be-used tool that this government passed through an omnibus budget bill last year.

“She hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To is quoted as saying to Prince, who said that was incorrect.

It also includes the conversation between Wilson-Raybould and Prince about a meeting Prince was asked to have with Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford and then-principal adviser Gerald Butts.

In the instance of the meeting between Trudeau’s top two staffers and Prince, the text messages back up Wilson-Raybould’s telling of the interactions, and contradicts Butts saying during his March 6 committee appearance that “there was no urgency to attend that meeting.”

The meeting request was labeled “URGENT” the documents show.

Though the texts do not offer any evidence to dispute Butts’ saying that the recounting of the exchange with Prince was taken out of context and that he had a ""very different recollection of that meeting.""

MORE DETAILS ON RESIGNATION

Wilson-Raybould’s submission also shed new light on the series of events that led to her ultimately resigning from her role as veterans’ affairs minister, which she was shuffled into in January.

She had previously told the committee that she believed she was shuffled out of her job because of her refusal to change her mind about the case, but in the new statement Wilson-Raybould said she took Trudeau at his word when he insisted that wasn’t the case.

Though, at the time she says she made the decision to resign if her replacement decided to issue a directive to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin matter, “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular.”

A deferred prosecution agreement has not been pursued by current Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, though the government has made signals that they aren’t ruling it out.

She also confirmed that she was offered the Indigenous services job, as Butts had testified. She said she was shocked they’d offer it to her since she says she made it clear from the moment the Liberals started assembling a transition team, that she’d never be able to fill that role.

Wilson-Raybould also said that she had a series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver after the initial story broke, and in the days before she ended up resigning from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“The prime minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in Cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” Wilson-Raybould says in her statement.

OPPOSITION RESPONSE

In the opening remarks of the new documents, Wilson-Raybould says her view is that the real issues at the heart of the SNC-Lavalin scandal are not about “how things are ‘experienced’” or considerations like caucus dynamics, political ambitions, or poll numbers. Rather she says it is about prosecutorial independence, the rule of law, and Canada’s democratic institutions.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses” in Canadian institutions, and that she looks forward to a future where “we truly do politics differently,” seeming to lean on a phrase Trudeau regularly touted during the 2015 campaign.

The opposition wanted to invite Wilson-Raybould back to testify again -- something she was open to -- but Liberal MPs on the House Justice Committee shut down the study, saying that they’d heard all they needed to.

Wilson-Raybould also offered that while she has nothing further to add to the formal process, if she was asked or compelled to participate in a future investigation or parliamentary process, she would.

In a statement reacting to the new information, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called it “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.” He called the entire affair “corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the evidence was “so compelling and well-documented” that an independent public inquiry is needed.

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement… The former Attorney General repeatedly made clear to the Prime Minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference – and they ignored her,” Singh said in a statement.

Since her testimony, Trudeau has faced calls to resign, the House of Commons agenda has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, and several other high-profile officials have resigned amid insistence that nothing improper occurred.

The PMO’s statement claims that “all facts are on the table now,” and that the Liberal government is focused on “moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

All eyes are set to be on Parliament Hill when MPs return on Monday, particularly when Liberal MPs convene for their weekly caucus meeting on Wednesday. There, it is likely that the developments that have occurred on this file over the last few days will come up, as some of her colleagues are expected to get up and call for her removal.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

92,,2019-03-26T19:48:00.0000000Z,But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession ... mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups. Remember infrastructure?,"The 2019 federal budget, like all recent federal budgets, is a tribute to the pleasures of endless economic growth.

In the days when inflation was high, interest rates were volatile and growth was very stop and go, budgeting was hard work. Reining in runaway deficits absorbed most of the energies of finance ministers for the better part of three decades.

But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession in the last quarter-century, and a mild one at that. Budgeting in such times is comparative child’s play — governments, at the federal level at least, have to positively go out of their way to run deficits.

Indeed, so steady has the revenue-gusher been — no government has ever had as much money to play with, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars per citizen — that the Liberals have been obliged to perform quite heroic feats of spending just to keep pace. Though real per capita spending is at all-time record levels, the deficit remains stubbornly below one per cent of GDP — hardly a deficit at all, really. My God, in the fiscal year just ending, the deficit actually fell: revenues came in faster (6.8 per cent) than even the Liberals could spend them (4.9 per cent).

I’ve said before that these are deficits of choice, rather than necessity. A better way to describe them might be deficits for show. Not even the Liberals still pretend deficits of this size would have any impact on growth, nor have they: real growth per capita in the bad old Harper years, from fiscal 2007 to 2016, averaged 0.9 per cent — versus 0.7 per cent, actual and projected, in the shining new era ushered in by the Liberals (2017-2024).

Indeed, they’re not even supposed to. Their impact is, first, symbolic — behold, we run deficits because we like to, whereas the previous government did so only grudgingly! — and second, to permit the government to spend more, mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups.

Remember infrastructure? That was supposed to differentiate the new Liberal deficit spending from the old Liberal deficit spending. It wasn’t about pork-barrel politics, or short-run economic fixes. It was about making strategic investments that would increase productivity for the long run. Only it hasn’t quite worked out that way, has it?

The budget boasts that federal infrastructure spending has increased from $8 billion in fiscal 2016 to $14 billion in the current fiscal year. That’s an increase of $6 billion, which sounds like a lot, until you realize total program spending has increased by $47-billion in the same period. At one point the Liberals used to claim one dollar in three of new spending would go to infrastructure. The actual result: more like one in eight.

It is time, then, for the conversation to move on: from how spending is financed to what it is spent on, from the size of government to its composition, from the macro to the micro. Deficits of this size are not going to ruin us, as the opposition claims; neither would eliminating them, as the finance minister pretends.

The quantity of spending isn’t so much the issue as the quality. It isn’t that we can’t afford it: it’s that, in the rush to get all that spending out the door, little thought appears to have been given to whether the money is being spent in the best way, or whether it should be spent at all.

The most telling table in the budget is the last: the one that tallies up the estimated savings from the several “comprehensive reviews” of spending the government claims to have undertaken. The total annual saving: $237 million. Out of a budget of $323.5 billion.

Perhaps one day something a little more stringent will be attempted. And perhaps this budget’s signature initiatives on training and housing, which give every impression of having been cooked up in the Prime Minister’s Office, if not in party election planning sessions, will be the subject.

The training chapter notes, with evident satisfaction, that the government now spends close to $7.5 billion a year on skill development “across more than 100 distinct programs.” Given the country’s acute and growing skills shortages, some questions might be asked about their efficacy. Some, but not too many: a review of skills programming provided “an opportunity to reflect on past successes and determine where more can be done.”

Such a forgiving attitude to the past does not bode well for the future. Has any serious analysis been done of the new Canada Training Benefit — how it will interact with provincial programs, what sort of training will be eligible, and so on?

Likewise for the government’s suite of new policies to make housing more affordable. The budget acknowledges the only real solution to high house prices in the long run is to increase the supply of houses. But the specific measures it announces would mostly stimulate the demand — notably a First-Time Home Buyer Incentive that would involve the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, worryingly, in lending directly to prospective buyers. The details are sketchier than sketchy, but any benefit would more than likely be capitalized into prices. Would anyone really be made better off?

But why ask hard questions, when growth is endless and budgets need never be balanced? Except … even if the business cycle has been abolished, and growth does persist, it will be much slower growth than we have known, now that the Baby Boomers are hitting their retirement years. That may not be of much concern to the feds, who largely insulated themselves, in the deficit-slashing years, from the fiscal consequences. But it’s a huge problem for the provinces, who will have to pay to look after all those aging Boomers.

What would the budget do to stimulate growth in the long run — to improve Canada’s sluggish productivity record, to arrest the alarming decline in business investment, to reform Canada’s complex, growth-killing corporate and personal income tax system?

Er, nothing, as it happens. For as it has been said, in the long run we are all out of office.","Andrew Coyne: Federal budget a testament to the pleasures of endless growth.

Notley stops at science museum

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley announced Monday that a re-elected NDP government would extend the party’s flagship $25-a-day child care plan, subsidizing all child care spaces in the province.

It would amount to a $1.5-billion investment over five years, building on a commitment the NDP first rolled out in 2015.

Currently there are 122 centres in Alberta, including 7,300 spaces, that cap fees at $25 a day per child. Notley has touted the child care policy as a way to help women return to work.

“Alberta has the largest gender-gap in labour force participation in the country,” she said at a Calgary news conference.

The NDP plan would apply to a total of 75,000 spaces, including 13,000 new ones, and save parents an average of $300 per month.

Clare Clancy wrote a backgrounder ahead of the announcement to help frame the issue.

Alberta Election latest

Kenney on education

A United Conservative Party government would bring back Grade 3 provincial achievement tests and introduce new standardized math tests in Grades 1, 2 and 3, party leader Jason Kenney announced at a Calgary school on Monday morning.

As school trustees gathered in Edmonton and Calgary to advocate for Alberta’s next government to fund enrolment growth in schools and address shortfalls in transportation and school repair funding, Kenney said the UCP would “maintain or increase” education funding. Kenney said he would expect boards to decrease administrative overhead and direct more funding to classrooms.

The UCP will continue to build new schools to address demand, he said.

Kenney also said the UCP would proclaim the Education Act by Sept. 1, 2019, replacing the School Act. It would erase the additional protections the NDP government introduced for LGBTQ students and staff with Bill 24 in 2017.

The party would pause the current K-12 curriculum rewrite, he said, and broaden consultation to include more perspectives. The curriculum should be written in plain language and include more history and geography of Alberta and Canada, he said.

“It’s time to put away failed teaching fads” and embrace tried and true education methods, Kenney said.

Today we announced our bold, ambitious, detailed and positive plan to ensure that Alberta has the strongest education systems in the world. #ableg #abvote #abstrongandfree — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) March 25, 2019

The party would repeal a 2013 ministerial order from the previous Progressive Conservative government that refers to schools focusing on competencies rather than content, and using inquiry-based learning methods for students to apply knowledge.

If elected, the UCP would order an immediate audit of the $3 billion spent during the last 15 years that was supposed to help keep class size averages near guidelines set by the Alberta Commission on Learning in 2003. Class sizes in many parts of the province have grown steadily since 2010.

Kenney also said a UCP government would work with universities to ensure teachers are experts in the subjects they are teaching.

The UCP would also introduce a “Choice in Education Act,” which would lift the cap on the number of charter schools in Alberta. The Progressive Conservative government established a cap of 15 charters in provincial regulation in the 1990s. There are currently 13 charter schools operating in Alberta.

Charter schools would be able to own property, Kenney said, and would have a higher priority in making use of surplus school sites.

The UCP would also review the education funding formula, which rural school boards say is penalizing them when enrolment declines.

Jason Kenney just listed the planks of the UCP's education platform in Calgary. Highlight: UCP would replace the School Act with the unproclaimed Education Act. #ableg #abed

Fildebrandt on education

The Freedom Conservative Party also released its education platform Monday afternoon.

Speaking outside a church in Chestermere, party leader Derek Fildebrandt pledged to provide equal funding for all schools — public, private or home school — with cash following the students, and pass a Parents Bill of Rights to give moms and dads final say in their child’s education.

Fildebrandt also vowed to cancel the NDP’s new curriculum rollout “lock, stock and barrel.”

“We’re not going to cancel the curriculum and replace it with an FCP curriculum. We are going to cancel the Alberta curriculum, period, and allow school boards to decide for themselves what curriculum they will follow so long as they meet reasonable … targets for learning,” he said.

Fildebrandt took a swipe at universities and colleges, too, saying they have “become a hotbed of radicalism that has more of a focus on indoctrination than on learning and free thought.”

He said any post-secondary institution that doesn’t protect freedom of speech, assembly and thought would have their provincial funding revoked under an FCP government, and student union fees would be voluntary.

94,LifeStyle,2019-03-28T01:04:00.0000000Z,"MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal ... WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods ...","WELLS: On that note, I want to welcome to The Message Graeme MacKay, the Hamilton Spectator's award winning editorial cartoonist. In fact it occurred to me as I was preparing for the episode that the sign Beware of Cartoonist is funny and also has deeper meetings or layers to it, just as your work always does, because in fact you occupy a physical space in the newsroom off on your own — separate from the reporters. And you also play a singular role at The Spectator which is to offer an opinion, a point of view on everything from politics to Hamilton's quirks and the vast canvas of human nature and to do so editorial cartoons. That's me giving my spin how you might see your job. How do you see what you do?

MACKAY: Yeah, I occupy a very isolated corner of the newsroom way at the other end and by the exit door to the newsroom too so there's a symbolic thing there. I guess I'm lucky enough to have a position that I have because it's sort of like a visual columnist. But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: Sure.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

Illustration of the Hamilton Spectator’s editorial cartoonist holding his book “You Might Be From Hamilton If...” | Graeme MacKay , The Hamilton Spectator

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand

OTTAWA – The Conservatives are asking the federal judicial affairs commissioner to investigate the leak of confidential information about former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould’s controversial choice for chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Conservative justice critic Lisa Raitt has sent a letter to Marc Giroux arguing that the leak “strongly suggests” that “political actors” leaked information about an appointment to the country’s highest court.

If so, Raitt says, it would be “an egregious case of political interference … that severely injures the independence of the judiciary.”

Raitt’s letter comes two days after The Canadian Press and CTV reported that Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clashed over whom to appoint to the top court upon the retirement of Beverley McLachlin as chief justice in 2017.

Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the normally confidential process, said Wilson-Raybould urged Trudeau to name Glenn Joyal, chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench, to fill both McLachlin’s spot on the bench as a justice from western Canada but also the chief justice role.

They said Trudeau was disturbed to discover that Joyal took a restrictive view of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and had criticized the top court for liberally interpreting it to include “new rights” not explicitly mentioned in the charter; the court’s broad interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage and the striking down of Canada’s abortion law and prohibition on medically assisted dying.

Trudeau ultimately appointed Alberta judge Sheilah Martin to fill the western slot on the Supreme Court and elevated sitting Justice Robert Wagner to the role of chief justice.

Wilson-Raybould said Monday there was “no conflict” with Trudeau on the matter but otherwise declined to comment, saying the selection process for Supreme Court justices is confidential and any disclosure “could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.”

However, on Wednesday, citing an anonymous source, the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould recommended Joyal as part of a broader plan to appoint an Indigenous judge to the role of chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench – which would have been a first for a superior court in Canada. The newspaper also said Wilson-Raybould believed Joyal held a more liberal view on the charter of rights than Wagner, although the report cited evidence to the contrary.

The Canadian Bar Association and the Manitoba Bar Association have also criticized the disclosure of information about the appointment process.

The leaks suggest Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair to move Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio in a mid-January cabinet shuffle. She was moved to Veterans Affairs but resigned from cabinet a month later amid allegations that she had been improperly pressured last fall by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould has since said she believes the move was punishment for her refusal to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. Such an agreement would have forced the company to pay stiff restitution but saved it from the risk of a criminal conviction, which could threaten the viability of the company.

Raitt said Wednesday that the leaks about the Supreme Court appointment process are more proof of Trudeau’s disrespect for the rule of law.

“The SNC-Lavalin affair has raised serious questions about the rule of law in Canada and the degree to which the Prime Minister’s Office has interfered in it,” she said.

“This most recent episode of potential political interference from the PMO only further damages our democratic institutions and values and requires immediate attention.”

John Crawford

LNG Canada says proposed changes to the province's tax structure for liquefied natural gas, announced this week by the BC Government, are a very important step forward in the development of the industry in this province.

Although the company's investors had already given the project final approval, an LNG Canada spokesperson says the announcement shows the NDP is prepared to deliver on its commitments.



Finance Minister Carole James announced on Monday the government's new Income Tax Amendment Act, which she said will ensure the LNG export industry has an even playing field with other resource sectors in the province, and can be globally competitive.

""We're creating jobs, we're creating environmental protection and we're bringing in a fair share of resources to British Columbia,"" she said.

LNG Canada External Affairs Director Susannah Pierce agreed, saying the changes help ensure BC can find a new market for its natural gas resources, and realize the opportunities the LNG sector creates for the province's workers, communities and First Nations.

""It is removing the LNG Income Tax Act, which is something that was unique only to the LNG industry in the province, and so really it's the final chapter of the BC Government's commitment to ensure that there is a sustainable and competitive industry in the province,"" she said.





[PHOTO: Susannah Pierce, LNG Canada -- at October 2018 FID announcement]

Environmental groups aren't happy with the new bill -- nor is the BC Green Party, with leader Andrew Weaver complaining that the NDP basically sold out to the industry.

""They've basically given LNG Canada whatever they want, frankly I'm surprised they haven't given them promises of their second and third children as well!"" he said.

But while the Green Party will vote against the bill, it's likely to pass with the backing of the BC Liberals.

""Our desire is to be supportive, but we still have a job to do, in terms of ensuring that the government fully discloses the benefits and the costs associated with the agreement,"" said Liberal MLA Mike De Jong.

In the meantime, work is proceeding on the project at Kitimat -- and Pierce says local businesses are already seeing the benefits.

""We've begun additional site-clearing and that's to make sure the site is ready for materials when they come on-site to start more of the construction element of this; we've done preliminary dredging, to enable some of the ships to safely enter the area, and also to ensure Rio Tinto has an extension to its wharf, so that when they go off of the former Eurocan wharf, they can go onto a new extension of their wharf closer to shore,"" she explained.

More than 600 workers have already been busy on site, and Pierce says that number is steadily increasing, with a focus on hiring local as much as possible.",LNG Canada Applauds BC Tax Changes,CFTK TV,http://www.cftktv.com/News/LNG-Canada-Applauds-BC-Tax-Changes
97,Business,2019-03-26T04:16:00.0000000Z,The former Liberal government in Ontario agreed nearly two years ago ... going at the Dryden plant is to be heard later this month by the Supreme Court of Canada. The issues to be resolved by the court in Resolute FP Canada Inc. et al v.,"More than a half century after a river system in northwestern Ontario was contaminated by mercury poisoning from a pulp and paper plant, there are still health problems for members of two First Nations communities who live in the region.

The impact on the Grassy Narrows First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations has been referred to as one of the country’s worst environmental disasters.

It also continues to be an environmental and health concern in 2019. The former Liberal government in Ontario agreed nearly two years ago to establish a trust fund for remediation actions in the English and Wabigoon Rivers. The new Conservative government of Doug Ford promised last fall to increase disability payments for local residents with health difficulties related to the environmental problems.

As well, a dispute over the meaning of an agreement signed in 1985 between the province and two companies to end litigation stemming from the mercury poisoning and also to keep pulp and paper operations going at the Dryden plant is to be heard later this month by the Supreme Court of Canada.

The issues to be resolved by the court in Resolute FP Canada Inc. et al v. Ontario could have implications in commercial contracts far beyond that of the scope of the 1985 indemnity. It is also another reminder about the importance of precision in contract drafting. “You have to be cautious to avoid boiler plate language,” says Natalie Mullins, a partner at Gowling WLG in Toronto. “You have to address every issue very specifically,” adds Mullins, whose practice focuses on environmental-based litigation.

A central aspect of the upcoming case before the Supreme Court is whether the indemnity clause agreed to by Ontario in the 1985 agreement applied only to third-party claims against two companies or to so-called “direct” claims stemming from the costs of subsequent environmental orders by the province. Also, if an indemnity is in effect for a corporate property owner, the Supreme Court is being asked to clarify what happens to this protection if there is a transfer of control and a provincial government invokes its environmental powers against any entity that was ever attached to the land.

Adding to the somewhat complicated factual history in this dispute is that judges at every level in the litigation have disagreed on the application of the contractual interpretation template set out by the Supreme Court less than five years ago in Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.

In some ways, the issues in the case invoke basic principles of contract law. “It goes back to the debate over contractual interpretation — textual or contextual,” notes Paul Davis, a lawyer at Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein LLP in Toronto. “Our Supreme Court has been moving away from a textual interpretation,” says Davis, who is the co-author of a paper in the Canadian Business Law Journal about the issues raised in Resolute as a result of the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal.

The indemnity in 1985 was part of an agreement between the Ontario government and Reed Ltd. and Great Lakes Forest Products Limited. A predecessor company of Reed was responsible in the 1960s for the release of untreated mercury waste into the local river systems. Great Lakes agreed to purchase the Dryden plant in 1979 after the province, which did not want the pulp and paper operations to close, agreed to limit the potential liability from litigation. The deal also required Great Lakes to spend a significant amount of money to upgrade and modernize the plant.

A settlement with the First Nations bands impacted by the pollution was not reached until 1985. As part of a broad agreement with all parties, including First Nations, the federal government and the two companies, the province agreed to an indemnity provision for both Reed and Great Lakes.

The main clause of this provision stated that Ontario would indemnify the companies from “any obligation” as a result of “any claim, action or proceeding, whether statutory or otherwise” that existed in 1979 when the transaction for the pulp and paper operations went through. The scope of the indemnity extended to claims by individuals, companies, the federal government and “any province” as a result of environmental damage caused previously.

Ownership of the pulp and paper operations and control over the waste disposal site had transferred hands a number of times when, in 2011, the Ontario government issued environmental orders to deal with soil erosion and ongoing water testing.

Weyerhaeuser and predecessor companies to Resolute FP Canada Inc. were named in the order and required to compensate the province more than $270,000 to cover the cost of the remediation. The companies were also informed that they were not relieved from being responsible for any future orders related to site, which, in 2011, had an estimated lifespan of another 35 years.

Weyerhaeuser was named in the order as a result of it owning the property for two years, from 1998 to 2000. Through a number of corporate consolidations over the years, Resolute could be linked back to Great Lakes, one of the two companies that signed the agreement with Ontario in 1985.

The companies named in the order were not responsible for the mercury poisoning, but the powers of the province are quite broad under the Environmental Protection Act, explains Mullins. “To address contamination, the ministry can reach back in time. You just have to have some association with the land and you continue to be exposed even after you sell it,” she says.

Weyerhaeuser initiated an action against the province in 2013 and Resolute was added as a party to the litigation. Superior Court Justice Glenn Hainey ruled that the indemnity was not restricted to third-party claims, as Ontario argued.

“The province wanted to protect Dryden’s economy and encouraged Great Lakes to continue the pulp and paper operation in Dryden and to invest a great deal of money in upgrading the operation. It was well known that the disposal site posed a serious environmental liability,” the judge wrote. “Under the circumstances, it would be commercially absurd to conclude that the parties contemplated that the province could at any time withdraw its commitment to protect Great Lakes and its successors from environmental liability arising from the disposal site,” he added.

The province appealed that decision and, in a 2-1 ruling, the Court of Appeal upheld the finding that the indemnity applied to direct claims. However, the majority also ruled that the predecessor company to Resolute had assigned its benefit to Weyerhaeuser in1998. It also concluded that the motions judge should determine if Weyerhaeuser transferred its benefit when it sold the Dryden mill and other assets in 2007 to another company.

On the first issue of whether the 1985 indemnity was restricted to third-party claims, all three judges referred to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sattva and the instruction to consider the “factual matrix” when deciding the intent of the parties in a contract.

Justice David Brown, with Justice Peter Lauwers concurring, also highlighted this section of the Supreme Court ruling. “While the surrounding circumstances will be considered in interpreting the terms of a contract, they must never be allowed to overwhelm the words of that agreement,” noted Brown.

“I see no legal error in the motion judge’s statement that the interpretation of a contract should start with the language of the contract. That is the logical place to start, especially since the jurisprudence requires the interpreter of a contract to determine the parties’ intention in accordance with the language they use,” wrote Brown.

The majority found that Hainey did not commit a “palpable and overriding error” in his interpretation of the contract and that, depending on the language used, an indemnity can cover direct claims.

Justice John Laskin issued a dissenting judgment and suggested that Hainey’s analysis was in error.

“The motion judge’s starting point for interpreting the 1985 indemnity was to look at the words of the document in isolation, and then only secondarily at the ‘surrounding circumstances.’ His two-stage approach to the interpretation of the 1985 indemnity is not the proper approach. Context controls meaning,” wrote Laskin, who ruled in favour of Ontario on whether the indemnity applied to direct claims.

Ontario and the two companies all sought leave to appeal different aspects of the Ontario Court of Appeal decision. Leave was granted last fall.

Douglas Sarro, a lawyer and co-author with Davis of the paper on the case and its legal issues, says he believes Laskin’s judgment is more in line with the way the Supreme Court has suggested to go about interpreting these kinds of agreements. “I think the Supreme Court is going to have to remind the courts below about the approach it set out in Sattva,” says Sarro, senior advisor, research and regulatory innovation at the Ontario Securities Commission (his comments are not on behalf of the OSC).

“Given the structure of this indemnity, it makes more sense to me as one that covered third-party claims,” Sarro says, in part because of other aspects of the agreement that was signed in 1985 by the provincial and federal governments, the companies and First Nations.

There is not a lot of Canadian case law on the scope of indemnities in circumstances such as the Weyerhaeuser/Resolute case. In their law paper, the lawyers also argue that the majority did not follow the approach of other jurisdictions, both in the United States and some Commonwealth countries, in determining whether the indemnity covered third-party claims. Broad language on its own is not enough to expand the scope of an indemnity without considering the context, they write.

Not surprisingly, the Ontario government is in agreement with the analysis conducted by Laskin in his dissent on whether the indemnity applied to direct claims. “Further, the Court of Appeal ought to have corrected the motion judge’s conclusion that the 1985 indemnity was a business agreement. The settlement was not commercial in nature. It reflected a policy objective to address concerns arising from the mercury contamination,” state Ontario lawyers Leonard Marsello, Tamara Barclay and Nansy Ghobrial in written submissions filed with the Supreme Court.

Agreements with government are different than contracts solely between private-sector entities, they argue, because of the public interest requirements. “Absent express language, courts should not imply an obligation to compensate for breach of contract resulting from future legislation,” they write.

Resolute, in its written submissions, suggests the issues before the court are not actually complex. “In 1979 and again in 1985, the province of Ontario gave indemnities to Great Lakes Forest Products Limited. It gave those indemnities to persuade Great Lakes to buy and invest $200 million in a pulp and paper mill, to settle environmental litigation with First Nations bands and to save the economy of Dryden, a single industry town. . . . [B]ut in 2011, when environmental liabilities arose from the buried mercury, Ontario sought to renege from its bargain,” write Andrew Bernstein, Jeremy Opolsky and Jonathan Silver at Torys LLP.

In his dissent, Laskin did not address whether the companies involved in the litigation still enjoyed the benefit of the indemnity, because he found it only ever applied to third-party claims.

The finding by the majority that the benefit had extinguished over time through the various commercial transactions is criticized by both companies in their written submissions before the Supreme Court, on the basis of failing to apply the standard principles of contractual interpretation. “Those principles required the court to consider the wording of the enurement provision in the context of the indemnity as a whole, the factual matrix, and the principle that commercially unreasonable results should be avoided,” write Weyerhaeuser’s lawyers Christopher Bredt, Markus Kremer and Alannah Fotheringham at Borden Ladner Gervais LLP.

The finding by the majority in the Court of Appeal ruling that more evidence is required to determine if Weyerhaeuser “lost” the benefit of the indemnity in the 2007 sale of the Dryden plant leads to a “commercially absurd result,” they argue. “It would be very difficult for an indemnitee to sell a contaminated property if a purchaser knows that it will be exposed to liability upon becoming the property’s owner. By the same token, few owners would be willing to sell a contaminated property if they know that, by doing so, they will lose the benefit of the indemnity,” they state.

If you are indemnified only while you hold title to the property and theindemnity, but once you sell and assign it you are opened up to an order “doesn’t seem to be a reasonable commercial outcome,” says Mullins. “The ministry would be potentially getting a windfall.” When draftingindemnityagreements, it is important to make clear what you are protected from and who is protected, Mullins adds.

Depending on how the Supreme Court rules in this case, it may be necessary for legal departments to revisit past agreements to determine the scope of an indemnity, says Michael Barbero, a lawyer at McLennan Ross LLP in Calgary, whose practice focuses on environmental law and regulatory compliance.

“Identify whether the agreement has a robust definition of claim, such that you can ascertain whether direct claims, third-party claims or both are captured by the agreement. Then identify whether the commercial context is relevant and worth arguing,” says Barbero.

Davis agrees that reviewing past indemnity agreements may be worthwhile. “You may have to go back and look and see what other sections of the contract say,” he adds. In future agreements, “if the intention is to limit it to third-party claims, use that express language,” Davis says.",Risky business: what is the scope of your indemnity?,Canadian Lawyer Magazine,https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/author/shannon-kari/risky-business-what-is-the-scope-of-your-indemnity-17014/

Internationally, Canada-China ... Both Liberal MPs from Calgary now sit as ...","Despite ongoing technical conversations, finding a resolution to China’s decision to end all Canadian canola seed imports has been deemed not possible, at least in the short-term.

Canola Council of Canada president Jim Everson said the industry had no choice but to try and find alternative markets.

Those statements confirmed the industry’s worst fears after Chinese officials pulled Richardson International’s export licence because of still unproven concerns about “hazardous organisms.”

Canadian farmers are now caught in the middle of escalating trade and diplomatic tension between Ottawa and China, which buys about 40 percent of the canola Canada exports.

The fear now is whether the situation escalates.

With spring seeding fast-approaching, the fear about what the dispute with China could mean for farmers’ bottom lines grows by the day.

The trade war with China is yet another fire Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s embattled Liberals must fight at a time when the party has spent much of 2019 on the defensive.

Internationally, Canada-China diplomatic relations are severely strained. China remains livid about the fact Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer for Chinese telecom giant Huawei, in December following an extradition requested from the United States.

Chinese officials have since detained two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessperson Michael Spavor, who the Chinese have accused of espionage.

The diplomatic dispute has also cost Canada its ambassador to China, who was fired by the prime minister after he suggested to reporters Wanzhou had a strong legal case.

Closer to home, the Trudeau government has spent more than a month combatting allegations the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured the former attorney general in relation to a file involving SNC Lavalin.

ADVERTISEMENT

It’s a political crisis that has seen two cabinet ministers, a senior adviser to the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council (this country’s top bureaucrat) resign.

The possibility of a drawn-out dispute with China over canola exports is unlikely to do the Liberals any favours in Western Canada, where the economy is already a hot-button issue thanks to troubles in the energy sector.

In Alberta alone, it’s estimated 3,000 jobs are directly tied to canola, with 70 percent of the province’s exports to China canola-related.

Then, there are the political concerns.

Those who follow Canadian politics know that the East-West political divide in this country is as much reality as the urban-rural spread. With a federal election just around the corner, fears over western alienation are re-emerging.

From the start, the Trudeau government only had a handful of western voices in its caucus outside of British Columbia.

Both Liberal MPs from Calgary now sit as independents. Edmonton MP Amarjeet Sohi, who serves as Trudeau’s natural resources minister, has his hands full with the economic and market access struggles of Canada’s oil and gas sector.

ADVERTISEMENT

Meanwhile, fellow Edmontonian Randy Boissonault sits on the House of Commons justice committee that until recently was handling the SNC Lavalin affair.

International Trade Minister Jim Carr is a key figure for the Liberals who has been tasked with finding a solution to the canola dispute. The importance of the file is not lost on him. The Richardson’s family has deep ties to Winnipeg, where Carr is from.

Carr has said there is no scientific basis for China’s concerns about pests in Canadian canola.

Carr is scheduled to testify in front of the House international trade committee on the canola-China dispute on April 2 alongside Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau.",Farmers caught in the middle of trade dispute with China,The Western Producer,https://www.producer.com/2019/03/farmers-caught-in-the-middle-of-trade-dispute-with-china/

But Liberal members on the committee say they’re not convinced.,"An all-party committee of the legislature delivered recommendations Tuesday on how best to handle ride-hailing in B.C. and is recommending the government allow drivers with Class 5 licences to get behind the wheel.

The committee was asked to deal with specific issues after the government changed laws in 2018 to pave the way for app-based ride-hailing services. Other key recommendations delivered to the legislature include eliminating boundaries for where passengers can be picked up, no limits on fleet size and establishing minimum pricing.

The transportation minister said she’s willing to be flexible on those issues, but not on who gets behind the wheel.

“I will not move on Class 4 licences,” Claire Trevena told reporters in Victoria. “I think people's safety is paramount and Class 4 adds to that safety.”

Asked several times for evidence that shows safety is increased, Trevena stated the commercial licences mean additional safety.

But Liberal members on the committee say they’re not convinced.

“Parents send their children in cars with other parents on field trips and they don't worry that that driver doesn't have a Class 4 license,” said Stephanie Cadieux, who insisted Class 4 licences would be prohibitive for Uber.

The report referred to Alberta and Nova Scotia having Class 4 licences.

They tend to be more intensive to get and cost more. Critics say that will lead to fewer drivers.

In a statement, Uber said Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario allow the more common Class 5 licences. The company wants B.C. to consider the same.

Uber Canada’s Michael van Hemmen wasn’t ready to say what a Class 4 requirement would mean for the company.

“Uber has to see the full regulations before we can comment about whether we can apply or launch,” he told CTV.

Regulations and insurance options are being developed. After that, companies will be able to apply to get ride-hailing vehicles on the road.

The opposition claimed with so much work left to do, a 2019 timeline is unrealistic, and suggested the spring of 2020 is more likely.

Asked about the timeline, Premier John Horgan said, “forgive me if I ignore their fear mongering today,"" adding that “I'm absolutely confident ride hailing will be here in 2019.”",B.C. premier 'confident' ride-hailing will be in place by end of 2019,BC CTV News,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/b-c-premier-confident-ride-hailing-will-be-in-place-by-end-of-2019-1.4353184

Irrespective of what he deems Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s ethical problems we cannot and should not overlook the obvious shortcomings that are obvious in our prime minister. If there is nothing untoward regarding the interactions between the then attorney general and various proxy agents of Mr. Trudeau; then let’s have a full hearing at the justice committee with no restrictions on the testimony. We know this won’t happen because the prime minister would be exposed as favouring a certain province above all else. Including changing the law for a single company based in Quebec.

The Student Voices on Sexual Violence Survey was sent to over 746,000 full-time students in Ontario from February to March 2018 by the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development, now the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (TCU).

The ministry had come under fire for the delay in releasing results, following reporting by The Varsity and the Queen’s Journal, Queen’s University’s student newspaper.

TCU Minister Merrilee Fullerton acknowledged that the released results were not comprehensive because the government needed to “protect the privacy of the survey participants.” She said that the ministry will be consulting Ontario’s Information & Privacy Commissioner Brian Beamish “on the release of additional survey results.”

In response to the released results, Fullerton announced that the provincial government plans to double investment in the Women’s Campus Safety Grant this year to $6 million. The annual grant funds campus initiatives including public education, drafting policy to prevent sexual violence, and improving security systems at universities.

The government will also require all publicly-assisted colleges and universities to review their sexual violence policies by September, create task forces to address sexual violence on campus, and draft an annual reports to their board of governors about measures taken in response to sexual violence on campus.

Survey results

A 37-page report summarizes the survey, which was administered by CCI Research Inc. and includes responses from 117,148 full-time university students of 441,499 invited, among other categories.

The report warns against interpretations of smaller data sets and comparing data between institutions; due to the voluntary nature of the report, each institution had a differing number of respondents.

Of 104,238 responses to five questions about knowledge of sexual violence supports at U of T, 61.7 per cent reported that they did not understand how to access supports related to sexual violence and did not understand the wider process for reporting incidents of sexual violence.

Out of 3,514 responses to eight questions, 42.4 per cent reported dissatisfaction with the U of T’s institutional response to sexual violence, which includes believing survivors of sexual violence and creating an environment where sexual violence is recognized as a problem.

In U of T students’ perception of consent, 89.6 per cent of 146,068 responses to seven questions demonstrated an understanding of consent as: revocable at any time, not measured by physical resistance, and required even when affected by decision-altering substances, among others — the remaining responses either took a neutral stance or disagreed with the above definitions.

U of T also had a high proportion of students who reported witnessing sexual violence including physical or verbal abuse, helping someone who was intoxicated, or informing university officials.

68.7 per cent of respondents reported being witnesses, with 67.3 per cent of those saying that they intervened in situations when incidents of sexual violence were witnessed.

4,628 respondents from U of T reported experiences of stalking and 12,293 reported instances of sexual harassment, including discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation and online and physical harassment.

3,602 out of 20,942 U of T students reported non-consensual sexual experiences, part of the 26,824 students from the broader university sector who reported instances of non-consensual sexual experiences.

New Democratic Party criticizes funding as insufficient

In response to a question asked during a press conference on the topic about whether the survey’s results warrant “greater action” than her announcements today, Fullerton said that the government’s plans are an “immediate response to an issue that has only just been reported back to [them],” but did not give further specifics about future plans.

Suze Morrison, a New Democratic Party MPP and the official opposition critic for women’s issues, lambasted the funding increase to the Women’s Campus Safety Grant as insufficient. She said that if the Ontario government was “serious about addressing the underlying systemic issues of… gender-based and sexual violence,” it would deliver on “promised funding to rape crisis centres across Ontario.”

The previous Liberal government had promised $14.8 million over three years to these centres as part of its gender-based violence strategy, but the current Progressive Conservative government has suspended plans for this funding.

Council of Ontario Universities welcomes data, U of T hopes to expand outreach

Sandy Welsh, leader of the Council of Ontario Universities’ Reference Group on Sexual Violence and Vice-Provost Students at U of T, was asked by The Varsity if her group would conduct follow-up or recurring surveys on sexual violence. Welsh deferred to the ministry, saying, “I cannot speak for what the ministry may do. I think it’s an important survey. We’re glad to have these results and look forward to any discussions in the future about other ways to survey.”

U of T Sexual Violence Prevention & Support Centre Director Angela Treglia spoke to The Varsity on the low proportion of students who felt that they understood the process for reporting instances of sexual violence.

“We have work to do to build and develop the awareness of the services that are available to people who’ve been affected by sexual violence on our campuses,” Treglia said. “We know and we want to get it right.”

The centre is a recent tri-campus development, having opened in 2017 with Treglia’s appointment as director. According the Treglia, the centre has held 200 workshops, reaching 8,000 participants at U of T, and continues to develop a system for supporting students so that “they have a place that they can go for confidential support and know that they’re not alone.”

On whether the initiatives announced by the ministry would be helpful to the centre, Treglia declined to comment. Treglia later went on to say that “we are striving and committed to creating a culture of care and a culture of consent on our campus.”

102,World,2019-03-28T08:49:00.0000000Z,"Later, after the Liberal party took power, Town says he came to the realization ... “I didn’t really agree with what we were being asked to accept,” he says, “that Canada, and the West generally, is more or less the pinnacle of progress in society ...","When the blindfold is removed, Muhammad Ali has a look in his eyes that is not so much panic or fear; it is one of emptiness—someone who has lost all sense of purpose.

It’s a stark contrast to the young man who burst onto the jihadist social media scene in 2014. Back then, ISIS was at the height of its power, when it controlled vast swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq, and was still growing. Ali, now 28, had left his home in Mississauga, Ont., in April that year to join the group in Syria, and sounded then like a man on a mission, one that involved beheading inﬁdels, executing homosexuals and enslaving women.

Not long after arriving, he tweeted about “playing soccer” with the head of James Foley, the U.S. journalist who was executed by ISIS on Aug. 19, 2014. In a November tweet, Ali, referring to the terrorist attacks at Parliament Hill and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., in October that year, called on ISIS loyalists to “strike them, just as they strike your brothers and sisters.”

Now, as he is led to a chair, Ali’s gait is tentative and uncertain. He scratches his arm and upper thigh obsessively, a skin condition he tells me, though he never suffered from anything like it growing up. Before sitting, he pauses and looks around at the Kurdish intelligence ofﬁcers in the room, as if waiting for instructions.

After eight months in a prison in northern Syria, Ali looks otherwise healthy, apparently well-fed with the beginnings of a new beard replacing the one he shaved off before attempting to escape the last vestige of the ISIS caliphate in June last year. He becomes agitated when one of the intelligence ofﬁcers sets up a video camera for the interview.

“I don’t want that,” Ali says, his voice strained. “They’re gonna use it for propaganda. They’re always forcing me to do these interviews.”

It’s not a good start to an interview I’d been trying to set up for more than a week. In fact, Ali was not even the Canadian ISIS prisoner I was hoping to meet. That was Mohammed Khalifa, the Toronto native who has admitted that he was the voice behind some of the Islamic State’s most gruesome execution videos.

I explain to Ali he is under no obligation to talk to me. To calm his nerves, I tell him I have news about his wife, who is also Canadian, and two young daughters, who are being held in a camp for the families of ISIS ﬁghters.

“Are they okay?” he asks, his dejection taking a sharp turn.

“The last I heard they are ﬁne,” I tell him. “Your wife is in touch with her father. He’s working on getting them returned to Canada. Do you want to do this interview?”

Ali nods and settles into his chair.

The prison in northern Syria where ISIS ﬁghters like Ali are kept is an imposing concrete panopticon surrounded by blast walls and razor wire on the southern outskirts of al-Hasakah. The prison has changed hands a few times over the course of the Syrian war. For a brief period in 2015, it came under the control of ISIS, which reportedly released all of its prisoners. It then fell to the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, the Kurdish militia in northern Iraq that, backed by the U.S., has led the ﬁght against ISIS.

On the day I meet Ali, in a side ofﬁce inside the prison compound, the prison shows little signs of the violence it has seen. The enemy, the one that once vowed to turn northern Syria into a medieval theocracy, is no longer threatening its gates; it is, instead, locked inside.

As many as 800 ISIS foreign ﬁghters, including Ali and Khalifa, now reside in al-Hasakah’s central prison, most captured by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, during the last stages of the assault on the dwindling caliphate’s territory. Over the past few months, under the cover of U.S. air strikes, artillery barrages and rocket ﬁre, the SDF closed in on the last remaining ISIS strongholds, battling through the Euphrates River Valley on its march to the Iraqi border, one ISIS-controlled village falling after the next.

On March 4, according to Mustafa Bali, an SDF spokesman, as many as 3,000 people, mostly civilians, fled from ISIS’s last stronghold in Baghouz al Fawqani, a tiny patchwork of rundown farmhouses, farm fields and tunnels on the east bank of the Euphrates, less than five kilometers from Iraq.

The last time I was down near Baghouz, on Feb. 11, ISIS ﬁghters were surrounded and desperate, lashing out in a counterattack that seemed to serve little purpose. U.S. jets, artillery and rocket launchers were raining ordnance down on their positions. Hundreds of civilians, almost entirely women and children, were on the move, stuffed into the backs of open-top trucks transporting them to SDF camps.

The counterattack failed. It may have been tactical, or it may have been exploratory, a probing mission to look for weaknesses in SDF lines. Or it may just as well have been the violent spasm of a dying beast.

When I first meet Kyle Town, it’s purely by chance in a restaurant in Derik, a small town in the Kurdish-controlled countryside of northern Syria near the Iraqi border.

The 30-year-old Thunder Bay, Ont., native walks in for lunch with a group of six foreign ﬁghters, mostly Americans, who have enlisted with the YPG, considered by most experts to be the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, known by its Kurdish acronym, PKK, which has fought a bloody insurgency in Turkey’s southeast for decades and is listed as a terrorist organization in Canada, the U.S. and Europe.

Despite its dubious origins, the YPG is a key ally of the U.S. in the ﬁght against ISIS and the founding militia of the SDF, dominating its command structure and ﬁelding its most potent ﬁghting force, armed and trained by American special forces.

Derik, a sleepy administrative town, is the home base for the International Freedom Battalion, the YPG’s foreign ﬁghter contingent. Hundreds—from Europe, the U.S. and Canada—have joined the group; some, like John Gallagher from Windsor, Ont., have died ﬁghting for them. Town arrived in northern Syria in August last year, geared up not simply to destroy ISIS but to participate in what he considers the noble cause of the YPG’s revolution.

We meet later at the Freedom Battalion’s headquarters, in the rolling green hills surrounding Derik. It is a cross between a military outpost and a trekking base camp, and offers a commanding view of the Kurdish countryside, not just in Syria but Iraq and Turkey as well.

Town shows me around the base, pointing out the aluminum portable building with “mosque” scrawled on its side that the YPG took from ISIS and now uses as a common room for its ﬁghters, decorated with pictures of famous leftist revolutionaries like Che Guevara and Margherita Cagol, the leader of the Italian Red Brigades. He walks me over to a ﬁrepit set on a hilltop overlooking a valley.

“If you look to the north you can see the Cudi mountains, which are a part of northern Kurdistan within the borders of the Turkish nation state,” Town says. “If you look to the east you can see some of the mountains that are in Iraq, so southern Kurdistan. It’s kind of a constant reminder that Kurds are living in these four split-up parts—when you include Iran. These borders, which were drawn up in some kind of meeting room far away from here, have divided people and denied them a lot of their rights.”

The symbolism is central to the YPG’s revolutionary cause. For both ISIS and the YPG, the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, doling out different parts of the Ottoman Empire to Britain and France, was the original sin that created superﬁcial nation states and subjected the people of the Middle East to the rule of dictators. That sin, both groups claim, can only be erased by dismantling those nation states altogether.

For ISIS, of course, they would be replaced by the caliphate; for the YPG, by a quasi-anarchist system of self-governing communities, each in control of its own destiny.

The clash of these two ideologies is the backdrop to the war that has played out in northern Syria between ISIS and the YPG, with the latter now declaring victory.

When I meet the foreign ﬁghters at the Freedom Battalion camp, they know the war is nearing its conclusion. They are relaxed and talkative. All have been to the front to ﬁght; Town most recently at the beginning of January. What he found there was an enemy in retreat, without the will to ﬁght and lashing out in desperation. “For the most part there was little resistance,” he says. “On Jan. 7, ISIS attacked our position during the evening. They had cover from dust that was being kicked up by the air strikes and carried on the wind. They swept across the front and wrapped around the right side of our position. The ﬁreﬁght lasted for about three hours and then when night came, they retreated again.”

At the time—in early January—SDF forces had already overrun Ash Sha’fah, the same village where, seven months earlier, Ali had decided to abandon ISIS and make a dash for the Turkish border with his wife and children. He was captured by the YPG there.

In his telling, the journey to Ash Sha’fah began in 2008, when he was 18 years old and a ﬁrst-year student in the aerospace engineering program at Ryerson University in Toronto. Those ﬁrst months at university were a difﬁcult transition for Ali. He found university life disorienting and his choice of career path uninspiring.

“I don’t know what it was, man, whether it was depression or just the stress,” he says. “But I just couldn’t handle it, to the point where I even stopped going to classes. Eventually my marks dropped and they kicked me out.”

Growing up, Ali attended John Cabot Catholic Secondary School, where he had few friends and spent almost no time socializing. His life was routine: go to school, come home, watch television. There was nothing that really interested him, no set of beliefs that his parents, Pakistani Muslim immigrants who arrived in Canada in 1999 and were busy trying to build a new life, instilled in him.

So when he did ﬁnd something, he took to it with unusual fervour. In 2010, Ali says he turned to religion, though his family was never particularly religious. His exploration began online where he says he began reading classical Islamic texts. But without anyone to guide him, his understanding took a more militant turn after the onset of the Arab Spring in 2011. As the uprisings intensiﬁed, Ali became progressively more dismayed and distressed. The Syrian regime’s violent attacks on peaceful protesters left an especially deep impression.

Ali’s anger grew. He fell into bouts of depression and anxiety, sometimes breaking down into tears over what he saw as the crimes being carried out against Muslims around the world. His family became dismayed. At one point, he says, his father took him to a local imam to try to help him.

Ali’s family has declined media interviews but, according to a friend who spoke to Maclean’s on condition of anonymity, what they didn’t know at the time was that, online, Ali had befriended Andre Poulin, the Canadian Muslim convert from Timmins, Ont., who had left to join Syrian rebels in late 2012. Poulin had joined the Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar, a group of foreign ﬁghters based around Aleppo led by Chechens; he was encouraging the increasingly frustrated Ali to come join him in the ﬁght.

Poulin’s death in August 2013 was the ﬁnal push Ali says he needed. For months he had thought about going; his friend’s “sacriﬁce” was what ﬁnally gave him the courage to follow through. For years after being kicked out of university, he had wandered through life aimlessly and eventually ended up in northern Alberta taking on odd jobs in its oil ﬁelds. After Poulin’s death, Ali went home to Mississauga, bought a plane ticket to Turkey, telling his family he was going on vacation, and in April 2014, left.

While Ali was en route to Turkey, and then being smuggled into Syria, Kyle Town was back in Thunder Bay employed as a sheet metal worker but with dreams of being part of a revolutionary movement that would upend the injustices he felt had become institutionalized around the world.

Town had grown up in an environment of activism and social justice. His parents had opposed the provincial government of Mike Harris and its slashing of social programs in the late 1990s. When Town was three, his father, a police ofﬁcer, was shot in the line of duty and paralyzed. “We got a lot of support from the community,” he says. “We managed to have nurses to take care of him 24 hours a day. We were really fortunate in this way, something that a lot of families don’t have.”

Harris’s cuts would have directly affected this kind of support. In response, the Town family took to joining protest marches against Harris’s plans and Town, then 10 years old, himself began to appreciate the power of “popular resistance to the government.”

Later, after the Liberal party took power, Town says he came to the realization that all political parties were the same, that it was the structures of capitalist-led democracy itself that was the problem. As a teen, politically active and searching for an ideology, he toyed with Marxist-Leninist-style socialism but came to the conclusion that its reliance on centralized state structures would only lead to more tyranny, as it had in the Soviet Union and China. He then turned to anarchism.

In 2007, Town left Thunder Bay for university in Ottawa to study political science—but found that what he was being taught was its own kind of propaganda. “I didn’t really agree with what we were being asked to accept,” he says, “that Canada, and the West generally, is more or less the pinnacle of progress in society in terms of democracy.” He dropped out and joined like-minded people in the anarchist community.

Syria ﬁrst caught his eye during the early days of the ISIS expansion, especially when news began to emerge of its genocide against Yazidis in the summer of 2014. The PKK’s defense of the Yazidis struck him as not only heroic but also the product of the kind of ideologically driven tenacity that was needed to bring about the revolution he felt the world needed.

When he was ﬁnally ready to go, in the summer last year, he says he didn’t keep his intentions secret. He told everyone, including family, friends and work colleagues. “My family was supportive,” he says. “I’ve always been open with them about my thoughts on different issues. We’ve always talked about things like this.” In August, he boarded a flight to Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq, and then made his way to the Syrian border.

Neither Town nor Ali had any military training but both ﬁrmly believed in their causes. Town’s story is relatively easy to conﬁrm and, being on the side that fought the universally hated ISIS, he has no reason to lie. Ali’s story is more complicated. Fearful and in the hands of the YPG, he now claims his only goal in coming to Syria was to protect Syrians and that he only ever fought the Syrian regime, never the YPG.

It’s impossible to conﬁrm details of his time in Syria (Maclean’s was able to conﬁrm the details of his life in Canada through media reports and interviews with people who knew him). But Ali has been consistent with his story, and the timeline of what he did while he was an ISIS member does align with how the group’s territory expanded and then collapsed.

Ali claims he arrived in Aleppo in early April 2014 with the help of a Swedish radical from ISIS whom he met online. “I didn’t really know much about the groups,” he says. “I just ended up meeting this guy from ISIS. At that time, pretty much everyone was going to ISIS, all of the foreigners and also the Syrians.”

After a month at a compound in Aleppo with about another 200 foreign recruits, Ali says he was moved to Jarablus, on the Turkish border, and then to a camp outside Raqqah, the city that would later become the capital of the ISIS caliphate. He learned how to use small arms; he learned how to pray properly and recite the right lines from Islamic tradition for a variety of situations, whether going into battle or before eating a meal.

After three weeks of training, ISIS administrators asked him what sorts of skills he possessed. Ali says he told them about his work in Alberta’s oil ﬁelds, so he was sent to the oil ﬁelds south of Raqqah. But there, nothing was working so he ended up sitting around until he was approached by an Australian ﬁghter who invited him to come to his training camp in al-Tabqah, a small town just east of Raqqah.

Over three months there, Ali received advanced sniper and reconnaissance training. It was there also that he met his future wife.

Little is known about Rida Jabbar, an Afghan-Canadian from Vancouver, and her motivations for joining ISIS. But according to other wives of ISIS ﬁghters, foreign women who joined the caliphate were held prisoner in homes until they found a husband. In Ali’s case, he was told while at the training camp in al-Taqbah that there was a Canadian woman available for marriage in the village. The two met once briefly and, sometime in September 2014, were married.

Ali insists this was not a forced marriage or any kind of enslavement. He claims he had heard rumours at that time about what was happening to Yazidi women but didn’t really think much of it. “There was always people trying to justify it,” he says. “And me, while not understanding Arabic or being well versed in Islam or things like that, I mean it’s very hard sometimes to separate the truth from ﬁction and to know what’s right and to know what’s wrong. I mean, at the same time you’re sitting in a war zone and you’re getting pressured from all sides. It’s not an easy life, man.”

Ali was also using social media at that time to promote ISIS atrocities like the sexual enslavement of Yazidi women. He was, by his own admission, on board with its mission. In those early days, while the caliphate was rapidly expanding, Ali says it did feel like their cause was divinely ordained. The morale was high, he says, and he was happy.

Things began to change sometime in early 2016, after the birth of his ﬁrst daughter. By then it had become clear to Ali that ISIS was not simply ﬁghting for the Syrian people. Its split from other rebel groups ﬁghting the regime had led to inﬁghting that Ali believed undermined the cause. And he now felt the propaganda campaign calling for attacks on Western targets had been a mistake, even though he himself had participated in it.

“I started seeing that I’d been manipulated, that this group was more so a maﬁa than anything else,” he says. “They were really not concerned about the Syrian people or foreigners like me. They were mostly concerned about protecting themselves and surviving.”

The breaking point came in October 2017, when SDF forces began their assault on Raqqah. Ali says he had been stationed at a training camp for foreign ﬁghters in the countryside east of Hama where he trained others in sniping and reconnaissance. But by the summer of 2017, the regime was closing in. He was forced to retreat to the east to al-Mayadin, on the Euphrates River.

As regime forces advanced, the ISIS lines collapsed. By mid-October, Ali and his fellow ISIS militants were forced further south. By then, Raqqah had fallen to the SDF. After that crushing blow, the will to ﬁght evaporated, Ali says. “A lot of people at that time were fed up already. They wanted to go back. Some people were willing to hang around a bit longer. And for some people, going back was not an option.”

By January 2018, the ISIS caliphate was little more than a patch of land no bigger than Moosonee straddling the Euphrates River. Ali had been sent back to the front near Ash Sha’fah, tasked with targeting regime forces for ISIS snipers and doing some of his own sniping. On the morning of Jan. 23, he says he crossed the river to visit his wife and children and drop into an ISIS ofﬁce for some work.

“By the afternoon, I heard that pretty much the entire west side had fallen in that hour or two-hour period that I’d been gone,” he says. “[The regime] pretty much just walked in and stormed the place. When I heard that news, I pretty much left work, just stayed home with my family, saw a few people. I left ISIS; I stopped working for them.”

Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue who interviewed Ali in October last year, says ISIS foreign ﬁghters have often had a change of heart, especially once there are children in the picture. “I think his argument that he was disillusioned is probably accurate,” he says. “Whether he was able to leave right away is probably the more difﬁcult question. But he did have a wife and kids at that point.”

He also believes that foreigners in the caliphate were likely used as pawns, particularly women and children who were moved in tandem with the shifting front lines and kept as human shields. “I was stunned by the number of Western women coming out of the last holdouts,” he says.

Ali also claims that the ISIS leadership abandoned foreign ﬁghters, which Amarasingam says is also probably true. For the Iraqis and Syrians at the higher echelons of the organization, melting into the local population would be straightforward, as well as strategic. Most experts agree that ISIS is planning an insurgency in both Syria and Iraq. In fact, it has already begun. But for foreigners like Ali, who looked different and spoke little Arabic, there was no choice but to stay and ﬁght.

The more difﬁcult question to answer is whether Ali has abandoned his ideological fervour. He insists he was never fully inured to the ISIS brand of Islam. But when the situation was good, when ISIS controlled large swaths of territory and Ali was contentedly working away in the oil ﬁelds or training snipers, he was, by his own admission, happy to play the role of radical Salaﬁ jihadist and believed he was engaging in a holy war against the West.

The Canadian government has been evasive on the issue of what to do with people like Ali—as many as 32 Canadians are held in al-Hasakah’s prison and a refugee camp in northern Syria. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has admitted that bringing them home and prosecuting them will be difﬁcult considering the challenge of gathering evidence of their activities in a dangerous war zone. The U.S., meanwhile, has said if countries like Canada do not repatriate their nationals, the SDF will have no choice but to release them, increasing the likelihood they will return to the battleﬁeld.

Ali insists he poses no danger to Canada and wants to come home, that his experiences on the battleﬁelds of Syria have taught him the value of life in his home country. “Canada is very open and everyone is very accepting of each other,” he says. His revolution, he claims, is over.

For Kyle Town, the ideological question is more clear: being on the winning side has only deepened his belief in the YPG’s cause. ISIS was only one part of a much bigger battle, he says, and he was late on that scene anyway. During his brief time on the front lines, he was witness to the end of the caliphate. Now there is a more dangerous enemy on the horizon, he says.

Turkey, which considers the YPG as much a terrorist organization as the PKK, is threatening to launch its own offensive on YPG-held areas in northern Syria. For the Turks, the YPG’s political vision, its rejection of all state structures, is an existential threat.

During the last ceaseﬁre between Turkey and the PKK, PKK militants were criticized by international organizations for setting up their own political structures in areas they controlled in the southeast, in essence overthrowing the local government. In Syria, the YPG has done ostensibly the same thing. Its utopian political experiment means the Syrian regime will either have to give up political control over a vast swath of its territory or try to take it back by force.

Town says he is ready to ﬁght, whether it is against Turkey or Syria. His revolution is only beginning.

Premier François Legault said it’s necessary to protect “our identity.” And a poll conducted just before the bill was presented suggests he was right when he claimed the support of the “vast majority” of the people.

So, if fear of “outsiders” doesn’t explain the anti-hijab bill, what does?

“The Quiet Revolution” is the usual answer, referring to the modernization of Quebec starting in the 1960s.

Supposedly, that’s when French-speaking Quebecers turned against a Roman Catholic Church that had oppressed them for centuries, and against religion in general.

This argument has been made by, among others, Gérard Bouchard, co-chair of the province’s 2007-08 commission on religious accommodations, in a recent article in La Presse.

Or, the explanation is “Quebec liberalism,” from a study arguing that liberal social values in this province are different from those in the rest of Canada.

The study notes that in the RoC, social liberals are likely to oppose restrictions on the wearing of minority religious symbols, while in Quebec, they’re likely to support them. But it doesn’t address the question of whether this Quebec liberalism also applies to symbols of the majority, and if not, why not.

This brings us back to the Quiet Revolution.

Usually, revolutionaries are quick to take down or change the symbols of their oppressors, such as their flag, or their monuments.

Or their place names. In Quebec, there has been a tendency to replace English names with French ones approved by a government commission created in 1977 by the language law, Bill 101.

So, the predominantly English-speaking town founded as Montreal West no longer officially exists by that name. Now it’s Montréal-Ouest.

Someone who doesn’t know this province but who reads Bouchard’s history of relations between Quebecers and the Church might expect Catholic symbols here to have received similar treatment.

To explain why Quebecers are “generally less open” than other Canadians to “expressions of religion,” Bouchard described how the Catholic high clergy had oppressed them.

It had betrayed them by collaborating with the British conquerors of New France in return for power. Over the next two centuries, it had used that power to keep the French-Canadians in ignorance, suppress their freedom, and resist their social progress, in particular reducing women to bearers of children.

And yet, despite all this, there has been no movement to, say, remove statues of the Virgin Mary from in front of “non-denominational” public schools, or change the schools’ religious names.

Or to remove the 10,000 “Saints,” 2,329 “Saintes,” and 648 “Notre-Dames” still in the place-names commission’s name bank.

Religious names are still so “abundant” in Quebec, says the commission, that to reduce “confusion,” it prefers “secular” new ones.

But the CAQ bill stipulates that the legislation couldn’t be used to have the courts change the names, or other symbols of Quebec’s “religious cultural heritage.”

One of those symbols is the National Assembly crucifix. After the bill was presented, the Assembly unanimously voted to have it removed.

But that was only after it was shamed into it by Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante’s announcement of the removal of the crucifix from the city council chamber.

And before the government presented the crucifix motion, it ensured it had the opposition’s support, so that no party would gain a partisan advantage by opposing it.

It wasn’t responding to public pressure. On the contrary, polls suggest that, while most Quebecers don’t want to see government employees wearing religious symbols, especially minority ones, they do want to keep the crucifix in the Assembly.

This must make them the only liberated people in history who want to preserve the symbols of their former oppressors.

What they want is the selective secularism that’s been called “Catho-laicity”: secularism for others, but not for themselves.

So, neither the Quiet Revolution nor Quebec liberalism is a convincing explanation for the CAQ bill.

Then what else can it be?

104,,2019-03-28T19:14:00.0000000Z,The Liberal government earmarked $1.4-billion over seven years for loan forgiveness across Canada in the 2019 federal budget ... Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”,"Northern Indigenous leaders are welcoming the federal budget decision to erase debt incurred from land claims and treaty negotiations with the Canadian government.

They say that instead of repaying the federal government, that money can now be reinvested in programs, wellness, governance and youth.

Chiefs from the Dehcho, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in, Sahtu, Tlicho and South Slave regions were in Detah on Tuesday to meet with Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett.

The Liberal government earmarked $1.4-billion over seven years for loan forgiveness across Canada in the 2019 federal budget.

Yellowknives Dene First Nation Chief Ernest Betsina said the decision is welcomed.

“This forgiveness grant will be provided to our future generations … and provide more opportunities that can support First Nations,” he said.

Betsina said past federal cutbacks under previous governments affected core funding, negotiations, language planning and housing.

Loan system to negotiate land claims not ‘successful’

In 2018, the federal government adopted a grant system to capture the “actual costs of self-government,” Bennett said.

The 2019 budget also sets aside $40 million over five years for First Nations to research and develop claims.

“Getting to self-government shouldn’t be based on loans anymore. People spending 20 years and then $30-million in debt to not quite get there, has just not been successful,” she said.

Negotiation on a loan basis was a hard-sell for communities, she said.

“If people don’t feel that things are fair then it’s pretty hard for them to get their communities behind them to do the work,” Bennett said.

‘Long ways to go’

Tlicho Grand Chief George Mackenzie told Bennett self-government will improve the future for young Indigenous people.

“Us in the Aboriginal world have a long ways to go yet, but we will not get there if we don’t have the federal support that we are seeking,” he said.

As the federal election approaches, Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”

“Our young people today, everywhere, are crying for help … we lack resources … we lack the funding,” he said.

Other negotiations proceeding

Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina announced that Akaitcho First Nations could have an agreement in principle this year. They have been negotiating since 1992.

Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian reminded Bennett that the Dehcho First Nations have been in talks with Canada for nearly 20 years, and negotiations are stalled over surface and subsurface resource rights.

The Dehcho First Nations want to temporarily set aside land and resources and work on issues like education and self-government, Norwegian said.

“We are trying to decide how that looks like for us. It is a struggle and we really would like to move forward, but make sure that it is on our terms, that we are moving toward self-determination,” Norwegian said.

Meanwhile, K’atl’odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel says the community is leaning toward self-government, but has concerns about keeping reserve status under the Indian Act.

“That’s really powerful to our people because we don’t want to lose that. I want you to recognize that,” she said to Bennett.

But there are rules and one of the more important rules here (and most everywhere in the country) is that you confine your politics to your own jurisdiction.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe crossed that line this week in a tweet directed at Alberta voters urging them to unite behind one conservative party to defeat NDP Premier Rachel Notley.

“Dear Albertans, Prior to the formation of @SaskParty 20 years ago, our province was the example of what dividing the free enterprise movement will do: electing NDP governments, over and over again. United we win, divided we lose,” Moe tweeted.

Moe is supposed to be the premier for everyone in Saskatchewan. And he is addressing Albertans?

Essentially, Moe is engaging in the online equivalent of physically knocking on doors for Jason Kenney and Alberta’s United Conservative Party.

Why would he or others around him not get that there may be a problem here?

Sure, Moe has the right to his personal views and stating them in public likely surprises no one. Sure, it’s common to hear barbs thrown across the floor of the Assembly after the election in another province.

But there’s a reason why you have never seen other Saskatchewan premiers like Brad Wall or Lorne Calvert or Roy Romanow or Grant Devine campaigning for another province while in office. Unlike Moe, they were cognizant of their duties, responsibilities and who elected them.

You weren’t elected by anyone in Alberta. You don’t represent “the free enterprise movement.” Nowhere in your job description does it state that it’s your role to prevent “electing NDP governments.” Your job is not to hurry Rachel Notley along to her political demise, which seems an inevitability, anyway.

Good heavens. Can anyone imagine what Scott Moe would be saying if Rachel Notley started campaigning for Ryan Meili? Golden rule here.

Consider how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was rightly crucified for doing the same thing by stumping for then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne. So Moe is now following Trudeau’s lead? How’d that work out for either Wynne or Trudeau?

Mostly, though, you don’t do it because it’s bad for business.

It’s bad when you go to Conference of Confederation meetings and you have to stand shoulder to shoulder with Alberta’s premier — regardless of who that is — to fight for critical regional issues like pipelines. What would happen if Saskatchewan did have an NDP premier and Jason Kenney decided he couldn’t work with the NDP on pipelines? Would Saskatchewan be right to be miffed?

It’s bad the next time Saskatchewan has to go to a western premiers’ conference to talk about the New West Partnership or to talk about stocking Saskatchewan beer in Alberta or even barring Alberta licence plates at Saskatchewan work sites. (Sadly, the latter seems to have been a largely mythical issue that likely did arise over the Sask. Party government’s need to pick a fight with Alberta over something.)

It’s really bad because it represents a mindset of partisanship taking precedent over what’s good for the province. If Moe needs any reminding how problematic this is, he may want to recognize he’s complaining we don’t have a good equalization formula after Wall and his government abandoned pursuit of the equalization formula everyone in this province really wanted so as not to embarrass former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper for what amounted to an unworkable national promise.

But worst of all, it can only heighten the nastiness because voters see it as one more thing that was once unacceptable now becoming acceptable.

We witnessed elected Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities delegates screaming “traitor” at 40-year-elected MP Ralph Goodale. We heard at SARM mindless rants about separation and shipping the socialists to Venezuela.

Is Moe or anyone else thinking about whether this helps political discourse in Saskatchewan? Wouldn’t we be better off to tone down the animosity and rhetoric?

The Ford government folded her office into the attorney general in last fall's budget update. Marieke Walsh / iPolitics

TORONTO—As her office is shuttered by the provincial government, Ontario’s environment commissioner is again warning voters about the Tories’ “frightening” and “inadequate” climate and environment policies.

In tabling her final report to the legislature on Wednesday, Commissioner Dianne Saxe told reporters “Ontario was doing many things right and is basically stopping doing those things.”

[READ MORE: McKenna chides Ford government for carbon tax double speak]

From the axing of the provincial carbon price last year to the cancellation of electricity conservation programs announced last week, Saxe said Premier Doug Ford’s government is “cutting off our nose to spite our face.”

For example, her final report on energy conservation finds that abandoning electricity conservation post-2020 will add about two megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2030.

She said that will offset much of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions the government plans to find in the natural gas sector. That work is supposed to reduce emissions by 3.2 megatonnes by 2030.

Ultimately Saxe finds that by pushing up fossil fuel use, the government will increase energy bills, air pollution, health impacts and greenhouse gas emissions.

“At a time when climate damage is accelerating, Ontario is turning away from the things that we know work,” Saxe said.

Adding that Ontario’s policies are “very inadequate” and “very frightening.”

The province eliminated the energy conservation programs connected to the electricity grid last week as it tries to pair down electricity bills and meet its election promise to lower electricity rates by another 12 per cent.

However, Environment Minister Rod Phillips told reporters that the changes in conservation programs were done to focus conservation where there are emissions, and because Ontario’s electrical grid relies on green energy like hydro and nuclear it’s not worth focusing on those areas.

“Our focus is on working where there’s going to be the biggest impact,” Phillips said.

Last fall the Ford government lowered Ontario’s emissions targets to bring them in line with those set by the Trudeau Liberals.

[READ MORE: Ford government weakens Ontario’s emissions targets]

Ontario plans to reduce emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. That target is far less aggressive than the previous Liberal plan to reduce Ontario’s emissions by 37 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030.

Phillips told reporters the plan he unveiled last fall, after axing cap-and-trade will meet the new emission goals.

“We have a very clear plan that will get us to that 30 per cent target,” Phillips said. “We will hit the targets that the federal government set.”

Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner disagreed with the minister’s optimism, saying that experts find the new climate change policy wanting.

“Every expert that you talk to, whether economist or climate scientist, has said that the environment plan that was released last fall by this government, will not meet Ontario’s greenhouse gas reduction commitments,” Schreiner said.

Saxe said that the introduction next week of the federal carbon tax could offset some of the changes Ontario is making. But she cautioned that with a fall election the carbon tax doesn’t have a certain future.

Because Canada is among the world’s top 10 emitters, she said what happens here could jeopardize the international agreement on climate change.

“What we’re doing in Ontario, and what we may do in Canada this year, puts the entire Paris Agreement at risk. And if the world can’t hold together on the Paris Agreement, we are toasted, roasted and grilled.”

107,,2019-03-26T08:00:00.0000000Z,"Radio-Canada reported Tuesday the government wants ... designed to woo the support of the opposition Parti Québécois, the only party currently supporting the government’s plan.","QUEBEC — Premier François Legault is defending his government’s decision to override fundamental rights in secularism legislation by saying Quebec needs to protect its identity and clearly separate the state from religion.

Confirming the bill to be tabled Thursday will invoke the notwithstanding clause contained in both the Canadian and Quebec charter of rights, Legault said it won’t be the first time a Quebec or Canadian premier makes use of the option.

“Yes, it’s not a small thing,” Legault told reporters. “It’s a big decision but sometimes in order to protect collective rights we have to use it. It has been used at least 40 times by different premiers, including Robert Bourassa.

“It’s never an easy decision. I think we have to protect our identity.”

Asked if minorities don’t deserve the same kind of protection, Legault said state secularism has to be visible and not just be something on paper.

“I think it is important to separate religion and politics in Quebec,” he said. “For many years now there has been a distinction between the government and religion. It has to be shown, especially for people representing the government and being in an authority position.”

The move means that, like previous regimes, the Coalition Avenir Québec government is stepping deeper into the turbulent world of identity politics at its own peril and in the belief that this is what Quebecers want.

“I think we have the support of the vast majority of Quebecers,” Legault said.

He said he anticipates some groups will not be happy about the government’s use of the clause as a way to protect its decision to ban certain authority figures, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols such as the hijab, kippah, crucifix and turban from court challenges.

He said he recognizes the clause has a five-year shelf life but speculated that by then people may be satisfied with the government’s decision and renewing it will not spark discord.

At the same time, down the hall, the minister responsible for the legislation, Simon Jolin-Barrette, delicately issued an appeal for calm in the divisive debate.

“As a person I am always ready to listen to people,” Jolin-Barrette told reporters. “This said, I don’t want things to heat up. We have a collective responsibility to remain calm.”

Neither Legault or Jolin-Barrette would confirm media reports the government has decided to expand the original list of public servants to be covered by the ban.

Radio-Canada reported Tuesday the government wants to include school principals plus any public sector employee carrying a weapon — for example, people ensuring security in courthouses, and wildlife officers.

They would be added to the list of persons already targeted in the bill, including judges, police officers, Crown prosecutors and elementary and high school teachers.

The government will also unearth a little-known recommendation of the 2008 Bouchard-Taylor report and ban the speaker and deputy-speakers of the National Assembly from wearing symbols.

As for the fate of the crucifix hanging over the speaker’s chair of the legislature, the government has decided not to include it in the bill.

Last week, Legault opened the door to possibly moving the crucifix to a less conspicuous location, after the City of Montreal announced it would remove the crucifix from its council chambers.

Sources say the issue has sparked a heated debate inside the CAQ caucus, which was to discuss the matter again at its weekly caucus meeting here Tuesday evening.

What does seem certain is the government plans to include a so-called grandfather clause in the bill that would recognize acquired rights of employees. That means existing public servants who wear religious symbols would not be in danger of losing their job if they refuse to remove them.

The government says there are about 500 people in the public sector in positions of authority who wear such symbols.

At the CAQ’s pre-session caucus in Gatineau in January, Legault said he would be the one to make the final call on acquired rights because the CAQ caucus of MNAs is split on the idea.

The CAQ’s decision to include an acquired-rights clause appears to be political, designed to woo the support of the opposition Parti Québécois, the only party currently supporting the government’s plan. PQ support would be good optics for a government in a hurry to settle the issue and move on.

On Tuesday, interim PQ leader Pascal Bérubé repeated on Twitter he, too, would like to see the issue wrapped up.

.@PascalBerube: «Il n'y a rien qui va nous faire dévier de la nécessaire volonté de régler cette question ce printemps et de collaborer avec le gouvernement, sans l'assurer de notre vote final, mais on veut vraiment une bonne collaboration là-dessus.» #PQ https://t.co/psdavByOxO — Mathieu Lavigne (@MathieuQC) March 26, 2019

The Liberals, however, predicted a long season of court battles for the CAQ.

“Everything they do is going to court or has gone to court and they lose,” Liberal critic Gaétan Barrette told reporters.

Applying the grandfather clause is no simple matter because it implies having to count who in the public sector already wears religious symbols. That issue got the government in trouble in January when it was revealed senior bureaucrats had started to poll the heads of the education, judiciary and police services to try to come up with a number.

On Tuesday, the Fédération autonome de l’enseignement (FAE) — one of the province’s largest teachers’ federations — announced it is taking the Legault government to court to block any future head count.

“We will defend our members’ right to work tooth and nail,” FAE president Sylvain Mallette told reporters.

Mallette noted the union has never received a grievance over a teacher wearing a religious symbol in the classroom and no study exists linking the wearing of such symbols with students feeling intimidated into assuming the teacher’s beliefs.

“Why are they trying to fix a problem that does not exist in the public schools?” Mallette said. “Would we accept in Quebec that we do a head count based on their sexual orientation? Would we accept that teachers be identified based on their political leanings?

“No. We would not accept this. So why would we accept it that people be identified on the basis of their beliefs when it has absolutely nothing to do with their work?”

However, Legault, Jolin-Barrette and Education Minister Jean-François Roberge told reporters the government has no plans for a head count as the union is alleging.

His party announced on Friday that if elected, they would usher in an Alberta Constitution, a legal framework that would provide more rights to residents, even beyond those in Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

“[It] would include rights to reasonable firearm ownership. Free speech as our most supreme right that can’t be overridden by other Charter issues. Rights to self-defence and defence of property and property rights itself,” he said in an interview with CTV News. “These are very important rights that have been excluded from the federal Charter and provinces have the right to their own Constitutions, so we’re calling for the creation of an Alberta Constitution.”

He says the RCMP has misclassified a number of different firearms on the market, notably the semi-automatic AR-15.

“The AR-15 looks like a scary weapon but it’s essentially if you took a Ford Taurus and put fire stripes on it, it would look like a more badass car than it really is. There are rifles like that are just misclassified because they look scary.”

Fildebrandt says his government would also do more to make sure that people who work in the backcountry on a regular basis would have the protection they need against dangerous predators, provided they are properly trained, screened and have their credentials kept up to date.

“We are not proposing the Wild West here, but we are talking … if you’re a mountain climber; some of my family members are mountain climbers [and] they’ve come across grizzly bears and cougars. We’re talking about a very reasonable expanding of protective measures for people.”

The expanded laws the FCP is proposing also includes more property rights, something that Fildebrandt says would have dealt with the situation faced by an Okotoks farmer a lot faster than it had been.

“It shouldn’t take political pressure to stop this kind of wrongful prosecution, so we propose, in an Alberta Constitution, to add property rights, self-defence and to instruct our Crown prosecutors to stop wasting their time and their resources on victims and go after the people who are actually attacking their property.”

Devon Martin, a competitive shooter who lives in Calgary, says he started out by hunting with his father and has experience with shooting a number of different firearms.

“I own multiple semi-automatic sporting rifles, some bolt action hunting rifles as well as some semi-automatic handguns and I’ve had revolvers too.”

He says many people he knows are touchy about any change in legislation, particular those that could turn a law-abiding gun owner into a criminal overnight.

“A lot of guys have had issues with 10-22 magazines. It’s a .22 long rifle magazine that had a capacity of 25 rounds. But it fit into something else, so they kiboshed that and made it prohibited to have anything over 10. That made a lot of people overnight, criminals.”

Jason Kenney, speaking in Calgary on Thursday, said Albertans who live in rural communities are particularly vulnerable and something more needs to be done to protect them.

“We do not encourage vigilantism, we strongly discourage that. But we do think the unique vulnerability of people in very remote areas should be at least one thing the Crown counsel takes into account.”

He adds that the ability of police to protect someone in an incident should also be considered.

Fildebrandt, who admits to owning as many guns as he likes, says everyone he knows is responsible with their firearms.

“I’m a handgun owner, many Albertans are handgun owners. The vast majority of us store and keep our handguns very safely; we comply with the law.”

The election is scheduled to take place on April 16.

China, Canada and Canola

China has banned shipments of canola from major Canadian companies, and some experts say it's a political move.

After Chinese authorities banned two major Canadian companies from shipping canola seed to China, producers say they're hoping for a quick resolution to the dispute — but are prepared to look to other markets.

Earlier this month, Chinese customs authorities revoked the licence of Winnipeg-based agricultural handler Richardson International, and then pulled a similar move on Regina-based Viterra Inc. on Tuesday.

China alleges Canadian canola has harmful pests in it, but the ban is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive with Chinese telecom giant Huawei, at the behest of the United States.

""It's certainly not about the quality of Canadian canola, in my mind,"" Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada, told Chris Hall, host of CBC Radio's The House, in an interview airing Saturday.

Last week, the Canola Council of Canada announced orders from China had mysteriously dried up for a number of canola sellers other than Richardson and Viterra.

On Friday, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said the government is considering subsidizing farmers hit by China's ban on Canadian canola imports.

But Everson — who met with with the two ministers on Friday — said he is hoping China's market reopens soon.

As China shuts down more canola imports from Canada claiming they're contaminated, we talk to the president of the Canola Council of Canada about what this means for the industry and what farmers want the government to do. 6:49

""We've talked to [the ministers] quite a bit about the issues in terms of re-engaging and engaging China and restoring that market, and that's the first priority,"" Everson said, adding he hopes the government sends a delegation to China to address the issue.

Everson said producers are ready to look elsewhere to sell their canola, but added that it might be a difficult task, given that roughly 40 per cent of Canadian canola seed exports normally go to China.

""It is very difficult to very quickly diversify away from such an important market to other market opportunities,"" he said.

Six months from an election

Only six months remain before the federal election and the question remains how the SNCLavalin scandal, trade tensions with China and the newly introduced federal budget will affect the results. The strategist panel — Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party, Hamish Marshall, chair of the Conservative campaign and Michael Belagus, campaign co-chair for the NDP — weighed in on each party's strategy this election year.

Cowan acknowledged the damage the SNCLavalin scandal has done to the Liberal Party and the prime minister, but said its members remain focused.

""Obviously it's been a tough news cycle and it's been going on for quite some time,"" said Cowan. ""This will likely continue to percolate for some time, but really where my team and I've been focused is ... on supporting the team, nominating candidates, supporting the prime minister and getting ready for what was always going to be a challenging campaign.""

Belagus and Marshall both said they think the SNCLavalin scandal will benefit the NDP and the Conservatives politically.

""There is a real sense of disappointment with the prime minister, a lot of people who came to us and said, 'Hey, look, I voted Conservative when you guys won a majority in 2011, but I was tired of Harper and I wanted a change,"" said Marshall.

""Trudeau seemed like change and, wow, was that a mistake. And we get that again and again and it's not just in, you know, seats we lost by a couple of points, so you'd expect we're hearing that in the core of Toronto and right across the country.""

On foreign policy and the recent canola seed trade conflict with China, the panel agreed that how a party deals with those issues is going to be important to voters.

2019 has been a busy year so far, and it's only March. With the clock ticking down to the federal election in October, how are the parties preparing? We ask three backroom strategists working on the campaign plans for the NDP, Conservatives and Liberals. Michael Balagus, Hamish Marshall and Suzanne Cowan join us. 12:56

""Yeah, I would agree that foreign policy as it affects jobs, as it affects people's ability to earn a living, is the prism that, come election time, people look at it through,"" said Belagus. ""But I would add one more layer. I think foreign policy is also an opportunity where voters can get a sense of a leader and a party's values.""

Notwithstanding whether the federal government's newly announced budget will make an impact on the Liberal Party's prospects this year, Cowan said the government takes those budget commitments seriously.

""These were tangible plans to implement a national pharmacare program, which is a huge priority for Canadians and has been for this Liberal government,"" said Cowan. ""We as the government are in a position to actually (produce) action and not just talk about it, and we are taking a responsible approach to that.""",The House: A tale of the tape,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/the-house-a-tale-of-the-tape-1.5077180

This, according to a new analysis of public opinion polling data by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute. The data was donated to ARI by Angus Reid Global Public Affairs.

The Conservatives capture 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote – essentially unchanged from where they stood last month – but it is the governing Liberals who have dropped three points to 28 per cent as the SNC-Lavalin affair has remained in the headlines.

The principal beneficiaries of this decline in Liberal support appear to be the New Democratic Party and smaller parties, including the Green Party and the People’s Party of Canada.

Woywitka said he knows one social ...","Alberta’s upstart libertarian conservative party, led by former UCP MLA Derek Fildebrandt, says it has replaced two candidates in the upcoming election — one over anti-Islamic social media posts and views, the other for “controversial posts.”

Clayton Knutson

According to a the Freedom Conservative Party’s director of communications, Clayton Knutson was asked to resign as its candidate in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake and was officially removed on March 18 when he wouldn’t step down.

“He had failed to disclose previous information on his candidate nomination package and that includes… financial, personal and prior social media posts,” Cody Johnston told Global News on Tuesday. “We are a small and mighty party and we do our best to make sure that we vet our candidates properly before they get on the paper, and we do expect them to follow the honour system and it was found out that Clayton had failed to disclose controversial and quite frankly, Islamophobic posts in the past.”

When interviewed by Global News, Knutson said he believes a true libertarian party should not kick him out because he is critical of Islam.

“You have to be Shariah-compliant if you’re going to run for a party in Alberta,” he said. “I criticized people that will use the word Islamophobia because I don’t believe in Islamophobia. I think nobody has a phobia if they are actually criticizing Islam. It’s all about: you can’t criticize Islam.

“They asked for my resignation. I said, ‘Absolutely not,’ because they’re saying stuff like, ‘You’re a racist,’ and I’m not a racist, I’m in an interracial marriage.”

Knutson said he was turned off by the UCP after that party turfed a nomination candidate over photos he took with the far-right group Soldiers of Odin. He said he believed the Freedom Conservatives would allow its prospective candidates to have more freedom in their comments and associations.

Watch below: (From October 2018) Rachel Notley responds to the UCP disqualifying Lance Coulter after comments about the Soldiers of Odin.

Johnston said while the Freedom Conservative Party does see itself as a party of conservative libertarians,”there’s no place for Islamophobia in any party… and no one’s going to stand for that type of stuff.”

“He’s truly doubled down in the last few days, trying to prove that he is a racist and he is Islamophobic and I find his comments to be deplorable and we absolutely wholeheartedly reject them.”

Since being removed as the Freedom Conservatives’ candidate, Knutson has been active on Twitter, posting about Islam and saying he would vote for Caylan Ford, who recently resigned as a UCP candidate over comments about race and white supremacist terrorists; Eva Kiryakos, who recently resigned as a UCP candidate for comments she made about gender-neutral washrooms and a post she shared about refugees; and Todd Beasley, who was prevented from running for the UCP after social media posts were discovered in which he said of Islam that he hoped someone in history would have “snuffed this evil cult when they had the chance.”

“I think Mr. Knutson is unfit to be a politician in the province of Alberta,” Johnston said. “We need to be standing up against hate and intolerance and I know that he said we’re a bad libertarian party for not protecting his freedom of speech, but I argue he’s a bad conservative for failing to stand up against terrorism.”

Knutson said he has “the best intentions for every individual Muslim” and that he hopes “they have great lives.”

“But taking away my free speech with regards to religion just because I want to be a political candidate I think is very cowardly of the Freedom Conversative Party.”

Wade Woywitka

On Tuesday, the Freedom Conservative Party confirmed Wade Woywitka, who had been its candidate in Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright, was asked to resign by the party which Woywitka did.

“It was a similar situation [to Knutson’s],” Johnston said when asked why Woywitka was asked to step down. “[He] had made some controversial posts.”

Johnston said he couldn’t immediately elaborate but Woywitka told Global News he believes his involvement in the Yellow Vest movement and views he has expressed on immigrants prompted the call for him to resign.

“[Things were brought up by another party about] stuff I said on the internet about our Yellow Vest movement and of course, as soon as you’re part of the Yellow Vests, you’re painted as a racist and every other thing in the book because we’re against the UN and we want pipelines built and everybody to get back to work,” he said.

“They were taking… just stuff I had said… interviews I had done in Ottawa (when the United We Roll convoy arrived there), and picking and choosing what they wanted to use out of context.”

Watch below: (From February 2019) A pro-pipeline convoy arrived at Parliament Hill Tuesday. Kendra Slugoski and Mike Le Couteur have more on the issues the protesters from across Canada want addressed.

Woywitka said he knows one social media post — that he said he made years ago — in particular helped bring about the end of his candidacy.

“It was in regards to all the immigrants coming in and I said, ‘Yeah, we need someone like (Donald) Trump to keep all the foreigners out of our country because they’re taking over and they’re ruining our country for our children,” he recounted.

“I talked to Derek and he just said, ‘There’s all these things they’re saying about you,’ and I just told him… ‘I’m not doing it (running as a candidate any longer) cause I’m not taking down the Yellow Vest movement for anything.'”

However, Woywitka said he plans to continue to support the Freedom Conservatives going forward.

“I back them 110 per cent,” he said. “That’s how I’m voting this year… I will back Derek [Fildebrandt] 110 per cent.

“We’re here for one reason and that’s to make our country better and to get our sovereignty back and to be a free nation again and not have some globalist government running our country, and I’m pretty sure that the Freedom Conservative Party and most Albertans have the same views that I do.”

Watch below: (From March 21, 20190 The Freedom Conservative Party launched its 2019 election campaign in Calgary on Thursday.

Woywitka, who indicated he was previously active in the Wildrose Party, said he is not sure if he will run for office again but he hopes all Albertans will vote this election, regardless of what party they support.

Chad Miller has now replaced Knutson as the Freedom Conservatives’ candidate in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake while Matthew Powell has now replaced Woywitka as the party’s candidate in Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright.

Albertans head to the polls on April 16.

113,,2019-03-30T16:55:00.0000000Z,"It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities. So at this critical juncture ...","The ghastly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand recently show that the rise of far-right extremism has not only proven itself to be a major global threat to peace and security, but also an existential threat to conservatism itself, which has come under heavy fire for breeding, or at least tolerating in its ranks, xenophobic elements.

In a way, the New Zealand attacks may prove to become a pivotal moment for the right-wing.

Though the racism of far-right extremism has long been identified as something real and dangerous, it has also, to a large extent, remained under the radar; something ugly simmering under the surface.

But after 50 people (nearly all visible minorities) were slaughtered at a house of worship, in a modern western nation deemed to be one of the safest in the world, that ugliness has boiled over for the world to see.

What’s now clear is that it’s past time for conservatives to utterly separate themselves from any notion or any segment of their membership base that ascribes even remotely to xenophobic or Islamophobic views. It should go without saying that conservatism is a movement in which racists are not welcome. Unfortunately, this is a message that must now be shouted by conservatives across the world, including here in Canada, where anti-immigrant views have, as of late, begun to stain the brand.

READ MORE: When terror strikes the populist leaders cash in

After the New Zealand mosque attack, the leader of the People’s Party of Canada refused to offer comment (even to denounce it). Similarly, the leader of the Conservative Party’s first statement focused on how “freedom” had come under attack (not Muslims), needing a second try to get it right. The delay left the impression that the Conservative Party feared alienating a kind of voter who may hold anti-immigrant views.

Both parties have also been skeptical of Canada’s signing of the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. The Conservatives have argued that it will erode the sovereignty of our borders, while the PPC says it will open the doors to masses of migrants from poor countries. Both claims seem geared toward stoking fear among anti-immigration voters, and contrary to the reality of the massive value of immigration.

Of course, south of the border, the president of the United States has openly fraternized with far right and white supremacists while routinely raising fears about immigrants, whether it’s about building a wall to keep out Mexicans or imposing a travel ban to keep out Muslims.

It’s as if an element of the right has forgotten, or perhaps has simply not truly understood, that there is a huge difference between “nationalism” and “nation building”.

“Nationalism” as we understand it today, is increasingly a movement based on bigotry and fear-based racism—one that’s often associated with populist far right movements in Europe that have ridden a wave of anti-migrant sentiment. “Nation building” however, is a very different and noble cause; one that is about wanting to make your country great—it is not to be associated with the pettiness of racism, bigotry or Islamophobia at all.

There needs to be a refocus on positive conservatism, a movement that embraces immigration and minorities. After all, immigration is what made the U.S. the dominant power in the world, by welcoming and nurturing the best minds to fuel technology and ingenuity. (Immigrants contribute 10 per cent of America’s annual GDP and are, according to the Brookings Institution, more likely to become Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine.)

We’ve seen the immense benefits of immigration here as well, but there’s a lot more potential we have yet to tap into. And conservative thinking should be obsessed with wanting to build Canada up to reach its true greatness.

Conservatism at its best is a movement that champions individual liberties and fiscal responsibility; small government and social values. Campassionate conservatives also believe in helping others, be they refugees or fellow citizens. It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities.

So at this critical juncture, what is stopping Canadian conservatives from building a party that embraces open doors and offers a safe haven to the world’s most needy, while making Canada an economic powerhouse? Nothing. Because most right of centre voters in Canada are welcoming to refugees and immigrants and would welcome the economic growth and innovation they bring.

This is what the new conservatism, a positive conservatism, can look like. It’s got to be about nation building, not nationalism. It’s got to be about achieving the best for Canada, in a way that includes everybody, and cuts at the root of far-right extremism. It’s time to make a separation between racist nationalism, and the positive, inclusive patriotism of nation building.

Yes, you read that right, Andrew Scheer and his Conservative Party think that it's a good idea to send mass-texts to campaign against the federal government's carbon tax.

This new tactic comes on the heels of new campaign ads released this week that accuses Justin Trudeau of being a ""fake feminist"". Canada's official opposition party is still using classic outreach tactics like television advertising and door-to-door campaigning, but this mass-text initiative is a clever new tactic.

In an apparent effort to modernize the campaigning process, Andrew Scheer and his Conservative government believe this to be the best way to reach a massive amount of voters.

The party is taking phone numbers from various databases and will randomly generate other numbers. So even if you're not a card-carrying Conservative, you might just get a text today.

TL;DR Canada's Conservative Party might just send you a mass-text today to campaign against Justin Trudeau's proposed carbon tax. Andrew Scheer and the Conservative party believe that this controversial initiative is all about utilizing 21st-century methods to help with voter outreach. Critics say that this isn't illegal, but it's definitely unconventional.

@cpc_hqembedded via

You might remember that this isn't the Conservative Party's first foray into using technology to attract voters. In 2011, Stephen Harper's government used robocalls to attract voters and to report fake polling information.

After over 40,000 Canadians reported them to the authorities, the Conservatives quickly backtracked and apologized for using such murky campaigning tactics.

According to a CBC report, the federal carbon tax will kick in on April 1st in four provinces, which will increase gas prices by almost 5 cents per litre. In the House of Commons, Trudeau's government has come under fire because of this proposed carbon tax.

@cpc_hqembedded via

Liberals are quick to point out that 90% of the revenue will return to Canadians, as each household in the affected provinces will be able to claim a tax deduction on the carbon tax.

Conservative provincial governments in Ontario and Saskatchewan are challenging the plan in provincial courts, claiming that the carbon tax is unconstitutional.

One of the texts will read ""Andrew Scheer here. Trudeau's carbon tax will raise gas prices 5 cents on Monday, so fill your tank!"" There are a few more texts planned as well.

So the Conservative party is now spamming us with text messages... not cool. Thumbs down! Lost my vote, ha! You never had it to begin with. Solitifies my vote to vote against the conservatives.

Conservatives are quick to accuse the Liberals of instituting a carbon tax as a ""cash grab"". The Liberals retort by saying that this is in the name of environmental protection. Trudeau's government says that this policy is an attempt to meet emissions reduction goals for 2030.

Experts say that placing a carbon tax on the most polluting industries is the easiest and cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Canadians who are affected by this carbon tax may not agree with that but since Trudeau is offering a tax deduction on affected expenses, they might come to appreciate it.

I'm not sure of how effective it is to mass-text Canadian citizens to promote your political party, but the Conservatives seem to think it'll work out for them. We'll see how this plays out.

If you get a text from a weird number today, that might just be Andrew Scheer hitting you up. You won't be able to text back though!

“The ad that was displayed on Teletext this morning is in alignment with the Canadian ad standards, but we realize that we could do a better job at ensuring that customers understand that Calgary Transit does not endorse or support any of the ads displayed,” Stephen Tauro, a customer information and services co-ordinator for Calgary Transit, said in a statement.

“We are looking at immediate ways to better identify ads in the text application to make this distinction clear for customers.”

Tauro said Calgary Transit has an advertising contract with several vendors to sell ad space on its property and digital platforms.

“We work closely with our vendors to ensure this alignment (with Canadian ad standards),” he stated. “Advertising revenue helps offset the costs of operating our transit system.”

A spokesperson for Elections Alberta said the text message advertisement did not violate any election rules.

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conversations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence. She entered politics with her mind set on transforming the country and, after three years, came to believe she couldn’t do it as a Liberal. An early party switch meant trying to make the most of what could be her last year in office, she says, noting she had the support of her family and many constituents. But it also meant alienating supporters and staff who fought to get her elected and who now have reason to want to see her lose. Later this year, they will get their say on whether her actions were genuine and, above all, justified.",The Politics of Switching Parties,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/the-politics-of-switching-parties/

The NDP’s standard bearer in the riding will be selected on Saturday.

The byelection already features an interesting cast of characters, including a jilted Conservative who lost a bid for her party’s candidacy and jumped to Maxime Bernier’s Peoples Party of Canada (PPC); a Green candidate who had a falling out with the NDP ahead of the last federal election; and a Liberal Indigenous candidate with as big a profile as Jody Wilson-Raybould when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited her for the Liberals in 2015.

Singh, who took a seat in the House of Commons for the first time last week after winning his own byelection in the greater Vancouver riding of Burnaby South last month, will greet the NDP candidate in Nanaimo on Sunday, his office told iPolitics.

A roster of four NDP candidates suggests the New Democrat’s confidence in the riding, despite a late entry into the race and a hike in Green Party support in the past years. Prime Minister Trudeau announced the byelection on March 24.

A day after Trudeau set the byelection date, he surfaced in Nanaimo to circulate and draw attention to a star Liberal candidate, who the party had announced only a week earlier. That candidate, Michelle Corfield, is a prominent and highly successful Indigenous leader who holds a doctorate from Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business.

Corfield is also chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of Ucluelet First Nation and a founding member of a settlement trust at Ucluelet First Nation on the western coast of Vancouver Island. Corfield is an executive resident at the Beedie School’s Indigenous Business and Economic Development Knowledge Exchange.

Despite the credentials of his party’s candidate, or perhaps to ensure Corfield was the one in the limelight during an ongoing confrontation between Trudeau and one of his star 2015 candidates, Vancouver Liberal MP and former justice minister Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau declined to take questions from local news media.

Even with as prominent a candidate as Corfield, the Liberal party faces an uphill battle toward May 6.

Vancouver Island resisted the Liberal wave of 2015, voting in New Democrats in six of the island’s seven federal electoral districts. The seventh, Saanich—Gulf Islands, was won by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for her second term in the House of Commons.

The contests were close and Angus Reid Institute’s polling analyst Shachi Kurl notes that Vancouver Island has been a tug-of-war between New Democrats and Conservatives over the past years.

“The island has a tendency to swing orange or blue,” Kurl said in a phone interview from her Vancouver office.

Nanaimo News Bulletin reporter Nicholas Pescod says he expects the NDP will continue to hold Nanaimo—Ladysmith. “I suspect the NDP will do well,” he said in a telephone interview from the News Bulletin newsroom.

Kurl noted low-turnout byelections can hinge on local organization, for which the NDP is famous in B.C.

Nanaimo—Ladysmith was left vacant after popular former NDP MP Sheila Malcolmson, announced last fall that she was making the jump to provincial politics. She resigned her Commons seat on Jan. 2 to contest and win a byelection in the provincial electoral district of Nanaimo. That Jan. 30 byelection was crucial for the survival of the province’s NDP coalition government.

For the May 6 federal byelection, the NDP field of four candidates also includes a prominent Indigenous candidate, Bob Chamberlin, who is vice-president of the long-established Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and chief councillor with the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation at the north end of Vancouver Island.

The other three NDP hopefuls include Lauren Sample, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson, a past president of Nanaimo Pride, and a women’s rights advocate; Maeve O’Byrne, a founder of the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation who coaches volunteers working in refugee camps; and Fred Statham, whose electoral experience includes two attempts at election to Nanaimo city council.

The nominated field for other parties is just as unique.

The Green Party and Conservative candidates launched their nomination bids last fall, after Malcolmson announced she would not seek re-election federally.

Green candidate Paul Manly, who came third against Malcolmson in 2015, was acclaimed as the Green candidate on Feb. 3, after launching his nomination campaign last Oct. 25. According to commenters on a Reddit forum and other media, Manly tried to contest the NDP riding’s general election nomination in 2015, but claimed later his candidacy was rejected because he protested Israel’s treatment of his father, former NDP MP Jim Manley, who was arrested after taking part in an attempt to breach Israel’s 2012 sea blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The nominated Conservative candidate for the byelection, Sun Life office manager John Hirst, won his nomination on Nov. 17 last year. His opponent for the Tory nomination, Jennifer Clarke, was picked up to run for the PPC.

Both parties back the Trans Mountain expansion (TMX) project, and both want to see First Nations have the opportunity to buy a stake in the federally owned pipeline.

Ottawa set down several guiding principles this week for discussions with Indigenous groups interested in buying a piece of the pipeline, which the Trudeau government purchased last year for $4.5 billion.

Those guidelines include Trans Mountain must be operated on a commercial basis, that impacted communities have a chance for meaningful economic participation, and that Indigenous ownership help trigger economic development of their communities.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley, whose government committed last year to invest up to $2 billion into the pipeline’s expansion project if it faces cost over-runs — and receive an equity stake in return — has already spoken to interested First Nations that want to explore an ownership bid.

“We are more than interested and open to having conversations with First Nations groups … as well as supporting them in their efforts to take on a larger equity stake,” she said Thursday.

“We are, at this time, more likely looking at capacity funding for them, or potentially helping them get access to capital.”

Likewise, UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he’s had a number of conversations with groups like the Indian Resource Council of Canada, which have been pressing for Indigenous ownership as a way to reduce poverty and create jobs.

“I am very encouraged. I think this is the way forward,” Kenney said Thursday.

“It’s time that we gave practical expression (of) solidarity with the majority of First Nations who are pro-development. They want the right to move their people from poverty to prosperity and they understand responsible resource development, like TMX, is a way of doing so.”

The UCP will announce next week “practical ways in which we will support aboriginal co-ownership of that and other projects,” he added.

These are positive developments for Alberta, which needs a pipeline, and for Indigenous groups that want a chance to control development that could affect their land — giving them a seat in the board room — while providing economic opportunities.

First Nations’ ownership won’t remove all of the obstacles facing energy infrastructure in this country. Some Indigenous groups in British Columbia object to the pipeline’s expansion, which would triple the amount of Alberta oil moving to the Pacific coast.

However, it would be a constructive step, broadening support for an initiative that will help maximize the value of Canada’s natural resources.

The project first needs to move out of limbo.

The federal government is busy completing consultation with First Nations affected by the Trans Mountain expansion, and it’s expected to make a final decision on the development in the coming weeks.

“There’s no project yet,” federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in Calgary this week.

“We are going through the consultation process, so we can’t be putting participation on the table right now, but we’ve said we do want Indigenous equity participation.”

Similarly, Trans Mountain Corp. CEO Ian Anderson told Global News Radio this week that Indigenous ownership would be a “building block” to close the economic gap facing First Nations.

There won’t be any shortage of interested players when the Trudeau government decides to sell Trans Mountain to the private sector, which likely will not occur until the project is built.

Project Reconciliation, a group formed last year to acquire a majority stake in the pipeline, has contacted First Nations across Western Canada to gauge their support for getting involved.

Delbert Wapass, former chief of the Thunderchild First Nation in Saskatchewan and chairman of Project Reconciliation, said the response has been encouraging.

He believes the new federal principles, along with the support of Alberta’s political leaders, are giving the idea momentum.

“This here would be a game changer for many First Nations, where they would have the opportunity to have a better quality of life for their people,” Wapass said Friday.

“We are not asking for preferential treatment or special treatment, or asking to use taxpayer money … we will get the financing, we will do the business in a responsible, structured way. That’s what it means to us as First Nations.”

Other groups have also expressed interest, including the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and Fort McKay First Nation in Alberta.

Chief Allan Adam of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation noted he’s aware of four different groups considering an ownership bid.

The process is still in preliminary stages, but his interest remains high.

However, Adam cautions the Trudeau government shouldn’t be holding out hope of Indigenous ownership if it’s not serious about taking action.

“If they are going to lead First Nations down a trail where there’s no opportunity at the end, I think it will be very detrimental to Canada,” he said in an interview.

“All First Nations are watching this now.”

In Alberta, the parties themselves are offering political support — and may provide more tangible assistance to help make it happen — although the ball remains in Ottawa’s court.

“There is a role for the Alberta government to play here because … the oil is coming from Alberta,” Adam added.

“Every government player is going to be very critical.”

122,Politics,2019-03-29T13:54:00.0000000Z,"Prince said that Telford and Butts were adamant that SNC-Lavalin get a deferred prosecution, and that Butts in particular didn’t care about respecting the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ... was released, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer ...","OTTAWA — A trove of detailed evidence documenting Jody Wilson-Raybould’s final days as justice minister and attorney general — including a secretly-recorded phone call with then-Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick — has reinforced her claim that government officials attempted to interfere in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and undermined the accounts of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and some of his top aides.

The evidence, submitted to the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday and made public Friday, shows that Wilson-Raybould repeatedly warned top officials working for Trudeau that they were attempting to politically interfere in a criminal prosecution, violating a constitutional principle.

In an extraordinary 17-minute phone call on Dec. 19, 2018, Wernick can be heard telling Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau was “determined” to find a way for Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to get a deferred prosecution, despite Wilson-Raybould’s insistence that it was wrong to overrule the prosecution service’s decision to proceed with a trial.

“This is not a great place for me to be in,” Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick near the end of the phone call. “But what I am confident of is that I have given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

“Alright, but … I am worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this,” Wernick replies, referring to Trudeau. “I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

Ending the phone call, Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick she is waiting for “the other shoe to drop.”

“I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister has and gets things that he wants,” she said.

Less than three weeks after that phone call, Wilson-Raybould was told she would be removed as justice minister and shuffled into a different cabinet role. She said the Prime Minister’s Office denied that it was over the SNC-Lavalin issue.

Wilson-Raybould’s evidence also includes lengthy text-message exchanges between herself and her chief of staff, Jessica Prince. In one conversation, Prince details a conversation she had on Dec. 18, 2018, with Trudeau’s top aides, Chief of Staff Katie Telford and then-Principal Secretary Gerald Butts.

Prince said that Telford and Butts were adamant that SNC-Lavalin get a deferred prosecution, and that Butts in particular didn’t care about respecting the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, given it had been created as an independent body under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

“Gerry kept talking about how it was created by Harper,” Prince said in a text message. “I was like ‘sure but it is what we have and we have to respect the statute.’ No scruples.”

“So crazy,” responded Wilson-Raybould. “Gerry said the same thing to me.”

I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister has and gets things that he wants

The new material shows that Wilson-Raybould repeatedly said that she felt the pressure being put on her was inappropriate and constituted an attempt at political interference — despite the fact that Trudeau, Butts and Wernick have all contended that Wilson-Raybould did not bring her concerns forward at the time.

“If anyone, particularly the attorney general, felt that we were not doing our job fully, responsibly and according to all the rules, as a government, it was her responsibility to come forward to me this past fall and highlight that directly to me,” said Trudeau on Feb. 12, 2018. “She did not. Nobody did.”

After the material was released, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer repeated his call for Trudeau’s resignation, which he first made following Wilson-Raybould’s committee testimony on Feb. 27.

“(Trudeau) looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him,” he said in a statement. “This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation. The entire SNC-Lavalin scandal is corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption. Two cabinet ministers have resigned on principle and both Justin Trudeau’s top political advisor and his top civil servant have resigned in disgrace. The Prime Minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh called the material “so compelling and well-documented that we must have an independent public inquiry to get to the truth.”

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement,” said Singh’s statement. “What we see in this submission is a lawyer acting in her client’s best interests to protect him from his own recklessness.”

The Prime Minister’s Office on Friday evening released a statement saying, “The Prime Minister was not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould, and we were unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

In the introduction to her submission, Wilson-Raybould wrote that the context of the justice committee’s study “is the core principle of prosecutorial independence — a principle that at times appears to have been obscured by layers of commentary, hyperbole, and spin.”

Wilson-Raybould submitted the material after Liberal MPs on the Commons justice committee voted to conclude their study of the issue without inviting her to testify a second time — despite the fact they had invited Wernick twice.

She originally testified before the justice committee on Feb. 27, a four-hour-long appearance in which she described the Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick. She said she felt he was making “veiled threats,” and that she’d told Wernick she was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre — a reference to U.S. President Richard Nixon’s firing of the independent prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.

Wernick testified to the committee on Feb. 21 and again on March 6. In his second appearance, Wernick disputed Wilson-Raybould’s version of the phone call. “That is not my recollection of the conversation,” he said when asked to respond to her description. But he said he didn’t take notes about it and didn’t have a strong memory of what was said.

“I do not have an independent recollection of the event. I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” he said.

In her Feb. 27 appearance, Wilson-Raybould had not told the committee she’d recorded the call. In her submission published today, in which she provided both the transcript and the audio of the call, she said she made the recording because she didn’t have a staff member with her to take notes, and because she “had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.”

“So while I typed out notes during the phone call, I took the extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step of making an audio recording of the conversation without so advising the Clerk,” she wrote. “This is something that I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.”

During the phone call, Wilson-Raybould made clear several times that she was uncomfortable. “Again, I am surprised that you and I are having this conversation, but I’m just saying that I really feel uncomfortable about the appropriateness of this conversation,” she said at one point.

I am not seeing anything inappropriate here

The audio recording confirms Wilson-Raybould’s description of her conversation with Wernick during her February testimony.

In the call, Wernick said Trudeau was concerned about potential job losses and wanted “to be able to say that he has tried everything he can, you know, within a legitimate toolbox, to try to head that off,” including consulting an external legal expert like former Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin.

Wilson-Raybould repeatedly raised concerns about prosecutorial independence. She said that if she were to step in and order the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement, “there is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference.”

“It does not matter how I would look in doing that — I would be a mockery, and that is not the problem — the bigger problem is what it would look like down the road for the government,” she told Wernick.

“One, it has never been done before, but two, this is going to look like nothing but political interference by the prime minister, by you, by everyone else that has been involved in politically pressuring me to do this.”

Wernick insisted that he and the other officials approaching her on this issue were acting lawfully. “You are not just the attorney general, you are the minister of justice in a cabinet,” he said. “I am not seeing anything inappropriate here.”

Wilson-Raybould was on guard about her conversation with Wernick in part because of the meeting that Prince, her chief of staff, had taken with Telford and Butts the day before.

In a text message on Dec. 18, Prince said there was “nothing new” being provided as evidence from the Prime Minister’s Office on why to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“They want external counsel retained to give you an opinion on whether you can review the DPP’s decision here and whether you should in this case,” she told Wilson-Raybould, noting they had also suggested Beverley McLachlin.

Prince said she told Butts that such a move would amount to interference, to which she said Butts replied, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve interference.”

“At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do!” Prince then said to Wilson-Raybould.

The former attorney general responded, “OMG. I do not even know what to say to that.”

Prince said she emphasized to Butts and Telford that it was extremely important to maintain the independence of the attorney general. “They didn’t seem to get or even care. Yup, I was floored,” she said.

After her phone call with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould wrote that the next time she heard from the prime minister or anyone in his office was on Jan. 7, when Trudeau told her she was being shuffled.

Wilson-Raybould also confirmed that she had a “series of meetings” with Trudeau in Vancouver that led to her Feb. 12 resignation from cabinet in the wake of a Globe and Mail article that broke the story of allegations of political interference.

“The Prime Minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in cabinet spoke for itself,” she wrote. “I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.”

We will continue to listen to Albertans and ...,"Hundreds of people gathered in southwest Calgary Thursday night for a show of support for gay-straight alliances and the current rules that prevent disclosure of participants.

The protest march was in response to United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney’s plans, should the UCP be elected into government, to replace the School Act with the unproclaimed Education Act of 2014. The change of legislation would lead to the potential for parents and guardians to be notified when a student participates in a GSA.

“I’m here to support GSAs,” said Blake Spence, a participant in the rally. “I think it’s really important for them to pick when and why they come out, not the government.”

“I’m a teacher and a parent and a gay man,” said Andrew Clapperton. “I can’t believe I’m having to fight this battle all over again but I’m here to do it and I’ll be here until we make sure that kids have a right to privacy, they have a right to safer spaces in schools, and so they’re not being overrun by a government that doesn’t really respect them.”

The protesters marched from the parking lot of the Marda Loop Safeway to the office of Doug Schweitzer, the UCP candidate for Calgary-Elbow.

Schweitzer released the following statement Thursday night in response to the march.

“I have always been, and continue to be, an advocate for LGBTQ2S+ community. Today, I am proud that all major political parties supports gay-straight alliances and categorically reject mandatory notification of parents.

To those that marched today, I will never diminish your concerns and feelings of frustration. I am saddened to see that my opponents have turned such a critical issue for our vulnerable youth into a divisive topic, when we should be working to find a strong path forward together.

I am committed, alongside my United Conservative colleagues, to ensuring that Alberta has the strongest legal protections for gay-straight alliances in Canada. We will continue to listen to Albertans and act in the best interests of all our children.”

A similar rally was held Wednesday in Edmonton.

Its more a fear that those that are doing ...","One of the unusual features of the past four years in Alberta has been the remarkable calm that has prevailed in our normally tumultuous, shambolic, sometimes chaotic health care system.

Under the NDP Government, for the first time in the past 30 years at least, health care hasn’t been a continual gong show, spinning ever closer to the edge under a series of conservative governments that couldn’t keep their political paws off the system and swung back and forth from crisis-inducing austerity to hair-on-fire crisis spending.

This may have been because conservative ideology runs counter to reality – no, in health care, “market solutions” do not work very well, no matter what you may wish to believe. Or it may have been because, as some theorize darkly, conservatives don’t really want to see public health care succeed and therefore encourage failure to justify marketization.

Whatever, while many flaws remain in this large, complex and costly system, health care has never run more smoothly than since Rachel Notley’s New Democrats unexpectedly came to power in 2015 and Sarah Hoffman was appointed minister of health.

Paradoxically, this has been to the disadvantage of the NDP as an election approached. Health care, a traditional NDP strength, has been ticking along so smoothly it’s no longer a front-burner issue for most Albertans.

How did the NDP do it? As Calgary Herald political columnist Don Braid pointed out yesterday in a column surprising because it is so at odds with his employer’s drumbeat of attacks on the government, “the NDP calmed down the system, made significant improvements and provided stability for health planners, professionals and workers.”

“Health care access and delivery are far more level and reliable than they were in 2015,” Mr. Braid wrote. And in almost all of the 30 years before that, he could have added.

But don’t worry, as the Herald columnist pointed out, Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party has a plan to “fix” all that.

Under the Progressive Conservatives, Mr. Braid recalled, “staffing and programs were flatlined, resuscitated and then put through the same survival cycle again. It was chaotic for doctors, nurses and too often for patients.

“Now the UCP proposes something even worse – real-world cuts, with no apparent hope of a corresponding hike the next year.” And all the meaningless Coroplast pledges about protecting health care signed by Mr. Kenney will not change this if he gets to do what he says he’d do.

I was thinking about Mr. Braid’s credible prediction that Mr. Kenney’s vow to impose austerity on health care once again “guarantees a return to the chaos of the Progressive Conservative years, and maybe worse, because there would be no panic spending spikes to save the day,” when I came across another column about health care and conservatives.

The same day as Mr. Braid published his observations, Paul Krugman, economics columnist for the New York Times and a Nobel Prize winning economist, took a look at what drives the U.S. Republican Party to sabotage, and now to attempt to repeal, the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama’s signature achievement as president.

Given that U.S. President Donald Trump is now proposing to use a legal manoeuver to take health insurance away from more than 20 million Americans in the year before a presidential election, Dr. Krugman observed, “it’s no longer possible to see any of this as part of a clever political strategy, even a nefariously cynical one.”

“It has entered the realm of pathology instead,” he said. “It’s now clear the Republicans have a deep, unreasoning hatred of the idea that government policy may help some people get health care.”

Sometimes it helps to put issues close to home in a larger context. As has been observed here recently, over the past 40 years there has been a significant effort on the right to forge an international ideological consensus through promotion of institutions such as the worldwide network of utopian market fundamentalist “think tanks” and Astro-Turf groups.

As a result, nowadays, there is very little light between conservatives in Washington and their counterparts in Ottawa and Edmonton.

So, is it possible that Mr. Kenney and the UCP have, like their Republican brethren south of the Medicine Line, gone beyond mere cynicism to outright pathology?

It’s not just health care

It’s not just the health care file where this happens, of course.

When Mr. Kenney touted his plan this week to roll back legal protections for LGBTQ students, it seemed weirdly like President Trump’s decision to move against health care that benefits poor and working class Americans. That is, not particularly to the advantage of either politician, under present circumstances, to talk about such schemes.

We have to ask, does the same kind of pathology drive Mr. Kenney to do the wrong thing about protecting LGBTQ youth from persecution – sometimes, sad to say, from their own families – as drives him to promise to return health care in Alberta to the chaos and dysfunction of the PC years?

Hundreds of people gathered at the Alberta Legislature in Edmonton last night to protest against the UCP plan to dump the NDP legislation that protects students who join gay-straight alliances and, instead, to allow teachers and private schools to out them to their families.

It is profoundly to be hoped that does not become reality.

Will there be a Game 7?

By Canadian Press on March 26, 2019.

CALGARY – Another United Conservative Party candidate who has pulled out of the Alberta election says someone outside the party is threatening to release her past social media comments about Muslim refugees and transgender washrooms in schools.

Eva Kiryakos, who was running in Calgary-South East in the April 16 vote, announced her resignation in a Facebook statement and video released Sunday night.

Kiryakos said she’s been getting threats from someone who wants to release images of things she has said or commented on.

“Someone outside of our party has been threatening to smear me, and I have had enough of the bullies and the threats,” she said in the statement. “This is who I am and I will keep speaking up – for myself and for Albertans.”

In one of the online exchanges, Kiryakos retweeted an article about Germany’s alleged migrant rape crisis called “Rapefugees Not Welcome.”

She said in her statement that everyone retweets and shares articles.

“I admit the image on the article isn’t positive,” she said. “But the article was on women getting raped and the crisis there. When women are being assaulted, I care, no matter the faiths or the backgrounds of the people.”

In another post, Kiryakos wrote about transgender washrooms in Alberta schools. “I should have the right to choose for my children to not be brainwashed into accepting perversions as ‘alternative lifestyles.”’

In her statement, she said she was concerned for her daughter’s safety and voiced her honest opinion.

“It’s OK to disagree.”

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he appreciates her decision to step down and put the party first. He did not specifically comment on the social media posts.

“I’ve always been clear that the United Conservative Party is a big-tent coalition that respects human dignity and will protect the rights of people regardless of how they pray or who they love,” he said.

“Eva’s also from a minority community herself. She is from a Middle Eastern refugee family, from a community that has faced a history of genocide.”

Kiryakos, a lawyer and mother of two, said she came to Canada as a child with her parents after they fled persecution for their Christian faith in Iraq. She said she was raised in Saskatchewan and taught to speak up and practise her right to freedom of speech.

Last week, Calgary UCP candidate Caylan Ford stepped down after publication of a private 2017 Facebook conversation in which she allegedly spoke about the replacement of white people in their homelands and the collapse of western culture.

Ford has degrees from three universities, including Oxford, and once worked as a policy adviser for what is now Global Affairs Canada under the Harper government. She was considered a star candidate.

At the time, NDP Leader Rachel Notley said she was shocked by Ford’s comments. She said she doesn’t believe Kenney is a racist but that the UCP has a problem with racism.

On Monday, she told reporters that the problem isn’t about the UCP not properly vetting candidates.

“I think this is about the leadership,” she said.

“This is not in my mind, a good look for anybody who is seeking to represent Albertans in the legislature and to lead this province.”

“Here’s the NDP Leader wearing blue in 2019. In 2015, lots of neutral colours. It’s subtle but telling. NDP brand is absolutely radioactive in Alberta. They’re essentially running against their own party, and trying to earn subliminal associations with conservative blue,” tweeted Blaise Boehmer.

His tweet led to a constructive, kind and nuanced debate, as is characteristic of Twitter in the realm of provincial politics. Reporters and political insiders debated branding, and whether or not dissecting Notley’s clothes is “creepy.”

Kenney’s current campaign spokesperson Christine Myatt chimed in, tweeting “what the Leader wears is a big part of staging a campaign event and you better believe it’s deliberate and well thought out.”

Even a Canadian senator got into it, with a somewhat different take. (Independent Senator Paula Simons previously worked as a columnist at the Edmonton Journal).

“Psst. Sometimes a girl just likes the colour blue. I swear, not dressing to send you subliminal messages!” she tweeted, with photos of her wearing blue.

Smaller party promises

The Liberals unveiled a couple of tax promises Thursday — introducing a harmonized sale tax and eliminating income tax on the first $57,250 of personal income ($114,500 for couples).

“Almost two-thirds of Albertans will be exempt from personal income tax under our plan,” said Liberal Leader David Khan in a statement.

He also promised to reduce corporate income tax from 12 to 10 per cent if elected.

The Alberta Party also released an interesting plan Thursday when Leader Stephen Mandel promised to create the first corridor for self-driving vehicles in Canada by adding additional lanes to the Queen Elizabeth II Highway.

“S​elf-driving vehicles are already in use and more are on the way,” he said in a statement. “We can either get ready for this, or get left behind.”

UCP releases ’embarrassing cousin’ ad

UCP Calgary-Hays candidate Ric McIver released a new ad Thursday attacking NDP Leader Rachel Notley.

Notley said in a 2015 TV interview her government was working to improve the province’s environmental reputation so Alberta could be “genuinely proud to be a leader as opposed to the embarrassing cousin no one wants to talk about.”

The ad uses a record scratch to repeat her comments three times, but McIver said it’s fair game because “she never apologized” for the remark.

Notley later said she was referring to a lack of environmental action from the former Progressive Conservative government.

Calgary campaign trail

Calgary dad Tyler Ogilvie took on the job of Mr. Clean for Notley Thursday when his kitchen was broadcast live during a news conference.

Notley, parents and media squeezed into the gleaming kitchen of Ogilvie’s northeast Calgary townhouse Thursday morning to hear the NDP’s education platform.

“I’ve never cleaned this place so hard,” Ogilvie said of preparing for his moment in the political spotlight.

Minutes later, he was having coffee with Notley and three mothers who weighed in on the NDP’s education platform after the NDP leader fielded questions.

Ogilvie, dad to a 16-month-old and son of a teacher, applauded Notley’s announcement, adding “there just aren’t enough teachers, ever.”

Notley later dropped into NDP Calgary-Falconridge candidate Parmeet Singh’s campaign headquarters to deliver a pep talk.

Singh has delivered more lawn signs than any NDP hopeful in the city — about 1,200.

“It’s all because of the community love that’s there,” said Singh, whose current foray into politics is his first.

And Conservatives aren’t shy about making their views heard.,"Sour grapes, ego, opportunism — those are just some of the reasons why politicians turn on the party that brought them to power.

There are politicians who quit their party over principle. Winston Churchill crossed the floor — twice.

There are those who quit because they’re opportunists. Someone on the other side dangles a juicy cabinet post.

Then there are those who quit because they chafe under the intense discipline partisan politics demands.

And there are those who quit for a combination of all those reasons. That, I suspect, is where Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston MPP Randy Hillier fits — rebel without a cause; party of one.

Hillier quit the PC Party recently, saying Premier Doug Ford’s office has created a “culture of fear,” in the Tory caucus and citing vague examples of inappropriate lobbying by Ford’s friends. He’s asked the Integrity Commissioner to probe those claims and is now sitting as an Independent.

This is par for his course. Hillier has a track record of making wild accusations against every party leader he’s served under. He accused Patrick Brown of engaging in unproven, “dirty and crooked” politics.

In the fall of 2013, with an election looming, a group of Tory malcontents — with Hillier as an active participant — took a hatchet to then leader Tim Hudak. I don’t know if it’s a suicidal death wish that propels fringe Tory elements to pull such stunts, or if it’s some massive ego that drives them. This particular guerrilla attack was all the more unseemly because Hillier was one of the candidates Hudak had defeated for the leadership. Did he want to make it best two out of three?

This is nothing new for Tories. There’s a broad spectrum of beliefs within the party — from Red Tory to social conservative. And Conservatives aren’t shy about making their views heard. The challenge for any leader is to bring all the warring factions together in a cohesive fashion, especially when you’re in government.

It isn’t easy.

There are always disgruntled types, especially those left out of cabinet.

When Mike Harris was leader, he had several maverick backbenchers — most notably Bill Murdoch, Toni Skarica and the late Chris Stockwell.

Stockwell was outspoken about the creation of the so-called Megacity. One of the most passionate speeches I’ve heard in the Legislature was when Stockwell pleaded for his own government to reconsider changes to education funding for the city of Toronto. Skarica, a former Crown attorney, provided thoughtful criticism of the Harris Tories, which was courageous but ultimately doomed his political career. Murdoch was more of an ornery rabble-rouser who delighted in being a grumpy contrarian.

They created mayhem for Harris within the Tory caucus. Stockwell became one of the finest Speakers I’ve seen. Skarica became a judge.

Other parties have their renegades — just not as many.

The NDP’s late, great Peter Kormos fought with leader Bob Rae. Kormos passionately supported public auto insurance. When the NDP formed government in 1990, Rae backed away from the policy, despite campaigning on it. Kormos was furious. Ironically, he was dumped from cabinet not over his opposition to Rae’s insurance flip-flop, but because he posed — fully clothed — as a Sunshine Boy.

You get the sense from Hillier that the only person he’d be happy with as Tory leader is Randy Hillier. He came to politics as part of the Lanark Landowners Association — a radical rural party that has its roots in battling red tape that frustrates farmers and landowners. He was part of an attempted hostile takeover of the PC Party, supporting members of the Landowners Association when they challenged — and in one case won — nominations against sitting Progressive Conservatives. They were usurpers.

Veteran MPP Norm Sterling, a former cabinet minister, was unseated by Jack MacLaren in the eastern Ontario riding of Carleton Mississippi Mills — aided and abetted by Hillier.

You have to wonder why Hillier would continue to run for the PCs, a party for which he’s demonstrated so much contempt.

Ironically, he’s one of the few MPPs who could likely hold his seat as an Independent in the next election.

As a pastor of an affirming and welcoming congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, I stand with and beside the LGBTQ2SIA+ community in calling all elected officials, and those running for public office to support queer youth across our province this campaign season.

This support is now threatened by an education platform put forward by the United Conservative Party under Jason Kenney’s leadership. In my church role, and as a member of the queer community who has spoken at GSAs within our city, I can personally vouch for the need of these important spaces, and I condemn any policy that would give power to others to “out” students who wish to find safety and support within a GSA’s care. Protecting the rights and well-being of all who live in this country is the responsibility of every Canadian politician, regardless of their personal beliefs. This includes everyone within the LGBTQ2SIA+ community. As a pastor, I understand that at times individuals must put their personal faith convictions first, but if those convictions conflict with the laws of the land, then perhaps public office is not for them. We can’t revert back to the closeted dark ages of our province – we need to continue to support our LGBTQ2SIA+ youth and the systems of support that have been actively saving lives.

STUMPING FOR TRUDEAU

Letter writer Glenn Harrison sounds like a Liberal plant! Irrespective of what he deems Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s ethical problems we cannot and should not overlook the obvious shortcomings that are obvious in our prime minister. If there is nothing untoward regarding the interactions between the then attorney general and various proxy agents of Mr. Trudeau; then let’s have a full hearing at the justice committee with no restrictions on the testimony. We know this won’t happen because the prime minister would be exposed as favouring a certain province above all else. Including changing the law for a single company based in Quebec. It also would expose him for not caring a damn about areas of the country.

So, Toronto Coun. Mike Layton wants to sue Alberta for creating oil and gas products, which harm the people of Ontario. Like guns, oil and gas does not harm people. It’s how they are used that harm people. If you never pull the trigger of a gun, it won’t harm anyone. If you never use oil and gas, it too, will never harm anyone. Using this analogy, let’s see who uses more oil and gas, Ontario with its greater population and its manufacturing facilities or Alberta, with three times less population using oil and gas. Maybe Albertans should sue Ontario for the crap coming out of Toronto and Ottawa.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

That piece is “Harper: Serial Abuser of Power, The Evidence Compiled: The Tyee’s full, updated list of 70 Harper government assaults on democracy and the law.”

You can find it here.

The article lists dozens of serious abuses of power racked up by former prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservatives from the time they formed government in 2006 until the date the article was published, Aug. 10, 2015.

The list was not concerned with Tory laws, policies or positions disagreeable to people whose politics don’t lean right.

Instead, The Tyee defined abuses of power to be the opposite of good government, acts ranging from “scams to smears, monkey-wrenching opponents to intimidating public servants… some offences are criminal, others just offend human decency.”

The article drew on suggestions from Tyee readers as well as journalists. Each carefully researched item in the list is linked to credible journalistic sources, including newspapers such as the National Post and the Globe and Mail whose editorial boards had backed the Conservatives in the previous election, and would do so in the fall of 2015.

The article quickly became one of The Tyee’s most read ever, and was one of the most widely read pieces by any news organization covering the federal election. After the contest was won by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, traffic for the article faded and it resided in The Tyee’s digital archives.

With another election coming, Trudeau and his party deny improper pressure was applied to former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in hopes of stopping a criminal trial of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Pilpott, who say the political interference was real, have resigned from cabinet. Trudeau’s top advisor Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick have quit their posts, as well.

After Wilson-Raybould gave testimony to the House justice committee on Feb. 27, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for an independent investigation into the affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was more aggressive, demanding that Trudeau step down.

Trudeau had “lost the moral authority to govern,” he charged, and was a “prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.”

Perhaps not coincidentally, that’s when The Tyee’s rap sheet on the last Conservative government began gaining a lot of new readers.

In the past month, the piece has received more than 14,000 page views, a near 2,000-per-cent jump over this time last year. Its numbers topped almost all other Tyee stories this month.

Who is suddenly reading and sharing the article and why?

It’s not hard to imagine why members of both the federal Liberals and NDP would find it apt to promote. The Liberals could point to the bad record of the Conservatives as evidence they were just as scandal-plagued when in power, or more so. The NDP might offer the piece to people souring on the Liberals as proof their party offers a cleaner alternative to the Tories.

Scheer was a Conservative MP throughout the Harper government, rising high in its ranks before becoming House speaker. He was first elected as a Saskatchewan MP in 2004, after accusing his opponent of being soft on child pornography because, in Commons debate, he’d warned against censoring art such as Nabokov’s novel Lolita.

A recent tweet by Tyee web director Bryan Carney noted the article has been popular of late.

The Quebec government will invoke the notwithstanding clause for its proposed law that will bar key provincial employees from wearing Muslim headscarves and other symbols of religious observance, a move aimed at pre-empting Charter challenges.

The bill, scheduled to be tabled on Thursday, will prevent workers in a “position of authority” from wearing religious symbols on the job. It will affect teachers and principals in public schools, judges and police officers as well as other provincial employees who carry guns on the job, said provincial sources who were granted anonymity to discuss the legislation.

It will allow current employees to continue wearing religious symbols at work while imposing the restrictions on new hires or those who change jobs, the sources added.

Story continues below advertisement

In the run-up to tabling the legislation, the government has indicated in recent weeks that it is open to eventually removing the crucifix in the National Assembly. A decision is expected to be made by MNAs after the new legislation is adopted.

Explainer: Legault Year One: How the CAQ has transformed Quebec so far

The notwithstanding clause, also known as Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is a seldom-used, controversial part of the Constitution that allows government legislation to override some parts of the Charter for up to five years at a time.

The last time it was used, in 2017, then-Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall invoked it to override a court ruling that would have removed funding for non-Catholic students attending Catholic schools.

Quebec governments of various stripes have used it over the years, but the last time it created a storm of controversy was in 1988, when premier Robert Bourassa used the measure to adopt a restrictive language law.

For its part, the federal government has never invoked the notwithstanding clause.

The religious symbols legislation is set to aggravate the continuing clash between the provincial government and Ottawa. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been vocal about protecting religious minorities throughout the country and limiting the use of the notwithstanding clause. The two governments have also been waging public battles on infrastructure spending and the possibility of allowing the Quebec revenue agency to collect federal income taxes.

Opinion: As Quebec tables religious symbol ban, the rest of Canada should stay zen

Nine lawyers – three of them university professors – have signed a letter warning the Quebec government that using the clause should be reserved for “exceptional” situations. By including it in the initial legislation, Quebec would pre-empt a legal challenge that allows opponents of the law to have their day in court, the lawyers argue.

Story continues below advertisement

“The rush to invoke the notwithstanding clause … indicates to some members of society that their rights aren’t important enough to have to justify limiting them,” the letter says.

Robert Leckey, dean of law at McGill University and a signatory of the letter, referred to the notwithstanding clause as the “nuclear weapon” of legislative options and said the Quebec government is resorting to it “because they believe that the law would not pass constitutional muster.""

“But I think there are reasons the law wouldn’t pass constitutional muster that the government should take very seriously,” he said. “I think there’s no valid objective and the means chosen are disproportionate and will harm some people without producing much of a benefit.”

However, Premier François Legault defended the use of the clause this week as a way of protecting Quebec’s identity.

“When you’re talking about protecting values, protecting our language, protecting what we have that is different in Quebec, you have to be ready to use it,” he told reporters on Tuesday, noting the need “to protect collective rights.""

Polls have shown the government has the support of a majority of Quebeckers to enact new legislation that would be in line with the recommendations of the 2008 Bouchard-Taylor Commission, which suggested limiting the wearing of religious symbols among specific classes of provincial employees.

Mr. Trudeau denounced the use of the notwithstanding clause when the Ontario government was set to use it last year in relation to changes to the municipal election process.

The Prime Minister has also frequently spoken out against proposed legislation in Quebec that would seek to determine what people – especially Muslim women – can and cannot wear.

The Conservative Party of Canada, on the other hand, has said it will respect the Quebec government’s right to enact legislation in its areas of jurisdiction.

Members of Mr. Legault’s Coalition Avenir Québec government have repeatedly used the will of the majority to justify their actions, but Prof. Leckey cautioned against overriding constitutional rights to satisfy the majority.

According to media reports, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of border security, is attempting to close a loophole in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).

The agreement allows Canada to send asylum-seekers back to the United States without hearing their refugee claims (and allows the U.S. the same option for those going in the other direction). The loophole is that the STCA only applies to asylum-seekers who present themselves at official land ports-of-entry.

Since President Donald Trump was elected, around 40,000 asylum seekers have used this loophole by crossing into Canada from the U.S. at places other than official ports-of-entry. They are not trying to sneak into Canada undetected. Rather, they cross the border irregularly to avoid being turned away under the STCA and then approach Canadian authorities to make refugee claims.

The number of irregular border-crossers has declined recently, with fewer than 1,000 in January 2019. What’s more, while the overall number of refugee claims made in Canada has been higher than usual in the past two years, it is not far off historical norms.

Nonetheless, the additional 40,000 refugee claims have produced pressures on the refugee determination system and on provincial social programs. There has also been political pushback, with calls from the Conservative party for the government to stem the flow.

However, closing the STCA loophole is a complicated proposition.

Blair reportedly wants irregular border-crossers to be taken to official ports-of-entry and processed as if they had presented themselves there directly. In other words, the STCA would apply both at official ports-of-entry and elsewhere.

To make this work, the U.S. would need to agree, which is the first complication.

More asylum-seekers come to Canada

The purpose of the STCA from a Canadian perspective was to force the U.S. to take responsibility for asylum-seekers who travel to Canada via the United States. Canada had long wanted the STCA because the flow of asylum-seekers is asymmetrical. Far more asylum-seekers come to Canada from the U.S. than the reverse.

For the same reason, the United States has long refused to agree to the STCA. That only changed after 9-11, when Canada offered the U.S. greater border security integration in exchange for the STCA.

Canada now wants to expand the STCA, so the question is: What will Canada have to give the U.S. to get them to agree?

One might expect quite a lot, given that Trump has shown little interest in taking steps that would result in thousands of asylum-seekers who would otherwise go to Canada remaining in the U.S.

The need for a quid pro quo raises a second complication. The STCA is being challenged in Canadian courts by human rights organizations who say that the U.S. is not safe for refugees and that the STCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Given the anti-refugee policies of the Trump administration, there is a good chance that courts will strike down the STCA. By negotiating expansions to the STCA without waiting to see whether the regime is upheld, there is a real risk that anything Canada gives to the U.S. in exchange will be for naught.

A third complication: Even if Canada gets the U.S. to agree to expand the STCA, and even if the regime is upheld by the courts, the impact of any expansion is likely to be both counterproductive and dangerous.

A dangerous incentive

If asylum-seekers who are intercepted at irregular border crossings are returned to the U.S., this will create a strong incentive for such asylum-seekers to cross the border without being intercepted.

Currently, irregular border crossings are manageable and organized. Most occur in a single, well-monitored location in Quebec. That crossing is not dangerous. Border officials and RCMP are present. Irregular border-crossers immediately enter into immigration and refugee processing, which includes health, criminality and security screening.

Other countries that have tried to stem flows of asylum-seekers by closing off safe and manageable routes have had a common experience. The flows do not stop but are instead diverted into more remote and hence more dangerous routes. Organized crime gets involved, bringing increased security risks and violence. The inevitable result is lost lives and decreased border security.

In the end, the political pressure on the government to be seen doing something on this file may outweigh these policy considerations. But politics lead to a fourth complication.

During the last federal election campaign, Justin Trudeau distinguished himself from former prime minister Stephen Harper partly through a more compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the death of Alan Kurdi — himself a tragic victim of cat-and-mouse games between smugglers and governments seeking to keep refugees at bay.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Prime Minister Trudeau further sought the moral high ground when, in response to the president’s anti-refugee policies, he famously tweeted Canadians will welcome those fleeing persecution.

There is no way to close the STCA loophole without the Liberal party turning its back on those progressive values, on the eve of a federal election campaign.

In this context, attempting to expand the STCA may not only be bad policy, it may also be bad politics.

Hundreds of Calgary marchers gathered Thursday evening in Marda Loop to support strong gay-straight alliances in Alberta schools.Amelia Newbert used a megaphone to decry the United Conservative Party’s education plan that could see educators report to parents their children’s involvement in GSAs.Newbert reminded the crowd that most gender and sexually diverse students do not have a single adult in their life who they’re able to talk to about identity.“So what is their lifeline? Their peers. And where are their peers? They’re in GSAs at school,” said Newbert.The UCP’s education plan rolls back protections made in Bill 24 , which prevented schools from telling parents that their children had joined a GSA.Myles Nahal, who shared his personal story at the march, says GSAs saved his life.“Without it, I can strongly say I probably would not have finished high school and would definitely not be in university. So GSA’s definitely have helped me become the person I am today.”He added it is never the job of a parent or educator to out a student.“Only we know when it is safe to come out,” he said.Andrew Clapperton says it’s critical that children can feel confident that they’re speaking to teachers who won’t out them.“I’m a parent. I’m a teacher. And I’m a gay man. So, it’s an issue that strikes me right in the heart.”Clapperton said he hopes UCP candidates will reconsider their party’s position.“This is an issue about the safety of our kids, but it’s also an issue about the integrity of the party that you’re voting for. Do you really want to be involved in a party that has this view that human rights are something that can be taken away, and I would say, ‘no.’”Greg Clark, MLA and Alberta Party candidate in Calgary-Elbow, attended the rally and said he’s frustrated.“In the Alberta Party we know, it is absolutely possible to build pipelines, create jobs, balance a budget, and respect LGBTQ2+ rights, it’s not an either-or proposition.”The UCP’s Doug Schweitzer didn’t participate in the march, which concluded in front of his office. He released a statement on Twitter stating: “I am committed alongside my colleagues, to ensuring that Alberta has the strongest legal protection for gay-straight alliances in Canada. We will continue to listen to Albertans and act in the best interests of all our children.”He also wrote that all major political parties “categorically reject mandatory notification of parents.” While rolled back legislation doesn’t require parental notification, it doesn’t stop educators from informing parents of their children’s involvement.Editor: Rayane Sabbagh |",Hundreds join in Calgary GSA march in support of LGBTQ2+ youth,The Calgary Journal,https://www.calgaryjournal.ca/news/4575-hundreds-join-in-calgary-gsa-march-in-support-of-lgbtq2-youth.html

But there are rules and one of the more important rules here (and most everywhere in the country) is that you confine your politics to your own jurisdiction.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe crossed that line this week in a tweet directed at Alberta voters urging them to unite behind one conservative party to defeat NDP Premier Rachel Notley.

“Dear Albertans, Prior to the formation of @SaskParty 20 years ago, our province was the example of what dividing the free enterprise movement will do: electing NDP governments, over and over again. United we win, divided we lose,” Moe tweeted.

Moe is supposed to be the premier for everyone in Saskatchewan. And he is addressing Albertans?

Essentially, Moe is engaging in the online equivalent of physically knocking on doors for Jason Kenney and Alberta’s United Conservative Party.

Why would he or others around him not get that there may be a problem here?

Sure, Moe has the right to his personal views and stating them in public likely surprises no one. Sure, it’s common to hear barbs thrown across the floor of the Assembly after the election in another province.

But there’s a reason why you have never seen other Saskatchewan premiers like Brad Wall or Lorne Calvert or Roy Romanow or Grant Devine campaigning for another province while in office. Unlike Moe, they were cognizant of their duties, responsibilities and who elected them.

You weren’t elected by anyone in Alberta. You don’t represent “the free enterprise movement.” Nowhere in your job description does it state that it’s your role to prevent “electing NDP governments.” Your job is not to hurry Rachel Notley along to her political demise, which seems an inevitability, anyway.

Good heavens. Can anyone imagine what Scott Moe would be saying if Rachel Notley started campaigning for Ryan Meili? Golden rule here.

Consider how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was rightly crucified for doing the same thing by stumping for then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne. So Moe is now following Trudeau’s lead? How’d that work out for either Wynne or Trudeau?

Mostly, though, you don’t do it because it’s bad for business.

It’s bad when you go to Conference of Confederation meetings and you have to stand shoulder to shoulder with Alberta’s premier — regardless of who that is — to fight for critical regional issues like pipelines. What would happen if Saskatchewan did have an NDP premier and Jason Kenney decided he couldn’t work with the NDP on pipelines? Would Saskatchewan be right to be miffed?

It’s bad the next time Saskatchewan has to go to a western premiers’ conference to talk about the New West Partnership or to talk about stocking Saskatchewan beer in Alberta or even barring Alberta licence plates at Saskatchewan work sites. (Sadly, the latter seems to have been a largely mythical issue that likely did arise over the Sask. Party government’s need to pick a fight with Alberta over something.)

It’s really bad because it represents a mindset of partisanship taking precedent over what’s good for the province. If Moe needs any reminding how problematic this is, he may want to recognize he’s complaining we don’t have a good equalization formula after Wall and his government abandoned pursuit of the equalization formula everyone in this province really wanted so as not to embarrass former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper for what amounted to an unworkable national promise.

But worst of all, it can only heighten the nastiness because voters see it as one more thing that was once unacceptable now becoming acceptable.

We witnessed elected Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities delegates screaming “traitor” at 40-year-elected MP Ralph Goodale. We heard at SARM mindless rants about separation and shipping the socialists to Venezuela.

Is Moe or anyone else thinking about whether this helps political discourse in Saskatchewan? Wouldn’t we be better off to tone down the animosity and rhetoric?

So if the economy is your major ...","He’s the same old Stephen Mandel, in other words the sharpest, funniest, most plain-spoken politician I’ve ever met.

But now Mandel is in tough. He’s leading an Alberta Party in a provincial election where opposing leaders Jason Kenney and Rachel Notley get almost all the attention.

That doesn’t mean, however, that Mandel and his centrist party can’t steal a few seats. It certainly doesn’t mean Mandel doesn’t have important things to say on the economy.

This includes scathing critiques of his political opponents, starting with Rachel Notley’s NDP. “The NDP has never met a private sector job they couldn’t scare off,” Mandel says. “When Alberta needed a shot in the arm, the NDP made a bad situation worse by creating uncertainty and enacting job-killing policies and tax hikes.”

Notley and her ministers have not even been open to meeting with many business leaders, Mandel says. “You can’t get into see them.”

The NDP has focused on pleasing big business, like the huge oilsands companies, while failing to deal with small-business concerns. The Alberta Party promises to double the small-business deduction to $1,000,000 per year. Another promise is to cut the corporate tax rate from 12 to 10 per cent.

The Alberta Party would also axe the NDP’s carbon tax, except on heavy emitters. Mandel says the current tax, which gives two-thirds of people a full rebate on everything they pay, is strictly a wealth transfer. “The people with money, they are the ones that are told to solve all the problems.”

Then there’s the NDP’s instinct to have government own and run numerous businesses, Mandel says. “They got their hands into every business.”

Consistency has been lacking under the NDP, with the rules for doing business changing too much, which has led investors to go elsewhere, Mandel says. “Businesses are very frustrated. They don’t see this as a place of the future.”

When it comes to balancing the ballooning budget, Mandel says the Alberta Party would move slowly to avoid pushing the province into recession. “It’s important to do it in a reasonable manner but we also have to come up with a plan to deal with the huge debt we have.”

The Alberta Party wants to bolster the petrochemical industry and would have a 10-year program where petrochemical producers get free feedstock gas from the government if they’ll build plants and produce higher-value products here. Industrial zones will be set up where the permitting process is simplified and sped up.

As for the proposed Trudeau legislation, C-48, to ban oilsands shipments off the northwest B.C. coast, Mandel says, “It’s some of the biggest boondoggle bullshit that Alberta has ever had to face. C-48 is a bunch of crap. … They’ve effectively cut off our ability to export oil except to the States. … That is one of the most destructive things they can do. It says to Alberta, ‘We don’t want you.’ And that’s a scary thing.”

As for Bill C-69, the proposed federal plan for the environmental assessment of major projects like pipelines, Mandel says it’s poorly conceived, giving too much power to the Environment Minister and with too many crazy clauses for businesses to navigate to proceed with a project. “You wonder why they’re not going to invest in Alberta, or in Saskatchewan, or in Canada. It’s just going to tell people, ‘Don’t come here.’ ”

The Canadian dollar is under 75 cents, Mandel points out. “Why? Because nobody has any confidence in our federal government’s economy.”

Mandel says the government should take action against the U.S.-funded campaign of Canadian green and social justice groups which aims to landlock Alberta oil. “I think it’s unreasonable, it’s unfair and I’d go after them. Why are you in our country? Who the hell are you? Go down to California with their pollution. Go to your coal plants.”

I point out to Mandel that his strong free enterprise approach is somewhat similar to what we hear from the United Conservative Party.

So if the economy is your major issue, why vote Alberta Party over UCP?

Mandel says that as a longtime businessman, he has business experience, while Jason Kenney has only been in government.

And for voters leery about the social conservatism of the UCP, Mandel says of his party, “We’re socially progressive but we’re also business people. … We believe deeply in entrepreneurship and free enterprise.”

So where does this leave us? I’m happy to endorse Mandel himself and his party’s business plan. But it’s an election, so you have to make up your own mind.","David Staples: NDP policy means businesses don't see Alberta as place of the future, Mandel says",Edmonton Journal,https://edmontonjournal.com/business/local-business/david-staples-ndp-policy-means-businesses-dont-see-alberta-as-place-of-the-future-mandel-says

B.C.'s John Horgan finds himself among Canada's most popular premiers, according to a new poll.

The poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute has Horgan sitting in the third most popular position behind Quebec Premier François Legault and Saskatchewan's, Scott Moe.

British Columbia Premier John Horgan received the approval of more than half of B.C., earning the backing of 52 per cent of B.C. residents. Thats an increase of 9 percentage points since December, when four-in-ten or 43 per cent approved of his performance. The current number ties Horgan’s highest mark as premier, which was set in March 2018.

Most premiers have seen their standing among their own constituencies improve – or at least hold – since December. The two exceptions are Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s approval drops four points this quarter to 38 per cent.

Alberta’s Rachel Notley, currently seeking a second term as Alberta premier, faces long odds ahead of the April 16 election day. Recent polls, including one released by the Angus Reid Institute, have consistently pointed to a substantial lead for the opposition United Conservative Party.

137,Canada,2019-03-26T23:12:00.0000000Z,"OTTAWA — Jody Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge to be ... who has touted the Liberals as ""the party of the charter"" and whose late father, Pierre Trudeau, spearheaded the drive ...","Her retirement meant the government would have to choose a new chief justice and find another bilingual judge from western or northern Canada to sit on the nine-member bench.

Trudeau created an independent, non-partisan advisory board, headed by former Conservative prime minister Kim Campbell, to identify qualified candidates to fill the western/northern vacancy and submit a short list of three to five names for consideration.

According to the sources, one of the names on the eventual list was Glenn Joyal, who had been appointed in 2011 by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper as chief justice of Manitoba's Court of Queen's Bench.

Wilson-Raybould then sent Trudeau a 60-plus-page memo arguing that Joyal should not only be added to the top court but should be named chief justice as well.

Only once before in Canadian history — in 1906, when Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed his justice minister to the top judicial job — has a prime minister chosen a chief justice who was not already sitting on the Supreme Court.

Wilson-Raybould's pick puzzled Trudeau but he became disturbed after doing some research into Joyal's views on the charter, the sources said.

Joyal had criticized the judiciary for broadly interpreting charter rights and expanding them to apply to things not explicitly mentioned in the charter or, in his view, intended by provincial premiers when they agreed to enshrine a charter in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court's liberal interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage, the right of women to choose to have an abortion and the legalization of medical assistance in dying, among other things — developments Trudeau has celebrated.

In a January 2017 speech to the Canadian Constitution Foundation's Law and Freedom Conference, Joyal echoed conservative arguments that the top court has usurped the supremacy of elected legislatures to determine social policy.

The charter, Joyal argued, was the result of a compromise between Pierre Trudeau and premiers, most of whom had originally opposed inclusion of a charter in the Constitution. The compromise was intended to maintain a balance between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government, with provisions allowing governments to limit or override rights altogether in some circumstances.

Since then, judicial interpretation of the charter has ignored the intentions of the drafters and ""led without question to a level of judicial potency that was not anticipated back in 1982,"" Joyal said in the speech, a video of which is available on the foundation's website. That, in turn, has resulted in a ""less potent and less influential legislative branch that seldom has the final word.""

""With the 'constitutionalizing' of more and more political and social issues into fundamental rights, the Canadian judiciary has all but removed those issues, in a fairly permanent way, from the realm of future civic engagement and future political debate,"" he said.

Joyal was particularly critical of the Supreme Court's interpretation of section 7 of the charter — the section which guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the person and under which the top court struck down Canada's abortion law and the prohibition on medically assisted death.

The court's liberal interpretation of that section ""has become, particularly in recent years, the single most fertile source for the discovery of new rights and the de facto constitutionalization of political and social issues,"" he said.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould's advice. He ended up appointing Sheila Martin, a judge on the appeal courts of Alberta, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, to fill the vacant western Canadian seat on the bench. Sitting Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner was elevated to the role of chief justice.

Wilson-Raybould's advocacy of Joyal for the top judicial job may not come as a total surprise to some Liberals, who've privately noted what they consider her conservative, restrictive approach to charter rights in a number of bills, including those dealing with assisted dying, impaired driving and genetic discrimination.

Jane Philpott, as health minister at the time, was jointly responsible with Wilson-Raybould for the assisted dying legislation. She quit the cabinet earlier this month in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould, saying she no longer had confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.",Sources say Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s conservative pick for high court,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9239542-sources-say-trudeau-rejected-wilson-raybould-s-conservative-pick-for-high-court/

He says he saw how the current economic climate gripping the province left 100,000 out of work.

So, when his friend Mark Grinder approached him about the Alberta Independence Party, he decided to get involved.

“Mark was involved with the Alberta Independence Party for a while, and thought I would be open to their platform. I did my research, and liked what they were presenting.”

Keller will run for the party in the Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo riding.

It’s his first time running for office, but the 23-year resident and heavy-duty technician believes his party’s platform is ideal for the region.

“Lower taxes, individually as well as corporate. Our platform is eight and half per cent corporate tax for Alberta companies, and personal tax is 20 per cent flat tax.”

Why “Independence”?

Keller admits the Alberta Independence Party raises eyebrows.

Some argue not voting for the Alberta NDP or United Conservative Party would “split the vote”.

He is more than happy to explain to prospective voters why they should a vote for the Alberta Independence Party.

“We’re looking at the people, who [are] not necessarily are strongly affiliated with another political party, and are open to new suggestions, new ideas. Independence: It’s something new, but unfortunately that’s the only way that we can get things turned around in Alberta.”

Keller adds a vote for Independence is a vote against the federal government.

He believes Ottawa turned their back on the province citing the growing debt and equalization payments.

“It’s not just the oil and gas industry, everybody’s hurting. The federal government doesn’t really seem to care that 100,000 or more [are] out of work. That has spin-off effects with restaurants, clothing stores, and grocery stores.”

What Keller and the Alberta Independence Party would like to see are the three pipelines going to international markets.

Currently, Keller argues Canada fell behind as changes to oil production and shipping by IMO 2020 may render Trans Mountain obsolete.

“In 2020, the Burnaby port is going to be obsolete, so this whole idea of the pipeline going to Burnaby is under false pretences. Canadian taxpayers are going to be paying five billion dollars for nothing.”

""On the big things that will reduce our climate pollution, allow Canada to fulfil its role under the Paris agreement and show the poorer countries of the world that are suffering ...","

Allison Jones, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Ontario's environmental commissioner issued dire warnings Wednesday about the ""frightening"" state of climate policy in the province as she delivered her office's last report.

The Progressive Conservative government announced last fall that it was eliminating the office of the environmental commissioner and merging its functions with the auditor general. In delivering a report on energy conservation, Dianne Saxe said Ontario is heading in the wrong direction on the environment.

""At a time when climate damage is accelerating, Ontario is turning away from the things that we know work,"" she said, describing the government's climate policy as ""very inadequate, very frightening.""

""On the big things that will reduce our climate pollution, allow Canada to fulfil its role under the Paris agreement and show the poorer countries of the world that are suffering the greater damage that we are going to do our part, we are causing great damage.""

Saxe is critical of the government's cancellation of a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gases, as well as the cancellation of electricity conservation programs and a growth plan that she says increases urban sprawl and therefore reliance on transportation fuels.

""I think that what we're doing in Ontario and what we may do in Canada this year puts the entire Paris Agreement at risk,"" she said, referring to the federal Conservatives' opposition to the upcoming carbon tax.

""If the world can't hold together on the Paris Agreement we are toasted, roasted and grilled.""

The 2015 Paris Agreement sets a target of keeping average global temperatures from rising by more than 2 C, or 1.5 C if possible.

Saxe was critical of the government's recent cancellation of a slew of electricity conservation programs, including rebates for energy-efficient heating and cooling equipment, discounts for buying energy-efficient products such as LED light bulbs, incentives for builders to improve energy performance in new residences, and refrigeration equipment upgrade incentives.

Since 2007, Ontario has made valuable progress in conserving electricity and some progress in conserving natural gas, and without those programs the province would be emitting about six megatonnes more each year in carbon dioxide equivalents, she said.

The government's environment plan doesn't even mention electricity conservation, Saxe said, and abandoning it would increase greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by about two megatonnes.

Environment Minister Rod Phillips said his climate plan will produce a 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the target set by the federal government, without a carbon tax -- which the province continues to rail against.

Phillips said the plan focuses conservation efforts on natural gas instead of electricity.

""We're adding conservation programs around areas that actually produce greenhouse gases, like natural gas production,"" he said. ""The conservation programs related to electricity largely are affecting programs that come from our electricity grid, which because of nuclear power, because of renewables, because of hydro, doesn't produce a great deal of greenhouse gas.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said reports and comments like the ones Wednesday from the environmental commissioner are why the government got rid of Saxe's office.

""They don't want to hear what it takes and what's necessary to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets,"" she said. ""Instead, they just want to continue along their merry way and not take seriously our responsibilities when it comes to climate change.""

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner called it a ""tragic loss"" to no longer have a standalone officer to report on facts and evidence that members of the legislature need to make sound policy decisions.

Premier Doug Ford had promised that not a single job would be lost under his government, but Saxe said this move has meant 12 people are losing their jobs.","State of Ontario's climate policy is 'frightening,' watchdog says",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/state-of-ontario-s-climate-policy-is-frightening-watchdog-says-1.4354564

Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

When Donald Trump was elected in 2016, many of us Canadians wagged our fingers smugly at our southern neighbour. “What were they thinking?” we said to one another in line at Tim Hortons. We spent the next year or so glued to CNN, more captivated by American politics than what’s happening here.

We might have wanted to pay more attention.

The tide in the Great White North appears to be shifting right — but not in the way we’re used to. This isn’t a typical liberal-conservative tug-o-war, the ebb and flow we’ve seen throughout election cycles. This new movement is one that has already swept through Hungary, Poland, the U.S., it’s fuelled Brexit in the U.K. and has seen the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, who have been compared to the Nazi regime. And it’s tilted so far to the right that it threatens to upend our democracy and the very liberties we’ve fought for.

While conservatives have historically called for less government regulation, lower taxes and a stronger military, today’s Canadian right-wing politics has rebranded itself to include more visible intolerance. Bigotry isn’t just bubbling under the surface these days, it’s out in the open and proudly displayed for when the guests come over.

This ugly, newfound boldness threatens to dominate the next federal election, impacting not only the world’s view of us a fair, diverse and welcoming country, but also the lives of all marginalized Canadians. That keeps me up at night.

As a gay mother with a trans child in the Ontario school system, and as a human rights advocate who spends a lot of time on social media, I’m on the receiving end of a lot of messages from people who think it’s “about time” politicians start standing up to “special interest groups.” We’ve been coddled for too long, they say, and we don’t deserve special treatment. They mock, namecall and outright threaten those of us who fight for the rights of marginalized people to be preserved. They’ve always done this, of course, but their voices, now embolded by the very politicians and public figures they support, are growing in number and getting angrier. I’ve had to file two police reports after my life was threatened — and those are only the incidents I reported.



This swing to the populist right is both in our face and insidious. Donald Trump might be loud and brash, but his win was unexpected by most. We surveyed the damage from up north, thinking it couldn’t possibly happen here. Surely, Canadians know better. We didn’t.

Modern populism has grown quietly, from the pages of right-wing websites to the birth of new neo-fascist groups such as the Proud Boys, now designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Support for the populism movement gained traction through one protest, one meeting, and one tweet at a time. Now it’s loud and it’s everywhere. It unseated Premier Kathleen Wynne and her Ontario government, with Premier Doug Ford and the Conservatives promising little more than a buck-a-beer and the end of teaching gender identity in schools.

And then, in October 2018, Premier Ford met privately with university professor Jordan Peterson. While the premier openly discussed other meetings that had taken place around that time, the public only learned of this one after the CBC obtained his itinerary through a freedom of information request.

Wildly popular in some right-wing circles, Peterson’s views have been slammed as retrograde, problematic and dangerous. He became well-known after taking a stand against using trans people’s chosen pronouns, claiming being forced to do so is an attack on free speech. He argued vehemently against the federal Liberal government’s now-passed trans rights bill, speaking in front of the senate committee overseeing the bill, and warned his followers about the dangers of “compelled speech.” Peterson has also proposed “enforced monogamy” as a way to reduce male violence and believes “crazy women” can’t be controlled by men because men can’t resort to physical violence against them.

Despite, or, perhaps, because of these views, Peterson, who teaches at the University of Toronto, earns tens of thousands of dollars monthly from his Patreon account, a site where fans can pledge financial support to creators of all stripes. These donations are given to him by admirers, many of them Canadians.

Ford, meanwhile, campaigned heavily on the removal of Ontario’s most current incarnation of the sex-ed curriculum, and followed through — a move that has earned much criticism and more than one lawsuit. However, it was also, in part, what earned his party a majority government. A slew of Ontarians has proudly come out in support of Ford’s policies, including the removal of mandatory student funding for certain college and university services, such as pride centres.

A week before meeting with Premier Ford, Peterson had spoken out in a tweet against the Ontario Human Rights Commission, claiming it to be the most “dangerous” organization in Canada, and calling for the Ford government to abolish it. Peterson has previously said he doesn’t agree with the OHRC’s support of gender identity and gender expression. The OHRC had just joined the legal fight against the Ontario provincial government’s removal of the sex-ed curriculum, which covered LGBTQ+ issues, consent and cyber-bullying.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission does exactly what the name implies: using the Ontario Human Rights Code as its guide, it strives to protect all Ontarians from discrimination and harassment. Those who are fiscally-minded might also appreciate how the OHRC first tries to resolve issues between parties out of court, taking the less-expensive mediation approach. It is not the country’s most dangerous organization, but its dismantling could certainly be very dangerous.

The timing of this secret meeting should ring alarm bells for liberals and conservatives alike. Protecting human rights is, after all, supposed to be a closely-held Canadian value.

Trump’s 2016 victory was a dog whistle for bigotry that reached the ears of Canadians. Doug Ford has proven Ontario will welcome similar politics, while Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, a federal right-wing party formed in 2018, has over 30,000 members and a social media presence that speaks out against “political correctness” and “diversity nonsense.”

Taking a page from the Yellow Vest movement in France, the Facebook group “Yellow Vests Canada” has more than 100,000 members. What began as a place to organize protests around the country quickly became a spot where anti-Liberal sentiments and memes are circulated around the clock, several going so far as to call for the Prime Minister’s death. Immigration is regularly condemned, and Islamophobia is dismissed as a made-up word.

While some of the most offensive posts have been removed over recent weeks, the views are still crystal clear. This group isn’t just anti-tax and pro-oil, it’s filled to the brim with intolerance. This message is consistent throughout provincial groups as well, such as BC Proud, Alberta Proud and Ontario Proud. With a combined total of hundreds of thousands of members in these groups, cries of fake news and the danger of refugees abound.

These sentiments don’t just live online.

Statistics Canada reported hate crimes had reached historically high levels in 2017, rising 47 per cent over the previous year, with Ontario and Quebec leading the pack on reported incidents. Black, Jewish and Muslim people were targeted most. Quebec saw a 50 per cent increase in hate crimes overall, and crimes against Muslims tripled between 2016 and 2017. In January of 2017, a shooter killed six men and injured several others in a Quebec City Mosque. Meanwhile, Ontario saw a 207 per cent increase in hate crimes against Muslims, and an 84 per cent increase against Black people. Crimes against LGBTQ+ people have also climbed. Swastikas have been spray painted on synagogues and other buildings across the country. Intolerance is growing.

Populism has many sources. Perhaps there are people who are tired of looking inward and are now lashing outward. Maybe, for some, it’s simpler to blame immigrants when they can’t find work than the companies who cut minimum wage jobs and still pay their executives millions in bonuses. Maybe it’s easier to find a scapegoat, to call someone like me a child abuser for supporting my transgender teen, than it is to grow and broaden our ideas of what’s normal.

Societal change can be hard and it can make people uncomfortable, but that’s a flimsy excuse for discrimination.

Intolerance has never gone away, it was simply out of fashion for a while. Now it’s back with a fresh new look and a boost from fake news and social media.

We should all care deeply about this frightening political shift and where it could take us.

I know I care, which is why I’m so scared about what’s happening in this country, and what’s yet to come.

THE CANADIAN PRESS

OTTAWA-Jody Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge to be chief justice of the Supreme Court, even though he wasn’t a sitting member of the top court and had been a vocal critic of its activism on Charter of Rights issues, The Canadian Press has learned.

Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of “significant disagreement’’ with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as “the party of the charter’’ and whose late father, Pierre Trudeau, spearheaded the drive to enshrine the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution in 1982.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment, which are typically considered highly confidential.

For her part, Wilson-Raybould said Monday “there was no conflict between the PM and myself.’’

In an email, she characterized the matter as part of the normal process of appointing a Supreme Court justice, which involves “typically CONFIDENTIAL conversations and communications, back and forths between the PM and the AG (attorney general) on potential candidates for appointment.’’

She said she’s “not at liberty to comment’’ on the “veracity’’ of what the sources said occurred, adding, “Commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.’’

The issue suggests Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious Justice portfolio earlier this year, a cabinet shuffle that touched off a full-blown political crisis for the governing Liberals.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya.

Trudeau has denied the SNC matter had anything to do with the decision.

She resigned a month later amid allegations she was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin case, triggering a furor that has engulfed the Trudeau government ever since.

The issue, the sources say, arose after Beverley McLachlin announced in June 2017 her decision to retire that December after 28 years on the high court,

including 17 as chief justice.

Her retirement meant the government would have to choose a new chief justice

and find another bilingual judge from western or northern Canada to sit on the nine-member bench.

Trudeau created an independent, non-partisan advisory board, headed by former Conservative prime minister Kim Campbell, to identify qualified candidates to fill the western/northern vacancy and submit a short list of three to five names for consideration.

According to the sources, one of the names on the eventual list was Glenn Joyal, who had been appointed in 2011 by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper as chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench.

Wilson-Raybould then sent Trudeau a 60-plus-page memo arguing that Joyal should not only be added to the top court but should be named chief justice as well.

Only once before in Canadian history, in 1906, when Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed his justice minister to the top judicial job, has a prime minister chosen a chief justice who was not already sitting on the Supreme Court.

Wilson-Raybould’s pick puzzled Trudeau but he became disturbed after doing some research into Joyal’s views on the charter, the sources said.

Joyal had criticized the judiciary for broadly interpreting charter rights and expanding them to apply to things not explicitly mentioned in the charter or, in his view, intended by provincial premiers when they agreed to enshrine a charter in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court’s liberal interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage, the right of women to choose to have an abortion and the

legalization of medical assistance in dying, among other things ? – developments Trudeau has celebrated.

In a January 2017 speech to the Canadian Constitution Foundation’s Law and

Freedom Conference, Joyal echoed conservative arguments that the top court has

usurped the supremacy of elected legislatures to determine social policy.

The charter, Joyal argued, was the result of a compromise between Pierre

Trudeau and premiers, most of whom had originally opposed inclusion of a

charter in the Constitution. The compromise was intended to maintain a balance

between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government, with

provisions allowing governments to limit or override rights altogether in some

circumstances.

Since then, judicial interpretation of the charter has ignored the intentions

of the drafters and “led without question to a level of judicial potency that

was not anticipated back in 1982,’’ Joyal said in the speech, a video of which

is available on the foundation’s website. That, in turn, has resulted in a

“less potent and less influential legislative branch that seldom has the

final word.’’

“With the ‘constitutionalizing’ of more and more political and social issues

into fundamental rights, the Canadian judiciary has all but removed those

issues, in a fairly permanent way, from the realm of future civic engagement

and future political debate,’’ he said.

Joyal was particularly critical of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of

section 7 of the charter ?_ the section which guarantees everyone the right to

life, liberty and security of the person and under which the top court struck

down Canada’s abortion law and the prohibition on medically assisted death.

The court’s liberal interpretation of that section “has become, particularly

in recent years, the single most fertile source for the discovery of new

rights and the de facto constitutionalization of political and social

issues,’’ he said.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s advice. He ended up appointing Sheila

Martin, a judge on the appeal courts of Alberta, Northwest Territories and

Nunavut, to fill the vacant western Canadian seat on the bench. Sitting

Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner was elevated to the role of chief

justice.

Wilson-Raybould’s advocacy of Joyal for the top judicial job may not come as a

total surprise to some Liberals, who’ve privately noted what they consider her

conservative, restrictive approach to charter rights in a number of bills,

including those dealing with assisted dying, impaired driving and genetic

discrimination.

Jane Philpott, as health minister at the time, was jointly responsible with

Wilson-Raybould for the assisted dying legislation.

She quit the cabinet earlier this month in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould,

saying she no longer had confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-

Lavalin affair.

MICHAEL CHAHLEY/THE VARSITY

Content warning: descriptions of sexual violence.

A high number of reported sexual harassment, non-consensual sexual experiences, and lack of knowledge around university support systems were sobering highlights from the results of a sexual violence survey released on March 19 by the provincial government.

The Student Voices on Sexual Violence Survey was sent to over 746,000 full-time students in Ontario from February to March 2018 by the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development, now the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (TCU).

The ministry had come under fire for the delay in releasing results, following reporting by The Varsity and the Queen’s Journal, Queen’s University’s student newspaper.

TCU Minister Merrilee Fullerton acknowledged that the released results were not comprehensive because the government needed to “protect the privacy of the survey participants.” She said that the ministry will be consulting Ontario’s Information & Privacy Commissioner Brian Beamish “on the release of additional survey results.”

In response to the released results, Fullerton announced that the provincial government plans to double investment in the Women’s Campus Safety Grant this year to $6 million. The annual grant funds campus initiatives including public education, drafting policy to prevent sexual violence, and improving security systems at universities.

The government will also require all publicly-assisted colleges and universities to review their sexual violence policies by September, create task forces to address sexual violence on campus, and draft an annual reports to their board of governors about measures taken in response to sexual violence on campus.

Survey results

A 37-page report summarizes the survey, which was administered by CCI Research Inc. and includes responses from 117,148 full-time university students of 441,499 invited, among other categories.

The report warns against interpretations of smaller data sets and comparing data between institutions; due to the voluntary nature of the report, each institution had a differing number of respondents.

Of 104,238 responses to five questions about knowledge of sexual violence supports at U of T, 61.7 per cent reported that they did not understand how to access supports related to sexual violence and did not understand the wider process for reporting incidents of sexual violence.

Out of 3,514 responses to eight questions, 42.4 per cent reported dissatisfaction with the U of T’s institutional response to sexual violence, which includes believing survivors of sexual violence and creating an environment where sexual violence is recognized as a problem.

In U of T students’ perception of consent, 89.6 per cent of 146,068 responses to seven questions demonstrated an understanding of consent as: revocable at any time, not measured by physical resistance, and required even when affected by decision-altering substances, among others — the remaining responses either took a neutral stance or disagreed with the above definitions.

U of T also had a high proportion of students who reported witnessing sexual violence including physical or verbal abuse, helping someone who was intoxicated, or informing university officials.

68.7 per cent of respondents reported being witnesses, with 67.3 per cent of those saying that they intervened in situations when incidents of sexual violence were witnessed.

4,628 respondents from U of T reported experiences of stalking and 12,293 reported instances of sexual harassment, including discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation and online and physical harassment.

3,602 out of 20,942 U of T students reported non-consensual sexual experiences, part of the 26,824 students from the broader university sector who reported instances of non-consensual sexual experiences.

New Democratic Party criticizes funding as insufficient

In response to a question asked during a press conference on the topic about whether the survey’s results warrant “greater action” than her announcements today, Fullerton said that the government’s plans are an “immediate response to an issue that has only just been reported back to [them],” but did not give further specifics about future plans.

Suze Morrison, a New Democratic Party MPP and the official opposition critic for women’s issues, lambasted the funding increase to the Women’s Campus Safety Grant as insufficient. She said that if the Ontario government was “serious about addressing the underlying systemic issues of… gender-based and sexual violence,” it would deliver on “promised funding to rape crisis centres across Ontario.”

The previous Liberal government had promised $14.8 million over three years to these centres as part of its gender-based violence strategy, but the current Progressive Conservative government has suspended plans for this funding.

Council of Ontario Universities welcomes data, U of T hopes to expand outreach

Sandy Welsh, leader of the Council of Ontario Universities’ Reference Group on Sexual Violence and Vice-Provost Students at U of T, was asked by The Varsity if her group would conduct follow-up or recurring surveys on sexual violence. Welsh deferred to the ministry, saying, “I cannot speak for what the ministry may do. I think it’s an important survey. We’re glad to have these results and look forward to any discussions in the future about other ways to survey.”

U of T Sexual Violence Prevention & Support Centre Director Angela Treglia spoke to The Varsity on the low proportion of students who felt that they understood the process for reporting instances of sexual violence.

“We have work to do to build and develop the awareness of the services that are available to people who’ve been affected by sexual violence on our campuses,” Treglia said. “We know and we want to get it right.”

The centre is a recent tri-campus development, having opened in 2017 with Treglia’s appointment as director. According the Treglia, the centre has held 200 workshops, reaching 8,000 participants at U of T, and continues to develop a system for supporting students so that “they have a place that they can go for confidential support and know that they’re not alone.”

On whether the initiatives announced by the ministry would be helpful to the centre, Treglia declined to comment. Treglia later went on to say that “we are striving and committed to creating a culture of care and a culture of consent on our campus.”

Conservative whites “who dislike diversity ...","“How are the Gulf Islands being changed by global migration patterns?”

That was the title for a talk I was to give on the Gulf Islands, after a library committee asked me to hop on the ferry and meet some of those whose homes are surrounded by the Salish Sea.

Gulf Island organizers of the talk tacked up small posters about it at their community centres, their (often-organic) grocery stores and (vegetarian) cafes.

But there was a misunderstanding. Many locals assumed, since the notices said there was to be a presentation about “global migration patterns,” I was going to talk about … birds.

It turns out bird migration may be more germane to nature-loving, kayak-paddling Gulf Islanders than the trans-national migration of humans, a phenomenon that is a key issue in Metro Vancouver but far less noticeable on the islands.

Unlike Metro Vancouver, where the population is almost half foreign-born, the demographic reality is vividly different just a short B.C. Ferries ride away from the big, bustling city.

The number of foreign-born residents who have made a home in the past two decades on the Southern Gulf Islands is just two per cent. And, unlike Metro Vancouver where the 2016 census shows whites comprise about 49 per cent of residents, the proportion of people of European origin on the Southern Gulf Islands is a notable 97 per cent.

You don’t have to be a demographer to recognize something happens when you join passengers on a ferry to the Southern Gulf Islands, Sunshine Coast, Northern Gulf Islands, or, to a slightly lesser extent, Vancouver Island. The ferry’s population suddenly turns quite European in origin.

It’s part of a long-term trend, according to Statistics Canada. More than 85 per cent of immigrants to B.C., most of whom are Asians or other people of colour, move to Metro Vancouver.

At the same time, roughly 9,000 whites and Aboriginals each year depart Metro Vancouver for different parts of B.C., especially towns on the southwest coast.

Let’s take the Southern Gulf Islands as an illustration. The region of rocky beaches and forest (comprising Saltspring, Galiano, Mayne, Pender and Saturna) provides a graphic example of the urban-rural split in regards to ethno-cultural enclaves.

While large sections of Richmond are more than two-thirds ethnic Chinese, and the core of north Surrey is more than two-thirds South Asian, more than nine of 10 of the 4,660 permanent residents of the Southern Gulf Islands are of English, Scottish or Irish descent.

The total visible minority population of the Southern Gulf Islands is only 143 people. The biggest minority cohort is Japanese, followed by Chinese and Latin Americans. And most of them settled several decades ago, if not earlier. Strikingly, the census shows no South Asians make a home on the Southern Gulf Islands.

The Indigenous proportion of the Southern Gulf Islands, meanwhile, is about five per cent, almost as high as the B.C. average. However, none of those speak an Aboriginal language. That is unlike the 195 who have German, Dutch or Danish as a second language.

The strong European roots of the Southern Gulf Islands — where the vast majority of immigrants came, before 1980, from Britain or the United States — has cultural and even political implications.

Voters on the Southern Gulf Islands have recently, for instance, sent a Green party candidate to both Ottawa and Victoria. That unique achievement reflects a Mainstreet poll that suggests B.C. whites are far more inclined to vote for the Green party than people of colour.

The shift to ethnic enclaves is likely to continue across B.C. Similar to human movements in Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and elsewhere, a segment of whites are leaving behind highly diverse neighbourhoods of Metro Vancouver and Toronto for nearby predominantly white regions.

Political scientist Eric Kaufmann, who was raised in Vancouver to mixed-race parents, has created a chart showing how the proportion of whites jumped by roughly 20 per cent in a recent period in municipalities such as Squamish, North Vancouver and Port Moody.

Saanich, West Vancouver and Abbotsford are somewhat similar, Kaufmann found, retaining populations in which four of five are white.

Why are such trends occurring in the increasingly ethnically diverse West?

Demographers have long realized that many members of ethno-cultural groups tend to flock together for the sense of familiarity and the economic and social support.

In his new book, Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities, Kaufmann cites studies showing whites tend to move out of urban neighbourhoods that are changing as a result of in-migration.

And, surprisingly, the studies show white liberals leave ethnically diverse neighbourhoods for more Caucasian ones at a slightly higher rate than white conservatives (partly because liberals are more inclined in general to move).

Conservative whites “who dislike diversity don’t retreat from it any more than pro-diversity whites do,” writes Kaufmann, who is at the University of London, Birkbeck.

“What people say and do seems almost totally disconnected.”

Such trends make up the demographic experiment that is Metro Vancouver, which, along with Toronto, ranks as the most ethnically super-diverse region of Canada, if not the world. Meanwhile, the broad geography of Canada remains predominantly white.

For a moment, I was tempted to suggest the headline for this article about the Southern Gulf Islands could be: “Journey into the heart of whiteness.”

That would have played on the title of Joseph Conrad’s famous book, The Heart of Darkness, which was about a harrowing journey into the Congo, which Francis Ford Coppola turned into Vietnam in Apocalypse Now.

But such a headline would likely feed more half-jokes about whites. And that’s a North American cultural trend that Reihan Salam took apart in a brilliant essay in The Atlantic, titled The Utility of White Bashing.

Salam explains how anti-white rhetoric can be a way to get ahead socially and “often smacks of intra-white status jockeying.”

As with members of other ethnic enclaves in urban Canada, it is easiest to leave the white Southern Gulf Islanders to their pursuits, be they alternative energy, gardening, amateur music bands, Green party politics, orca-watching, or birding.

As people of any origin know, delight can be found in grabbing a pair of binoculars and focusing on the annual “global migration patterns” of cormorants, oystercatchers and hummingbirds.

At Toronto’s “A Cure for the Munchies,” the four-course menu is infused with cannabis.

The April 26 eight-seat culinary experience by Munchy Brothers and presented by communal dining service U-Feast sold out in less than 10 minutes, but tickets for a second and third night are already on sale for $110 per seat.

The eight guests signed up for the event next month will taste the “Mary Mo” cocktail, a mojito accented with a syrup infused with 2.5 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical compound that gives users that “high” sensation. They’ll be treated to the “Pipe Dreams” dessert, a Mexican churro pastry with a toasted marshmallow s'mores dip, each with 5 mg of THC from ganja-infused salt, sugar and chocolate chips. The other menu items all feature hints of cannabis, whether actually infused with the psychoactive drug or not, said Munchy Brothers head chef and creative director Pat Newton.

“All of the dishes are themed and presented as something that’s related to cannabis culture,” he told CTVNews.ca. “I've designed this menu to be playful and reflect traditional cannabis customs and archetypes.”

Like the “Bloodshot Eyes” roasted beet and crispy goat cheese salad. The dish is paired with a blood orange citrus vinaigrette drizzled onto the salad from Visine bottles, which some marijuana smokers use to hide red eyes that often come with getting high. The “Smoke and Mirrors” appetizer is a take on enjoying a “toke and a coffee” in the morning: the tomato and parmesan cappuccino is served with a smoked gouda and chive grilled cheese, served on a rolling tray (used to roll joints) complete with an ashtray, cigar shavings and freshly ground cannabis crumbs.

None of the dishes feature a strong marijuana taste or smell, because Newton’s Munchy Brothers crafted a proprietary process that removes the typically unsavory taste and scent from its products.

While cannabis edibles aren’t legal in Canada until October, this small event is private and offered to U-Feast members only. It will take place at a private condo in Yorkville’s Four Seasons Hotel and Residences, and features no retail sales of edibles. The menu items are made on the spot using cannabis-infused ingredients created by Newton’s Munchy Brothers, which are not available for sale.

“They’re paying for the service, for the hospitality,” he said. “This is like I’m inviting friends over for dinner and I’m offering an experience.”

Both Newton and U-Feast stressed that the cannabis will be consumed safely. Diners will consume up to 15 mg, which the organizers consider to be a conservative amount. “We’re careful not to have people walk out of there stoned,” said U-Feast CEO Terry Mocherniak, who said he’s planning a “cooking with cannabis 101” event. Only the cocktail at the start of the meal and the dessert at the end of the meal will feature prominent doses of THC, said Newton.

The dinner party night is meant to be a playful primer on cooking with cannabis. “The dining experience is designed to provide an uplifting experience and introduce people to the world of edibles,” he said.",Cannabis dinner party serving up 'kush-infused' mojitos and churros,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/cannabis-dinner-party-serving-up-kush-infused-mojitos-and-churros-1.4352362
147,Politics,2019-03-30T07:20:00.0000000Z,"She described her wrong understanding of the law, which is that she can’t even call the (director of public prosecutions) to ask questions without putting it into the Canada Gazette ... that no law was broken. Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told ...","OTTAWA—In a tense phone conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick that Jody Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded, the former attorney general repeatedly warned him that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his officials were engaging in political interference with the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. The 17-minute call on Dec. 19 begins cordially, but ends with Wernick warning Wilson-Raybould he was concerned about how the prime minister would react to her refusal to intervene in the trial and negotiate a remediation agreement with the Quebec company.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould provided texts and emails to the House of Commons justice committee as a followup to her testimony there on Feb. 27, when she described a “sustained” campaign by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of the Prime Minister’s Office to “politically interfere” in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. ( LARS HAGBERG / AFP/GETTY IMAGES FILE PHOTO )

In the call, Wilson-Raybould issued what she called the “strongest warning” to Wernick about the actions of Trudeau and others. “It is entirely inappropriate and it is political interference,” she said.

Article Continued Below

It directly contradicts Trudeau’s and his top officials’ public assertions that Wilson-Raybould never advised him of any concerns until after she was moved out of her job as justice minister in January. Wilson-Raybould previously testified she was under pressure by Trudeau and senior officials to direct that SNC-Lavalin be given a deferred prosecution agreement under a brand new law, which would allow the Quebec firm to avoid a criminal conviction and with it, a 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts.

Article Continued Below

In new material released Friday, Wilson-Raybould contradicts Wernick’s public statement that the matter was not discussed at cabinet, reminding him she warned the entire cabinet when the change was being contemplated that any decision to use a deferred prosecution agreement would be exceptional, and would need to be left up to the prosecutor in trial cases, including SNC-Lavalin’s. “I made it very clear at the cabinet table and other places that these tools are at the discretion of the prosecutor — and everybody agreed to that and there was no guarantee that there would be a DPA in this or any other case. So we are treading on dangerous ground here,” she said. “I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. All of this screams of that.” But Wernick maintains through the call that Trudeau is not pressing Wilson-Raybould to do anything outside legal bounds. “His view is that (he) is not asking you to do anything inappropriate or interfere. He is asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal,” Wernick tells her at one point. “The Prime Minister was not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould, and we were unaware of the full contents of this recording before today,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement late Friday. “As the Prime Minister said in his statement, he should have spoken directly with the former Justice Minister & Attorney General about this matter — and he wishes that she had come to him. As has been made clear through the various testimonies, and as the Prime Minister said, there was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months between PMO, the Clerk of the Privy Council, and the former Justice Minister & Attorney General.” The statement continues, “All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the Prime Minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.” The transcript and audio of the call were part of a package that included texts and emails that revealed other new information about Wilson-Raybould’s decision on Feb. 11 to resign from cabinet, three weeks after she was shuffled into veterans affairs. Wilson-Raybould denies testimony by Trudeau’s top aide Gerald Butts that she called minister of justice and attorney-general her “dream job.” She says he was the one who described it that way. Notified that she was being shuffled out of the justice portfolio, Wilson-Raybould says she told Trudeau and Butts “numerous times” she believed she was being moved “because of a decision I would not take in the SNC-Lavalin DPA matter, which they denied.”

She took Trudeau at his word but made a decision then that she would “immediately resign” if David Lametti, who replaced her as attorney general, decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular,” she said. A spokesman for Lametti told the Star Friday that he has not issued a directive in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution since his appointment. Wilson-Raybould said it was her meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver on the weekend after the story first broke that “led to my resignation from cabinet.” She says Trudeau publicly held up her presence in cabinet as evidence of her confidence in his government and its handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair. “I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” she wrote in her brief. But she pointedly does not go into detail about any aspects of their private discussions over three face-to-face meetings the prime minister had with her on Feb. 10-11 that led to her quitting. Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario told the Star the taped conversation was a “covert ops” move, with her hanging onto it for a “convenient moment.” He dismissed Wilson-Raybould’s claims about Wernick, saying he was “asking for information that only she could give.” “The clerk said this is a legitimate tool and why are we not exploring it here and he asked repeatedly for an explanation to pass on to the prime minister and she refused to give it,” Addario said. “She didn’t shut the call down. She described her wrong understanding of the law, which is that she can’t even call the (director of public prosecutions) to ask questions without putting it into the Canada Gazette. That’s not what the statute says, so he was right in thinking they were talking past each other.” Wilson-Raybould acknowledged that taping the call with Wernick without informing him was an “extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate” move but says she wanted an “exact record” of the discussion because she suspected it was likely to be an “inappropriate conversation.” During the call — which Wilson-Raybould previously described as the culmination of the pressure campaign — Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould she is part of a team, and the prime minister still believes she can use “tools” at her disposal, including asking former Supreme Court of Canada chief justice Beverley McLachlin for advice. “You are not just the attorney general, you are the minister of justice in a cabinet,” Wernick says to her. “I think the way (Trudeau) sees it and the advice he is getting is that you still have things you can do that are not interference and are still very much lawful.” Wilson-Raybould replies, “It is not they are not lawful … the perception and what will happen is that it will be deemed political interference from day one when people were talking about why we are entering into a DPA or putting in a DPA regime in place … Everybody knows that it was because of SNC. Whether that is true or not, that is what people will think.” The texts and emails that Wilson-Raybould gave to the justice committee confirmed much of the testimony she earlier offered about the SNC-Lavalin affair. Her letter stresses that she took to heart departmental legal advice that it would be unprecedented for an attorney general to direct the prosecution of a specific case absent new facts and evidence. Wilson-Raybould said none were offered in the SNC-Lavalin matter. She flatly dismissed the prime minister’s explanation since the controversy broke that Wilson-Raybould “experienced” events leading to her resignation differently or that it was the result of an “erosion of trust.” “The real issues engaged by this matter — the issues that will inform what type of Canada we want to live in and pass on to the next generations — are not, ultimately, about how things are ‘experienced,’ caucus dynamics, political ambitions, poll numbers, ‘erosion of trust’ or the role of social media,” she wrote in her 44-page brief.

By the end of the Dec. 19 phone call, Wernick is clearly concerned about having to go back to Trudeau without having made progress on the issue, telling Wilson-Raybould she was at “loggerheads” with the prime minister who is “pretty firm,” and that he’s worried about a “collision.” It also speaks to Wilson-Raybould’s anxiety at the time about the possible consequences for not budging. “I am waiting for … the other shoe to drop, so I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just struck doing the best job that I can,” Wilson-Raybould said. Later, she texted her chief of staff: “Ok the shite is going to hit the fan.” “Uh oh,” replies Jessica Prince. In her accompanying brief, Wilson-Raybould underscored that “prosecutorial independence” remains the core issue — “a principle that at times appears to have been obscured by layers of commentary, hyperbole and spin. “Any attempts to normalize such efforts is very dangerous to the institutions of our democracy,” she said. It wasn’t immediately clear what the committee will do with the new information. Liberal MPs on the committee had already voted to shut down further hearings into the controversy, including an opposition effort to have Wilson-Raybould testify for a second time. Liberal MP Randy Boissonault said the package confirms what “we already know,” that no law was broken. Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told the Star the recording “proves Jody Wilson-Raybould was telling the truth and Justin Trudeau was not. He claimed she never raised any concerns about political interference when she did so at least half a dozen times. He stated blatant falsehoods on that point and many others,” he said. The Conservatives have already asked the RCMP to investigate, as did five former Conservative and Progressive Conservative attorneys-general. The RCMP has not yet opened a formal investigation, but says it is aware of the matter and monitoring events. NDP MP Tracey Ramsay, who is a vice-chair of the justice committee, said the revelations in the audio recording underscore her party’s demand for a public inquiry in light of the Liberals’ refusal to allow committee hearings to proceed. She said the audio of the telephone call presents “clear and compelling and well-documented evidence” of efforts to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution and her determination to rebuff it. “There is no one who would listen to that call and believe she wasn’t pressured,” Ramsay told the Star. “Trudeau has acknowledged that he asked Wilson-Raybould to “revisit” the SNC-Lavalin prosecution decision but has insisted that no ethical or legal lines were crossed. “This is something that I was clear on, and then I asked her — even though I heard that she had made a decision, she indicated to me that she had made a decision — I asked her if she could revisit that decision, if she was open to considering to looking at it once again, and she said that she would,” Trudeau told a news conference earlier this month. Wernick has acknowledged that Wilson-Raybould was approached about the file but maintains that there was no undue influence. In his own committee testimony, he said discussions with the former attorney general were legal and appropriate.

1/ YIELD CURVEBALLS

Which is it - growth or gloom? With 10-year U.S. bond yields below 3-month T-bill rates for the first time in more than a decade, recession fears are swirling. After all, an inverted yield curve, when longer-dated yields drop below shorter maturities, have proved to be fairly reliable predictors of U.S. recessions in the past. As a result some investors are busy putting cash behind bets the Fed is gearing up for rate cuts.

But there are many who scoff - they point to a world economy chugging along at a decent clip, dovish central banks and company earnings that are still growing, albeit more slowly. So while Treasury yields are down 30 basis points this quarter, world stocks are up more than 10 percent. Recession skeptics may also note that U.S. equities are not far off record highs and credit spreads have retraced most of their December losses.

Also, while past recession discussions have focused on inversions of the 2-year/10-year U.S. curve, that hasn’t reacted so far. Fed policymakers too, such as voting member John Williams, say they are not worried about recession this year or the next. Others such as James Bullard seem to be endorsing the “this time is different” argument, hinting that the curve’s predictive power has weakened.

But policymakers around the world have already taken heed. The ECB has hinted at further rate cut delays and at tiering interest rates to help banks; other central banks, from New Zealand to Canada, are hinting at rate cuts ahead.

2/THE END OF THE ROAD?

No. No. No. No. Parliament’s cold response to Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal so far means the manner of Britain’s exit from the European Union - originally scheduled for March 29 - is unknown.

Brussels has let Britain delay its departure while May battled to find a way forward but there is little enthusiasm in parliament or the population even for the stripped-down version of May’s twice-defeated deal. But lawmakers have also given the thumbs-down to a series of other amendments, including revoking Brexit, delaying it further or holding another referendum.

Dismayed investors have been avoiding the pound but the resulting shortage in trading volumes just exacerbates price swings. The question now is whether the most hardline Conservative euroskeptics and Northern Ireland’s DUP, the party propping up May’s government, can ever be convinced to back an exit deal before the new April 12 deadline.

If the withdrawal agreement does somehow scrape through, sterling would likely surge above $1.35. For the time being though, the bleak, if unlikely, alternative scenario - a chaotic no-deal departure - persists.

Options markets aren’t optimistic. The price investors are willing to pay for one-month sterling protection - insurance against sterling falls - is at the highest since the 2016 referendum vote.

3/WORKIN’ FOR A LIVIN’

U.S. factory job growth was its weakest in February since the summer of 2017 but still managed to extend the streak of monthly gains to 19, the longest in nearly a quarter century. If, as expected, Friday’s March payrolls report makes it 20 in a row – economists polled by Reuters predict a 10,000 increase - it would mark the longest uninterrupted run of manufacturing employment expansion in a generation, matching the run from January 1983 through August 1984.

But while comparable in length, the current manufacturing renaissance pales in terms of total jobs created. Back then, U.S. factories added 1.34 million workers, more than three times the 417,000 new jobs since the current streak began in August 2017.

For early clues on the jobs data, cast an eye on Monday’s ISM Manufacturing Index. Its employment component is closely correlated with the Labor Department’s manufacturing payrolls series. ISM’s February reading on factory employment, at 52.3, was the weakest in more than two years. Should it drop below 50, the level separating expansion from contraction in the ISM series, it could signal an end to manufacturing employment’s long run. The last time ISM had a sub-50 print was September 2016. That month, U.S. factories cut 3,000 jobs.

4/DEAL WITH IT

A month has passed since the United States and China missed an initial deadline to agree a trade deal. The first face-to-face meetings between the two sides since that deadline were apparently “constructive” and “productive”; now Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is to travel to Washington for further talks.

In the meantime though, tariffs on Chinese goods worth $250 billion are in play and that is hurting - China as well as its Asian neighbors who are linked to it through complex supply chains. March Purchasing Managers Indexes are expected to show a further deterioration in sentiment across the region and another source of pressure is the worry of a recession in the United States.

The one thing preventing panic is the hope Beijing will provide enough stimulus to offset slowing trade. Central bankers around Asia have started hinting at interest rate cuts, relieved at the end of the Fed’s policy-tightening campaign. But the upcoming activity data might show how soon they need to act.

5/NO THANKSGIVING FOR THIS TURKEY

Last year’s lira crisis tipped Turkey into a painful recession, ended its credit-fueled economic boom and complicated President Tayyip Erdogan’s task of selling his economic success story to voters. They are headed to the ballot box on Sunday for the first time since last year’s currency meltdown.

Polls suggest Erdogan could lose Ankara, the city from which he has ruled Turkey with an increasingly iron grip since 2003. His AK Party could face a tough race in Istanbul, where Erdogan was once mayor. But policymakers’ efforts shore up the currency before the election have run into trouble and moves to curb offshore lira supply has pushed investors into selling Turkish stocks and bonds.

The question now is how quickly policymakers will normalize their approach to markets. And even if they do, will pressure on the lira ease up and can they win back the trust of investors, some of whom will have taken losses from the recent episode? For an economy that’s already reeling how much damage have these unorthodox measures inflicted? And finally, will the stress percolate to European banks active in Turkey? BBVA, Unicredit, ING, HSBC and BNP Paribas all have varying degrees of exposure.

Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have ...,"WELLS: On that note, I want to welcome to The Message Graeme MacKay, the Hamilton Spectator's award winning editorial cartoonist. In fact it occurred to me as I was preparing for the episode that the sign Beware of Cartoonist is funny and also has deeper meetings or layers to it, just as your work always does, because in fact you occupy a physical space in the newsroom off on your own — separate from the reporters. And you also play a singular role at The Spectator which is to offer an opinion, a point of view on everything from politics to Hamilton's quirks and the vast canvas of human nature and to do so editorial cartoons. That's me giving my spin how you might see your job. How do you see what you do?

MACKAY: Yeah, I occupy a very isolated corner of the newsroom way at the other end and by the exit door to the newsroom too so there's a symbolic thing there. I guess I'm lucky enough to have a position that I have because it's sort of like a visual columnist. But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: Sure.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

CTV Edmonton





New Democratic Party leader Rachel Notley hit the campaign trail on Friday. But while she wanted to discuss policy, Notley was forced to field questions about sexual misconduct within her own caucus.

Notley was campaigning in Sherwood Park when the subject of the harassment was raised.

In November, it was revealed that two party MLAs had been accused of sexual misconduct since 2015. The nature of the incidents is unclear, but a party spokeswoman said the alleged behavior took place outside of the workplace.

“We engaged in an appropriate response,” said Notley. “We hired independent investigators, who properly investigated these claims, made recommendations, and we followed those recommendations.”

Notley strongly denies there were any more incidents than the two that were reviewed by separate firms in Edmonton and Toronto.

“There's two that we're aware of and all the stuff was percolating on social media, there's absolutely no evidence of what was being discussed there,” said Notley.

The resurfacing of misconduct within the NDP caucus has UCP House Leader Jason Nixon calling on the premier to be more transparent.

“I think it's incumbent on the premier to be honest with Albertans about what has taken place with her caucus and her candidates,” said Nixon.

The party says the identities of the accused MLA's are not being released to protect the identity of the complainants.

Notley says the two accusers were both satisfied with the third-party review and its outcome; however, CTV News has not been able to independently verify that statement.

Late last year Robyn Luff left the NDP caucus due to what she says was a culture of bullying.

“We have thousands and thousands of members who are very passionate about what they do and I’m not going to suggest that everyone gets along at all times,"" said Notley.

152,World,2019-03-30T21:10:00.0000000Z,"But when they look at the growing divide over Israel within the Democratic Party, they have concerns about how the progressive candidates are breaking with what they viewed as conventional pro-Israel policy. ""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to ...","Not long ago, if a U.S. presidential hopeful from either party was mounting a serious bid for the Oval Office, the candidate would seek a spot on the main stage at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference, the largest U.S. gathering of the pro-Israel lobby.

This year, it seems, not so much.

While the 2019 speakers list was stacked with officials from President Donald Trump's administration and Republican Party grandees, most major Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 were missing from the conference altogether.

The three-day event, which ended Tuesday, included speeches from Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.

So I am troubled that leading Democrats seem to have some difficulty plainly calling out anti-semitism within their own ranks. And I am troubled that many of the declared Democrat presidential candidates seem to be avoiding <a href=""https://twitter.com/AIPAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@AIPAC</a> this year. —@senatemajldr

Nine of the biggest names in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination skipped the conference this year, and not one Democratic candidate was on the speakers list.

Jewish Americans have long aligned themselves with liberal causes. About 75 per cent of Jews voted Democratic in the 2018 midterms. But some delegates at this year's conference noted with dismay recent comments by freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar that they felt trafficked in stereotypes about Jewish political influence and money.

Recent polling suggests there is more willingness among younger progressive voters to criticize Israel.

Some AIPAC attendees who spoke with CBC News wondered whether the party has shifted too far to the left. Here's what some of them said.

Michael Goldberg, 49, Democrat from New York:

Michael Goldberg is waiting for a more 'centrist' Democrat to get in the race. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""It used to be that Democrats and Republicans had to fight to get a spot on the stage,"" Goldberg said.

Noting the lack of 2020 candidates on the speakers' list, he asked, ""Who's here that's running for the presidency for the Democrats?""

The attorney and father of three admitted that he feels ""a bit politically lost.""

He supported Barack Obama during his two terms in office. He and his wife have been ""lifelong Democrats,"" and are still registered with the party. But they voted for Trump in 2016 and may do so again in 2020, unless a Democrat they consider ""more centrist"" decides to run.

The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! <a href=""https://twitter.com/OANN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@OANN</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/foxandfriends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@foxandfriends</a> —@realDonaldTrump

Asked about talk of an ""Exodus"" or ""Jexodus"" — a movement begun by conservatives to woo Jewish-Americans away from the Democrats to the Republicans — Goldberg gave a knowing nod.

""It's me and my wife. That's what happened,"" he said. ""The Democrats were friends of the Jewish people. They were friends of Israel. But it's a different party now.""

Vicki Fishman, 47, Independent from Washington, D.C.:

Vicki Fishman is an Independent who lives in Washington. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""The American Jewish community stands for social justice, and the Democratic Party has positioned itself as being the party of social justice,"" Fishman said.

She's aware the eventual Democratic nominee often addresses AIPAC in an election year, as has been the case in the past three presidential election cycles, and that the upcoming election is still 19 months away.

""This is an off-year,"" she said.

Indeed, AIPAC's policy is to invite presidential candidates to speak only in election years. Even so, Hillary Clinton addressed AIPAC in 2016 as well as the off-year in 2015. Obama spoke there before the 2008 election, as well as in 2011 and again in the lead-up to his re-election in 2012. In 2007, a non-election year, both Clinton and Obama competed for Jewish voters, holding big events at AIPAC.

Rep. Ilhan Omar's tweets have ""complicated"" the public discourse for the Democratic Party, Fishman said. But she considers it to be a distraction.

""We're living in a polarized country right now, and that's just adding to the general polarization, and maybe that's taking up within the party.""

Katie Draisen, 20, Democrat from Boston:

Katie Draisen supports Elizabeth Warren's bid to be the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""There are so many conservative politicians here. It's really concerning to me as someone who is pro-Israel, Jewish-American because it feels to me like Jewish-Americans are being used by Republicans to gain voters,"" said Draisen, a self-described liberal Democrat.

""Knowing that Mitch McConnell is here, that makes me want to throw up.""

Draisen, a student at Boston University, supports Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren's bid for the Democratic nomination, though she declined to attend the conference.

Trump's closeness with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has aroused skepticism among her Gen Z progressive friends ""who see Israel and pro-Israel Americans as villains,"" Draisen said.

Netanyahu was listed as a speaker, but skipped AIPAC after a Gaza rocket attack. Netanyahu sent in a video address from Israel on Tuesday. A few months earlier, he reportedly told an aide, ""We don't need AIPAC anymore,"" reasoning he had enough support from American evangelicals and Trump.

Dismayed as she was that major Democratic 2020 hopefuls didn't attend, Draisen also said she saw political risk for them had they showed up at AIPAC. Doing so, she said, would be ""a big turnoff to most liberal Democrats.""

""It's unfortunate because I think most people don't understand the importance of supporting Israel, supporting a two-state solution, and learning.""

Marcia Jacobs, 86, Republican from Los Angeles:

Marcia Jacobs says she likes many of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Trump wasn't Jacobs's first choice to be president, but she has come to see the commander-in-chief as a staunch ally of Israel. Among the actions that convinced her was the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, as well as its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by moving the embassy there.

""He supports it so strongly, and [Democrats] are so anti-Trump that they're letting it affect any other issue,"" she said.

Jacobs was appalled by reports that the liberal non-profit MoveOn.org had urged Democratic candidates not to attend AIPAC.

""That's absolutely horrific,"" she said.

She also praised Trump for his tweet last week reversing more than 50 years of U.S. foreign policy on the Golan Heights by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the strategically important strip of rocky highlands located where the borders meet between northern Israel, southern Lebanon and Syria.

Manny Srulowitz, 18, Independent from Long Island, N.Y.:

Manny Srulowitz says he's noticed a new wave of Democrats who are critical of Israel. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Srulowitz, a moderate, said he was receiving emails last week from a pro-Israel organization informing him about the latest Democrats to pull out of AIPAC. He comes from a Republican household that voted for Trump in 2016.

""I wouldn't have enough knowledge to give you a confident answer about why the Democrats are all leaving,"" he said, ""but it's very evident the Democrats are not here.""

The high school senior from Long Island will be 20 years old in 2020, but doesn't see a Democratic candidate yet who would capture his vote.

""I have noticed there is a new wave of young and critical Democrats, usually the younger ones,"" he said of what he sees as declining support for Israel among people of his generation. ""I am not one of them. I am a big fan of the state of Israel.""

Ira and Susan Kapinow, 78 and 76, Independents from Potomac, Md.:

Susan and Ira Kapinow say they can't see themselves voting for Trump in 2020, but they don't like some of the things they see going on in the Democratic Party. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

As ""middle-of-the-roaders"" who try to avoid extremes in their politics, this is a fraught time for Ira and Susan Kapinow, married retirees and strong supporters of Israel.

Susan was troubled by support among at least two Democratic newcomers in Congress for the so-called BDS movement — a campaign calling for a boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.

""I find it offensive. Israel is a strong ally and a strong friend,"" Susan said.

The Kapinows can't see themselves happily voting for Trump in 2020. But when they look at the growing divide over Israel within the Democratic Party, they have concerns about how the progressive candidates are breaking with what they viewed as conventional pro-Israel policy.

""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to be generational,"" Ira said. ""The older Democrats were more supportive of Israel, the more traditional way. The younger Democrats are moving more and more to the left on Israel. Way too far left.""

Stewart Eisenberg, 64, Democrat from Philadelphia:

A liberal Democrat who voted for Clinton in 2016, Eisenberg has attended AIPAC's annual policy conference more than 20 times.

""You would like to see some presidential candidates from both sides, but we don't have the presidential candidate from the Republican side, either,"" he said.

He wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls this year, noting that top Democrats in Congress such as Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave speeches, as well as House majority leader Steny Hoyer.

Eisenberg balked at the idea of a ""Jexodus.""

""I think it's overblown,"" he said. ""You have certain people on the right and certain people on the left that have different views about Israel. Both parties have taken a turn to the radical side on both extremes, but in the general majority of the party on both sides, there has always been bipartisan support for Israel.

The New Democrats are confident the way forward for their party is to seek pragmatic policy solutions to longtime liberal agenda items. ""We caucus around ...","Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., speaks during a news conference on June 13, 2018.

Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., speaks during a news conference on June 13, 2018.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer laid down a marker in his speech last weekend to the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference.

""By the way, there are 62 freshman Democrats,"" the Maryland congressman, departing from his prepared text, said to the room of pro-Israel activists. ""Do you hear me? Sixty-two, not three.""

The adlib was a signal that Democratic leadership, just a few months in power, were making a change.

The trio of freshmen Hoyer was apparently referring to are Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, who as much as anyone have used their social media savvy to tap into progressive voter enthusiasm, and push lofty — and perhaps unattainable — policy goals: guaranteeing everyone has health insurance and a job, overhauling the economy to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, making college tuition free, and of course, impeaching President Donald Trump.

But as much as the young progressives have defined the early stage of the current House majority, it's clear the momentum has shifted as party leaders try to steer Democrats back toward the center.

Recent developments have revealed the limits of the star power of Ocasio-Cortez and company. Republicans are ridiculing the Green New Deal and casting the Democrats as socialists. Rather than adopting sweeping reforms, House Democratic leaders are putting forward bills that make incremental changes to health care and push for the more modest goals of the Paris Climate Accords. And the idea of impeaching the President is all but dead at this point. The leading voice on impeachment, Tlaib, got just one co-sponsor for her renewed resolution.

If that wasn't a clear enough signal, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi effectively buried the notion of impeachment in recent comments. ""I've made it really clear on impeachment,"" Pelosi told CNN Wednesday. ""Everybody can do whatever they want to do but that's not a place where we are right now.""

The conclusion of the Mueller investigation presents a challenge for those Democrats who counted on it bringing down Trump. But it's also a chance for the caucus' moderates to refocus the conversation in Washington on a more center-left policy agenda. That certainly lacks the verve and appeal of the revolutionary changes put forth by the progressives, but it may be more doable and some would argue is more in keeping with the ballast of the party.

A fight for the future of the party

""I think the numbers speak loudly,"" said freshman Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a self-described moderate from New Jersey. ""I think leadership knows where the power in the party is at.""

Sherrill is one of the 43 Democrats who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018. She's also a part of the moderate New Democrat Coalition, which with 101 members (including 39 freshmen) is the largest ideological caucus in Congress.

But just behind the NDC in size is the Progressive Caucus, at 97 members. Some New Democrats are also in the Progressive Caucus, but for the most part the groups serve as distinct counterweights to each other.

Both caucuses represent huge blocs of votes. They also represent two distinct paths forward. The New Democrats comes across as a bit more focus-grouped, describing their agenda as ""pro-business"" and ""solutions oriented,"" with an emphasis on the kitchen-table issues of concern to suburban voters. Progressives, on the other hand, channel the enthusiasm and frustration of a younger, more radical cohort questioning aspects of the country's underlying economic and social structures.

The fight over the future of the Democratic party is happening in the House, and while progressives seem to have lost the momentum for the moment, it remains to be seen whether moderates can take hold of the party's message. Democratic success will depend on House leadership managing the fight and keeping both sides happy.

Respective disruption

The New Democrats are confident the way forward for their party is to seek pragmatic policy solutions to longtime liberal agenda items.

""We caucus around issues of opportunity, entrepreneurism, pro-business but also pro-people, pro-planet,"" said Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, another freshman and NDC member. She calls the approach of her and like-minded members as ""respective disruption.""

""I think that there is much to be said for vision and aspirational ideals. We should all have them,"" Houlahan said. ""But we should also have solutions that are tenable.""

The New Democrats aren't likely to throw their weight behind the Green New Deal or Medicare for All, which could prevent either proposal from getting a vote on the House floor this session. Multiple staffers for moderate Democrats expressed their frustration at the way Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Green New Deal, without much of a plan for defending it.

""Green New Deal is definitely a vision, and I understand why it's appealing,"" said Houlahan. What would the pro-environment moderates propose if not the Green New Deal? It's not exactly clear. Houlahan said that the solution for climate change is a ""beautiful tree"" made of more practical proposals.

""Some of it have to do with energy, some have to do with agriculture, some have to do with health care, some have to do with education, and all of those things together are the real green deal, the thing that will really happen,"" Houlahan said.

A suburban majority

Sherrill says she won last fall by campaigning on shoring up the Affordable Care Act, undoing the new cap on state and local tax deductions, and funding more infrastructure — priorities she says she shares with her fellow New Democrats.

When asked what the top priority of his group's members is for the current Congress, NDC chairman Derek Kilmer of Washington said health care, then added infrastructure as a close second.

""We have 40 freshman members, and most of them ran on health care,"" Kilmer said.

Sherrill is one of those who campaigned on stabilizing the Affordable Care Act, which she argued had been gutted by the Republican Congress. Winning in the suburbs of northern New Jersey meant pressing forward on these economic issues while also avoiding being pulled too far to the left. Her district leans Republican, and she was among those Democratic candidates who vowed not to vote for Pelosi for speaker.

Candidates like Sherrill, say moderate Democrats, are who gave the party control of the House.

""It is a suburban majority,"" said a senior adviser to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats' political arm. An agenda that speaks to the suburbs, not just to the party's progressive grassroots, is what moderates say is what will keep Democrats in power.

'Incrementalism won't suffice'

But progressives aren't going down without a fight. ""I'm on the side of ambition in general,"" Rep. Andy Levin of Michigan told CNN. ""I'm someone who believes in Medicare for All. I'm someone who believes in rapid, comprehensive efforts to deal with our warming climate. Incrementalism won't suffice.""

Two leaders in the Progressive Caucus, Omar and Rep. Ro Khanna of California, said Medicare for All should make it into the House Democratic budget, even if it makes moderates in the party uncomfortable. ""They have the right to vote against it,"" said Khanna. ""We should pull up what we believe in, what a lot of our presidential candidates are running on, and people can vote.""

The moderates so far aren't swayed. When asked if she supports Medicare for All, Houlahan shook her head. ""I'm trying to get the business of the people done, and right now I believe, collectively in this Congress, the progress that can be made is to work to get the Affordable Care Act to work the way it's supposed to work,"" she said. Sherrill is also opposed to Medicare for All.

""That doesn't mean we can't get some good ideas"" from the proposal, she said.

Next up: a budget battle

The true test will come if and when House Democrats lay out a statement of the party's priorities in a federal budget proposal.

Torn between factions fighting over taxes, defense spending, health care and environmental proposals, House Democrats may not even vote on their own budget proposal this year, House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth of Kentucky told CNN. With 235 members, House Democratic leaders can only afford to lose 17 members in passing a partisan budget resolution.

""We've got moderates who don't want to vote for any revenue increase, we've got liberals who either want us to spend more or want to cut defense and so forth,"" said Yarmuth. ""It's just a hard path.""

At a news conference earlier this month, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus and the lead sponsor of Medicare for All, said her group would be releasing its own budget -- no matter what.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are among the White House hopefuls who will attend the Heartland Forum in Storm Lake, Iowa. They’re likely to tout proposals they released this week aimed at helping rural communities.

The attention on agricultural communities and issues is the result of a recognition that Democrats need to do more to win over rural voters, especially in places like Iowa. This state has long been a presidential battleground that swung between Democrats and Republicans. But Iowa has trended more solidly Republican over the past two election cycles, a troubling warning sign for Democrats seeking to oust President Donald Trump. “There needs to be a better connection made between politicians and rural Americans,” said Aaron Heley Lehman, the president of Iowa Farmers’ Union, which is hosting Saturday’s forum and busing in members from neighbouring states to hear the candidate pitches. In the early days of the 2020 Democratic primary, many candidates are focusing on building that connection.

Warren rolled out an extensive agriculture policy this week that would help family farmers by breaking up big agriculture monopolies. Klobuchar announced a $1 trillion infrastructure policy that she spoke about while surveying flooding damage in Iowa this weekend. And former Rep. John Delaney rolled out his own policy aimed at revitalizing rural America, which includes a focus on farming and rural infrastructure. Several contenders, including former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, have campaigned in parts of rural Iowa that haven’t seen much Democratic activity in years. Former Rep. John Delaney is the only Democratic candidate so far to visit all 99 of Iowa’s counties. That’s a key part of what Democrats need to do to win back rural America, according to Iowa state Rep. Mary Gaskill — simply show up. “There are a lot of people who are hesitant to come out as a Democrat, because they all feel neglected, or abused or shunned by their neighbour,” she said. Gaskill is the only Democratic lawmaker in her area, and represents a red county that went for Trump by more than 20 points in 2016 — but one that Barack Obama won by nearly 12 points in 2012. Now, at least two candidates — Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand — have campaigned there, a development Gaskill welcomes.

“We might see our neighbours there, that we didn’t know they were Democrats,” she said. O’Rourke won’t attend Saturday’s forum. But his first Iowa swing as a presidential candidate included stops in small towns that swung from Democrats to Republicans in 2016.

He didn’t change much of his message — during the swing O’Rourke still talked about the need for gun control, legal marijuana and a compassionate immigration program. But his top strategist in the state, Norm Sterzenbach, said the key was to bring those policies to people that hadn’t heard directly from Democrats before. “Maybe those ideas you like, maybe you don’t, but you’ll never know if we’re not in there communicating,” he said. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand recently visited the same swath of eastern Iowa, pitching herself to voters as a candidate who could defeat Trump because she’s won in red areas of New York. She, too, didn’t shy away from embracing progressive policies like gun control, universal health care and the Green New Deal, and she touted her work on the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, the policy prohibiting gays from serving openly in the military, everywhere she went. Neither Gillibrand nor O’Rourke won everyone over. Tom Courtney, the Des Moines County Democratic Party chairman, hosted an event for both candidates and said he wasn’t impressed by their message. “O’Rourke didn’t, and (Gillibrand) didn’t make a good case for rural Iowa either — nobody’s doing that yet. She was talking a lot of issues that liberals always talk about,” he said, like leadership on the global stage, the president’s morals or abortion rights. “Trump got elected by telling people he was gonna fix their lives. I’m not hearing that here.” The rural forum will offer candidates the opportunity to discuss policies that will have a more direct impact on rural voters and farmers — and explain how some of their more sweeping proposals, like the Green New Deal, would help at the local level. Lehman said he believes there’s space in the conversation with farmers to address things like climate change and immigration, but candidates have to start bringing that message directly to them. “We’re encouraged that candidates are spending time and energy to think about what good rural policy is — we hope that the thing we’re doing on Saturday is the beginning of the conversation we’ll have all during the caucus season,” he said.",Democratic presidential hopefuls taking pitch to rural Iowa,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/03/30/democratic-presidential-hopefuls-taking-pitch-to-rural-iowa.html

US Representative Ayanna Pressley is adding to the progressive outcry over a new policy that bars consultants from working with congressional primary challengers if they want to do business with the Democratic campaign arm.

Pressley, who vaulted into Congress by upsetting 20-year incumbent Michael Capuano, said Saturday that the policy could have a “chilling effect” on potential candidates — especially women and people of color.

Under recently unveiled standards, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it will not do any business with, “nor recommend to any of its targeted campaigns,” any consultant who works with a primary challenger to a House Democratic Caucus member.

The policy, according to the DCCC, is aimed at helping keep the party’s newly won majority in the House, which “includes supporting and protecting incumbents.”

But it’s quickly drawn heated criticism, especially from progressives who have pressed DCCC chair Cheri Bustos this week to reverse it. Pressley has traded text messages with Bustos, according to her aides. But she lamented Saturday that her and others’ concerns “haven’t been received by those calling the shots at the DCCC.”

The party, Pressley said, should not be “creating litmus tests or roadblocks that have a chilling effect on new candidates.”

“If the DCCC enacts this policy to blacklist vendors who work with challengers, we risk undermining an entire universe of potential candidates and vendors — especially women and people of color — whose ideas, energy, and innovation need a place in our party,” Pressley said in a statement.

Pressley pointed to her own victory in the 2018 election and the help she got from people who “were told not to come anywhere near my campaign” — a nod to the effect the policy could have on similar challenges in the future.

“Without their willingness to go against the status quo, it’s very possible that I wouldn’t be in Congress,” she said of her supporters.

“I believe fiercely in the potential of our party, but we cannot credibly lay claim to prioritizing diversity and inclusion when institutions like the DCCC implement policies that threaten to silence new voices and historically marginalized communities,” Pressley said.

Whether the growing consternation forces the DCCC to reverse course is unclear. The committee has so far shown little indication that it intends to strike down the policy after announcing it earlier this month, and Bustos, an Illinois representative, rose to her position, in part, by championing “a new emphasis on incumbent protection.”

Pressley’s comments echo those of other Democrats, including Representative Ro Khanna of California, who slammed it as a “terrible” idea that’s out of touch with voters. He wrote on Twitter that candidates like himself, Pressley, and others “may not have made it to Congress if the DCCC had these blackballing rules in place” when they ran.

“We need to fight until the DCCC reverses it’s [sic] policy to stifle a competition of ideas and have an unfair restraint of trade,” he wrote in another post, which was retweeted by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who, like Pressley, upset a longtime incumbent last year to win her seat.

In total, there are now 13 political parties ...","When Alberta voters mark their ballots for the April 16 provincial election, many will see the names of political parties brand new to them.

Yes, the United Conservative Party will appear on ballots for the first time, since it didn't exist the last time Albertans went to the polls in a general election.

But most Albertans are well aware of the UCP — especially after the first week of the campaign, which was dominated by Jason Kenney's party and its main rival, Rachel Notley's New Democratic Party.

In total, there are now 13 political parties registered with Elections Alberta.

The dormant Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties are still on the list, but won't field any candidates. That's due to the merger of the two parties under the UCP banner in 2017.

New choices include the Alberta Independence Party, added to the list of registered political parties just this week, and the Alberta Advantage Party.

3 ways to get on the list

Drew Westwater, deputy returning officer with Elections Alberta, said after the election was called on Tuesday, the Alberta Independence Party was able to endorse candidates in at least half of the 87 electoral divisions.

According to the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosures Act, there are three ways to qualify a party for registration:

hold at least three seats in the legislative assembly;

endorse candidates in at least half of the electoral divisions in Alberta;

collect 7,868 signatures on a petition to illustrate support. (The number represents 0.3 per cent of electors eligible to vote in the last general election.)

""I know this is a new one for Alberta,"" Westwater said of the Alberta Independence Party.

""It's the first time someone has done that and qualified under this provision of the act.

""Now we have a new party for electors to choose from in the upcoming election.""

Westwater said that by qualifying as a registered political party, the party's candidates can officially appear on the ballot under their party name. Without the party being registered, those candidates would have to list as ""independent.""

New parties try to get attention

Another new party appearing for the first time this election is the four-month-old Alberta Advantage Party.

Leader Marilyn Burns knows she faces a big challenge in getting noticed, but said the consequences of not being on the ballot are bigger.

The leader of the new Alberta Advantage Party, Marilyn Burns, says it's a challenge to get noticed, but important that Albertans have a choice in the election. (Alberta Advantage Party)

Supporters combed Alberta to gather 8,600 signatures on a petition to form the Alberta Advantage Party, said Burns.

The process of canvassing voters directly, said Burns, has given her a good indication of how people are feeling going into the election.

""What we've heard loud and clear, and continue to hear, is a visceral hatred for the NDP that is not going to change no matter what Jason Kenney does,"" she said.

That sentiment is balanced by ""the strong dislike and distrust of Jason Kenney,"" Burns added.

Choice and consequences

The upstart Freedom Conservative Party was created in 2018 by former UCP MLA Derek Fildebrandt.

Fildebrandt anticipates more about 30 FCP candidates will run in the election. He said his biggest challenge is to get people to think of options when they go to the polls.

""The media tend to give the impression you've only got two choices in politics.You've got the red team and you've got the blue team,"" Fildebrandt said in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""You've got Diet Coke and you've got Coke Zero, and there's a lot more to it than that.""

Little room for small parties

Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said this election is significant because it has put Alberta into the position of a two-party race for perhaps the first time in recent history.

""We've gone into new terrain here,"" Bratt said.

""I think there is room in the centre in this very polarized environment, but not in this election.""

He said it will take at least one election cycle to open up the field again.

“Taxing the rich to give to the poor, a Robin Hood mentality, may not be exactly the right way,” says Patricof, a major Democratic donor.

Ocasio-Cortez proposed a marginal tax rate of 70% on income over $10 million; while Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, put forward a 2% wealth tax on households that exceed $50 million.

Asked directly about the tax proposals, Patricof says, “You don’t need that.”

Patricof made the comments to Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in a conversation that aired on Yahoo Finance in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer,” a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.

In 1967, Patricof was an early investor in New York Magazine. He followed in the 1980s and ‘90s with larger investments in Apple and AOL, before either company was a household name. Meanwhile, he founded global private equity firm Apax Partners, which to date has raised over $50 billion in funds.

Patricof returned to venture capital in 2006 when he founded Greycroft, which has specialized in digital media companies with stakes in companies such as Huffington Post and Venmo. He donated thousands to support Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy in 2016 and Democratic Congressional candidates in 2018.

‘A fair tax system’

He listed income inequality among the top issues Democrats need to address, alongside health care and infrastructure.

“We just can't have people buying $200 million co-ops, and other people not being able to pay their rent,” Patricof says.

He called for “a fair tax system,” suggesting lawmakers close the carried interest loophole, a move that would prevent stakeholders in an investment fund from receiving advantageous tax rates on income generated by their investments.

Patricof has long backed the carried interest proposal, one he made in a New York Times op-ed in 2016, “even though it hurts my pocketbook,” he says. “There are a lot of people who have a conscience who are concerned.”

He lamented a divide in the Democratic party between centrists and the progressives.

“It's a shame that there's been a bifurcation,” he says. “I found myself the other day in an interview saying I'm not a socialist, I'm a capitalist.”

“We’re all getting put into boxes,” he adds.

Ocasio-Cortez’s tax proposal is supported by 45% of voters, while 32% of voters oppose it, according to a Morning Consult poll that surveyed 1,993 voters last month. Warren’s proposal outperformed the Ocasio-Cortez proposal in the same poll. Sixty-one percent of voters favored the Warren proposal, including 50% of Republicans.

This one sentence from the Mueller report, quoted in the now hotly debated letter from Attorney General of the United States, William Barr, to congressional leaders, has effectively taken the mooted impeachment and removal from office of President Donald Trump, off the table.

There is nothing else conceivable at the moment which could convince the necessary number of Republicans in the US Senate to turn on the de facto leader of the GOP.

Since the investigation led by the former director of the FBI Robert Mueller began, leftist academics, journalists and politicians around the world have postulated that it would unearth salacious evidence of collusion between Trump’s malevolent backers and Russians close to Vladimir Putin to promote the former’s election in 2016.

It is notable that the Mueller investigation utilised 19 lawyers and 40 FBI agents, issued 2,800 subpoenas and 500 search warrants and summoned approximately 500 witnesses.

To call it thorough would be an understatement.

Critics

The journalist and academic Seth Abramson tweeted breathlessly about what he claimed were long-standing ties between Trump and the Russian government.

Abramson’s book, Proof of Collusion: How Trump Betrayed America, accused the president of “compromising American foreign policy in exchange for financial gain and covert election assistance.”

Not to be outdone, Luke Harding of The Guardian wrote a hysterical tome, Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.

Evidently undaunted and unrepentant, both writers continue to tweet in apparent denial of Mueller’s central finding, with no hint of embarrassment.

Unfortunately, many Democratic politicians also rushed to judgment prior to the report’s release.

Congressman Adam Schiff stated in December 2017 that “the Russians offered help, the campaign accepted help, the Russians gave help, and the president made full use of that help.”

A year later, his colleague, Senator Richard Blumenthal, remarked that “the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.”

And only last week, presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said: “You have a president, who in my opinion beyond a shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government – a foreign power – to undermine and influence our elections.”

Obstruction

Now that the Mueller report has spoken unequivocally to the contrary, many on the left are asserting that its explicit “non-exoneration” of the president on an obstruction of justice charge warrants further investigations.

They argue that Attorney General Barr, in light of the previous commentary, is biased on the issue.

Since his letter was made public, Trump’s opponents have proffered that either Barr has misrepresented the contents of the report or that his conclusion that the relevant evidence does not constitute obstruction of justice is inherently flawed.

In short, they are impugning his character by saying that he is either lying about what the report says or is protecting the president.

This is a highly dubious contention, especially given Barr’s heretofore sterling reputation and the probability that most of the report’s contents will soon be disseminated widely.

Regardless, Democrats are determined to carry on investigating the president and may well come up with additional damaging information.

But while there is a possibility that President Trump may go to prison at the close of his presidency, he will not be impeached anytime in the near future.

Victim status

Emboldened by his at least partial vindication, Trump will travel the country attacking his foes and playing up his victim status.

Trump’s base will be sympathetic, but so too might be that small cohort of Americans (we call them the ‘soft Trump’ voters or the ‘persuadables’ ) who don’t feel strongly one way or another about the controversial New York billionaire.

The crucial political question is:

Why would Democrats persist with these investigations when they are highly unlikely to pay political dividends and could well backfire?

Have they forgotten the not totally opposite, but still dangerous, precedent on this front set by the Republicans’ move against Bill Clinton in 1998?

That president actually benefitted from what the American people regarded as a ‘witch hunt’ about an extramarital affair.

Their answer is that they are doing their job and Mueller’s report may point them in the direction of further criminality. Fair enough.

But it appears to me that the party is collectively making the latest in a series of massive missteps when it comes to Donald Trump.

Democratic contest?

Since the day and hour he was elected, Democrats have been out ‘to get’ the president.

So many are driven by their enmity for him that they seem to have forgotten that the way to ‘get’ an incumbent in a democracy is to beat him at the ballot box, not to drag him kicking and screaming from the Oval Office and put him in shackles.

Unfortunately, at present, in the minds of the men and women in the vast and amorphous entity described as ‘Middle America’ who are going to decide the 2020 presidential election, Democrats are known for despising Donald Trump but not much else.

If they are associated with any policies, by those who will decide the outcome of a contest the world will be watching as never before, it is with ardently defending abortion up to the point of birth and with advocating a “green new deal” that, whatever its merits, is wholly unrealistic and would inflict significant short-term damage to the economies of several vital Electoral College states.

This might be unpleasant or offensive to some, but it is political truth nonetheless.

Refusing to draw a line under an investigation that didn’t go the way they were regrettably convinced it would, by the unhinged anti-Trumpers, far left-wingers and conspiracy theorists in their midst will broadly confirm the doubts swing voters already have about the Democratic Party.

My unsolicited advice to a party that I have long belonged to (but that has been working overtime to disenchant me and the other moderates recently) is this: Jettison the impeachment fantasy and suppress the Trump hatred that fuels it.

Instead, go out and defeat a president who disgraces and embarrasses our country every day the old-fashioned way.

We shall see whether Democrats favour electability or excitability as they select a nominee endeavouring to do just that.

Tragically, online donors gave nearly $3 million, at an average contribution of $18. Most of these donors have no idea they're feeding their money into the ravenous, bloody maw of Moloch-- a DCCC working to hobble primary opponents to corrupt, conservative incumbents.

Last week the DCCC announced a new rule-- something they've been doing, secretly, for years: Anyone who works with a candidate challenging an incumbent Democrat will be blacklisted .

This cannot move forward.

If you do TV ads and work for someone like, say, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez against corrupt establishment icon Joe Crowley (circa 2018), you can no longer do any work for the DCCC or its candidates.

Sound anti-democratic to you? It is, especially when you consider that millions of Democrats in scores of deep blue districts in every part of the country have no way to hold their reps accountable except through primaries.

And AOC is hardly the only Democrat who got into Congress by challenging and beating an incumbent. Dozens of current members did exactly that. Last year Ayanna Pressley beat Mike Capuano in Boston. Ro Khanna beat Mike Honda in Silicon Valley and Eric Swalwell beat Pelosi-crony Pete Stark in the San Francisco suburbs in 2012. Beto first won his race in El Paso by winning a primary against a Pelosi-crony who no longer was seen to be serving the best interests of the community.

When Yvette Clarke ran against another uber-corrupt member, Major Owens, he decided to retire rather than face a sure defeat, whining that her challenge was ""a stab in the back."" Current Harlem congressman Adriano Espaillat ran again the corrupt Charlie Rangel in 2012 and 2014, nearly beating him. Finally Rangel announced he'd retire and let Espaillat have the seat, which is a seat-for-life, without voters being able to turn to a primary.

Nydia Velázquez was first elected by winning a primary, against my old congressman, nine-term incumbent Stephen Solarz. One of Pelosi's heirs-apparent, Hakeem Jeffries, entered a primary in 2012 against Edolphus Towns, scaring the 30-year incumbent into retirement. In Chicago 1992 saw Bobby Rush defeat Democrat Charles Hayes and in 2016 Dwight Evans beat prison-bound Chakka Fattah in a Philadelphia primary.

↓ Story continues below ↓

Remember Pelosi foe Seth Moulton? I bet deep down she hopes he is beaten in a primary next year, which is how he got into office in the first place, beating Pelosi-pal John Tierney in 2014 (after almost jumping in against him in 2012 as an independent).

Another really right-wing dirt-bag incumbent-- this one whining about liberals trying to take him out-- is Texas Blue Dog Henry Cuellar who was first elected in 2004 by primarying progressive Democrat Ciro Rodriguez, doing some vote rigging and managing to win the deep blue seat by 58 votes in a shady recount. Cuellar is target numero uno for Blue America and several other progressive groups that help Democrats beat fake-Democrats.

The thermometer on the right will take you to the Blue America ""Primary a Blue Dog"" page. If we don't push back, hard on this they will ruin every bit of progress we've made since the 2016 election. Please give generously.

This new move by bone-headed DCCC chair Cheri Bustos (Blue Dog-IL) was, well... bone-headed. She should apologize to the grassroots of the party and to the dozens of good, solid members who are in Congress now-- like Matt Cartwright-- because they successfully challenged corrupt conservatives.

New Democrats give Lemphers the green light More than 100 New Democrats gathered Thursday evening to choose Justin Lemphers to carry the party into this fall’s federal election. By Palak Mangat on March 29, 2019

More than 100 New Democrats gathered Thursday evening to choose Justin Lemphers to carry the party into this fall’s federal election.

Lemphers will challenge Liberal incumbent Larry Bagnell and Conservative Jonas Smith for the role of sole Yukon MP. No one has publicly announced an intention to represent the Green Party.

Running on a motto of “nothing for us without us,” the newly-confirmed candidate was beaming last night, saying the first thing he would do is pay his dues.

“I’m going to thank everyone again because these people put in time and energy into being here and they all deserve recognition,” he told reporters.

Lemphers is the president of the Yukon Federation of Labour, and has been involved in work with the Yukon Employees’ Union over the years.

He listed climate change, environmental protection, electoral reform, income inequality and a host of other issues around inclusion as key issues facing the territory and country.

His challenger, Kaori Torigai, didn’t disagree – even directly referencing governments across Canada in her speech before results of the nomination vote were known.

“Until now, I was only a participant in politics by voting,” Torigai told the crowd gathered at the Whitehorse United Church.

She didn’t mince her words about current leaders. She called out U.S. President Donald Trump and Ontario Premier Doug Ford as selected leaders who “gave a voice to hate, to divisiveness, segregation, cutting social programs.

“There are others in our country and in our own territory that have similar views –­ this is when I started to realize I had to participate.”

She wasn’t alone in that. Lemphers told the Star in January he can see at times the difficulty for racially visible Yukoners to gain access to services, for instance.

As for what qualifies him to run for office, the 43-year-old father of three sons was humble in his response Thursday.

“The people in the room this evening – thanks to them, they made that decision, so here I am,” he smiled.

The issue with perhaps more urgency – or at least one that is brought up most frequently – is climate change and the effects of it, he added.

“There are so many great ideas out there.

“When we look at protecting the environment, it’s about not just recycling but reusing,” he said.

A short-term solution being explored is eliminating the use of single-use materials, Lemphers added.

“If we’re just using something once and it’s going into a landfill and a recycling pile, then we’re still consuming – so talking to people about what it means to be a consumer and how we might be able to hold that back.”

Lemphers will hope to carry the NDP into October’s decision day.

If he wins, he would become the territory’s NDP’s first representative in Ottawa since Louise Hardy (1997-2000).

Hardy was ousted by Bagnell in the 2000 election, which saw him serve until 2011 before Conservative Ryan Leef defeated him. Bagnell was again elected in 2015.

The Tories have already put forth their choice after Smith was acclaimed their candidate last fall. Bagnell officially confirmed his intention in December 2018.

While it may have been months since his two oppoents announced, Lemphers isn’t afraid of being behind the eight ball, with October sitting just six months away.

“I think the NDP has a message and a connection with people, and those that are interested and those that are unfamiliar with it will want to hear that message,” he said.

Though one doesn’t need to go far to see Smith’s ads at bus stops or in papers, the NDP candidate doesn’t feel he’s lagging behind after being tied up in the nomination process for the last two months.

“I think people want to have conversations, and I’m happy to have those conversations,” he said.

“There’s an awesome opportunity to engage with Yukoners, and I’m looking forward to doing that outreach.”

That dialogue will begin immediately as Lemphers turns his attention to pitching to Yukoners why he’s their best bet for their voice in Ottawa for the next term.

On hand at last night’s meeting was Randall Garrison, an NDP MP from B.C. who served as a guest speaker, and doubles as the party’s critic for national defence and LGBTQ2S+ issues.

Lemphers shouted out both his family, including father Florian and partner Brigitte Parker, and a host of other NDP supporters.

Dan Bader, the president of the NDP Electoral District Association for the territory, pointed out this was the only contested nomination in the Yukon – a hopeful sign that the party may be gaining ground here.

“Yukoners are really connecting with the NDP’s message that with love and courage, we can build a better Canada,” Bader said in an ode to the federal social democratic party’s leader, Jagmeet Singh.

“Both candidates ran a great campaign, and we were really pleased to see so many new members out at the meeting,” Bader added.

May told her Conservative lawmakers she would step down if her Brexit deal was finally passed by parliament at the third attempt, in a last-ditch bid to win over many of her party’s eurosceptic rebels.

But some were unmoved and the Northern Irish party crucial to getting the agreement through said it would reject the deal again.

Britain was supposed to leave the bloc on Friday but Brussels agreed last week to put back the divorce date until April 12 to give it a chance to resolve a three-year crisis that has split the country down the middle.

READ MORE: Bye-bye Brexit? Here’s what might happen next as deadline looms

However, it still remains uncertain how, when or even whether the United Kingdom, the world’s fifth-biggest economy, will leave the EU. The possibilities that it will leave with no deal to soften the shock to its economy, or delay the departure date to hold a general election, have increased as other options fade.

While May’s deal continued to stumble, an attempt by parliament to take control of the process by holding a series of indicative votes on other options produced no immediate way through the impasse.

None of the proposals, many of which involved closer alignment with the EU than May envisages, won the support of a majority of lawmakers.

WATCH: U.K. lawmakers vote to take control of Brexit process

“In a spectacular display of indecision, the House of Commons has voted against remaining in the EU and every version of leaving the EU,” tweeted James Cleverly, the Conservative Party’s deputy chairman.

Nevertheless, some proposals fared better than May’s deal had done two weeks ago, and parliament was due to hold more indicative votes on Monday after refining the options most likely to secure a majority.

WATCH: EU lawmaker says Theresa May lacks ‘basic human skills’ of a politician

Many Conservative eurosceptics had made clear they would only consider supporting May’s deal if she gave a firm commitment to resign, hoping a new leader would be more sympathetic to their views when negotiating the terms of Britain’s future relationship with the EU.

“I have heard very clearly the mood of the parliamentary party,” May told a meeting of Conservative lawmakers (MPs).

“I know there is a desire for a new approach – and new leadership – in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations – and I won’t stand in the way of that.”

READ MORE: British PM Theresa May says she will quit if Brexit ‘deal gets through’

But within hours of May’s offer, the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up her minority government, said it would vote against the deal if May brought it back a third time.

“We’re in a situation where we cannot sign up to the Withdrawal Agreement,” DUP leader Arlene Foster said.

The government gave itself the option of bringing May’s deal back to parliament on Friday, although speaker John Bercow repeated his warning that he would not allow a third vote unless the motion had changed substantially since its last defeat.

WATCH: U.K. lawmakers seize Brexit control for a day

May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had already promised to step down before the next election, due in 2022.

Her deal, defeated in parliament by 149 votes on March 12 and by 230 votes on Jan. 15, means Britain would leave the EU single market and customs union as well as EU political bodies.

But it requires some EU rules to apply unless ways can be found in the future to ensure no border posts need to be rebuilt between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

READ MORE: British PM under pressure to give her resignation date: ‘Time’s up, Theresa’

Many Conservative rebels and the DUP object to this “Irish backstop,” saying it risks binding Britain to the EU for years.

To succeed, May needs at least 75 lawmakers to come over to her side.

After the ERG met, a spokesman said: “There is no way enough votes are coming out of that room to put the (Withdrawal Agreement) through.”

WATCH: U.K.’s May tells lawmakers: ‘Unless this house agrees to it, no deal will not happen’

While May was addressing her lawmakers, MPs in the main chamber debated eight other Brexit options, ranging from leaving abruptly with no deal to revoking the divorce altogether.

While there was no majority support for any, the option calling for a referendum on any departure deal, and another suggesting a UK-wide customs union with the EU, won more votes than May’s deal did two weeks ago.

Oliver Letwin, a Conservative former cabinet minister who led parliament’s unusual power grab, said it had been expected that none would immediately win a majority, and lawmakers would have another chance on Monday.

WATCH: Anti-Brexit march takes over London

The uncertainty around Britain’s most significant political and economic change since World War Two has left allies and investors aghast. Sterling dipped after Wednesday’s events.

If May’s deal were to pass, her office said there would be a contest to replace her after May 22, when Britain would leave the EU.

She would also become the fourth Conservative prime minister in a row to have fallen foul of divisions over Europe within her centuries-old party, following David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.

Most voters think the Brexit negotiation has been handled badly and there may now be a slight majority for staying in the EU, recent polls suggest. Many Conservative MPs say May herself has caused the chaos by not negotiating harder with the EU.

“It was inevitable and I just feel she’s made the right decision. She has actually read the mood of the party, which was a surprise,” said Conservative lawmaker Pauline Latham.

WASHINGTON — Unlike virtually every other candidate in the 2020 Democratic field, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is not a fan of the Green New Deal, and he wants you to know it.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y, is the biggest star in the Democratic Party at the moment and her Green New Deal, which calls for massive government investment and regulations to fight climate change, is her signature issue.

It’s popular. A whopping 91 percent of likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers say they favor candidates who support it, according to a Des Moines Register poll. And all six Senate Democrats running for president co-sponsored Ocasio-Cortez's bill. Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke said, “I haven't seen anything better” to fight climate change.

But much of that support may be soft since, much like Medicare for All, many presidential candidates qualify their support by saying they're open to lots of potential ways to fight climate change.

Enter Hickenlooper, who made his opposition to the plan plain in a Washington Post op-ed titled, “The Green New Deal sets us up for failure."" His campaign then made sure reporters saw the op-ed and made him available for interviews.

Why?

""I wasn't out there trying to rip anything apart,"" Hickenlooper told NBC News in a phone interview. “I agree completely with the sense of urgency — we're within a decade or so of suffering irreversible damage of the planet.""

He likes the idea of a Green New Deal, just not this one. He pointed to its inclusion of issues like a federal jobs guarantee. His op-ed cited a fact sheet put out by Ocasio-Cortez's office that doesn't reflect the content of her bill and which she later disowned, and criticized the plan for not acknowledging the role of the private sector nor the economic dislocation that would result from abruptly killing the fossil fuel sector.

“Campaigns are about different voices and different positions, and I felt there was a benefit in beginning the discussion around what would a more focused Green New Deal would look like,” he said.

Politically, the move helps Hickenlooper carve the ideological space he hopes to occupy in the crowded primary, which his advisers see as open to big ideas, but pragmatic. It's a position that has sometimes seemed muddled, like when Hickenlooper struggled to answer whether he's a capitalist. The only other candidate to vocally oppose the Green New Deal is former Rep. John Delaney.

For Hickenlooper, who once worked as a geologist in the oil and gas industry and more recently drank fracking fluid to show it was not toxic, a better solution involves bringing industry and environmentalists together and encouraging them to collaborate.

It’s a faith in compromise — critics would say a blind one — informed by his experience in Colorado, where he facilitated a process that led to fracking regulations embraced by both extractors and environmental activists.

Of course, scaling that up to a national level and to many more industries would be another matter entirely. And much of the environmental movement have now moved beyond mere regulations and want to keep carbon in the ground and prevent it from being extracted at all.

But Hickenlooper believes there is always a way to get to a compromise.

“Trust me, people told me when I said I wanted to get industry and the environmentalists to sit down together... 'You are ignorant and naive and that will never happen,'” he recalled. “But in the end it's worked. It takes time, but it's not impossible.”

He will put that belief to the test next week, when he makes a campaign swing through the South in some of the most conservative states in the country: Alabama, Georgia, Texas, South Carolina.",John Hickenlooper opposes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez' Green New Deal and wants you to know it,NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/john-hickenlooper-opposes-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-wants-n988221

By Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Tuesday defeated the ""Green New Deal"" resolution that called for tackling climate change by moving the United States off fossil fuels, while Democrats said the vote was a political stunt on an issue that will not die.

The vote was 57 against the resolution in the 100-member chamber, with 43 Democrats voting ""present,"" avoiding an up-or-down vote. Republicans won over Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema and one independent senator, Angus King, who usually votes with that party.

The Green New Deal, introduced last month by Democrats, marked an initial attempt to define legislation to create government-led investments in clean energy like wind and solar power, infrastructure and social programs.

Democrats have said the plan, which is backed by most of the party's presidential candidates, was designed to spur debate during the 2020 campaign on the intricate problem of how to tackle climate change while boosting the economy, not to force the party to take sides in a quick vote.

But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell forced a vote before the plan had the chance for a national debate or hearings in Congress.

In a move that likely previews their wider strategy ahead of next year's presidential election, Republicans used the plan to try to sow discord among Democrats, painting their rivals as shifting to socialism and embracing extreme policies.

McConnell wrote on Twitter that Americans would see which senators are against the deal and which ""are so fully committed to radical left-wing ideology that they can't even vote 'no' on self-inflicted economic ruin that would take a sledgehammer to America’s middle class.""

Asked before the vote whether he believes climate change is happening and if humans are contributing to it, McConnell said: “I do. The question is how do you address it."" He said the way to fight climate change was by encouraging private companies to innovate.

The non-binding Green New Deal resolution sought to speed a transition of the U.S. economy away from burning oil, gas and coal and emitting greenhouse gases from cars and industry blamed for climate change. Its name referenced Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt's Depression-era New Deal that used massive government-led investments to lift the economy.

Democratic Senator Edward Markey, who unveiled the plan with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, told reporters that McConnell and other Republicans ""fail to understand ... that the Green New Deal is not just a resolution, it is a revolution.""





TO FIGURE IN 2020 CAMPAIGN

Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was criticized by Green New Deal supporters after she was filmed last month telling children she opposed the resolution because it was too expensive. But she sided with the majority of Democratic senators in voting ""present,"" to show unity in the party.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat running for president in a crowded field, told reporters that most Republican lawmakers were treating climate change like a ""political stunt.""

Gillibrand said most Republican lawmakers were lockstep in support of President Donald Trump's policies of rolling back environmental regulations and withdrawing from the 2015 Paris international climate agreement and ""have refused to put forward any real plan to address climate change in any meaningful way.""

Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican, has offered a response to climate change that proposes to engage innovation by doubling research funding in 10 technologies including advanced nuclear, batteries and capturing carbon for burial underground, a plan critics say does not act fast enough.

Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper became the first 2020 Democratic candidate to oppose the plan, writing in the Washington Post that it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. To spur innovations needed to curb climate change, ""government must not shun the private sector,"" Hickenlooper said in the piece.

As scientists say climate change is causing billions of dollars worth of damage by making floods, storms and droughts more intense, debate is expected to amplify ahead of 2020.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters the Green New Deal was discussed with Trump at a party lunch on Tuesday. Graham said Trump told Republican senators: ""Make sure you don't kill it too much because I want to run against it.""

Preckwinkle served on the Chicago City Council for 19 years and later became president of the Cook County Board. The 72-year-old former teacher also is chairwoman of the Cook County Democratic Party, which wields tremendous political power by, among other things, “slating” or endorsing candidates for offices ranging from governor to county assessor and judges. Lightfoot, 56, is a former federal prosecutor who never has held public office and is now considered the front-runner. She decided to run even before Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, announced he wouldn’t seek a third term, saying she wanted to do something to help low-income and working-class people she believes have been “left behind and ignored” by Chicago’s political ruling class. “I stand as a Democrat,” Lightfoot told voters at recent candidate forum, “but a different kind of Democrat.”

Lightfoot also would be Chicago’s first openly gay mayor. The city has only elected one black mayor, Harold Washington Jr., who was elected in 1983 and died months into his second term. His predecessor, Jane Byrne, is the only woman to serve in the job. Whether it’s Lightfoot or Preckwinkle, the next mayor will step into a climate in which city leaders have taken some hits. Emanuel’s administration was rocked by claims of a coverup after a white Chicago police officer fatally shot black teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014. The city, responding to a judge’s order, released dashcam video of the shooting more than a year after it happened. Then earlier this year, longtime Chicago Alderman Ed Burke was charged with attempted extortion for allegedly trying to shake down a fast-food chain that wanted to build in his ward. He is one of several aldermen facing criminal charges or federal investigation.

“When we keep putting the same politicians in office, nothing changes. ... They get elected, and they forget about us,” said voter Marcia Lewis, who lives on the city’s South Side and says she’s backing Lightfoot. “I’m ready for someone new to come in.” More than a dozen candidates jumped in the race to replace Emanuel, including Bill Daley, the brother and son of previous longtime Chicago mayors.

Lightfoot finished as the top vote-getter, followed by Preckwinkle, in a February election though neither had overwhelming support among blacks, who make up about a third of the population in the segregated city. Lightfoot’s base was predominantly white wards along Lake Michigan on Chicago’s North Side, while Preckwinkle’s support was strongest in predominantly black wards on the West and South sides. Because neither candidate received a majority of votes cast, the two will meet in a runoff election. In another sign voters are looking for change, several aldermen — including some of Emanuel’s closest allies — are also facing runoffs. Preckwinkle is campaigning as an “independent Democrat,” noting that when she first ran for alderman more than three decades ago she lost her first two elections and then barely beat “the machine” to win a seat on the City Council on her third try. She says her 25 years of public service experience make her uniquely qualified to lead the nation’s third-largest city and to tackle its deep financial problems, which include some of the worst-funded pension systems of any major U.S. city. By 2023 Chicago must come up with almost $1 billion in new revenue to make its annual pension payments. As the top leader in Cook County, the second-largest county in the U.S., Preckwinkle closed a nearly $500 million budget gap, expanded access to health care and reduced the population of an overcrowded jail, in part by reducing the number of nonviolent offenders being held because they couldn’t post cash bail. “This is not an entry-level job,” she said. “It’s easy to talk about change. It’s hard to actually do it. And that’s been my experience — being a change-maker, a change agent, transforming institutions and communities.” Preckwinkle picked up an endorsement from Chance the Rapper, whose father is Preckwinkle’s campaign manager. The Grammy-winning music artist from Chicago said Preckwinkle was the most qualified of the two candidates. He noted her work to reduce the jail population and provide health care to more than 350,000 people, saying “actions speak louder than words.” Voter Rhonda McFarland, who lives in the ward Preckwinkle represented on the City Council and is supporting her for mayor, also cited her proven track record. She said the race comes down to “what we will do” versus “We know what (Preckwinkle) has done.” Lightfoot also has faced criticism from some activists who say she has sided too often with police when leading police oversight boards in Chicago. Lightfoot said her showing in the February election helped people see it might be possible to topple the city’s political “machine.” “For those people who hungered for change, for the first time they got a glimpse of what that might look like, and that it was actually attainable,” she said. “That’s why I think this campaign has gained so much momentum over these last few weeks because of that prospect for real, meaningful transformative government.” She said she will bring transparency and accountability to City Hall and restore people’s faith in government. “The machine’s been in decline for a while, but it still has a grip on certain things,” Lightfoot said. “This is our opportunity to send it to its grave, once and for all.” ___ Associated Press video journalist Teresa Crawford contributed to this report. ___ Follow Sara Burnett on Twitter at https://twitter.com@sara_burnett",New face and longtime politician vying for Chicago mayor,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/03/29/new-face-and-longtime-politician-vying-for-chicago-mayor.html

Is New Hampshire - with its Democratic-dominated House and Senate, as well as an all-Democratic federal delegation ...","Editorials from around New England: ___ CONNECTICUT The Republican-American March 27 In recent weeks, several commentaries have highlighted the growing popularity, in Democratic circles, of ""court packing"" - increasing the number of seats on the U.S. Supreme Court under the next Democratic president and Democratic-majority Congress . Among others, several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have gotten on board with this. ""Court packing"" would set up a troubling situation. However, it doesn't surprise that Democrats have fallen in love with the idea. Historically, they have proved more willing to politicize the Supreme Court than Republicans have. To be sure, the Constitution allows Congress to decide how many members the Supreme Court will have. In other words, the current number of justices, nine, is not set in stone. However, as Washington Post history writer Gillian Brockell noted March 12, the current Democratic move is intended ""to re-balance the court in their favor."" Therein lies the problem. The Supreme Court, and the lower federal courts, are supposed to serve as a collective check on the president and Congress. Setting the number of high-court seats with political and ideological goals in mind would cut against this principle. That assuredly would undermine the public's faith in the judiciary as an independent entity and, by extension, in government at large. For the record, as liberal news site Vox reported last year, court-packing was last seriously talked about in the mid-1930s, when President Franklin Roosevelt and Attorney General Homer Cummings - a former Stamford mayor and Democratic National Committee chairman - unveiled an ultimately unsuccessful packing plan intended to protect New Deal legislation from a largely conservative Supreme Court. When the high court had decidedly liberal leanings in the 1950s and '60s, Republicans and others on the right made no meaningful attempts at court packing. The current Democratic push for a stacked Supreme Court is indicative of a party that cares more about politics and ideology than it does about the rule of law. Sure, some Democrats are motivated by lingering resentment of Senate Republicans' successful effort to block President Barack Obama 's nomination, in the election year of 2016, of moderately liberal Judge Merrick B. Garland after the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia . Mr. Obama's successor, President Trump , nominated conservative Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, who ultimately assumed the Scalia seat. While legitimate criticisms can be made of the GOP's actions, it is important to keep a sense of perspective: the maneuvering only involved one seat. It also is worth noting that there is an excellent argument to be made that Democrats pioneered the idea of blocking election-year Supreme Court nominations, just as they largely are responsible for nominations devolving into fights over ideology, as opposed to ethics and legal bona fides. Voters should take note come 2020. Online: https://bit.ly/2I06AnM ___ MASSACHUSETTS The Boston Globe March 28 Lost in the torrent of post-Mueller report rantings by Donald Trump was its confirmation that the 2016 presidential election was indeed the subject of a wide-ranging attack by Russia, which has given every indication it intends to do it all over again in 2020. So perhaps when the president and his Republican cheering squad in the Senate finish high-fiving one another, they might get back to work on protecting the US electoral system from another invasion. Ignorance, after all, is no longer an excuse. It may not be ""collusion,"" but there is a point at which the failure to act would certainly constitute nonfeasance — and incompetence. ""A lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office this week. ""I would say treasonous things against our country."" He was, of course, talking about his political enemies here — not Vladimir Putin, who ought to be the real recipient of his wrath. That was one critical take-away from the Mueller report, or at least Attorney General William Barr 's summary of it. ""The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts,"" Barr wrote in his letter to Congress. Those included ""attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations. . . designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election."" As a result, in February 2018, the Mueller team secured indictments against 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their role in plotting to disrupt the 2016 election. The other element in Russian interference ""involved the Russian government's efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election,"" Barr wrote. That resulted in the July indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers. It would, of course, be helpful in preventing another round of electoral interference to learn from the details of the Mueller report itself — another reason its contents should be provided to Congress in short order. We know from the February 2018 indictment that Russians were focusing on the presidential election as early as 2014. Russians traveled here as part of their due diligence. They targeted purple states and, more broadly, racial minorities.

It's a safe assumption, confirmed by the nation's intelligence community, that they are not about to quit now. So what to do? Social media companies, which were weaponized by the Russians, need to be better and smarter. Facebook announced Tuesday that it had removed 2,632 pages, groups, and accounts from both Facebook and Instagram for ""coordinated inauthentic behavior."" Of those, 1,907 were linked to Russia. Cybersecurity needs to go to the top of the congressional to-do list. Sure, the Democratic National Committee will no doubt learn from its 2016 mistakes, but federal law enforcement has a continuing role to play here — not simply advising, but giving targeted organizations a heads-up, as they attempted to do for the DNC in 2016. And while elections remain a 50-state function, there must be at least minimal federal standards to assure that voting systems are as secure as humanly possible — that indeed every vote will be counted. It is also of critical importance that interference in a US election carries with it punishment that is swift and sure. So far, it hasn't. The indicted Russian operatives remain beyond reach. Trump has actually removed sanctions against three Russian firms with ties to a Russian oligarch implicated in the election subversion scheme. What kind of message does that send? Perhaps when the president finishes crowing about the end of the ""witch hunt,"" he'll focus on his real responsibility — to protect American voters from the next attack on their democracy. Online: https://bit.ly/2I0C90F ___ RHODE ISLAND The Providence Journal March 26 The far left wing of the Democratic Party in Rhode Island makes a good deal of noise and generates a great deal of ink. But more moderate and pragmatic Democrats continue to govern. We have seen this play out repeatedly. Progressives were supposed to make immense inroads in last year's election. But they didn't. They were supposed to challenge the leadership of House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello. But they fell far short, even though they branded themselves the Reform Caucus. (The brand quickly lost more of its luster when one of the ""reformers,"" Bristol Democrat Laufton Ascencao, quit under an ethical cloud.) Last Sunday, they were supposed to throw a scare into the state party's leaders. But Chairman Joseph McNamara easily turned back a challenge by fellow state Rep. Moira Walsh, winning a roll call vote by 144 to 28. In her quest to tear down Mr. McNamara, Ms. Walsh employed some slashing rhetoric. She described her party as one that ""succumbs to one bully"" and ""gets national attention for treating women like second-class citizens."" (The state representative remains upset that the party formally endorsed another Democrat against her last year, a former Republican who had backed President Trump.) For his part, Chairman McNamara sounded a gracious note in response. ""While we have our differences, we have more that unites us,"" he said. Mr. McNamara thanked Ms. Walsh, a member of the Reform Caucus, ""for entering this race"" and helping the Democrats ""become a better party. Her views will help move the party forward."" The vast majority of the women in the state committee supported Mr. McNamara. (In addition, all five women on the state committee's ten-member executive board supported him.) Earlier this month, the House passed a measure of great concern to many Rhode Island women: a bill to protect abortion rights in the unlikely event the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade. Speaker Mattiello worked to make sure the people's representatives had their say on the issue despite his own beliefs about the sanctity of life. It is true that the party's left wing did well in the state's 2016 Democratic presidential primary, when college students helped propel self-described socialist Bernie Sanders to victory over the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton , despite overwhelming establishment support for Ms. Clinton. But in legislative races, party organization and day-to-day governance, the state's moderate Democrats fare well. They seem to reflect, at least generally, the values of the voters. In recent years, this has been evident in the General Assembly's focus on improving the economy and permitting citizens to keep more of their money through a reduction in the state's onerous car tax. While Rhode Island's overall business climate ranks near the bottom in some national indices, the legislature has refrained from raising broad-based taxes and has turned aside some of the more extreme and ill-considered attacks on the state's businesses. At the same time, it has maintained a generous social safety net. To be sure, no elected official should feel safe from a challenge, inside the party or out. Elections play a powerful role in holding politicians accountable and keeping them close to their constituents. To that end, we hope the state's pipsqueak Republican Party can start to recover with the election of its chairman this Saturday. Online: https://bit.ly/2Wt5FjL ___ MAINE The Bangor Daily News March 26 It was a bittersweet Maine Maple Sunday for Patriots Nation, with tight end Rob Gronkowski announcing his retirement. But after nine years of rewarding fans with touchdowns and punishing his body with a long list of injuries, Gronk's decision makes sense. The stats that number 87 put up over his incredibly productive, if abridged, professional football career are likely to land him in the Hall of Fame: 521 catches, 79 touchdowns, nearly 8,000 receiving yards, three Super Bowl championships, and a host of individual records. Perhaps an even more daunting list, however, is the number of injuries he's stacked up over the years: a fractured vertebrae, ACL and MCL tears in his knee, two concussions, a broken forearm and a sprained ankle, among others.

We shouldn't feel too bad for a guy who's retiring before he turns 30, but we also shouldn't hold it against Gronkowski for prioritizing his own future — and health — over a chance to defend the Patriots' Super Bowl title next season. Gronk has literally broken his back for the team, and undoubtedly put himself at risk for increasing health complications in the future. He may be physically able to keep playing right now, but, as with all other professional athletes, he gets to make the personal decision of when to call it a career. The fans may want more, but in an age where we have increasing clarity about the long-term impact football and other contact sports have on athletes' bodies and minds, players shouldn't sacrifice their well-being. Gronkowski didn't specifically mention injuries in his retirement announcement on Instagram, but he discussed football's physical grind in an interview leading up to the Patriots' Super Bowl win earlier this year. ""Try to imagine getting hit all the time and trying to be where you want to be every day in life. It's tough. It's difficult. To take hits to the thigh, to take hits to your head, abusing your body, isn't what your brain wants,"" he said in January. ""When your body is abused, it can bring down your mood. You have to be able to deal with that, too, throughout the season. You have to be able to deal with that going into games."" With increased awareness of and league attention to the dangers of head trauma, decision's like Gronkowski's really shouldn't come as a surprise. Studies continue to shed light on the link between concussions (and hits to the head generally) and the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE. Mounting examples of retired NFL players struggling with health issues later in life or being definitively diagnosed with CTE after they've died must surely hit home for players today as they weigh their futures. As a physical blocker and receiver with a hulking 6-foot-6 frame, Gronkowski has been one of the biggest targets for defenders across the league. And all those hits unquestionably add up. His retirement statement may have focused on the positive experiences he had as a Patriot, but there's little doubt that long-term health concerns factored into his decision. And for good reason. On Monday, Gronkowski's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, told ESPN he'd discussed the possibility of the tight end coming out of retirement sometime in the future to start playing again. Rosenhaus was careful to note that was his idea, not something that Gronkowski was actively entertaining, so we shouldn't get our hopes up. Patriot fans would surely love to see him out there catching passes, blocking and spiking the football again. But after years of sacrificing his body, Gronk doesn't owe us anything. Online: https://bit.ly/2FArkzM ___ VERMONT The Rutland Herald March 28 Nancy Pelosi is offering some good advice. In the days since the Mueller report marked the end of the two-year investigation, Democrats have been queasy that the probe did not yield either indictments or condemnations of President Donald Trump. Yet, in meeting after meeting in the last week, the House Speaker has been clear in her leadership. The message: Stay cool and concentrate on the need for transparency, oversight and a full public release of Mueller's findings — not on the frenzied speculation on social media and elsewhere, according to three people briefed on the exchanges who were not authorized to speak publicly. ""Be calm. Take a deep breath,"" she told House Democrats during a closed-door meeting this week, according to attendees. ""We have to handle this professionally, officially, patriotically, strategically."" According to Politico and The Washington Post, Pelosi has been working various angles all week. From reassuring and reining in Democrats galled by Attorney General William Barr for issuing only a summary of the special counsel's findings, to rallying her colleagues to fight the Trump administration's efforts to gut President Barack Obama's health care law, Pelosi has taken charge. And as the large Democratic presidential primary field still takes shape — and lacks a front-runner to serve as its pacesetter — Pelosi has stepped in to do just that, the Post reported online. Speaking Thursday to reporters, Pelosi tried to deflect questions about the Mueller report and highlighted the Democratic efforts on health care and the environment. ""We are focused on meeting the needs of the American people in their lives,"" she said. According to a Post profile, Pelosi's deliberate approach has been forged over decades, from a childhood steeped in the rough-and-tumble politics of Baltimore — where her father and brother served as mayor — to her years in the House, where she has watched as generations of zealous Republicans have pursued Democratic presidents and then suffered as they were accused of overreach. National politics is a much trickier balancing act, of course. Pundits are split (of course) on whether her approach can work. Some say Pelosi is showing solidarity with rank-and-file Democrats who are furious about Barr's declaration that there was insufficient evidence to make an obstruction case against the president — even though Mueller failed to draw a conclusion on that matter. Yet, she is also trying to temper that fury so it doesn't erupt and spark an impeachment push. Almost everyone agrees: Pelosi is shrewd and calculated in her long-term strategizing. But it remains to be seen whether she can herd the Democrats. The party is already split into factions, including a growing progressive movement that has gained significant media attention through individuals like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Beto O'Rourke. According to Politico, Pelosi has been able to keep her colleagues with her, pressing Barr to release Mueller's report while keeping her agenda fixed on legislative items she believes have appeal and could help Democrats win the White House and hold the House majority, particularly defending Obama's health care law from Republican ""sabotage."" She also has gone where many Americans wished the Democratic Party had gone a long time ago. She's urging Democrats to stop talking about a possible Trump conspiracy with Russia. This week, Pelosi has underscored her emphasis on ""lower health care costs, bigger paychecks and cleaner government.""",Editorials from around New England:,Chicago Tribune,https://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-bc-nn--exchange-editorial-roundup-20190329-story.html

She says she was grateful for the “brave” staffers who joined ...,"Rep. Ayanna Pressley is pushing back against a new Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee rule that penalizes pollsters, strategists and other campaign vendors if they work for Democratic candidates challenging incumbents in primaries.

The Boston Democrat, who unseated longtime Rep. Mike Capuano in the Bay State’s 7th District in November, said the rule “slams the door” on future campaigns just like hers, making it harder for young candidates and activists to advance in the party — particularly women and people of color.

“I think it can certainly contribute to what are already cultural and institutionalized barriers to get us to closer to achieving leadership parity, both in gender and in race,” Pressley tells WBUR. That negative impact will be felt “on both sides of this, both on the candidate side and on the vendor side,” she says.

Pressley says even before the rule, some vendors were told “not to come anywhere near” her campaign lest they face retaliation from Democratic Party leaders.

She says she was grateful for the “brave” staffers who joined her campaign anyway, and says the success of primary challenges like hers and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s should serve as a valuable model for other Democratic candidates to follow rather than a problem that needs to be stifled.

Messages left with the DCCC for comment were not returned Saturday. But in a statement to Politico, a spokesman said the rule was meant to fulfill a campaign vow by DCCC chair Rep. Cheri Bustos to protect incumbents.

Pressley says she was proud that her campaign drew a large number of first-time primary voters and produced a surge of support from Latinx voters and college students. She says she wants other candidates to duplicate that success in other districts, particularly those made up of underserved communities.

“We accomplished something unique and special,” Pressley says. “But that is not anything that I want to be an anomaly. This is what I want to be more of the norm.”

Politico reported that several progressive House members clashed with Bustos of Illinois over the rule during a closed-door meeting Wednesday.

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus said the proposed rule would create a “monopoly” of campaign vendors with DCCC approval, and ""blackball"" others who work for other Democrats, the report said.","Rep.

However, Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper said Tuesday he opposes the Green New Deal. The former Colorado governor said the proposal sets “unachievable goals” and ...","WASHINGTON — The Senate turned away from the Green New Deal on Tuesday as both parties shunned an opportunity to debate a comprehensive climate change plan offered by Democrats.

Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate forced the vote as they seek to turn the Green New Deal into a wedge issue in the 2020 elections. Democrats called the GOP’s move a “sham” and said it carries its own political risk by mocking an issue — climate change — that a growing number of Americans care deeply about.

Senators voted 57-0 against a procedural motion to take up the nonbinding resolution, which calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power.

Three Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, joined all 53 Senate Republicans in opposing the climate plan. Forty-three Democrats voted “present” to protest the GOP’s action. Democrats accused the GOP of quashing debate by blocking public hearings and expert testimony about the consequences of inaction on climate change.

In shifting the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels, the Green New Deal calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming.

The plan has broad support among Democratic activists, and all six of the 2020 presidential contenders serving in the Senate have signed on as co-sponsors, putting it at the forefront of the party’s sprawling primary race.

However, Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper said Tuesday he opposes the Green New Deal. The former Colorado governor said the proposal sets “unachievable goals” and shuns the private sector.

Republicans say the plan would devastate the economy and lead to a huge tax increase. They call it more evidence of the creep of “socialism” in the Democratic Party, along with “Medicare for All” and a sweeping elections reform package that would allow public financing of congressional campaigns.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky scheduled Tuesday’s vote, saying it would force Democrats to take a stand on a plan that “might sound like a neat idea in places like San Francisco or New York” but would result in communities across the country being “absolutely crushed.”

By “basically outlawing the only sources of energy that working-class and middle-class families can actually afford,” the Green New Deal would “kill off entire domestic industries” and eliminate millions of jobs, McConnell said. The plan could lead to a spike in household electric bills of more than $300 a month, he said.

President Donald Trump also weighed in against the plan, which the White House called “job crushing.” At a luncheon with Senate Republicans, Trump urged lawmakers to keep the Green New Deal alive as an issue to use against Democrats.

“He said it’s important to run against,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. Trump likes the way the Green New Deal makes Democrats “uncomfortable,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, called the Green New Deal “ridiculous” and displayed pictures of dinosaurs, cartoon characters and babies as he derided the plan. He said he was treating it “with the seriousness it deserves.”

One poster Lee displayed depicted President Ronald Reagan shooting a machine-gun while riding a dinosaur that was holding a U.S. flag. The outlandish image was intended to illustrate the U.S. winning the Cold War, Lee said, but its fictional nature served a purpose: “Because this image has as much to do with overcoming communism in the 20th century as the Green New Deal has to do with overcoming climate change in the 21st,” he said.

Lee’s remarks enraged Democrats, who called climate change deadly serious, citing floods in the Midwest, wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South.

“Climate change is not a joke,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the resolution’s lead Senate author. “Mocking it is shameful.”

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the lead House author, trolled Lee’s argument on Twitter. “If this guy can be Senator, you can do anything,” she wrote to her 3.7 million followers.

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of a half-dozen senators seeking the Democratic nomination for president, said Republicans treat climate change “as a game” and said Democrats “will not fall for this stunt.”

Slowing climate change “should be our nation’s moonshot” in the 21st century, Gillibrand said, calling it a generational challenge similar to the race to the moon in the 1960s.

“We don’t know if we can get to net-zero carbon emissions in 10 years, but why not try?” she said at a rally before the Senate vote.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said Democrats were being hypocritical by refusing to vote for their own plan. “I’ve never seen a bill sponsored by a dozen people who don’t want to vote on it,” he said.

The Green New Deal goes far beyond energy to urge national health care coverage and job guarantees, high-quality education and affordable housing, as well as “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States” to be energy-efficient. Democrats have not specified a price tag, but Republicans say costs could run into the tens of trillions of dollars.

Lance Issa-Onilu, the APC spokesman, stated this when he spoke to newsmen on Abuja on why the party settled for Ahmed Lawan as its choice for Senate President.

According to Issa-Onilu, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had no say in the matter as APC has the necessary numbers in the National Assembly to make the top positions.

“You should know that from every zone, we have ranking members in the National Assembly who are eminently qualified to be Senate President. But there is only one vacancy to be filled because we don’t have two Senate presidents. In this case, considering other factors, the party took a decision.

“When I say the party, not just the NWC, because there was wide consultation across the country; the party leaders, governors, the President and so, it is not just Adams Oshiomhole or the NWC. That is the position of the ruling party. So, the idea of taking the thing to the zones is an option which we have also considered before arriving at a particular individual from the North-East, only after we have zoned that position to the North-East.”

Speaking on the comments by Adams Oshiomhole, the APC National Chairman, that the party would not share positions with the PDP, he said: ""It was not a threat. That is democracy. I have listened to PDP react to this and in their usual style, they exhibited crass ignorance. What we practise in Nigeria is the presidential system of government and in a presidential system of government, it is winner takes all. Once you win, you take whatever you want. There is no room for power sharing.

“We don’t need it because we don’t need them to run this government. We have enough members to run this government. In any case, when we were campaigning, we never told Nigerians that we were going to share power with any other party. We told them to entrust power on us fully because in the last four years, we have made good use of power and we will make better use of it in the next four years.

“Nigerians graciously assented to that. It will be a betrayal of that trust to go ahead and start sharing power with a party, particularly the PDP that has been rejected by Nigerians.

“We are smarting from the experience of the last four years, precisely what happened in 2015 when some traitors within the APC fold sold our birthright to an opposition party and some people now considered that as the normal thing. That action was not democratic. It was treachery and we thank God that Nigerians punished the people that were involved.

“They have been rejected with many of them now on compulsory retirement from politics. That is the verdict of the people of this country for compromising basic democratic principles, which say that when you have majority, you have the trust of the people to form a government without conceding anything to the people they have rejected. If they had wanted PDP, they would have voted for them.

“We pattern our presidential system along side that of the United States of America. When last did you see to the floor to elect Senate President. In their own case, the Speaker? Any party that has the majority automatically has the Speaker.

“What we had in the last one year when those traitors defected back to where they belong was an aberration and not democratic. It is an expression of lack of value and a commitment to personal aggrandisement and not a commitment to national interest. We should not think that it has now become the new normal. If we truly wants to practise democracy, we should consign such to the dustbin of history and never allow such to happen.

“The problem we have had with party politics in this country is the fact that no ideology drives any political party. But APC is daring to be different. What that means is that we are progressives and the worldview of progressives includes the ideology that speaks to those values that are very important to the common people.

“That is why most of the policies of this government has been pro-poor policies. All the social investment programmes were patterned along the world view of progressives.”

While urging members to support the party's decisions, he said Senator Ali Ndume, who has also expressed interest in the Senate President position had the fundamental right to do so.

“He is only expressing his fundamental rights. But those rights were taken care on that very day you subscribed to be a member of a particular political party, in this case, the APC. That day, he signed up to abide by the position of the APC. We take what happened in the last 24 hours as how badly the news hit him.

“He is a human being and we are also conscious of the fact that Senator Ali Ndume is a respected member of APC, a leader in this party and he knows the right thing to do and on both sides, the right thing will be done. That also includes other members who have the same issues, but at the end of the day, party supremacy will have to take precedence. The party will also to conscious not to be found wanting and not to be seen to be breaking its own rules.

“What happened in the National Assembly when APC members kept the national budget for seven months is a betrayal of the party on which platform they were elected and also a betrayal of the trust of the people of this country and Nigerians have passed a verdict on them.”","Those Who Defected From Our Party In 2018 Lack Values, Says APC",Sahara Reporters,http://saharareporters.com/2019/03/28/those-who-defected-our-party-2018-lack-values-says-apc

Outspoken rookie lawmakers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a democratic socialist and backs a sweeping spending plan to reduce carbon emissions called the “Green New Deal ...","(Bloomberg) -- For President Donald Trump’s new North American trade accord to become law, he’ll need the help of a political rival with a track record of blocking such deals.

In 2008, Nancy Pelosi was House Speaker when Democratic lawmakers denied President George W. Bush’s request for a vote within 90 days on a trade pact with Colombia. The rejection delayed approval of deals the Bush administration negotiated with South Korea and Panama, though all three were later ratified.

Once again Speaker, Pelosi will play a pivotal role for Trump’s renegotiated accord with Mexico and Canada, renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which isn’t one of her legislative priorities. It’s a change of pace from the frenetic year of negotiations that led to the deal being signed by leaders from all three countries in November.

“If the House doesn’t want to move on this, it doesn’t have to move. So it’s really up to her,” said Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Left-Tilting Tent

Pelosi is expected to only move the deal through the House if she can find a critical mass of her caucus supporting it and if she extracts concessions unrelated to trade from the White House in return, senior congressional aides say.

Asked to comment, Pelosi’s office referred to remarks she made this month in which the speaker said she and other Democrats are still weighing USMCA’s provisions on the environment, labor, pharmaceuticals and enforcement before deciding whether to support it.

With 60 new Democratic members who still have to familiarize themselves with their districts’ priorities and the content of the trade deal, the biggest challenge is educating lawmakers, the aides said. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is expected to meet with freshman members in the coming weeks to make his case.

Lighthizer has been wooing Democrats to support the updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Sympathetic groups could include the New Democrat Coalition, which includes 100 lawmakers who back pro-growth policies.

He may face a tougher challenge on the party’s left flank. Outspoken rookie lawmakers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a democratic socialist and backs a sweeping spending plan to reduce carbon emissions called the “Green New Deal,” have driven the Democratic agenda since the November election.

“That’s the most amorphous piece of this: When is the caucus happy enough that she feels confident moving this? Hard to say,’’ said the National Foreign Trade Council’s Vanessa Sciarra, referring to Pelosi.

Kevin Brady, the top Republican on House Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday there may be a House vote on the pact “this summer” once Democrats’ concerns are addressed.

Labor, Drugs

Some Democrats are calling for changes to sections of USMCA dealing with labor standards and drug patents.

The pact commits Mexico to reform its labor laws to allow workers to engage in collective bargaining. But senior Democrats have said the commitments are lacking teeth without adequate enforcement provisions.

America’s biggest federation of labor unions, the AFL-CIO, has said it won’t support USMCA in its current form, and would oppose it if the business community forced a “premature” vote. “What we hear on the Hill is the same thing we’re saying: It’s not ready to be voted on,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said on Bloomberg TV Friday.

Democrats also aren’t enthusiastic about a drug patent provision that would force Mexico and Canada to extend protection for biologic drugs, warning it could raise prices for consumers.

Steel, Aluminum

Mexico and Canada have warned they may not ratify USMCA unless the U.S. lifts tariffs on steel and aluminum. The duties are also unpopular with lawmakers from Trump’s own Republican Party.

Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate finance committee, said the agreement wouldn’t be considered as long as the duties remain in place.

The administration is considering replacing the tariffs with quotas, which are equally, if not more, unpopular with many lawmakers as well as Mexico and Canada.

The Trump administration can make tweaks to the agreement to mollify concerns. But major revisions would require reopening talks with Mexico and Canada, a scenario Lighthizer has ruled out.

172,Politics,2019-03-30T20:45:00.0000000Z,"So, even as we have come to see this state of war as a kind of “new normal,” the American public is wiser ... Her only reference to foreign policy was a vague statement about “democratic values,” “authoritarianism” and “nuclear proliferation ...","Forty-five years after Congress passed the War Powers Act in the wake of the Vietnam War, it has finally used it for the first time , to try to end the U.S.-Saudi war on the people of Yemen and to recover its constitutional authority over questions of war and peace. This hasn’t stopped the war yet, and President Trump has threatened to veto the bill. But its passage in Congress, and the debate it has spawned, could be an important first step on a tortuous path to a less militarized U.S. foreign policy in Yemen and beyond.

While the United States has been involved in wars throughout much of its history, since the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. military has been engaged in a series of wars that have dragged on for almost two decades. Many refer to them as “endless wars.” One of the basic lessons we have all learned from this is that it is easier to start wars than to stop them. So, even as we have come to see this state of war as a kind of “new normal,” the American public is wiser, calling for less military intervention and more congressional oversight.

The rest of the world is wiser about our wars, too. Take the case of Venezuela, where the Trump administration insists that the military option is “on the table.” While some of Venezuela’s neighbors are collaborating with U.S. efforts to overthrow the Venezuelan government, none are offering their own armed forces .

The same applies in other regional crises. Iraq is refusing to serve as a staging area for a U.S.-Israeli-Saudi war on Iran. The U.S.’s traditional Western allies oppose Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement and want peaceful engagement, not war, with Iran. South Korea is committed to a peace process with North Korea, despite the erratic nature of Trump’s negotiations with North Korea’s Chairman Kim Jong Un.

So what hope is there that one of the parade of Democrats seeking the presidency in 2020 could be a real “peace candidate”? Could one of them bring an end to these wars and prevent new ones? Walk back the brewing Cold War and arms race with Russia and China? Downsize the U.S. military and its all-consuming budget? Promote diplomacy and a commitment to international law?

Ever since the Bush-Cheney administration launched the present-day “Long Wars,” new presidents from both parties have dangled superficial appeals to peace during their election campaigns. But neither Obama nor Trump has seriously tried to end our “endless” wars or rein in our runaway military spending.

Obama’s opposition to the Iraq war and vague promises for a new direction were enough to win him the presidency and the Nobel Peace Prize , but not to bring us peace. In the end , he spent more on the military than Bush and dropped more bombs on more countries, including a tenfold increase in CIA drone strikes. Obama’s main innovation was a doctrine of covert and proxy wars that reduced U.S. casualties and muted domestic opposition to war but brought new violence and chaos to Libya, Syria and Yemen. Obama’s escalation in Afghanistan, the fabled “graveyard of empires,” turned that war into the longest U.S. war since the U.S. conquest of Native America (1783–1924).

Trump’s election was also boosted by false promises of peace, with recent war veterans delivering critical votes in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. But Trump quickly surrounded himself with generals and neocons; escalated the wars in Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan; and fully backed the Saudi-led war in Yemen. His hawkish advisers have so far ensured that any U.S. steps toward peace in Syria, Afghanistan or Korea remain symbolic, while U.S. efforts to destabilize Iran and Venezuela threaten the world with new wars. Trump’s complaint, “We don’t win anymore,” echoes through his presidency, ominously suggesting that he’s still looking for a war he can “win.”

While we can’t guarantee that candidates will stick to their campaign promises, it is important to look at this new crop of presidential candidates and examine their views — and, when possible, voting records — on issues of war and peace. What prospects for peace might each of them bring to the White House?

Bernie Sanders

Senator Sanders has the best voting record of any candidate on war and peace issues, especially on military spending. Opposing the oversized Pentagon budget, he has only voted for 3 out of 19 military spending bills since 2013. By this measure, no other candidate comes close, including Tulsi Gabbard. In other votes on war and peace, Sanders voted as requested by Peace Action 84 percent of the time from 2011 to 2016, despite some hawkish votes on Iran from 2011 to 2013.

One major contradiction in Sanders’ opposition to out-of-control military spending has been his support for the world’s most expensive and wasteful weapon system: the trillion-dollar F-35 fighter jet. Not only did Sanders support the F-35, he pushed — despite local opposition — to get these fighter jets stationed at the Burlington airport for the Vermont National Guard.

In terms of stopping the war in Yemen, Sanders has been a hero. Over the past year, he and Senators Murphy and Lee have led a sustained effort to shepherd his historic War Powers bill on Yemen through the Senate. Congressman Ro Khanna, whom Sanders has chosen as one of his four campaign co-chairs, has led the parallel effort in the House.

Sanders’ 2016 campaign highlighted his popular domestic proposals for universal health care and social and economic justice but was criticized as light on foreign policy. Beyond chiding Clinton for being “too much into regime change,” he seemed reluctant to debate her on foreign policy, despite her hawkish record. By contrast, during his current presidential run, he regularly includes the military-industrial complex among the entrenched interests his political revolution is confronting, and his voting record backs up his rhetoric.

Sanders supports U.S. withdrawals from Afghanistan and Syria and opposes U.S. threats of war against Venezuela. But his rhetoric on foreign policy sometimes demonizes foreign leaders in ways that unwittingly lend support to the “regime change” policies he opposes — as when he joined a chorus of U.S. politicians labeling Colonel Gaddafi of Libya a “thug and a murderer,” shortly before U.S.-backed thugs actually murdered Gaddafi.

Open Secrets shows Sanders taking in over $366,000 from the “defense industry” during his 2016 presidential campaign, but only $17,134 for his 2018 Senate reelection campaign.

So our question on Sanders is, “Which Bernie would we see in the White House?” Would it be the one who has the clarity and courage to vote “No” on 84 percent of military spending bills in the Senate, or the one who supports military boondoggles like the F-35 and can’t resist repeating inflammatory smears of foreign leaders? It is vital that Sanders should appoint genuinely progressive foreign policy advisers to his campaign, and then to his administration, to complement his own greater experience and interest in domestic policy.

Tulsi Gabbard

While most candidates shy away from foreign policy, Congressmember Gabbard has made foreign policy — particularly ending war — the centerpiece of her campaign.

She was truly impressive in her March 10 CNN Town Hall , talking more honestly about U.S. wars than any other presidential candidate in recent history. Gabbard promises to end senseless wars like the one she witnessed as a National Guard officer in Iraq. She unequivocally states her opposition to U.S. “regime change” interventions, as well as the New Cold War and arms race with Russia, and supports rejoining the Iran nuclear deal. She was also an original cosponsor of Congressman Ro Khanna’s Yemen War Powers bill.

But Gabbard’s actual voting record on war and peace issues, especially on military spending, is not nearly as dovish as that of Sanders. She voted for 19 of 29 military spending bills in the past six years, and she has only a 51 percent Peace Action voting record . Many of the votes that Peace Action counted against her were votes to fully fund controversial new weapons systems, including nuclear-tipped cruise missiles (in 2014, 2015 and 2016); an 11th U.S. aircraft-carrier (in 2013 and 2015); and various parts of Obama’s anti-ballistic missile program, which fueled the New Cold War and arms race she now decries.

Gabbard voted at least twice (in 2015 and 2016) not to repeal the much-abused 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force , and she voted three times not to limit the use of Pentagon slush funds. In 2016, she voted against an amendment to cut the military budget by just 1 percent. Gabbard received $8,192 in “defense” industry contributions for her 2018 reelection campaign.

Gabbard still believes in a militarized approach to counterterrorism, despite studies showing that this feeds a self-perpetuating cycle of violence on both sides.

She is still in the military herself and embraces what she calls a “military mindset.” She ended her CNN Town Hall by saying that being commander-in-chief is the most important part of being president. As with Sanders, we have to ask, “Which Tulsi would we see in the White House?” Would it be the Major with the military mindset, who cannot bring herself to deprive her military colleagues of new weapons systems or even a 1 percent cut from the trillions of dollars in military spending she has voted for? Or would it be the veteran who has seen the horrors of war and is determined to bring the troops home and never again send them off to kill and be killed in endless regime change wars?

Elizabeth Warren

Elizabeth Warren made her reputation with her bold challenges of our nation’s economic inequality and corporate greed and has slowly started to stake out her foreign policy positions. Her campaign website says that she supports “cutting our bloated defense budget and ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy.” But, like Gabbard, she has voted to approve over two-thirds of the “bloated” military spending bills that have come before her in the Senate.

Her website also says, “It’s time to bring the troops home,” and that she supports “reinvesting in diplomacy.” She has come out in favor of the U.S. rejoining the Iran nuclear agreement and has also proposed legislation that would prevent the United States from using nuclear weapons as a first-strike option, saying she wants to “reduce the chances of a nuclear miscalculation.”

Her Peace Action voting record exactly matches Sanders’ for the shorter time she has sat in the Senate, and she was one of the first five senators to cosponsor his Yemen War Powers bill in March 2018. Warren took in $34,729 in “defense” industry contributions for her 2018 Senate reelection campaign.

With regards to Israel, the Senator angered many of her liberal constituents when, in 2014, she supported Israel’s invasion of Gaza that left over 2,000 dead and blamed the civilian casualties on Hamas. She has since taken a more critical position. She opposed a bill to criminalize boycotting Israel and condemned Israel’s use of deadly force against peaceful Gaza protesters in 2018.

Warren is following where Sanders has led on issues from universal health care to challenging inequality and corporate, plutocratic interests, and she is also following him on Yemen and other war and peace issues. But as with Gabbard, Warren’s votes to approve 68 percent of military spending bills reveal a lack of conviction on tackling the very obstacle she acknowledges: “the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy.”

Kamala Harris

Senator Harris announced her candidacy for president in a lengthy speech in her native Oakland, California, where she addressed a wide range of issues, but failed to mention U.S. wars or military spending at all. Her only reference to foreign policy was a vague statement about “democratic values,” “authoritarianism” and “nuclear proliferation,” with no hint that the United States has contributed to any of those problems. Either she’s not interested in foreign or military policy, or she’s afraid to talk about her positions, especially in her hometown in the heart of Barbara Lee’s progressive congressional district.

One issue Harris has been vocal about in other settings is her unconditional support for Israel. She told an AIPAC conference in 2017, “I will do everything in my power to ensure broad and bipartisan support for Israel’s security and right to self-defense.” She demonstrated how far she would take that support for Israel when President Obama finally allowed the United States to join a UN Security Council resolution condemning illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar were among 30 Democratic (and 47 Republican) senators who cosponsored a bill to withhold U.S. dues to the UN over the resolution.

Advertisement:

Faced with grassroots pressure to #SkipAIPAC in 2019, Harris did join most of the other presidential candidates who chose not to speak at AIPAC’s 2019 gathering. She also supports rejoining the Iran nuclear agreement.

In her short time in the Senate, Harris has voted for six out of eight military spending bills , but she did cosponsor and vote for Sanders’ Yemen War Powers bill. Harris was not up for reelection in 2018, but took in $26,424 in “defense” industry contributions in the 2018 election cycle.

Kirsten Gillibrand

After Senator Sanders, Senator Gillibrand has the second-best record on opposing runaway military spending , voting against 47 percent of military spending bills since 2013. Her Peace Action voting record is 80 percent, reduced mainly by the same hawkish votes on Iran as Sanders from 2011 to 2013. There is nothing on Gillibrand’s campaign website about wars or military spending, despite serving on the Armed Services Committee. She took in $104,685 in “defense” industry contributions for her 2018 reelection campaign, more than any other senator running for president.

Advertisement:

Gillibrand was an early cosponsor of Sanders’ Yemen War Powers bill. She has also supported a full withdrawal from Afghanistan since at least 2011, when she worked on a withdrawal bill with then-Senator Barbara Boxer and wrote a letter to Secretaries Gates and Clinton, asking for a firm commitment that U.S. troops would be out “no later than 2014.”

Gillibrand cosponsored the Anti-Israel Boycott Act in 2017 but later withdrew her cosponsorship when pushed by grassroots opponents and the ACLU, and she voted against S.1, which included similar provisions, in January 2019. She has spoken favorably of Trump’s diplomacy with North Korea. Originally a Blue Dog Democrat from rural upstate New York in the House, she has become more liberal as a senator for New York state and now, as a presidential candidate.

Cory Booker

Senator Booker has voted for 16 out of 19 military spending bills in the Senate. He also describes himself as a “staunch advocate for a strengthened relationship with Israel,” and he cosponsored the Senate bill condemning the UN Security Council resolution against Israeli settlements in 2016. He was an original cosponsor of a bill to impose new sanctions on Iran in December 2013, before eventually voting for the nuclear agreement in 2015.

Like Warren, Booker was one of the first five cosponsors of Sanders’ Yemen War Powers bill, and he has an 86 percent Peace Action voting record . But despite serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, he has not taken a public position for ending America’s wars or cutting its record military spending. His record of voting for 84 percent of military spending bills suggests he would not make major cuts. Booker was not up for reelection in 2018 but received $50,078 in “defense” industry contributions for the 2018 election cycle.

Amy Klobuchar

Senator Klobuchar is the most unapologetic hawk of the senators in the race. She has voted for all but one, or 95 percent, of the military spending bills since 2013. She has only voted as requested by Peace Action 69 percent of the time , the lowest among senators running for president. Klobuchar supported the U.S.-NATO-led regime change war in Libya in 2011, and her public statements suggest that her main condition for the U.S. use of military force anywhere is that U.S. allies also take part, as in Libya.

In January 2019, Klobuchar was the only presidential candidate who voted for S.1, a bill to reauthorize U.S. military aid to Israel that also included an anti-BDS provision to allow U.S. state and local governments to divest from companies that boycott Israel. She is the only Democratic presidential candidate in the Senate who did not cosponsor Sanders’ Yemen War Powers bill in 2018, but she did cosponsor and vote for it in 2019. Klobuchar received $17,704 in “defense” industry contributions for her 2018 reelection campaign.

Beto O’Rourke

Former Congress member O’Rourke voted for 20 out of 29 military spending bills (69 percent) since 2013, and had an 84 percent Peace Action voting record . Most of the votes Peace Action counted against him were votes opposing specific cuts in the military budget. Like Tulsi Gabbard, he voted for an 11th aircraft-carrier in 2015, and against an overall 1 percent cut in the military budget in 2016. He voted against reducing the number of U.S. troops in Europe in 2013, and he twice voted against placing limits on a Navy slush fund. O’Rourke was a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and he took in $111,210 from the “defense” industry for his Senate campaign, more than any other Democratic presidential candidate.

Despite an obvious affinity with military-industrial interests, of which there are many throughout Texas, O’Rourke has not highlighted foreign or military policy in his Senate or presidential campaigns, suggesting that this is something he would like to downplay. In Congress, he was a member of the corporate New Democrat Coalition that progressives see as a tool of plutocratic and corporate interests.

John Delaney

Former Congressmember Delaney provides an alternative to Senator Klobuchar at the hawkish end of the spectrum, after voting for 25 out of 28 military spending bills since 2013, and earning a 53 percent Peace Action voting record . He took in $23,500 from “defense” interests for his last congressional campaign, and, like O’Rourke and Jay Inslee, he was a member of the corporate New Democrat Coalition.

Jay Inslee

Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington State, served in Congress from 1993 to 1995 and from 1999 to 2012. Inslee was a strong opponent of the U.S. war in Iraq, and introduced a bill to impeach Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for approving torture by U.S. forces. Like O’Rourke and Delaney, Inslee was a member of the New Democrat Coalition of corporate Democrats, but also a strong voice for action on climate change. In his 2010 reelection campaign, he took in $27,250 in “defense” industry contributions. Inslee’s campaign is very focused on climate change, and his campaign website so far does not mention foreign or military policy at all.

Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang

These two candidates from outside the world of politics bring refreshing ideas to the presidential contest. Spiritual teacher Williamson believes , “Our country’s way of dealing with security issues is obsolete. We cannot simply rely on brute force to rid ourselves of international enemies.” She recognizes that, on the contrary, the U.S. militarized foreign policy creates enemies, and our huge military budget “simply increase(s) the coffers of the military-industrial complex.” She writes, “The only way to make peace with your neighbors is to make peace with your neighbors.”

Williamson proposes a 10- or 20-year plan to transform our wartime economy into a “peace-time economy.” “From massive investment in the development of clean energy, to the retrofitting of our buildings and bridges, to the building of new schools and the creation of a green manufacturing base,” she writes, “it is time to release this powerful sector of American genius to the work of promoting life instead of death.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang promises to “bring our military spending under control,” to “make it harder for the U.S. to get involved in foreign engagements with no clear goal,” and to “reinvest in diplomacy.” He believes that much of the military budget “is focused on defending against threats from decades ago as opposed to the threats of 2020.” But he defines all these problems in terms of foreign “threats” and U.S. military responses to them, failing to recognize that U.S. militarism is itself a serious threat to many of our neighbors.

Julian Castro, Pete Buttigieg, and John Hickenlooper

Neither Julian Castro, Pete Buttigieg, nor John Hickenlooper mentions foreign or military policy on their campaign websites at all.

Joe Biden

Although Biden has yet to throw his hat into the ring, he is already making videos and speeches trying to tout his foreign policy expertise. Biden has been engaged in foreign policy since he won a Senate seat in 1972, eventually chairing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for four years, and becoming Obama’s vice president. Echoing traditional mainstream Democratic rhetoric, he accuses Trump of abandoning U.S. global leadership and wants to see the U.S. regain its place as the “ indispensable leader of the free world.”

Biden presents himself as a pragmatist, saying that he opposed the Vietnam War not because he considered it immoral but because he thought it wouldn’t work. Biden at first endorsed full-scale nation-building in Afghanistan, but when he saw it wasn’t working, he changed his mind, arguing that the U.S. military should destroy Al Qaeda and then leave. As vice president, he was a lonely voice in the Cabinet opposing Obama’s escalation of the war in 2009.

Regarding Iraq, however, he was a hawk. He repeated false intelligence claims that Saddam Hussein possessed chemical and biological weapons and was seeking nuclear weapons , and therefore was a threat that had to be “ eliminated .” He later called his vote for the 2003 invasion a “mistake.”

Biden is a self-described Zionist . He has stated that the Democrats’ support for Israel “comes from our gut, moves through our heart, and ends up in our head. It’s almost genetic.”

There is one issue, however, where he would disagree with the present Israeli government, and that is on Iran. He wrote that “war with Iran is not just a bad option. It would be a disaster ,” and he supported Obama’s entry into the Iran nuclear agreement. He would therefore likely support re-entering it if he were president.

While Biden emphasizes diplomacy, he favors the NATO alliance so that “ when we have to fight , we are not fighting alone.” He ignores that NATO outlived its original Cold War purpose and has perpetuated and expanded its ambitions on a global scale since the 1990s — and that this has predictably ignited a new Cold War with Russia and China.

Despite paying lip service to international law and diplomacy, Biden sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which authorized the U.S. to lead the NATO assault on Yugoslavia and invasion of Kosovo in 1999. This was the first major war in which the U.S. and NATO used force in violation of the UN Charter in the post-Cold War era, establishing the dangerous precedent that led to all our post-9/11 wars.

Like many other corporate Democrats, Biden champions a misleadingly benign view of the dangerous and destructive role the U.S. has played in the world over the past 20 years, under the Democratic administration in which he served as vice president as well as under Republican ones.

Biden might support slight cuts in the Pentagon budget, but he is not likely to challenge the military-industrial complex he has served for so long in any significant way. He does, however, know the trauma of war firsthand, connecting his son’s exposure to military burn pits while serving in Iraq and Kosovo to his fatal brain cancer, which might make him think twice about launching new wars.

On the other hand, Biden’s long experience and skill as an advocate for the military-industrial complex and the U.S.’s militarized foreign policy suggest that those influences might well outweigh even his own personal tragedy if he is elected president and faced with critical choices between war and peace.

Conclusion

The United States has been at war for over 17 years, and we are spending most of our national tax revenues to pay for these wars and the forces and weapons to wage them. It would be foolish to think that presidential candidates who have little or nothing to say about this state of affairs will, out of the blue, come up with a brilliant plan to reverse course once we install them in the White House. It is especially disturbing that Gillibrand and O’Rourke, the two candidates most beholden to the military-industrial complex for campaign funding in 2018, are eerily quiet on these urgent questions.

But even the candidates who are vowing to tackle this crisis of militarism are doing so in ways that leave serious questions unanswered. Not one of them has said how much they would cut the record military budget that makes these wars possible—and thus almost inevitable.

In 1989, at the end of the Cold War, former Pentagon officials Robert McNamara and Larry Korb told the Senate Budget Committee that the U.S. military budget could safely be cut by 50 percent over the next 10 years. That obviously never happened, and our military spending under Bush II, Obama and Trump has outstripped the peak spending of the Cold War arms race.

In 2010, Barney Frank and three colleagues from both parties convened a Sustainable Defense Task Force that recommended a 25 percent cut in military spending. The Green Party has endorsed a 50 percent cut in today’s military budget. That sounds radical, but, because inflation-adjusted spending is now higher than in 1989, that would still leave us with a larger military budget than McNamara and Korb called for in 1989.

Presidential campaigns are key moments for raising these issues. We are greatly encouraged by Tulsi Gabbard’s courageous decision to place solving the crisis of war and militarism at the heart of her presidential campaign. We thank Bernie Sanders for voting against the obscenely bloated military budget year after year, and for identifying the military-industrial complex as one of the most powerful interest groups that his political revolution must confront. We applaud Elizabeth Warren for condemning “the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy.” And we welcome Marianne Williamson, Andrew Yang and other original voices to this debate.

But we need to hear a much more vigorous debate about war and peace in this campaign, with more specific plans from all the candidates. This vicious cycle of U.S. wars, militarism and runaway military spending drains our resources, corrupts our national priorities and undermines international cooperation, including on the existential dangers of climate change and nuclear weapons proliferation, which no country can solve on its own.

We are calling for this debate most of all because we mourn the millions of people being killed by our country’s wars and we want the killing to stop. If you have other priorities, we understand and respect that. But unless and until we address militarism and all the money it sucks out of our national coffers, it may well prove impossible to solve the other very serious problems facing the United States and the world in the 21st century.",Do any of the Democratic presidential candidates understand the power of peace?,Salon,https://www.salon.com/2019/03/30/do-any-of-the-democratic-presidential-candidates-understand-the-power-of-peace_partner/

New Voters’ Register: Baako backs NDC, but says tussle is a ‘storm in a tea cup’

Abdul Malik Kweku Baako Jnr, Managing Editor of the New Crusading Guide newspaper

The National Democratic Congress (NDC) seems to have gained a lot of support in raising an objection to a communique issued by the Electoral Commission.



The ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) and other parties that went to the IPAC meeting have backed the NDC’s claim that the issue of a new voters’ register was not discussed at the meeting.



The EC in a communique after the IPAC meeting indicated there has been a conclusion on a new voters' register after 'an exhaustive deliberation'.



However, the NDC condemned the EC for misleading the public since nothing like that was discussed extensively.



The EC subsequently clarified that the new voters’ register will be in 2020 and that there will be another meeting to discuss it.



Adding his voice to this, the Managing Editor of the New Crusading Guide newspaper says the NDC are ‘justified’ in their claim; however, he claims they could have made their case without engaging in a tussle with the Commission.



“The NDC were justified in their concerns but I think they started from the right premise and drew a wrong conclusion. You brought the attention of the public to the error and that is right, and the EC responded . . . if you start from a premise and then you read into it an election-rigging motive, it doesn’t help . . . My appeal is that if you recognize an error, I’m not saying don’t say it but don’t read into it,” he stated.



Storm in a teacup



Kweku Baako further described the banter between the EC and the NDC as ‘a storm in a teacup’



According to him, “after listening to all sides, it’s obvious there was a problem with the release” . . . however, when it was clarified that the new voters’ register will be done in 2020, “I concluded it’s a storm in a teacup because there will be further consultations”.



“My view is that when this happens; we can issue one statement and clarify, but the continues attack doesn’t help anybody,” he told the EC and the NDC while contributing to a panel discussion on Joy newsfile programme, Saturday.","New Voters’ Register: Baako backs NDC, but says tussle is a ‘storm in a tea cup’",Ghanaweb.com,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/New-Voters-Register-Baako-backs-NDC-but-says-tussle-is-a-storm-in-a-tea-cup-734341

As he had done in previous elections, District 25 New Democratic Party candidate Herb Dickieson had volunteers out bright and early Tuesday morning putting up the first of his election signage.

Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan dropped the writ Tuesday night in Charlottetown, triggering a four-week provincial election campaign.

Then, shortly after 8 a.m. on Wednesday, Dickieson discovered his signage was just a little premature.

“I have people out covering them up,” he told the Journal Pioneer Wednesday morning.

But he wasn’t planning on leaving them covered for long.

On a coffee break, Dickieson was collecting the last of the signatures he needed before reporting to the District 25 returning officer to complete his necessary documents to become a “registered” candidate with Elections P.E.I.

New rules require that candidates be registered with Elections P.E.I. before advertising – including signage – can be initiated. Such registration forms were only available to candidates the morning after the writ and once the returning offices open.

“We want to be in compliance with the Elections P.E.I. rule,” said Dickieson. “We have people out there now correcting that to make sure we’re in full compliance.”

Elections P.E.I. CEO Tim Garrity sent an email to political parties on Tuesday, advising them of the new rule.

DIckieson, who served one term as the District 25 MLA from 1996 to 2000 and ran in other election campaigns, said he was just doing what he had done in previous election campaigns and was not aware of the rule change.

He was not the only candidate in his district to have signs up early.

On a 7:30 to 8:20 a.m. round trip along Highway 2 between Bloomfield and Richmond Wednesday, the Journal Pioneer counted five election signs: one at Coleman Corner promoting Dickieson and four between Portage and Victoria West promoting Liberal incumbent Robert Henderson. Henderson could not be reached for comment on the timing of his signage.

There were similar reports from across the province.

Dickieson subsequently confirmed that his paperwork was filed, and the tarps were being taken off of his signs.

“I’m legal now,” he said.

Garrity confirmed that Elections P.E.I. staff had received several complaints about signage being in contravention with the Elections Expenses Act. He said investigations have been launched.

“The investigation is ongoing at this point, so I can’t comment too much on it right now. We’re involving our legal representatives and we’re investigating any and all complaints that come in around the election signs, using that Section 17 of the Elections Expenses Act.”

According to Garrity no signs advertising parties or candidates should have been out prior to at least 9 a.m.

He said the offices opened, at the earliest, at 9 a.m. on Wednesday.

Candidates first have to register with Elections P.E.I. before they can advertise, he said.

“They have to register with us, and that includes getting their nomination forms filled out and paying their deposit with the returning officers and getting their forms officially signed off by the returning officers as registered candidates.”

By Daren Butler

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Actor Kemal Ulusoy and the rest of his Kurdish theater group lost their jobs along with thousands of others in southeast Turkey after the state seized control of about 100 town councils won by the main pro-Kurdish party at the last local elections.

Voters go to the polls again on Sunday but Ulusoy says the municipal elections are just another performance staged by authorities, after President Tayyip Erdogan warned that the elected officials may again be replaced by state appointees.

""What we are seeing is not democracy,"" said Ulusoy, who has performed plays in Kurdish for nearly 30 years. ""An election is only held as a formality, to give him the appearance of legitimacy. He can still do what he wants.""

Kurds make up about a fifth of Turkey's 82 million population. The southeast, mainly Kurdish, has borne the brunt of a three-decades-old conflict between the state and autonomy-seeking PKK militants that has killed more than 40,000 people.

Erdogan, who has been in power for 16 years, says the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) has ties with the outlawed militant group. The HDP denies links to the PKK.

The HDP, which has strong support in the southeast, hopes to regain control of municipalities seized by the state in 2016, about two years after the last local elections in 2014. State officials known as kayyums were appointed to run the councils.

But Erdogan has said kayyums may be appointed again if new mayors, like their predecessors, are deemed to have ties to the militants.

The 31 actors in the municipal theater in the city of Diyarbakir are among 15,000 council workers who the HDP says lost their jobs after kayyums were appointed.

""This led to spectacular destruction, injustice and oppression in Diyarbakir in art and culture, as it did in every area of society,"" said Ulusoy, who has set up a new theater with colleagues.

His bleak outlook was shared by HDP supporters among tens of thousands of people marking the Kurdish Newroz spring celebration in Diyarbakir who were fiercely critical of state security measures and Erdogan's election campaigning.

""The president uses very divisive language. Anyone who doesn't support him is painted as a traitor,"" said Geylani Alpay, 63, complaining about his vehicle being searched three times on his journey to the Newroz celebrations.

Nearby, thousands of young people linked hands and danced to Kurdish music blaring from loudspeakers, while others waved red, yellow and green HDP flags.

STATE BOOSTS INVESTMENT

The pro-Kurdish party has won the last three parliamentary elections since 2015 comfortably in Diyarbakir and much of the southeast, and Erdogan's AK Party is their only serious rival in the region.

AK Party supporters say the last two years in Diyarbakir under state-appointed mayor Cumali Atilla has brought greater security and improved services after 1.25 billion lira ($224 million) of investments in roads and parks.

""We can sit in the park in the evenings with our wives. We couldn't do that in the past because it was too dangerous,"" said Yilmaz Polat, 37, a cotton farmer.

The PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, took up arms in 1984 and is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. An explosion of violence after a two-year peace process collapsed in 2015 has killed 4,280 people, according to International Crisis Group data.

Diyarbakir's historic Sur district was devastated in the fighting but concrete buildings are now rising in the area and militant violence has dwindled after sustained military operations.

Extensive building of highways, apartment blocks and shopping malls has transformed the appearance of the city.

Cevdet Nasiranli, the AK Party candidate for the city's Kayapinar district, said the situation could deteriorate if the HDP wins. ""It is a vote on peace and confidence,"" he said.

HDP mayoral candidate Selcuk Mizrakli, a former surgeon, said all the state-run municipality had done was carry out HDP projects for which financing had previously been withheld.

He said his party's campaign was hampered by a lack of coverage by an overwhelmingly pro-government media and by security forces which he said harassed HDP campaigners.

""There is a society of fear in Turkey,"" he said. ""The state is behind concrete walls and in armored vehicles.""

Tensions with neighboring Pakistan soared after a suicide bomb attack in the Indian part of the disputed Kashmir region killed 40 Indian paramilitary police last month. The bombing was claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.

That led national sentiment on security and terror-related issues in India to peak at nearly 29 percent in early March after India retaliated with airstrikes on a suspected militant camp in northern Pakistan, according to CVoter polling agency.

However, it has since waned to about 15 percent, as tensions have cooled, the agency said, citing its daily tracker of national sentiment.

“A cliff-fall for (the) security narrative complicates BJP’s positioning as this is one issue where BJP comprehensively dominates the Congress and in fact entire opposition,” CVoter said, referring to Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that will face off against the main opposition Congress in the general election scheduled to begin on April 11.

Pollsters say the airstrikes and nationalist rhetoric had diverted attention away from socio-economic issues, including increasing unemployment and an agrarian crisis, that critics have often used to lambaste Modi’s policies.

The new poll numbers suggest those issues may be back on voters’ minds, CVoter said.

At election rallies in recent weeks the BJP has played up the airstrikes and a subsequent anti-satellite missile test that Modi hailed as making India a military space power. Some opposition parties criticized the anti-satellite test announcement as a political gimmick.

“The impact of mission Shakti (anti-satellite missile) test is anticipated to show in the next few days,” CVoter said.

A coalition led by Modi’s BJP is widely expected to retain power in the looming general election, the world’s biggest democratic exercise with about 900 million eligible voters. Final results of the vote will be available on May 23.

Ed Markey (D-MA; right) and other congressional Democrats listen during a news conference in front of the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 7, 2019, in Washington, D.C. Markey and Ocasio-Cortez held a news conference to unveil their Green New Deal resolution.

(CNN) - House Republicans are hoping to force a vote on the Green New Deal to put House Democrats on the record as to whether they support the sweeping and controversial proposal, though it's not clear the effort will gain traction as Democrats are expected to dismiss it as a political stunt.

House GOP Whip Steve Scalise said at a news conference Wednesday where House Republicans announced their plan that it's important to ""contrast"" the kind of energy policy that their party supports with ""what Nancy Pelosi and her radical leftists are trying to do.""

The concept of a Green New Deal has been championed by progressive party rising stars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and embraced by Democratic 2020 contenders. But the Green New Deal, which calls for a national mobilization of resources to tackle global warming, hasn't been universally embraced by congressional Democrats, though the party is broadly united in calling for action to fight climate change.

Pushing for a vote gives House Republicans an opportunity to put a spotlight on a proposal that they believe divides Democrats.

Republican Rep. Jody Hice of Georgia plans to file a discharge petition in an attempt to bring the Green New Deal resolution to the House floor for a vote. A discharge petition is a procedural tool that can be used to force a floor vote, but only if a majority of House members sign on in support.

Discharge petitions rarely succeed because of how high threshold is to clear. Even if every House Republican signs on in support, roughly 20 House Democrats would still need to sign on in order to force the vote.

""The American people need to know where their representatives stand on this radical proposal, the Green New Deal,"" Hice said. ""Make no mistake about it, regardless of what supporters say, it is a radical proposal that will dramatically take American society further to the left. And I want a vote on it.""

The Georgia Republican added that he hopes there will be enough support from Democrats to force a vote.

""The message to my socialist, Democrat colleagues is very simple: we're looking for at least 20 of them ... we want them to join with Republicans for the sake of a recorded vote on the Green New Deal,"" he said.

That appears improbable, however, especially if House Democrats put up a show of unity like most Senate Democrats did when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought the Green New Deal up for a vote in the Senate on Tuesday.

The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats voted ""present,"" in protest over the vote, which they argued was only intended as a political attack on the nascent proposal.

Hice said on Wednesday that he will file the discharge petition sometime after Easter.

The congressman tentatively plans to file the motion on the House floor in late April, a GOP aide familiar with the discussions told CNN. Once that happens, the congressman will be able to start gathering signatures for the petition, according to the aide. The aide added that Hice is currently ""actively working to garner support among his colleagues,"" for the petition.

CNN has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office to request comment.

The freshman Democrat on Tuesday criticized McConnell's decision to bring the Green New Deal to a vote in the Senate and tweeted that she ""encouraged"" Senate Democrats to vote ""present.""

Republicans have been quick to seize on the fact that Senate Democrats did not vote to advance the measure, casting it as a sign that Democrats are unwilling to stand behind the proposal. Senate Republicans were united in voting ""no"" out of objection to the far-reaching plan, which McConnell has labeled ""a socialist makeover of the entire US economy.""

In response to a tweet from Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming asking, ""Why did Senate Democrats just duck a vote,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote, ""Because I encouraged them to vote present, along w/ others. McConnell tried to rush the #GreenNewDeal straight to the floor without a hearing.""

Ocasio-Cortez added, ""The real question we should be asking: Why does the Senate GOP refuse to hold any major hearings on climate change?""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said that she welcomes the enthusiasm behind the Green New Deal, but she has described it as one of many proposals that will be looked at by committees.

At the start of the new Congress, Pelosi set up a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis that's expected to come up with recommendations for new legislation. In one sign of the efforts Democrats are making to push for climate action, Pelosi along with other House Democrats, unveiled a bill Wednesday that aims to push the United States to uphold the Paris climate agreement.",House Republicans will attempt to force vote on Green New Deal,channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/house-republicans-will-attempt-to-force-vote-on-green-new-deal/1063251618

A coalition led by Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to retain power in a staggered election beginning on April 11, especially given recent tension with old rival Pakistan.

“This country has seen governments that only made slogans, but for the first time, they are seeing a decisive government that knows how to demonstrate its resolve,” Modi told the rally in the city of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh state, which has the most members of parliament of all states.

“Our vision is of a new India that will be in tune with its glorious past,” he said to roars of approval from the crowd who waved BJP flags and chanted for another term for Modi.

The rally was held in a field flanking a main road, surrounded by farm land. Vendors sold BJP mugs, T-shirts and clocks.

The general election, the world’s biggest democratic exercise with about 900 million eligible voters, will be held in phases ending on May 19. Votes will be counted on May 23.

Tension with neighboring Pakistan soared last month after a suicide bomb attack in the Indian part of the disputed Kashmir region killed 40 Indian paramilitary police. The bombing was claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.

India retaliated with an air raid against a suspected militant camp in northern Pakistan.

In December, the main opposition Congress party defeated the BJP in three major rural states as a lack of jobs and weak farm prices dented Modi’s popularity.

But pollsters say Modi’s chances have improved significantly thanks to his tough stance on Pakistan

At the rally, Modi repeatedly spoke about the Indian bombing of the suspected militant camp. He also referred to a test on Wednesday in which India shot down one of its own satellites in space, which he said made India a space power.

Modi also promised economic growth and a prosperous society for all.

Modi’s main challenger is the opposition Congress party, which was for decades India’s dominant political party.

One Modi supporter derided a recent Congress offer to hand out 6,000 rupees ($87) a month to the poorest families if it was voted back into power.

“I know how the economy works,” said chartered accountant Anupam Sharma. “GDP would be decimated.”

But the conference won’t be a showcase for Democratic contenders for a ...,"WASHINGTON (JTA) — The Democratic candidates are steering clear of AIPAC’s big policy conference, but celebrations by the pro-Israel lobby’s critics on the left may be premature.



This week MoveOn, the progressive advocacy group, asked candidates not to attend the conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and has been keeping a list of the no-shows: Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Washington Gov. Jay Inslee; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing Secretary Julian Castro; former Maryland Rep. John Delaney; and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke. (Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul considering an independent run, also is not attending.)

However, only Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who said in 2016 that he “would very much have enjoyed speaking at the AIPAC conference,” explained why he wasn’t going this year in language that closely hews to MoveOn’s arguments for snubbing the event.“He’s concerned about the platform AIPAC is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a two-state solution,” his policy director, Josh Orton, told The Huffington Post.MoveOn’s reasons included AIPAC’s opposition to the Iran deal; its inclusion of speakers who the group says peddle Islamophobic rhetoric; alleged war crimes condoned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; a deal struck by Netanyahu that could bring a far-right party into the Knesset; and AIPAC’s supposed refusal to condemn white nationalists in President Donald Trump’s orbit.But the conference won’t be a showcase for Democratic contenders for a perhaps more prosaic reason: AIPAC hasn’t rolled out the welcome mat.The truth is, AIPAC does not welcome candidates as speakers in non-election years. An AIPAC official confirmed the policy to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, but would not explain it. A best guess is that when there are more than a dozen candidates in play, it’s too unwieldy. By the time March of an election year rolls around, it’s down to three or four, which makes the logistics easier.So why aren’t the other Democrats attending, if only just to schmooze? JTA asked a number of them, and is awaiting their responses, but one plausible reason is that they are campaigning. Until 2007, AIPAC allowed candidates to hold salons on the convention campus — no fundraising allowed, but an opportunity to meet and greet folks who might want to give once they get away from the convention. In 2007, the buzz at Obama’s salon was, well, buzzier than at Hillary Clinton’s, a harbinger of what was to be.AIPAC has ceased the practice, which means just stopping by the convention is wasted time for an eager campaigner. (AIPAC since 2015 has stopped its roll call, when executives and lay leaders would read out the names of the politicians in attendance.)So MoveOn’s “victory” list appears a little disingenuous. Harris, for example, teased her presidential candidacy at AIPAC two years ago and again last year — there are no definitive signs she is turning on the lobby. Delaney’s campaign told The Hill that he wanted to attend — he was “very disappointed” — but had a scheduling conflict.“We have attended every year since he has been in Congress and we very much look forward to being back next year,” his campaign said.But its complaints about AIPAC focus attention about fault lines on the left over Israel.It’s notable that some things Sanders and MoveOn object to about the lobby have changed since 2016, when Sanders was eager to speak to AIPAC — but much has not.MoveOn’s No. 1 reason — that AIPAC took the lead in opposing the Iran nuclear deal — happened in 2015, when the Obama administration negotiated the deal. So did the Israeli elections, when Netanyahu incurred the Obama administration’s wrath for referring to Arab voters in what seemed to be racist terms. Israel’s last war was with Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2014, and before that in 2012. Netanyahu, moreover, is considered among his citizens to be among the Israeli prime ministers who have shown the greatest restraint in wartime.AIPAC has had speakers from Israel’s right who do not want a two-state solution, and in 2016 — the year Sanders thought it was a good idea to speak to the conference — The Nation singled out a number of speakers perceived as Islamophobic. By contrast, this year AIPAC distanced itself from a speaker who attacked Muslim lawmakers, and the speaker withdrew.In 2016, AIPAC did not condemn white nationalists associated with Trump (it did reprimand Trump for dissing Barack Obama), and it is true that unlike other groups, the lobby has not singled out administration figures like Steve Bannon or Stephen Miller. But AIPAC rarely speaks out on any issue that does not directly concern Israel — although it was, uncharacteristically, among the groups that expressed dismay in 2017 after Trump equivocated following the deadly neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia.AIPAC — again, unlike other Jewish groups — did not directly condemn Netanyahu for his deal with the far-right Jewish Power party, but (again unusually for AIPAC) it did condemn the party itself.AIPAC is trying hard to cultivate Democrats, the party that still garners the loyalty of most American Jews, and explicitly backs the two-state solution, while Netanyahu and Trump have both retreated from it, and a number of the conference’s sidebar sessions are about how to get there. Its legislative agenda this year is devoid of the items that only Republicans are advancing, including proposals to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Iran deal damaged the relationship between AIPAC and Democrats, but not beyond repair.So what really has changed for Sanders? He was critical of the lobby in 2016, using its friendship with Hillary Clinton to attack her in a debate, but was also eager to engage.Perhaps the lobby is collateral damage from the broken relationship between Netanyahu and Democrats. It was bad enough that the Israeli leader dissed Obama in 2015 by speaking out against the president’s Iran policy in Congress, but his intimacy with Trump appears to be too much to bear for the party — certainly, the liberal wing that Sanders represents.There’s no question that Sanders’ surprisingly strong candidacy in 2016 made it easier for candidates this year to criticize Israel. This week, O’Rourke and Buttigieg took aim at Israeli policies, and Warren has done so as well. Sanders now posts campaign videos that speak of “apartheid-like” conditions in areas controlled by Israel. Harris, Sanders and Warren defended Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democrat accused of criticizing Israel and AIPAC in terms seen as anti-Semitic, while the party’s congressional leadership was preparing to condemn her.The same three senators, along with Gillibrand and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., another presidential candidate, voted last month against an AIPAC-backed bill that would have protected states with laws targeting the boycott Israel movement. Each senator said the anti-boycott measure infringed on speech freedoms and that they opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel. It remains to be seen whether Booker, Gillibrand, Warren and Harris are comfortable with MoveOn’s boycott of AIPAC.Keep an eye on next year’s policy conference, when candidates will not be able to brush off AIPAC without explaining why — and might be less inclined to do so as they begin to pivot from pleasing the Democratic base and reaching out to independent voters. That’s a reality MoveOn appears to recognize — it has said that attending the conference will not be a litmus test in how it otherwise treats candidates.A version of this post first appeared in The Tell , Ron Kampeas’ weekly newsletter on Jewish news from Washington.

Julian declined to say whether the New ...","The federal New Democrats' fiscal plan for the fall election will be shaped by estimates of how much money Ottawa loses out on each year to international tax-avoidance schemes, the party's finance critic says.

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada's so-called ""tax gap"" to show it can finance big campaign commitments — in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare — by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

article continues below

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40 billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

""The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,"" Julian said in an interview.

""You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion or higher... And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people's lives.""

Details about the NDP's fiscal approach follow last week's release of the final federal budget before October's election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget's release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn't say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party's poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP's ""social democratic economic vision.""

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party's plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness — and he expects this time to be different.

""I think what we needed in 2015 is what we'll have in 2019 — which is the PBO report on the tax gap,"" Julian said. ""In a sense, we're coming with far more evidence to support what we're saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.""

Other political parties have shown interest that the forthcoming tax gap report could be a source of new fiscal space for election promises, said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer.

But Giroux warned any federal government would need to make considerable efforts before they can turn the tax gap estimate into a source of revenue.

""We have to be somewhat prudent because even if we come up with an estimate that's high — and I'm not saying it's the case — it's only the beginning,"" Giroux said in an interview.

He said after identifying how much money is escaping the public treasury, the Canada Revenue Agency ""has to have the willingness to get that money.""","NDP to focus on 'tax gap' in election, says New West MP",New West Record,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/news/ndp-to-focus-on-tax-gap-in-election-says-new-west-mp-1.23771964

Paying for those added costs would require significant tax hikes, bringing U.S. tax levels much closer to those found in Canada or Britain. Preventing that rise is surely a good thing, but Americans have yet to be persuaded to care more about this than they do about the security of Medicare. … [D]esigning a plan so that the risk of failure falls on the federal budget rather than the patient is the right way to go.”There is, however, no sign that Republicans are currently interested in making such a fundamental shift, and it’s likely that Olsen’s advice will fall on deaf ears, leaving Republicans right back where they started on health care.The bottom line: President Trump has made a promise Republicans will have a hard time keeping. He’s done so before — does anyone remember his sudden pledge just before the 2018 midterms to pass a 10 percent tax cut for the middle class?

Eliminate Obamacare – Then What?

Courts Strike a Blow to Trump’s Health Agenda

In the meantime, a federal judge on Thursday struck down the Trump administration’s rule letting small businesses and sole proprietorships join together to buy so-called “association health plans,” writing that those plans were “clearly an end-run” around the Affordable Care Act’s benefit requirements means to protect consumers.

Makinde emerged victorious on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, who ...","Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti says South West leaders must adopt new methods if their quest for restructuring of the country is to be realised.

The governor, who spoke in Ado Ekiti at a national retreat of the Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) which he hosted, said the current tactics being used in agitating for restructuring was defective.

According to him, the Yoruba race needs to be more tactical if it is indeed desirous of actualising its desired restructuring .

He urged the proponents of restructuring in the region to liaise with other zones on how to actualise the plan.

“There are those who entertained fear on this issue of restructuring and whether this is legitimate or not, we must reach out to them because we are not an island onto ourselves.

“We don’t need to be shouting on the roof tops before we get it, but if we want to do it alone, the agitation will fall,’’ he said.

The governor also expressed dismay at the voter apathy in the South West region in the last election, saying a total of 16.2 million were initially registered in the region while the number of those who voted was not impressive.

He said: “In the last presidential poll, Ekiti registered 909,000 voters, only 381,000 voted.

”In Osun 1.67million registered , only 737,000 voted; Ondo, 1.8million registered , 586,00 voted; Oyo, 2.7million registered , 891,000 voted; 2.36million registered in Ogun, 605,000 voted and Lagos with 6.3million, only 1.56million voted.

“This might be caused by deficit of trust or fraudulent multiple registration, but whatever the case was, as long as we remain a constituent part of this country, ARG should reflect on this and act appropriately

“If it was as a result of deficit of voter education, then the ARG and governments need a lot to do.

“Religion also affected us because some people were brainwashed to vote based on religious consideration.’’

Fayemi also expressed the readiness of the APC governors in the region to work with the governor-elect of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, in the overall interest of the region.

Makinde emerged victorious on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party.

Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, who were represented at the retreat, called for a return to the values of the old western region.

The National Chairman of the group, Mr Wale Oshun, reiterated the need for restructuring and advised that it should be taken to the front burner to benefit the Yoruba race.

He also canvassed for true federalism, urging political leaders in the region to take a firm stand to protect the rights of the Yoruba race.

“Our leaders who know that restructuring is an issue that is germane must speak up the way the ACF used to speak on some national issues,’’ he said.",Restructuring: Governor Fayemi urges South-west leaders to adopt new strategies,TODAY,https://www.today.ng/news/politics/restructuring-governor-fayemi-urges-south-west-leaders-adopt-strategies-208457

The new tactical line the Marxist party has adopted is to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance, “to increase the strength of the CPIM and the Left in the Lok Sabha and ensure an alternative secular government.” In 2014, it was to reject the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance and at the same time, “defeat the BJP and its allies.”

Integration of economic growth with generation of jobs to create full employment , putting more money in the hands of people to boost demand, enlarging the resource base by taxing the rich and corporate profits and scrapping the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act and setting a minimum floor for social sector spending as a binding constraint on both the central and state governments were some points common to both manifestos.The CPI (M) also repeated its demand for the “introduction of proportional representation with a partial list system.”

The section Alternative Economic Policies repeated nearly all the points made by the 2014 manifesto and adds two new promises -- of restoring the Planning Commission, which was replaced by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) with NITI Aayog -- and involving state governments in major economic decisions at the central level.

Both manifestos mention the word “rich” five times in context of wealthy people.

Among the new promises, the CPI(M) wants electoral bonds to be scrapped; it wants a halt to “bulk surveillance by state agencies,” and “clear provisions and judicial supervision of any surveillance that violates citizens’ privacy.” It has demanded data privacy laws for protection against appropriation/misuse of users’ private data for commercial use. It also sought curbing of “monopolies that use either telecom such as Jio/Airtel/Vodafone or internet service platforms such as Google, Facebook, etc.”

The CPIM called for an employment guarantee in urban areas, 200 assured days of work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, special packages to support labour-intensive industries in creating jobs, minimum monthly pension not less than 50% of the minimum wage or a monthly ₹6,000 to senior citizens, among other things.

The party’s new promises include passage of the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 to uphold the rights of all transgender persons and removing the lacunae that it claims is present in the current Transgender Persons Bill, 2018.

It supported “legal recognition and protection to same sex couples similar to marriage - ‘civil union’ /’same-sex-partnerships’, legislation/s on similar lines as Special Marriage Act, 1954 so that the partner can be listed as a dependent, for inheritance, alimony in case of divorce etc.”

The party favoured a comprehensive anti-discriminatory bill covering the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities and reservations for them in education and employment.

The chapter on resource mobilization repeated four old suggestions, and added, “Ensure all the loan defaulters who have fled India to avoid legal action are brought to book and the looted monies recovered with interest”. It said the Goods and Services Tax should be overhauled.

Delaney, a former finance entrepreneur spending a chunk of his personal fortune on a long-shot presidential run, joined four other Democratic presidential candidates at HuffPost and the Open Markets Institute’s Heartland Forum in Storm Lake, Iowa.

HuffPost’s Zach Carter asked Delaney whether his emphasis on bipartisanship sugarcoated his history of joining Republicans on legislation gutting Wall Street regulations. Carter noted that over the course of his career in Congress, Delaney had received over $2 million from financial firms and their employees.

Delaney stood behind his policy votes, without specifically addressing the suggestion that he might have been compromised by the campaign cash that he received.

Referring specifically to a vote in favor of a May 2018 law exempting a large swath of banks from key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, Delaney declared, “The things I did in the Dodd-Frank framework were focused on helping community banks, because I think community banks are the backbone of our country.”

KOCHI: The emergence of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as a third force has stirred Kerala’s bipolar political field. The BJP expects a steep increase in its vote share and expects to spring a surprise. “We are confident of winning many seats in the state. The people are fed up with the two fronts and they will support NDA candidates,” BJP state president PS Sreedharan Pillai told Express special correspondent Manoj Viswanathan in an interview. Excerpts:

Q: As the state party chief, what is your expectation about the Lok Sabha election results?

A: The scenario in Kerala has changed and we are confident of winning many seats in the state. Our party base has expanded which will reflect in the vote share. We had a meagre 10 per cent vote share in 2014 LS polls, which increased to 15 per cent in 2016 Assembly polls. Now, we are expecting a vote share of 25 per cent, which will make it a triangular contest.

Q: What are the factors you think will tilt the electoral balance in your favour?

A: All opinion polls have indicated that Narendra Modi will return to power. Kerala was not able to support the Modi Government in 2014, which the people want to correct this time. It is the achievements of the Modi Government that will tilt the scale in our favour. We have achieved what no other governments could not do.

The government has launched a slew of development projects in Kerala which will help garner more neutral votes. Besides popular schemes like Jan Aushadhi, Ayushman Bharat and projects aimed at ensuring health, food and potable water to all have won accolades. People will cast their vote considering our performance.

Q: Do you think the Sabarimala agitation will help the BJP?

A: The police atrocities against protesting devotees at Sabarimala have created a deep wound in the minds of the people. Cases were foisted against the devotees and hundreds were tortured and put up in jail. The devotees are pained by the arrogant attitude of the government. They will cast their votes in favour of the NDA to register their protest. Sabarimala will have an impact on the poll outcome.

Q: In Kerala, where minority voters hold the key, how do you plan to reach beyond the traditional vote base?

A: There is a visible change in the approach of the Christian community which will benefit the BJP this time. I can’t reveal our strategy but we are expecting a shift in the voting pattern. Community organisations like the NSS and the SNDP Yogam maintain a good relationship with us and we expect their support. All these factors will have a positive impact.

Q: Why do you think the BJP can win the election on development plank?

A: Because the Modi Government has made the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The country has achieved a growth rate of 7.3 per cent. The value of the currency has improved by 22 per cent. India’s foreign exchange reserve has touched a record high.

While ODM held its internal elections in August 2015, Jubilee, the ruling party, has had no democratically elected office bearers since its formation in the lead-up to the 2017 polls.

Jubilee, headed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, and Raila Odinga’s ODM, are expected to invest heavily in the internal polls to buttress their bastions as springboards for the presidential contest, now 41 months away.

The polls are all important because they are part of a democratic process through which parties recruit new members, raid opponents’ turfs and strengthen grassroots support.

Internal polls also gauge the parties’ individual strengths to project any formidable performance in upcoming presidential contests because it is by such process that various candidates for elective seats are picked.

GRASSROOTS

Grassroots leaders are the bedrock of presidential nominations as they make up the crucial party decision-making organs, including the National Delegates Convention, which elects the presidential flag-bearers.

The Star has established that the two parties are laying the ground for the crucial elections, which are likely litmus tests for the outfits’ unity and grip on their bastions.

Mismanagement may sink them into uncharted political waters that would negatively impact their 2022 chances.

Previously, such elections have triggered vicious fallouts, violence and even resulted in the formation of fringe parties.

Jubilee secretary general and Cabinet Secretary without portfolio Raphael Tuju told the Star that the ruling party plans to conduct its inaugural grassroots elections early next year.

Tuju insists the party is intact and will go on with its poll preparations. “Unless there is something like a legal order for an extension, we plan to do our elections before March 2020 to ensure that the same does not interfere with competitive politics in 2022,” Tuju said.

He said if elections are left too close to the 2022 polls, they would impact negatively on the party’s performance.

The elections will come at a time when the governing party is staring at an implosion triggered by widening cracks over government policies, including Uhuru's onslaught against corruption.","Jubilee, ODM gear up for do-or-die party polls",The Star,https://www.the-star.co.ke/siasa/2019-03-30-jubilee-odm-gear-up-for-do-or-die-party-polls/

Brian Kemp’s desk.

Throughout the day, vulnerable Republicans were spotted in deep conversations over the measure, and its chief sponsor conceded that some were so “terrified” that they could endanger the vote.

House Speaker David Ralston raised the suspense by delaying the vote for three days before calling it shortly after a lunch break on Friday. Asked earlier in the day its chances of coming up, he said “stay tuned.”

Kemp put his political capital on the line with an unequivocal endorsement, and he sent deputies to help whip the votes. He’s set to sign it after the legislative session ends, perhaps in mid-April.



When the final votes were tallied, six state lawmakers crossed party lines to vote on the measure, which eked through the House by a 92-78 vote. It needed 91 votes to succeed. The Senate voted last week strictly on party lines to pass the measure.

State Rep. Ed Setzler and other supporters had little room to spare: The vote earlier this month was 93-73. And the longer the wait, the more time for opponents to rally against it.

Setzler said in an interview that he initially had closer to 100 supporters, but several were absent Friday.

“There were very, very aggressive attacks by our political opponents trying to politicize this, trying to twist the issue,” said Setzler, blaming Democratic “vitriol” for the narrow vote.

“I will call out the members of our party who say they are for us, and voted for this bill and pushed it over the top,” said state Rep. Erica Thomas of Austell. “This is a mess.”

Five Republicans voted against the measure, including two who also opposed it earlier this month: State Reps. Deborah Silcox of Sandy Springs and Butch Parrish of Swainsboro.

Joining them were two Republicans who were absent during the last vote. State Rep. Sharon Cooper, who chairs the House Health Committee that initially approved the bill, and state Rep. Chuck Martin of Alpharetta.

In an interview, Martin said he’s a staunch opponent of abortion rights and pointed to his support for past restrictions. But he said he voted against the latest measure because it would “criminalize the practice of medicine.”

“I’m pro-life and I’m going to go home with my head up pro-life,” he said. “This bill gives me concerns that even proponents say it’s more likely than not to be unconstitutional and may not ever be enforced. That gives me pause to the pro-life cause.”

And one GOP lawmaker, state Rep. Jay Powell of Camilla, voted for the measure earlier this month but against it on Friday. He could not immediately be reached for comment.

Eight other lawmakers were excused: Republicans Dave Belton of Buckhead, Gerald Greene of Cuthbert, Brett Harrell of Snellville, Jeff Jones of Brunswick, Todd Jones of Cumming, Dave Rutledge of McDonough and Ron Stephens of Savannah. Democrat Mickey Stephens of Savannah was also absent.

191,ScienceAndTechnology,2019-03-29T11:41:00.0000000Z,"Markey is outraged; he claims Republicans just want to sow discord within the Democratic party, portray Democrats as favouring ... him merely by asking for his views about the Green New Deal. Ocasio-Cortez has no such qualms. When asked whether ...","Twenty-nine-year-old ex-bartender and freshman U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez received thunderous environmentalist and media acclaim when she introduced her Green New Deal resolution in the House and Ed Markey submitted it in the Senate.

It was quickly endorsed or cosponsored by scores of other house and senate Democrats, including many who want to run against President Donald Trump in 2020.

But within days, the deal was subjected to rigorous analysis (and ridicule) by energy experts, Trump, Republicans, conservative pundits and even some Democrats. Their disdain is well-founded.

Asserting yet again that “manmade climate change” poses an “ existential threat ” to people and planet – with only a dozen years before total disaster strikes – the Green New Deal demands that the United States convert to 100 per cent “renewable” energy within 10 years. It also proclaims an equally urgent need to abandon free enterprise capitalism in favour of 100 per cent socialist economic and “social justice” policies.

In the energy arena, the deal requires that fossil fuels, nuclear power and even waste-to-energy and large-scale hydroelectric facilities be eliminated from the US energy mix. Coal, oil and natural gas leasing and development on federally controlled western lands would be banned, as would exports of those fuels.

Internal combustion cars, trucks, buses, trains and boats would be replaced with electric versions or eradicated. Airplanes would be replaced by high-speed rail. And every house and building in America would be gutted, rebuilt or retrofitted with “state of the art efficiency” technologies. That’s for starters.

The original draft resolution (since replaced on Ocasio-Cortez’s website) even called for getting rid of “farting cows” – to prevent methane from increasing above its current minuscule 0.0017 per cent of the atmosphere. So bugs not beef in our diets – and no more cheese, milk, yogurt or ice cream.

In the social justice and fairness arena, the deal provides that every American would get government-guaranteed jobs, with “family-sustaining” wages and pensions; free college or trade school; “healthy organic” food; “safe, affordable, adequate” and energy-efficient homes; and support for ethnic and economic “communities” that “historically” were harmed “first and most” by “dirty energy.”

Saturday Night Live could not have crafted a better parody of energy, economic and scientific reality.

But Ocasio-Cortez is determined to have her deal brought up for a vote in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi worries about the spectacle that would ensue. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is equally determined to have a vote. Markey is outraged; he claims Republicans just want to sow discord within the Democratic party, portray Democrats as favouring extremist policies and sabotage the plan.

Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Menendez threatened to call police on a reporter who was “harassing” him merely by asking for his views about the Green New Deal.

Ocasio-Cortez has no such qualms. When asked whether implementing her deal would require “massive government intervention,” she replied : “It does. Yeah. I have no problem saying that.” Moreover, she added, we shouldn’t point fingers and say China, India or Russia aren’t doing anything like this. We shouldn’t “hold ourselves to a lower bar.” We should “choose to lead” the world in this transition.

Lead the world in economic suicide, environmental degradation, plummeting living standards, shorter life spans and societal upheaval would be a more accurate description of her proposal.

But at least Democrats and environmentalists have now made clear what they’ll do to America’s energy, economy, jobs, transportation, infrastructure and society if they regain control of the House, Senate, White House, deep state and courts.

What they’re not doing, discussing or even thinking about is how they intend to achieve their energy-climate-socialist nirvana, how many trillions of dollars it would cost, how many millions of good jobs would be eliminated before their promised job-creation programs theoretically kick in and exactly how they plan to deal with the enormous human and environmental impacts.

Ocasio-Cortez says don’t worry about the price tag. Just tax the rich more and borrow trillions more. Whether the cost is $1 trillion per year or $40 trillion to $100 trillion in total , that’s an ignorant, cavalier response. Either way, she must provide the numbers, calculations and wherewithal – transparently and with full debate.

And on environmental matters, Ocasio-Cortez and her cosponsors have no clue what they are talking about.

America has over a century of coal, oil and natural gas that should be used. It has vast quantities of limestone, copper, iron, and rare earth and other strategic metals that would be essential for the wind turbines, solar panels, biofuel operations, massive backup battery arrays, and thousands of kilometres of new electricity transmission lines that the Green New Deal envisions. Is there a snowball’s chance in hell that they would open highly mineralized western and Alaskan lands for exploration and mining?

Their intransigence on those resources means giving up bonuses, rents, royalties, taxes and millions of high-paying jobs. Billions of dollars in revenues to government will be replaced by billions of dollars in subsidies from government. America won’t even be able to manufacture energy systems because it won’t have either the reliable, affordable fuels to operate factories nor the necessary raw materials.

Meanwhile, the rest of the world will continue to use fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases, surge ahead economically – and sell us trillions of dollars of Green New Deal energy systems. Those that come from China might even have grid-hacker-friendly portals built right into their motherboards.

Shuttering nuclear and hydro power plants – and converting transportation and shipping systems from gasoline and diesel – would mean the U.S. will need twice as much electricity as it generates today. Closing waste-to-energy facilities would add to those demands – and to landfill requirements.

Contrary to claims by green deal advocates, electricity rates would likely skyrocket.

The deal will also kill people, by making it hard for poor families and pensioners to afford adequate heat in winter. And just imagine countless stranded electric cars, trucks and buses clogging highways, especially during snow storms, as their batteries go dead … and hundreds of people die of exposure.

Given all that, there should be no thunderous applause. And no Green New Deal.

Curio Wellness stated in its lawsuit filed Monday that the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission’s new licensing process violates existing state regulations and jeopardizes the more than $10 million the company has invested to grow, process and sell marijuana products.

But reaction was swift and fierce from state lawmakers, regulators, other cannabis growers and patients. On social media and in other public venues, Curio’s critics said the lawsuit would derail a yearlong effort to increase diversity in an industry that largely cut out minorities from winning licenses. An “Occupy Curio” event organized by critics is scheduled for Saturday at the company’s cannabis store in Timonium.

“It’s simply not true this lawsuit was intended to challenge the effort to improve diversity in our industry,” said Curio founder and CEO Michael Bronfein, a prominent national and state Democratic Party supporter, in a statement Friday. “In fact, Curio has always supported this effort and will continue to do so.”

Bronfein said he decided to withdraw a lawsuit whose merits he still supports but that has thrust him and his company into a swirl of accusations that he and Curio do not support diversity.

“I raised my children here and built my life here, and nothing hurts me more than being at the heart of a conversation that divides our community,” he wrote. “I have seen the concerns from our customers on social media about racial insensitivity. I have seen comments and accusations that in no way reflect the values of this company and are not an accurate depiction of the hardworking people of all races and ethnicities I work with every day.”

Read Curio founder and CEO Michael Bronfein's full statement »

University of Baltimore President Kurt Schmoke said Bronfein “was upset because some people called him a racist.”

“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Schmoke said. “Whatever issues one may have business-wise, you can debate that. But in terms of his character — he’s an outstanding citizen and absolutely not a racist.”

Curio’s lawsuit does not address diversity. Instead, it states that investors spent millions of dollars on the operation based on regulations that promised a “strictly limited number” of licenses. To award more licenses would jeopardize the investments of Curio and 13 other companies that have grower licenses.

The company, which also holds licenses to process cannabis products and to sell them, even acknowledged that the commission can award new licenses. But the lawsuit stated that the commission did not follow regulations that state that any such awards must be based on a market analysis that has not been conducted.

Commission Chairman Brian Lopez, who was named as a defendant in Curio’s lawsuit, said the law hashed out last year states that a demand study cannot be conducted until 2024 when the industry has “had time to mature.”

Lopez and Del. Cheryl Glenn, a Baltimore Democrat who has been involved for years in developing regulations for the industry, said that the state published a disparity study that examined the market and showed that minorities are disadvantaged.

Minority firms lost out in the first round of bidding for 15 medical marijuana growing licenses. Based on the disparity study’s findings, the General Assembly passed compromise legislation in 2018 to expand the marijuana growing operations to try to give minorities an ownership role.

Glenn said Curio and Bronfein have been “standing alone” with this lawsuit and that the rest of the industry “demands diversity.”

“No one wants in 2019 to have a trillion dollar industry be controlled by all white men,” Glenn said. “We have had widespread support.”

The Maryland Wholesale Medical Cannabis Trade Association, which represents growers and processors, rejected the lawsuit Monday and said “the current application process should continue.” One grower, the group said, “does not reflect the desire of the majority of companies in the industry” to support more diversity.

Glenn said Bronfein’s opposition to last year’s legislative compromise shocked her.

“I said, ‘Are you kidding me?’” Glenn said. “We don’t have any diversity in this industry and you want us to wait while you create a monopoly.”

Bronfein said in his statement that he supports efforts to improve diversity.

“At Curio, diversity is not just a goal we mindlessly put on paper, it’s not just about affirmative action or corporate social responsibility,” he wrote. “It’s who we are. It’s the values we live by. It’s our culture — from management to our store floor.”

He wrote that 36 percent of Curio’s employees are female and 38 percent are African American.

“But over the last several days I have heard from my team that they are hearing from friends and family that they work for a company that doesn’t want to see economic benefits extended to all corners of our diverse state,” he wrote. “My commitment to diversity is not a business decision but a personal commitment rooted in the belief that it’s simply the right thing to do.”

He said he and his wife established a scholarship at the University of Baltimore that awards between two and four scholarships for African American students majoring in accounting.

William Jews, a prominent African American businessman and former chief executive of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield in Maryland, also issued a statement saying that Bronfein has long been an advocate for diversity.","Amid backlash, Baltimore County cannabis firm drops lawsuit trying to halt Maryland from awarding new licenses",The Baltimore Sun,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-cannabis-lawsuit-dropped-20190329-story.html

EC’s announcement on new register for 2020 reckless – Franklin Cudjoe

IMANI Africa President, Franklin Cudjoe

IMANI Africa President, Franklin Cudjoe says the Electoral Commission (EC) announcement of plans to compile a new voters register for the 2020 general elections was reckless.



Speaking on The Big Issue, Mr. Cudjoe said the move towards a new register is being rushed given the malcontent from a major stakeholder like the National Democratic Congress (NDC).



He also criticised the manner in which the EC made the announcement, which came in a press release.



“Presumably, for a big announcement like this, all parties should be on board. It looks as if this is quite a reckless means of communicating a major decision that had not been thought through properly by all parties.”



Beyond this, Mr. Cudjoe felt the EC’s direction was at odds with its resolve to cut down costs.



The Chairperson of Commission, Jean Mensa, was in January complaining about the high cost of conducting elections in Ghana.



“In 2016, the cost of elections in Ghana was 12 dollars per voter compared to 9 dollars in Nigeria and 5 dollars per voter in Tanzania in 2015. How can election monitoring bodies streamline their processes to reduce cost,” she said at the time.



In view of this, Mr. Cudjoe questioned how “you arrive at a decision like this without taking into consideration the normal cost of how proper registers are done is confounding.”



“I’m worried that the same issue of the costing element which is the most important matter in all of this apparently is not being adhered to,” he added.



The EC’s decision for a new register came after an Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) meeting on Wednesday.



The EC said it arrived at the decision in consultation with political parties.



It has said the new register will include enhancing features, making it worthy of Ghana’s democracy.



Reacting to the EC’s announcement, the NDC demanding the withdrawal of the communique issued by the EC insisting that no consensus was reached.



According to the party, never was such a decision taken during the Wednesday IPAC meeting.



“In fact, the compilation of a new voters’ register was only mentioned in passing by the EC during a discussion on limited registration. There certainly was no “extensive deliberations “ on this particular matter,” the party said in a statement.

Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti says South West leaders must adopt new methods if their quest for restructuring of the country is to be realised.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor, who spoke in Ado Ekiti at a national retreat of the Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) which he hosted, said the current tactics being used in agitating for restructuring was defective.

According to him, the Yoruba race needs to be more tactical if it is indeed desirous of actualising its desired restructuring .

He urged the proponents of restructuring in the region to liaise with other zones on how to actualise the plan.

“There are those who entertained fear on this issue of restructuring and whether this is legitimate or not, we must reach out to them because we are not an island onto ourselves.

“We don’t need to be shouting on the roof tops before we get it, but if we want to do it alone, the agitation will fall,’’ he said.

The governor also expressed dismay at the voter apathy in the South West region in the last election, saying a total of 16.2 million were initially registered in the region while the number of those who voted was not impressive.

He said: “In the last presidential poll, Ekiti registered 909,000 voters, only 381,000 voted.

” In Osun 1.67million registered , only 737,000 voted; Ondo, 1.8million registered , 586,00 voted; Oyo, 2.7million registered , 891,000 voted; 2.36million registered in Ogun, 605,000 voted and Lagos with 6.3million, only 1.56million voted.

“This might be caused by deficit of trust or fraudulent multiple registration, but whatever the case was, as long as we remain a constituent part of this country, ARG should reflect on this and act appropriately

“If it was as a result of deficit of voter education, then the ARG and governments need a lot to do.

“ Religion also affected us because some people were brainwashed to vote based on religious consideration.’’

Fayemi also expressed the readiness of the APC governors in the region to work with the governor-elect of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, in the overall interest of the region.

Makinde emerged victorious on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party.

Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, who were represented at the retreat, called for a return to the values of the old western region.

The National Chairman of the group, Mr Wale Oshun, reiterated the need for restructuring and advised that it should be taken to the front burner to benefit the Yoruba race.

He also canvassed for true federalism, urging political leaders in the region to take a firm stand to protect the rights of the Yoruba race.

“Our leaders who know that restructuring is an issue that is germane must speak up the way the ACF used to speak on some national issues,’’ he said.",Restructuring: Fayemi urges S/West leaders to adopt new strategies,thenewsnigeria.com.ng,https://www.thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2019/03/restructuring-fayemi-urges-s-west-leaders-to-adopt-new-strategies/

Saharareporters had reported ...","Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), may have incurred the wrath of the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, for his role in the political logjam currently threatening the peace of Adamawa state.

Consequently, she is currently plotting his replacement in the new cabinet, for daring to oppose her political preferences in their home state of Adamawa.

The SGF and Mrs. Buhari, SaharaReporters learnt, have differed sharply on the choice of the next Governor of the state. While Aisha Buhari is allegedly not disposed to having Jibrilla Bindow reelected for a second term, Mustapha would simply damn the consequences to have Bindow return.

As gathered, Mustapha and Bindow have sealed a succession pact, meaning all things being equal, the former will succeed the latter in 2023. Mustapha, it would be recalled, lost the APC ticket to Bindow in 2015.

This perhaps in a sense defines the clash of interests between Aisha and her husband's appointee, which of course, manifested way back during the governorship nomination process of the All Progressives Congress (APC).

Mustapha, as gathered, interfaced with the Adams Oshiomhole-led party hierarchy for Bindow to emerge, to the chagrin of the First Lady and her preferred candidate, Mahmood Halilu Ahmed, who is better known as Modi.

But it was not only Aisha who suffered the humiliating defeat, because, like her, former SGF Babachir Lawal and Mohammed Buba Marwa both felt that Bindow had shown deficiencies in many ways, as such, he should be upstaged.

The trio had backed Modi to take over from Bindow on grounds of alleged incompetence. But SGF Mustapha defied them all and managed to secure the party's ticket for Bindow.

Against this background, the wife of the president had openly campaign against Bindow after President Muhammadu Buhari's reelection.

Aisha Buhari, who hails from Adamawa State, is known for her outspokenness, so she had no qualms openly criticising the leadership style of Bindow and urging the electorate to vote him out.

Speaking in Hausa parlance, an audio of which went viral on social media platforms just a week to the March 9 governorship election, Aisha had said: “As an indigene of Adamawa myself, I want to use this medium to call on our people to vote credible leaders this time.

""Recall even my husband had counselled voters to vote wisely this time round. I'm here to stress just the same issue; don't return to power people who are wont to deception and lies.”

She further counselled the electorate thus: ""Do not repeat the mistake of voting people with questionable academic credentials; we need leaders who have enough education to govern our state"".

However, the SGF thinks differently, as he has always defied Mrs. Buhari on Adamawa politics, especially on how she would want leaders to emerge.

On the inconclusive Governorship election, sources said the First Lady has been worried since news of Adamawa's inconclusive governorship election broke out.

""She is particularly concerned about how the situation may threaten the fragile peace of the state,” a source said.

Madam Buhari, the source further said, was dismayed to have heard that SGF Mustapha was allegedly bankrolling the lawsuit of the Movement of Restoration for Defence of Democracy (MRDD), and its governorship candidate, Rev. Eric Theman.

It is widely speculated that Mustapha is footing the legal cost in the ongoing MRDD suit aimed at canceling the inconclusive governorship election, to clear the coast for fresh polls, hoping to achieve Bindow's reelection at all cost.

But the wife of the President feels the move is capable of setting the state on fire, just as Babachir, who belongs to her camp, has already called on Bindow to concede defeat to Ahmed Umar Fintiri, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses” in Canadian ...","OTTAWA – Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was cautioned about a potential “collision” with the prime minister over the SNC-Lavalin file by outgoing Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, a newly-released audio recording reveals. This caution came a month before she was shuffled out of her role, and nearly two months before the scandal began unfolding publicly.

According to an audio recording of a conversation that the pair had, submitted to the House Justice Committee by Wilson-Raybould, Wernick said he was worried what might happen if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould remained at “loggerheads” about whether or not to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to the Quebec engineering firm.

In the audio, Wilson-Raybould can be heard issuing repeated and stern warnings that senior officials pressuring her over the SNC-Lavalin case would “look like nothing but political interference” if the Quebec construction and engineering company were granted deferred prosecution. By the time of her recorded conversation with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould says she had already endured months of intense lobbying from such officials.

She said in the audio that she was absolutely confident in her decision -- to back the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision not to grant the agreement and to continue pursuing the criminal charges -- and in response, Wernick said he was “worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

In a statement late Friday, Trudeau’s office said that he was “not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” and that the PMO was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

The PMO statement reiterates that Trudeau wishes she would have gone to him directly about the matter, reinforcing his message that there “was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months” between all key actors in this affair.

“I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,” Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario said in a statement, according to The Canadian Press. According to his lawyer, Wernick was not aware the call had been recorded until it was released on Friday.

“She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar,” CP quotes him as saying.

The 17-minute audio file was provided to all members of the House Justice Committee on Friday, as part of the new and supplementary evidence related to the SNC-Lavalin scandal that she handed over days ago.

The 43-pages of additional material also includes a 21-page written statement, as well as screen shots of text messages and copies of emails that she referenced during her initial testimony, adding more fodder to the continuously developing controversy that’s dominated political headlines for the last two months.

The secret recording is of a Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick that both parties have previously testified to. In the recording Wilson-Raybould can be heard saying that she was trying to protect Trudeau by issuing these cautions about prosecutorial independence.

She said the way the case was being handled “screams of” political interference and that while she agrees jobs are important, the issue is how it would look if federal prosecutors dropped the criminal charges of fraud and corruption, in exchange for a remediation agreement.

Throughout the scandal -- which touched off on Feb. 7 when The Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to interfere in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin -- the federal Liberals have cited the 9,000 jobs at stake as their main motivator for any actions in this case.

Should SNC-Lavalin be found guilty, they could face a 10-year ban on applying for federal contracts, leading to the company having to move out of Canada.

“I feel that I am giving him my best advice. And if he doesn’t accept that advice then it’s his prerogative to do what he wants. But I’m trying to protect the prime minister from political interference, perceived or otherwise,” she said.

Wernick -- who was not made aware during the recording that he was being taped -- can also be heard saying that he “respects” where Wilson-Raybould was coming from, but that Trudeau’s view was that “he’s not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He’s asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal, Wernick said.

“You’re not just being attorney general, you’re the minister of justice and a cabinet [minister] – and, you have context within which you exercise your roles and your responsibilities. Like, I’m not seeing anything inappropriate here,” Wernick can be heard saying.

Chair of the committee, Anthony Housefather, has said that ""no redactions have been made"" to Wilson-Raybould’s submission by the committee, though there are portions of the submission that appear to have been redacted by Wilson-Raybould before it was submitted.

Wilson-Raybould, who is still a member of the Liberal caucus, provided this evidence to further bolster the testimony she gave to the committee on Feb. 27, and to respond to contradicting stories that others have offered since her appearance.

RECORDING OF CALL WITH WERNICK

During her initial testimony on this phone call, Wilson-Raybould said she was alone and took the call from home. She said that Wernick wanted to communicate where Trudeau was at regarding the file, and spoke about the company potentially moving its headquarters.

She quoted him saying “I think he is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another....So he is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.”

When asked about this call during his follow up testimony, Wernick said that it was not his recollection of that call. “I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” Wernick said.

“I never raised partisan considerations at any time. I reminded her repeatedly that she was the final decision-maker. I did not attempt to influence her decision. I was giving her relevant context about public interest considerations for a decision that was hers to take. I never suggested consequences for her,” Wernick testified.

The audio call largely confirmed Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, but also backed up Wernick’s assertion that he did not make any direct partisan considerations, like Quebec votes, which Wilson-Raybould has alleged she was consistently reminded of while the file was on her desk. Though he did cite a “rising anxiety” following job losses in Oshawa and tough times in Calgary.

In the recording you can hear her taking a deep breath before the conversation begins.

“I actually feel really uncomfortable having this conversation because it’s wrong,” Wilson-Raybould says on the tape.

“Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? This is not just about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like, breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence,” Wilson-Raybould asks Wernick about Trudeau.

“Well I don’t think he sees it as that,” Wernick said, offering that it was a case of people talking past eachother.

“Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael,” she replied.

The conversation ended with Wilson-Raybould saying that she was “waiting for the other shoe to drop,” and that ""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just stuck doing the best job that I can.""

After she got off the call, the new evidence shows that she texted her then-chief of staff Jessica Prince that “the s**** is going to hit the fan.”

In her written submission Wilson-Raybould said she recorded the conversation because she “I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She said she had never done this before, and has not done so since, recognizing that her recording of this conversation would otherwise be inappropriate

Law societies in Canada prohibit lawyers from knowingly recording conversations with clients without their knowledge, including the Law Society of Ontario, which Wilson-Raybould belongs to. In a statement the Society told CTV News that it “does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

“I did this simply to ensure that my notes were accurate and given the ongoing pressure and attempts to interfere in this case, the nature of conversations that had occurred… and my strong suspicion that this matter would continue to escalate in even more inappropriate ways,” she wrote.

Her unprecedented decision to then make the recording public as part of her submission was done, she says, to allow Canadians to decide for themselves whether Wernick’s comments amount to the “veiled threats” that she alleges, and which he denies.

Wernick will soon be retiring from his job as Canada’s top public servant, a decision he says is because there ""is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties,"" after both the Conservatives and New Democrats have called for his resignation given his role in the still unfolding controversy.

COPIES OF TEXTS, EMAILS

In her initial hours-long committee appearance she offered an in-depth account of approximately 20 exchanges --10 phone calls and 10 meetings -- specifically on the SNC-Lavalin case. She also worked through a chronology of communications, ranging from in-person meetings and phone calls, to text messages and emails, from 11 senior staffers from the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and the finance minister's office.

Throughout her testimony, she cautioned there were limitations in her ability to speak broadly about the case because of the specifics of the waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had issued.

What she has handed over to the committee stays within the lines of what is permitted in the waiver, which includes any relevant information related to the case against SNC-Lavalin over her years-long tenure as attorney general.

Contained within the new documents are transcripts as well as screen shots of conversations she or Prince had. These include email exchanges with members of Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office who the documents describe as being involved in the “mucking around” on the case.

In one it details a phone call Prince had with Morneau’s deputy chief of staff Justin To, in which he allegedly said that Wilson-Raybould had “a philosophical problem” with the entire promise of a deferred prosecution agreement, which remains a yet-to-be-used tool that this government passed through an omnibus budget bill last year.

“She hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To is quoted as saying to Prince, who said that was incorrect.

It also includes the conversation between Wilson-Raybould and Prince about a meeting Prince was asked to have with Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford and then-principal adviser Gerald Butts.

In the instance of the meeting between Trudeau’s top two staffers and Prince, the text messages back up Wilson-Raybould’s telling of the interactions, and contradicts Butts saying during his March 6 committee appearance that “there was no urgency to attend that meeting.”

The meeting request was labeled “URGENT” the documents show.

Though the texts do not offer any evidence to dispute Butts’ saying that the recounting of the exchange with Prince was taken out of context and that he had a ""very different recollection of that meeting.""

MORE DETAILS ON RESIGNATION

Wilson-Raybould’s submission also shed new light on the series of events that led to her ultimately resigning from her role as veterans’ affairs minister, which she was shuffled into in January.

She had previously told the committee that she believed she was shuffled out of her job because of her refusal to change her mind about the case, but in the new statement Wilson-Raybould said she took Trudeau at his word when he insisted that wasn’t the case.

Though, at the time she says she made the decision to resign if her replacement decided to issue a directive to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin matter, “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular.”

A deferred prosecution agreement has not been pursued by current Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, though the government has made signals that they aren’t ruling it out.

She also confirmed that she was offered the Indigenous services job, as Butts had testified. She said she was shocked they’d offer it to her since she says she made it clear from the moment the Liberals started assembling a transition team, that she’d never be able to fill that role.

Wilson-Raybould also said that she had a series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver after the initial story broke, and in the days before she ended up resigning from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“The prime minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in Cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” Wilson-Raybould says in her statement.

OPPOSITION RESPONSE

In the opening remarks of the new documents, Wilson-Raybould says her view is that the real issues at the heart of the SNC-Lavalin scandal are not about “how things are ‘experienced’” or considerations like caucus dynamics, political ambitions, or poll numbers. Rather she says it is about prosecutorial independence, the rule of law, and Canada’s democratic institutions.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses” in Canadian institutions, and that she looks forward to a future where “we truly do politics differently,” seeming to lean on a phrase Trudeau regularly touted during the 2015 campaign.

The opposition wanted to invite Wilson-Raybould back to testify again -- something she was open to -- but Liberal MPs on the House Justice Committee shut down the study, saying that they’d heard all they needed to.

Wilson-Raybould also offered that while she has nothing further to add to the formal process, if she was asked or compelled to participate in a future investigation or parliamentary process, she would.

In a statement reacting to the new information, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called it “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.” He called the entire affair “corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the evidence was “so compelling and well-documented” that an independent public inquiry is needed.

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement… The former Attorney General repeatedly made clear to the Prime Minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference – and they ignored her,” Singh said in a statement.

Since her testimony, Trudeau has faced calls to resign, the House of Commons agenda has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, and several other high-profile officials have resigned amid insistence that nothing improper occurred.

The PMO’s statement claims that “all facts are on the table now,” and that the Liberal government is focused on “moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

All eyes are set to be on Parliament Hill when MPs return on Monday, particularly when Liberal MPs convene for their weekly caucus meeting on Wednesday. There, it is likely that the developments that have occurred on this file over the last few days will come up, as some of her colleagues are expected to get up and call for her removal.

Temer's Brazil Democratic Movement party long held sway over key appointments in Brazil's largely state-run energy sector, including nuclear power plants. Work on Angra 3, the third nuclear ...","By Brad Brooks

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian former President Michel Temer was hit with more graft charges on Friday, just a day after being charged in a separate corruption case, according to federal prosecutors.

Temer, who left the presidency at the end of 2018, was arrested last week as part of an investigation into kickbacks on a nuclear plant's construction contract involving the Brazilian subsidiary of Swedish consulting firm AF Poyry, along with engineering firms Engevix and Argeplan.

Temer has since been released and denies wrongdoing. AF Poyry has said it would not comment on an ongoing investigation. Engevix and Argeplan did not reply to requests for comment.

Federal prosecutors charged Temer and his former energy minister Wellington Moreira Franco of taking part in a bribery scheme related to the Angra nuclear power plant complex on the Rio de Janeiro coast and other state firms. Moreira Franco has also said he is innocent.

Last week, prosecutors said the graft at Angra was one aspect of a ""criminal organisation"" that Temer had run during his four decades in public life, which received or arranged upward of 1.8 billion reais (£354.62 million) in bribes.

Temer, 78, served for two years as Sao Paulo state's prosecutor general starting in 1983. In 1985 he was elected to Congress, where he served until becoming former president Dilma Rousseff's vice president in 2011. He took over as president after Rousseff was impeached in 2016.

Temer's Brazil Democratic Movement party long held sway over key appointments in Brazil's largely state-run energy sector, including nuclear power plants.

Work on Angra 3, the third nuclear power plant planned in the Angra complex, has advanced haltingly since 1984 and has long been on the radar of graft investigators. The complex is run by Eletronuclear, a unit of state power holding company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras.

Temer is the second former president to be arrested in Brazil's unprecedented anti-corruption push since 2014. Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is in jail serving over 12 years for a corruption conviction.

On Thursday, Temer was charged with corruption on allegations of using a middleman to procure a suitcase full of cash from controlling shareholders of the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA.

In 2017, security cameras captured video of a former Temer adviser, Rodrigo da Rocha Loures, running out of a Sao Paulo restaurant carrying a bag with 500,000 reais in cash.

Plea-bargain testimony by two executives of JBS holding company J&F Investimentos SA implicated Temer and others in a bribery scheme and led prosecutors to accuse Rocha Loures of being a middleman for Temer, which the former president denied. Rocha Loures, who also denied the charges, is awaiting trial.

The hottest package currently, said Sharma ...","India is valued the world over for a great many things, but for three over all others: The Taj Mahal, Mahatma Gandhi and India’s electoral democracy.

So wrote S.Y. Quraishi, Chief Election Commissioner of India between 2010 and 2012, in his book, The Making of the Great Indian Election.

Few people would argue with that. Yet, while the Taj Mahal is a must-see and Gandhi tours are aplenty, the last of the three greats has eluded tourism players.

But as the big fat Indian general election approaches next month, Manish Sharma, founder of Akshar Travels in Ahmedabad in India’s westernmost state Gujarat, may be sparking a new travel niche. He calls it election tourism.

What he is doing is essentially putting an election component into existing tour packages, such as lectures and visits to polling places.

“Our industry has various niches like pilgrim tours, sports tours, honeymoons. Why can’t election tourism also be a niche? People always want new experiences,” Sharma told Skift in a phone interview.

Why not indeed?

The world’s biggest festival of democracy should indeed resonate with travelers who want to go into the fabric of society than staying at the hem.

More than 900 million eligible voters will vote, in seven phases from April 11 to May 19, with results coming in on May 23. Among them are 15 million voters aged 18-19 and millions more first-time voters.

According to an election snapshot compiled by Creative Travel India, there will be no less than one million polling stations, 11 million polling officials, two million electronic voting machines and an expenditure of around $7 billion, which is bigger than the $6.5 billion spent on the U.S. election in 2016.

There’s even a budget for elephants to carry electronic voting machines to inaccessible areas, so that every voter could vote.

“Elections are a long and major exercise which involve a huge force. They are safe. It’s a time for a lot of political parties making a huge spectacle with music, trucks decorated with pictures and many speeches,” said Dipak Diva, managing director of Sita Travels, Travel Corporation India and Distant Frontiers, which are among India’s leading inbound agencies.

Added Ashwani Kumar Goela, general manager of Radisson Blu Plaza Delhi, “Elections in India are safe. I would not say it is colorful and fun.”

Diva said he does not do any election packages. “If a client requests to see something of it while he’s here, we will take them to a rally, if there’s one, and explain the background and the processes. But the reality is no one will pay money to come to India to watch the elections. It’s nonsense. Unless of course they are students in political studies or people who are interested in politics. If you don’t understand the politics, it’s no use traveling for it. It’s complex,” said Diva.

Political Tours

But Akshar Travels’ Sharma thinks differently. The tour operator has created 15 election tour packages with untouristy names such as Grassroot Democracy of Kerala and Hustings in Himachal. And he’s expecting to sell more than 10,000 of these tours this year, compared with 5,200 when he first had the idea and featured election tours in Gujarat.

To be sure, no one is going to go home an expert on the Great Indian Election in seven days, although for certain they will experience India’s heritage, tradition and culture. These five to six nights tours are primarily sightseeing itineraries spiced with a good drizzle of election oil. In between the normal touring, there’s an opportunity or two, sometimes more, to go to a public rally, poll campaign and even meet party leaders and the election commission officer.

The hottest package currently, said Sharma, is the Domestic Affairs of Uttar Pradesh where, right on the first evening in Lucknow, guests get to dine with party officials. That one election encounter aside, the rest of six-night itinerary takes clients to explore Lucknow, Ayodhya, Allahabad and Varanasi, which is Modi’s constituency and may explain why the package is getting a lot of bookings.

But another package, Election Moves in Uttaranchal, packs in a lot more election stuff in between sightseeing. This includes joining a party promotional rally in Haridwar, having “the most luscious dinner” with party officials in Mussorie, “in-detail” conversations with local folks in Corbett about their views on Indian democracy and politics and meeting party officials in Nanital.

Direct bookings can be done through a dedicated Election Tourism India 2019 website that makes politics look as colorful and charming as the movie Big Fat Indian Wedding. A well-done site, it sells India through the lens of political party videos and has backgrounds to political parties and a list of India’s Prime Ministers through the years.

Aside from direct bookings through the website, the packages are also sold through more than 20 travel agents across the country.

Democracy Pride

Sharma said he has access to party leaders and their rally schedules, and that they too are interested in meeting and talking to tourists about India’s politics and elections.

“We even have the endorsement [on the website] of [current] Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wants the world to know elections in India are the biggest democratic process,” he said.

According to Sharma, he employs 175 volunteers to take care of tourists during the period. The packages cost between $1,000 and $3,000, excluding air, and generate “reasonable profits,” he said.

He is seeing bookings from Japan, Europe, the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates. “So far, we’ve received 1,600 bookings and more than 3,300 enquiries from both domestic and international tourists. They are students, journalists, researchers, but also tourists who want to experience something new,” said Sharma.

Currently it looks like Akshar Travels has the whole election market to himself.

“This is something new and not very popular as of now. Some of the people from the travel trade whom I spoke with are not aware of this,” said Radisson’s Goela.

In general, hotels will see an increase in business during but the election but this is because there is a lot of foreign direct investment in the country, thus the election is seriously followed by business analysts and reporters to gauge India’s future economic stability and government policies, he said.

Rajeev Kohli, Joint Managing Director of Creative Travel, said the idea of election tourism is a good marketing ploy but one that is “shallow” as it is not likely to offer a deep understanding of the election.

“We have elections in this country all the time [in the different states]. If you are a client who is interested to understand the election system — and yes India’s election is unique and also the most complex — you don’t come in the middle of it, because everyone is so busy to see you. The election day itself is a public holiday, no alcohol is served, so what do I do, bring Mr Smith and make him stand outside and see people coming in and out of the polling station?”

He added, “This is not the, say, Kumbh Mela festival, which is a structured festival for a few weeks and there are areas for foreigners to go to. These rallies are groups of villagers brought to a field, some small some large, and it’s not like there’s a lovely program. Rallies here run late and are mass events.

“But in the world there are people who are interested in everything. I’m sure there are 1,000 people in the world who are interested in this,” said Kohli.

He said in 25 years in the business, he never had a single person asking him to see the election, adding virtually all of India’s tour operators don’t do such packages.

“In fact I have people asking me if they should avoid India during the election period. The answer is no of course, as it’s not a dangerous movement by any measure and we work around it. In any case, it’s coming in the off-season,” said Kohli.

Still, Sharma should be credited for his creativity in using the Indian election as a means to gain incremental business. Tour operators in Indonesia and the Philippines, where elections will be held in April and May respectively may pick up on his idea and strengthen the vote for election tourism.",The Big Fat Indian Election Is the Country’s New Tourism Draw,Skift,https://skift.com/2019/03/28/the-big-fat-indian-election-is-the-countrys-new-tourism-draw/

The Lead

The Liberal MPs on the House ethics committee have defeated a motion calling for Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to appear before the body to testify on a proposed study into the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

Moved by Tory member Peter Kent, the motion won the support of the three opposition MPs during Tuesday’s special meeting, but it couldn’t draw any support among the six Liberals who sit on the committee. Conservative MP Bob Zimmer serves as chair of the committee.

“Well, the cover-up continues,” Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told reporters after the meeting. “Liberals had a chance to put votes where their mouths were, and instead, they decided to vote for another cover-up.”

During the meeting, Liberal MP and committee member Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, speaking on behalf of his party colleagues, argued that the committee wasn’t the “right forum” for the study because one had already been undertaken by the justice committee and such an inquiry would be better suited for a parliamentary commissioner.

He also said it was “premature” for the ethics committee to hold a study since the justice committee has yet to receive emails and text transcripts promised by Wilson-Raybould to verify her allegations.

Jolson Lim has the full story.

In Canada:

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is dismissing suggestions of deep-seated fractures in the Liberal caucus, pointing to last week’s voting marathon in the House as helping in solidifying party unity.

“Because of the tremendous opportunity to vote as a team for 30 hours last week … our team has come out stronger and more united than ever before,” he told reporters Tuesday morning at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology in Winnipeg. He was visiting the school to tout the Liberal government’s new training benefit program unveiled in the 2019 budget.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott recently resigned from cabinet over the lingering SNC-Lavalin controversy, with both openly criticizing how the Prime Minister’s Office has handled the issue. Also, outspoken MP Celina Casear-Chavannes left the Liberal caucus last Wednesday after publicly criticizing Trudeau for how he responded to her announcement that she would not run in 2019. Marco Vigliotti has more.

Interestingly, Erskine-Smith penned an op-ed for the Toronto Star on Tuesday urging Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to stay in the Liberal caucus, despite their disagreements with the government.

“I am a Liberal member of parliament and I continue to support our Liberal government. But that does not mean that I support every government action taken, or that I ought to refrain from public disagreement,” he wrote.

Back to Trudeau, he was also asked during his media availability about a story that broke Monday that alleged that the professional relationship between the PM and Wilson-Raybould “first began to fray” back in 2017 because of concerns over who to name to the Supreme Court.

Trudeau, though, said it would be inappropriate for him to respond to the media reports, adding that “the choice of Supreme Court justices and indeed, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, is always a decision of the prime minister.” Vigliotti also this one.

Keeping with the SNC-Lavalin controversy, the Globe and Mail is reporting that the Prime Minister’s Office received information last fall suggesting an internal disagreement with dispute Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel and “one of the lower-ranking prosecutors handling the SNC-Lavalin bribery and fraud prosecution.”

Ex-Progressive Conservative MPP Randy Hillier says he’s in talks with the province’s ethics watchdog about possible illegal or unregistered lobbying of the Ford government. In a lengthy Tuesday afternoon press conference, Hillier repeatedly slammed the culture of “fear and intimidation” in Premier Doug Ford’s government but gave no evidence to back-up his fresh attacks or his previous allegations of illegal activity.

He said he started speaking with Integrity Commissioner J. David Wake about “possible illegal and/or unregistered lobbying” soon after he was suspended from the Tory caucus on Feb. 20. Marieke Walsh has the latest.

Former Afghanistan hostage Joshua Boyle’s assault trial continued in an Ottawa courtroom on Tuesday, with the court hearing a frantic, late-night 911 call he made in December 2017 to say his wife Caitlan Coleman was threatening to kill herself, reports the Canadian Press.

The call was what eventually triggered an investigation that led to Boyle’s arrest just two months after Pakistani forces freed the couple from its kidnappers. Boyle is charged with offences including assault, sexual assault, unlawful confinement and causing someone to take a noxious substance.

After the call, Ottawa police showed up at the Boyle family’s apartment and it was on that day that Coleman was “finally able to walk away from Mr. Boyle” after months of alleged domestic abuse, Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham told the court on Monday.

The NDP is calling for the federal government to extend its mission in Mali to October to meet a request made by the United Nations, even though the government has said it plans to stay in the West African country only until mid-summer. The Canadian Press reported late last week that the UN had asked Canada to keep its forces in Mali until October, when their Romanian replacements will arrive.

Since the Mali mission was announced, the Canadian government has maintained that it will end at the end of July 2019. Charlie Pinkerton has more.

Canada’s armed forces, the RCMP and the Canada Border Services agency spent a total of $158,000 to send 42 employees to what’s billed as the biggest small arms show in the world last January.

In a written question in the Commons, B.C. Conservative MP Todd Doherty asked for expenditure details about federal employees who were “sent” to the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas, Nev.

The annual exhibit, held in the sprawling Sands Expo Centre on the outskirts of the city’s downtown casinos, is limited to representatives from armed forces, police services, tactical police units, the gun industry and related associations. It is not an event open to the general public, and no one under age 16 is allowed in. Tim Naumetz reports.

MPs in the U.K. Parliament took the unprecedented step Monday of seizing control of the parliamentary timetable as they look to resolve the deadlock over the terms of the country’s exit from the European Union. On Tuesday, they revealed the details of their plan to consider other Brexit options, as prime minister Theresa May was “warned more ministers could quit unless she changed course,” reports the BBC. The Commons will begin voting on alternatives on Wednesday, though this will likely continue into next week. MPs will complete a series of ballots to gauge support for different ideas.

The Democratic-controlled House in the U.S. fell short Tuesday in its bid to override the first veto issued by President Donald Trump, enabling him to divert more funding to build more barriers along the country’s southwest border with Mexico.

Lawmakers voted 248-181 in favour of overturning his veto of a motion passed by Congress annulling his national emergency declaration along the border, but it fell 38 votes short of the two-thirds majority required, reports the Associated Press.

Trump’s declaration allowed him to use a law that lets him shift already budgeted funding to address emergencies. This enabled him to move an additional $3.6 billion from “military construction projects to work on border barriers,” even though Congress voted this year to limit spending on such barriers to less than $1.4 billion.

The head of Algeria’s army is demanding that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika be declared “unfit to rule after weeks of protests against him,” reports the BBC. In a television address, the army’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah, said “we must find a way out of this crisis immediately, within the constitutional framework.”

Bouteflike has already agreed not to seek a fifth term in upcoming elections but they have been delayed in what critics say is a ploy to prolong his 20-year rule over the country. There have also been talks set up to draft a new constitution and set a date for elections but they have no scheduled start date.

Spain offered data to the FBI that it collected from a raid conducted against a self-proclaimed human rights group that allegedly led attack on the North Korean Embassy last month, the Associated Press reports.

National Court judge Jose de la Mata on Tuesday lifted the secrecy order in the case, saying it had found evidence of several crimes, such as trespassing, injuries, threats and burglary committed by “a criminal organization” at the Madrid embassy. He identified a Mexican, an American and a South Korean as the main suspects. Adrian Hong Chang, a Mexican national and resident in the United States, was named by the judge as the leader of a gang of 10 people who escaped on Feb. 22 after “stealing computers and documents from the embassy, where they shackled and gagged its staff.”

© Stephen MacGillivray Prime Minister Justin Trudeau talks to media in St. Stephen, N.B., Thursday. He apologized Thursday for a remark made Wednesday night.

Not since Laureen Harper told an Indigenous rights protester at a cat video festival in 2014, “Tonight we’re here for homeless cats” has a member of the Canadian political establishment screwed up so badly in the face of an ordinary person wanting to be heard.

In case you don’t know what I’m talking about because you’re too absorbed in the Prime Minister’s other scandal (hint: it starts with an S and ends with an N), let me explain: Justin Trudeau was speaking at an event at a luxury Toronto hotel Wednesday night when a protester holding a large banner interrupted him.

“People in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning,” she called out, referencing the fact that people in Grassy Narrows — an Ontario First Nation — are indeed suffering from mercury poisoning because in the 1960s a paper company began polluting the river there. Many maintain, this protester included, that the government response to the crisis has been abysmally slow and insufficient. “You committed to addressing this crisis,” the protester said. But before she could continue, security approached her and escorted her away. And as they did the PM spoke.

“Thank you for your donation tonight,” he said. “I really appreciate it.”

It was in every way, the public speaking equivalent of kicking somebody when they’re already down.

And yet, laughter and applause followed — not from the protesters who presumably don’t think there’s anything funny about government inability to address a poisoning crisis, but from audience members who paid handsomely to be there, and whose experience with mercury poisoning is most likely limited to reading in a magazine that you can get it if you eat too much sushi.

Today they are eating their applause for a PM who is in apology mode.

The backlash to Trudeau’s sarcastic response was swift from every source: from activists, from conservative voices on social media (who surprise, surprise, suddenly seem to have a vested interest in environmental protections), and from regular people of all stripes.

On Thursday, the PM apologized before the press. In his own words:

“As I think you all know from time to time I’m in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way. That’s how I believe a democracy should function and I didn’t do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.”

Trudeau said he’d reimburse the protesters for the donation they made that granted them access to the fundraiser and he announced plans to revisit the Grassy Narrows crisis with his staff.

It seems like the least he can do but hopefully it produces some positive change (in this lifetime) for the protesters who told him off.

None of this, however, is positive for Justin Trudeau, a man heading into an election, whose approval rating, according to a new Ipsos poll conducted for Global News, has dipped below U.S. president Donald Trump’s. After this week’s events I won’t be surprised if we see another dip.

Laureen Harper’s response (“That’s a great cause but that’s another night ... tonight we’re here for homeless cats”) to a protester who wanted to know why she appeared to care more about felines than she did about missing and murdered Indigenous women was inappropriate. But it wasn’t smug.

On Wednesday night Trudeau was smug. To be precise, he was as smug as they come.

And it’s hard to recover from smug. In fact, much like a cat, once “smug” is out of the bag — you can’t stuff it back in. Once people see it on your face and hear it in your voice, they have a hard time seeing and hearing anything else when they look at you. And unlike SNC-Lavalin — a scandal that is complicated — “Smug PM” is very simple.

This could be Justin Trudeau’s Mitt Romney moment.

In 2012 in advance of the US presidential election, American magazine Mother Jones released surreptitiously recorded footage of Romney talking about Democratic voters in disparaging terms.

Romney says in the recording: “There are 47 per cent who are with him [Obama], who are dependent upon government…My job is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”

Romney never recovered from this incident, not only because it obliterated his nice guy disguise, but because his opponents ensured that everywhere you looked, there it was: that recording, online, on TV, and in your head.

Ontario residents describe the ravages of mercury exposure

The backlash to Trudeau's sarcastic response was swift from every source: from activists, from conservative voices on social media (who surprise, surprise, suddenly seem to have a vested interest in environmental protections), and from regular people of all stripes.

On Thursday, the PM apologized before the press. In his own words:

""As I think you all know from time to time I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way. That's how I believe a democracy should function and I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.""

Trudeau said he'd reimburse the protesters for the donation they made that granted them access to the fundraiser and he announced plans to revisit the Grassy Narrows crisis with his staff.

It seems like the least he can do but hopefully it produces some positive change (in this lifetime) for the protesters who told him off.

None of this, however, is positive for Justin Trudeau, a man heading into an election, whose approval rating, according to a new Ipsos poll conducted for Global News, has dipped below U.S. president Donald Trump's. After this week's events I won't be surprised if we see another dip.

Laureen Harper's response (""That's a great cause but that's another night ... tonight we're here for homeless cats"") to a protester who wanted to know why she appeared to care more about felines than she did about missing and murdered Indigenous women was inappropriate. But it wasn't smug.

On Wednesday night Trudeau was smug. To be precise, he was as smug as they come.

And it's hard to recover from smug. In fact, much like a cat, once ""smug"" is out of the bag — you can't stuff it back in. Once people see it on your face and hear it in your voice, they have a hard time seeing and hearing anything else when they look at you. And unlike SNC-Lavalin — a scandal that is complicated — ""Smug PM"" is very simple.

This could be Justin Trudeau's Mitt Romney moment.

In 2012 in advance of the US presidential election, American magazine Mother Jones released surreptitiously recorded footage of Romney talking about Democratic voters in disparaging terms.

Romney says in the recording: ""There are 47 per cent who are with him [Obama], who are dependent upon government…My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""

Romney never recovered from this incident, not only because it obliterated his nice guy disguise, but because his opponents ensured that everywhere you looked, there it was: that recording, online, on TV, and in your head.

From now until October, prepare to watch Justin Trudeau being smug again and again and again. Christmas has come early for Andrew Scheer. Meanwhile, the people of Grassy Narrows wait.

Grassy Narrows First Nation held a protest and demonstration in Toronto on Wednesday evening during a Liberal Party fundraiser to press the Trudeau government on its promise to fund a specialized mercury treatment facility in the northwestern Ontario community that's about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora.

During the event, the protester appeared to be escorted out of the room while Trudeau thanked her for her ""donation.""

""From time to time, I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday morning.

""I didn't do that last night — last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize.""

Grassy Narrows also is pushing for federal help for remediation of the polluted English-Wabigoon River system and better compensation for people affected by the toxic element.

In a video posted to the Council of Canadians' verified Facebook page Wednesday evening, a woman is shown standing in front of the stage where Trudeau is standing; she appears to unfurl a banner that references the prime minister and compensation for the ""mercury crisis."" She is heard saying ""people in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this crisis,"" while appearing to be removed from the room.

Trudeau, still on the stage, is heard saying, while facing the direction in which the woman was taken out of the room, ""Thank you for being here, thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate it,"" which draws cheers and applause from the crowd.

The Grassy Narrows protest in Toronto was at the Omni King Edward Hotel, where Trudeau was scheduled to appear at a Laurier Club donor ""appreciation event.""

Former Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott pledged in late 2017 that Ottawa would fund the development and construction of a treatment facility for people exposed to mercury-related illnesses in Grassy Narrows. A number of studies have linked the comparatively poor health of people in the community to the dumping of mercury-contaminated effluent by Reed Paper, former owners of the mill in Dryden, into the river where members of the First Nation have traditionally fished.

The dumping also affected Wabaseemoong, another First Nation, about 100 kilometres northwest of Kenora.

""The situation in Grassy Narrows is one that we have been following for quite awhile,"" Trudeau said Thursday. He said representatives from his office will be in touch with the office of Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan.

Grassy Narrows submitted a feasibility study for the treatment centre in late 2018, said the community's environmental health co-ordinator, Judy Da Silva. But the community is now waiting for Ottawa to commit to funding a detailed work plan — the next step in the project, she said.

""We're really worried this promise won't be fulfilled,"" Da Silva said, with the 2019 federal election drawing closer. ""The crunch is coming ... and we need something concrete in place ... for the mercury home to be a reality.

""As we speak, our people are having to suffer in the Kenora hospital, or in Thunder Bay or in Winnipeg, and the numbers are growing,"" Da Silva said.

Judy Da Silva was in Toronto to help protest what the community is calling a lack of action by the federal government on the Grassy Narrows mercury treatment centre. (CBC)

""We're hoping that ... [Ottawa] will put something in place that will fulfil that promise for a mercury home and for mercury justice for our people.""

Da Silva said Grassy Narrows has also yet to secure a visit from Trudeau, despite chief and council requesting he come to the community.

William Olscamp, a spokesperson for Indigenous Services Canada, said in an email to CBC News that the department has reviewed the mercury treatment centre's feasibility study ""and is actively engaged with the community, the province and other technical experts to continue to effectively map out the required services against the technical requirements of the building.

""Once the requirements have been finalized, the next steps can get underway.""

The elevated levels of mercury in the river that runs adjacent to Grassy Narrows also closed a once-thriving fishery in the 1970s, decimating the local economy. Community leaders have called on senior levels of government for better compensation, saying the existing Mercury Disability Board, established in the 1980s and under provincial jurisdiction, has only resulted in about six per cent of Grassy Narrows members getting any compensation.

While the province has committed to indexing payouts to inflation, there's been little talk about changing the eligibility criteria.

Grassy Narrows highlighted by Amnesty International

The situation in Grassy Narrows was highlighted by Amnesty International on World Water Day in March as one example in Canada of ""environmental racism.""

""There are communities, particularly communities of colour and Indigenous peoples, who daily have to live with threats to their health and well-being from environmental contamination that would be unthinkable for so many other wealthier communities,"" said Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada's Indigenous rights campaigner.

""Really, there's no clearer example of this than Grassy Narrows.""

Amnesty International has been working with the community for close to 20 years, he said, adding specialized health care should have been on the table years ago.

""This isn't something that should be delayed.""

Olscamp said in his email that Indigenous Services Canada ""continues to work collaboratively with the communities of Grassy Narrows First Nation, Wabaseemoong Independent Nations and provincial partners to address the specific health needs in these communities and reform the Mercury Disability Board.

""The timelines for completion of the treatment facility will depend on the project requirements and the final design agreed upon by the federal and provincial project participants and the Grassy Narrows community,"" he added.

Grassy Narrows is about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora, Ont. (CBC)

""It is too early at this point to provide a definitive date for the project completion.""

Benjamin acknowledged the commitments made by both the federal and provincial governments as being much-needed positive steps that need to be adhered to.

""We also have the fact that there have been these long struggles for justice that, at this point, we finally see them bearing fruit,"" he said.

Has the time come for Justin Trudeau to resign and let his party put another leader in place, so they’ll have a fighting chance for the Oct. 29 federal election?

The answer is yes — and someone better be making plans for both the scaffold and platform right now for possibly August if they want a chance to win anything.

People say polls are a snapshot in time, they can go up or down and campaigns matter, polls are for dogs and have been wrong before. I get it.

But those things are usually said by partisan loyalists who are losing (and know it) and for a brave front. Remember Kathleen Wynne’s campaign team telling you she’d come back and win, first from 28% and then at 19% and got wiped out?

A Liberal party under Justin Trudeau won’t get wiped out, but he’s up against polling numbers that put him back to before the starting gate of the last campaign — when he didn’t have an SNC-Lavalin millstone and a former attorney general who is believed by a margin of 2:1 with her version of the truth.

With vast majorities (including 70% of Liberal voters) wanting a public inquiry or RCMP investigation, it’s corroding the formerly good ship “sunny ways” every day they shutter House of Commons Committees and as his staff and party stalwarts run around deck ripping their hair out.

And even when they could get off a shot from the bow, it did nothing to stem the situation: the budget blew away like a wisp of water mist.

Polls from very reputable firms that nailed the last provincial election and have a history of being spot on when it’s not literally neck-and-neck have the Liberals nationally at between 28% and 30% when needing at least 38% for a majority.

And while people will say Andrew Scheer’s Conservative’s 40% of the vote is just an inflated anti-Trudeau vote, maybe that’s the whole point they should be considering: it’s anti-Trudeau.

And, it’s not all coming from the west who have piled on. Quebec Liberals where SNC lives are now tied with the once vanquished Bloc who have eaten up any soft NDP vote the Grits might have had.

Most disturbing for Liberals should be the 905 area code (forget 416 because it doesn’t swing votes), which is fully blue in the seat models and where Conservatives are leading by a margin of 2 to 1 in the polling. Without the Liberals “winning or even” in the polls there, they’re dead meat for any kind of a win (and Ontario is now 40% to 28%, advantage Conservatives.)

Our own DART polling showed just recently that only 31% nationally felt the Trudeau government deserved to be re-elected. To boot, Trudeau’s personal approval numbers are now below Trump’s, so more selfies won’t help.

So, caucus members and nervous Liberals: this is the real thing, not a drill. And time is running out.

Advice? Andrew Scheer stay absolutely quiet and let the Grits self-destruct. Trudeau resign and let the party get a new leader who might give the party momentum out of a convention.

And, to the Liberal Party, as you brace for any more truth torpedoes inbound to the port side from either the former attorney general or her former cabinet colleague, decide soon if you’re lashing yourself to the bridge or getting a new captain and ship.

Tick tock.

Rudy Turtle said he's again calling on Trudeau to visit his community, located about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora in northwestern Ontario, to see first-hand the effects that decades of exposure to mercury are having on the people. Elevated levels of the toxic element have remained in the English-Wabigoon River system since Reed Paper, former owners of the mill in Dryden, dumped 9,000 kilograms of mercury into the water in the 1960s and early 1970s.

""We've invited him to the community and he's always brushed it aside,"" Turtle said of letters leadership has sent to the Prime Minister. ""I would like to see him come to Grassy and meet the people of Grassy Narrows, not just the chief and council, but the people themselves.""

""Just to get a handle on what mercury's doing to our people.""

The community is frustrated, Turtle said, by how long the process is taking to break ground on a promised specialized mercury treatment facility so residents don't have to travel hundreds of kilometres to hospitals in Kenora, Winnipeg or Thunder Bay.

Grassy Narrows had hoped to start construction in the spring, but leaders and advocates are saying that money from Ottawa isn't flowing to proceed to the project's next step. Indigenous Services Canada said it is ""actively engaged"" with the community, the province and other ""technical experts"" to establish what services the facility will be responsible for and how they will fit into the building design.

The community's frustration was magnified by Trudeau's comments Wednesday at a Liberal Party fundraising event in Toronto where a protester unfurled a banner in front of the Prime Minister while he was taking the stage while saying that ""people in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this crisis.""

She was physically removed from the room while Trudeau said ""thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate it."" The prime minister apologized Thursday morning, saying his comments ""lacked respect.""

Turtle said the community is ""acknowledging"" that apology ""but we're not too impressed, let's put it that way.""

The incident was captured on video by Mark Calzavara, a regional organizer with the Council of Canadians. He said that he and the woman in the video did donate in order to be able to enter the room.

Trudeau said on Thursday that their money would be refunded.

Grassy Narrows First Nation is located about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora, Ont. (Canadian Press) ""There's a lot of concern that this commitment will not be fulfilled before the election,"" Calzavara said about why they wanted to draw attention to the issue, adding that ""if there is a change in government, that the incoming government may not honour the commitment at all.""

That's why Turtle said he wants to see money for the treatment facility locked into a trust, similar to what the Ontario government did in 2017 with $85 million committed to go toward remediation of the English-Wabigoon River system.

""It's about holding Mister Trudeau ... and the Liberal Party to account, they committed to building the mercury treatment centre,"" Calzavara said.

Those sentiments were echoed by Ogichidaa Francis Kavanaugh, the grand chief of Grand Council Treaty 3, of which Grassy Narrows is a member.

""Nothing has been done and our people continue to suffer. We want to see action now,"" Kavanaugh was quoted as saying in an emailed statement.

Mr. Turtle said the Prime Minister’s dismissive remarks to protesters, Ottawa’s treatment of former minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and a general sense of inaction on Indigenous issues are producing widespread disappointment with the Liberal government.

“Looking at the whole picture … I would say that the Prime Minister has lost confidence with a majority of the native people,” he said in an interview with The Globe and Mail Friday.

Mr. Turtle said the Prime Minister’s reaction to the protesters this week “felt like an insult” and he urged Mr. Trudeau to do more than apologize.

“We acknowledge the apology, but that’s about it. I guess I would say actions speak louder than words. I’ve been asking him to come to Grassy Narrows to visit our community and he’s always brushed it aside, so I guess if he started showing some action, then I would be more impressed,"" he said.

Mr. Turtle raised the issue of Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney-general who resigned from cabinet in February, and has accused the Prime Minister’s Office of applying inappropriate pressure in relation to a criminal prosecution. Ms. Wilson-Raybould, a former regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, also expressed frustration last fall with her government’s lack of progress on Indigenous files.

“It’s just the way he handled it,"" Mr. Turtle said. “In terms of reconciliation, [Mr. Trudeau] should have done his best to accommodate her.”

Francis Kavanaugh, Grand Chief of Grand Council Treaty #3, which includes Grassy Narrows and 27 other First Nations, said Mr. Trudeau hasn’t lived up to the expectations set by the Liberals in 2015.

“I’m just very, very disappointed. I had high hopes when he first became the Prime Minister. He ran on a platform of reconciliation – he was going to fix this, he was going to fix that – and I’m just starting to think that he’s a liar,” he said Friday in a phone interview.

Health problems facing residents of Grassy Narrows and neighbouring Wabaseemoong in northwestern Ontario were the focus of a protest that disrupted a speech Mr. Trudeau was delivering Wednesday evening in Toronto at a Liberal Party fundraising event.

When two protesters in the room shouted out that the people of Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning and that his government had promised to do something, Mr. Trudeau dismissed them.

“I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada,” Mr. Trudeau replied as the first of the two protesters was escorted away. The audience of donors who contributed $1,500 to the party cheered.

Video of Mr. Trudeau’s response spread quickly online, prompting widespread condemnation from First Nations leaders and others.

Mr. Trudeau apologized Thursday morning in Halifax, saying he had showed “a lack of respect.”

Members of both communities have long experienced health problems linked to toxins released into the river system in the 1960s by a paper mill in Dryden, Ont. The contamination affected the local fish population − a regular source of food and commerce. The waters remain contaminated decades later.

Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong are waiting on the federal and Ontario governments to deliver on two key promises that were both made in 2017: a provincial pledge to clean up the contamination and a federal promise to build a new health facility to treat patients affected by mercury.

Story continues below advertisement

The Ontario Liberal government’s 2017 announcement promised to place $85-million in a trust fund to pay for cleaning up the mercury contamination in the region. A spokesperson for the current Progressive Conservative government said officials continue to work with the communities on how to spend the money set aside for remediation. However, no firm project plans have been announced.

From the federal government, then-Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott promised in November, 2017, that a specialized health facility would be built in the area to serve people affected by mercury poisoning.

The federal government is assuming responsibility for building a facility, but is looking for provincial help in areas such as health-care staffing.

Indigenous Services Canada received a draft feasibility study for the treatment centre on Nov. 28, 2018, which covered issues such as location, design and estimated operational costs.

Federal Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan said in a statement that the department continues to work with the communities and the province on plans.

“I would be pleased to meet with Chief Turtle to determine how we can continue moving this critical work forward,"" he said.

“Trudeau’s apology rings hollow while our people are suffering without the care and support that we need,” Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle said in a written response to the National Post.

Trudeau apologized to Grassy Narrows after a video surfaced of the prime minister telling protestor Lana Goldberg “thank you very much for your donation” in response to her interruption of a high-end Liberal Party fundraiser Wednesday, where she was raising awareness about the First Nations community.

Grassy Narrows has been suffering from mercury poisoning in its local water supply for decades, after an upstream pulp and paper mill dumped thousands of pounds of effluent into the English-Wabigoon river system through the ’60s and early ’70s. Goldberg was representing an advocacy group called Free Grassy Narrows, which aims to help the community secure a long-term care facility for patients of mercury poisonings.

Opposition members of parliament blasted Trudeau’s comments as being flippant and smug, saying it contradicted the Liberal government’s carefully crafted brand of reconciliatory and progressive politics. Other observers were simply surprised by his handling of the protest.

“I’ve never seen him give that kind of cynical or shut-down response,” said Mark Calzavara, a member of the advocacy group Council of Canadians, who captured the comments on his phone. Calzavara was also raising awareness about the First Nations community.

Trudeau was speaking at a so-called Laurier Club event, which are Liberal Party fundraisers attended solely by major donors who give $1,500 or more.

On Thursday, Trudeau apologized for his comments to the protester and to the broader First Nations community.

“From time to time I’m in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and I always try to engage with them in a positive way,” Trudeau told reporters in Halifax.

“Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.”

Any funds that the protesters contributed in order to gain access to the event will be refunded, he added.

“They wanted to express their concerns about an issue and I do take that seriously and I apologize to them.”

The rejection by Chief Turtle comes after a medical treatment centre in the community promised by Ottawa lags behind schedule.

In November 2017, then-Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott announced that Ottawa would provide $170,000 to fund a feasibility study for a long-term treatment centre in Grassy Narrows, as well as provide further funding to “design, build and operate” the facility. It also promised a treatment centre in the Wabaseemoong, or Whitedog, First Nation that has had similar mercury poisonings.

The facility in Grassy Narrows, designed to hold around 20 beds, was meant to begin construction in the fall of 2018, but has not yet broken ground. One person familiar with the matter said that in discussions with the community in December, Philpott said she expected to project to get underway around June of this year, already months behind its initial start date.

Members of the Grassy Narrows and Whitedog First Nations have been found to have uncommonly high levels of mercury in their blood stream, largely from eating fish from the English-Wabigoon river system. Mercury is often carried in fish, particularly white fish species like walleye, and it “bioaccumulates” — meaning it is often passed down from one generation to the next through childbirth, and is nearly impossible to rid from the body.

Sufferers of mercury poisoning have been known to have learning disabilities, blurred vision and difficulty balancing, among other ailments.

The rough cost of the Grassy Narrows treatment centre is estimated at around $17 million, but due to the inter-generational existence of mercury the community is calling on Ottawa to provide maintenance and services to the facility over a 30-year period, for a total of roughly $88 million.

Chief Turtle of Grassy Narrows said the community needs to have the money put into a trust to ensure that future governments don’t suddenly take away the promised funding.

“I acknowledge Trudeau’s apology, but more importantly he needs to deliver on his government’s promise to build a Home and Treatment Centre so our mercury survivors can be cared for with dignity,” Turtle said.

Perry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the prime minister’s comments were “completely unacceptable and offensive,” and called on Trudeau to visit the affected communities in order to “see the impacts of the mercury contamination firsthand.”

Opposition members of parliament also lashed out against Trudeau for his remarks.

“What a smug, mean, aloof ass,” NDP MP Charlie Angus said on Twitter. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel called Trudeau “smug” and “arrogant,” while NDP leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted, “Instead of showing respect for people fighting for clean water & funding, Trudeau sides with his rich donors to get a laugh.”

Grassy Narrows is located about 100 km north of Kenora, Ont.

Japanese researchers have been studying patients in Grassy Narrows for decades, and have found residents of the community to display symptoms of Minamata disease, named after a small Japanese town where 900 people died as a result of eating fish tainted with mercury.

In December, a report found that mercury poisoning of the local river system was causing a number of health issues for youth in the community, particularly pregnant women, including anemia and attention deficit disorder.

That much was made clear after Jody Wilson-Raybould’s documents were made public Friday afternoon.

The most damning piece of evidence she provided was the audio recording of a 17-minute telephone conversation with Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council until his recent resignation.

The two were speaking about the SNC-Lavalin file, with Wernick repeatedly pressuring Wilson-Raybould about what it would take to get the criminal charges dropped against the firm and have them instead receive a Deferred Prosecution Agreement.

There is much that is troubling in this phone call, but the worst parts are the sections where Wernick makes it clear that his firmness on the issue comes directly from Trudeau. It’s Trudeau who is insisting this happen. It’s Trudeau who is the one who wants a deal made, whatever it takes.

“So he is quite determined,” Wernick says at one point. “Quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. And I think he is gonna find way to get it done one way or another.”

If that’s truly how Trudeau felt, the plot has just thickened.

The problem has become even more serious. And if Trudeau had actually said that at one point or another, then there would be a very good case for obstruction of justice.

The head of the public prosecution service had already ruled that she would go ahead with charges against SNC-Lavalin and that they would not be offered a DPA.

As Wilson-Raybould says to Wernick and writes later in the documents she submitted, what is at issue here is prosecutorial independence. No politician, not even the prime minister, can tell the head prosecutor to drop charges against a company for any reason.

That is not how a free society works. If that was happened here, then we’d be a banana republic. A joke country where justice is served according to the personal whims of the leader.

When this story first broke, Trudeau tried to tell us that nothing happened, that the story was “false”.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould provided texts and emails to the House of Commons justice committee as a followup to her testimony there on Feb. 27, when she described a “sustained” campaign by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of the Prime Minister’s Office to “politically interfere” in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

In the call, Wilson-Raybould issued what she called the “strongest warning” to Wernick about the actions of Trudeau and others. “It is entirely inappropriate and it is political interference,” she said.

It directly contradicts Trudeau’s and his top officials’ public assertions that Wilson-Raybould never advised him of any concerns until after she was moved out of her job as justice minister in January. Wilson-Raybould previously testified she was under pressure by Trudeau and senior officials to direct that SNC-Lavalin be given a deferred prosecution agreement under a brand new law, which would allow the Quebec firm to avoid a criminal conviction and with it, a 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts.

In new material released Friday, Wilson-Raybould contradicts Wernick’s public statement that the matter was not discussed at cabinet, reminding him she warned the entire cabinet when the change was being contemplated that any decision to use a deferred prosecution agreement would be exceptional, and would need to be left up to the prosecutor in trial cases, including SNC-Lavalin’s. “I made it very clear at the cabinet table and other places that these tools are at the discretion of the prosecutor — and everybody agreed to that and there was no guarantee that there would be a DPA in this or any other case. So we are treading on dangerous ground here,” she said. “I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. All of this screams of that.” But Wernick maintains through the call that Trudeau is not pressing Wilson-Raybould to do anything outside legal bounds. “His view is that (he) is not asking you to do anything inappropriate or interfere. He is asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal,” Wernick tells her at one point. “The Prime Minister was not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould, and we were unaware of the full contents of this recording before today,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement late Friday. “As the Prime Minister said in his statement, he should have spoken directly with the former Justice Minister & Attorney General about this matter — and he wishes that she had come to him. As has been made clear through the various testimonies, and as the Prime Minister said, there was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months between PMO, the Clerk of the Privy Council, and the former Justice Minister & Attorney General.” The statement continues, “All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the Prime Minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.” The transcript and audio of the call were part of a package that included texts and emails that revealed other new information about Wilson-Raybould’s decision on Feb. 11 to resign from cabinet, three weeks after she was shuffled into veterans affairs. Wilson-Raybould denies testimony by Trudeau’s top aide Gerald Butts that she called minister of justice and attorney-general her “dream job.” She says he was the one who described it that way. Notified that she was being shuffled out of the justice portfolio, Wilson-Raybould says she told Trudeau and Butts “numerous times” she believed she was being moved “because of a decision I would not take in the SNC-Lavalin DPA matter, which they denied.”

She took Trudeau at his word but made a decision then that she would “immediately resign” if David Lametti, who replaced her as attorney general, decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular,” she said. A spokesman for Lametti told the Star Friday that he has not issued a directive in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution since his appointment. Wilson-Raybould said it was her meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver on the weekend after the story first broke that “led to my resignation from cabinet.” She says Trudeau publicly held up her presence in cabinet as evidence of her confidence in his government and its handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair. “I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” she wrote in her brief. But she pointedly does not go into detail about any aspects of their private discussions over three face-to-face meetings the prime minister had with her on Feb. 10-11 that led to her quitting. Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario told the Star the taped conversation was a “covert ops” move, with her hanging onto it for a “convenient moment.” He dismissed Wilson-Raybould’s claims about Wernick, saying he was “asking for information that only she could give.” “The clerk said this is a legitimate tool and why are we not exploring it here and he asked repeatedly for an explanation to pass on to the prime minister and she refused to give it,” Addario said. “She didn’t shut the call down. She described her wrong understanding of the law, which is that she can’t even call the (director of public prosecutions) to ask questions without putting it into the Canada Gazette. That’s not what the statute says, so he was right in thinking they were talking past each other.” Wilson-Raybould acknowledged that taping the call with Wernick without informing him was an “extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate” move but says she wanted an “exact record” of the discussion because she suspected it was likely to be an “inappropriate conversation.” During the call — which Wilson-Raybould previously described as the culmination of the pressure campaign — Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould she is part of a team, and the prime minister still believes she can use “tools” at her disposal, including asking former Supreme Court of Canada chief justice Beverley McLachlin for advice. “You are not just the attorney general, you are the minister of justice in a cabinet,” Wernick says to her. “I think the way (Trudeau) sees it and the advice he is getting is that you still have things you can do that are not interference and are still very much lawful.” Wilson-Raybould replies, “It is not they are not lawful … the perception and what will happen is that it will be deemed political interference from day one when people were talking about why we are entering into a DPA or putting in a DPA regime in place … Everybody knows that it was because of SNC. Whether that is true or not, that is what people will think.” The texts and emails that Wilson-Raybould gave to the justice committee confirmed much of the testimony she earlier offered about the SNC-Lavalin affair. Her letter stresses that she took to heart departmental legal advice that it would be unprecedented for an attorney general to direct the prosecution of a specific case absent new facts and evidence. Wilson-Raybould said none were offered in the SNC-Lavalin matter. She flatly dismissed the prime minister’s explanation since the controversy broke that Wilson-Raybould “experienced” events leading to her resignation differently or that it was the result of an “erosion of trust.” “The real issues engaged by this matter — the issues that will inform what type of Canada we want to live in and pass on to the next generations — are not, ultimately, about how things are ‘experienced,’ caucus dynamics, political ambitions, poll numbers, ‘erosion of trust’ or the role of social media,” she wrote in her 44-page brief.

By the end of the Dec. 19 phone call, Wernick is clearly concerned about having to go back to Trudeau without having made progress on the issue, telling Wilson-Raybould she was at “loggerheads” with the prime minister who is “pretty firm,” and that he’s worried about a “collision.” It also speaks to Wilson-Raybould’s anxiety at the time about the possible consequences for not budging. “I am waiting for … the other shoe to drop, so I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just struck doing the best job that I can,” Wilson-Raybould said. Later, she texted her chief of staff: “Ok the shite is going to hit the fan.” “Uh oh,” replies Jessica Prince. In her accompanying brief, Wilson-Raybould underscored that “prosecutorial independence” remains the core issue — “a principle that at times appears to have been obscured by layers of commentary, hyperbole and spin. “Any attempts to normalize such efforts is very dangerous to the institutions of our democracy,” she said. It wasn’t immediately clear what the committee will do with the new information. Liberal MPs on the committee had already voted to shut down further hearings into the controversy, including an opposition effort to have Wilson-Raybould testify for a second time. Liberal MP Randy Boissonault said the package confirms what “we already know,” that no law was broken. Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told the Star the recording “proves Jody Wilson-Raybould was telling the truth and Justin Trudeau was not. He claimed she never raised any concerns about political interference when she did so at least half a dozen times. He stated blatant falsehoods on that point and many others,” he said. The Conservatives have already asked the RCMP to investigate, as did five former Conservative and Progressive Conservative attorneys-general. The RCMP has not yet opened a formal investigation, but says it is aware of the matter and monitoring events. NDP MP Tracey Ramsay, who is a vice-chair of the justice committee, said the revelations in the audio recording underscore her party’s demand for a public inquiry in light of the Liberals’ refusal to allow committee hearings to proceed. She said the audio of the telephone call presents “clear and compelling and well-documented evidence” of efforts to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution and her determination to rebuff it. “There is no one who would listen to that call and believe she wasn’t pressured,” Ramsay told the Star. “Trudeau has acknowledged that he asked Wilson-Raybould to “revisit” the SNC-Lavalin prosecution decision but has insisted that no ethical or legal lines were crossed. “This is something that I was clear on, and then I asked her — even though I heard that she had made a decision, she indicated to me that she had made a decision — I asked her if she could revisit that decision, if she was open to considering to looking at it once again, and she said that she would,” Trudeau told a news conference earlier this month. Wernick has acknowledged that Wilson-Raybould was approached about the file but maintains that there was no undue influence. In his own committee testimony, he said discussions with the former attorney general were legal and appropriate.

Once again, the Justin Trudeau government is taking a wait-and-see approach to an economic crisis on the prairies.

China began banning canola from being imported by certain Canadian companies in early March. It started with Richardson International Ltd., based out of Winnipeg, and then on Tuesday they added Viterra, out of Saskatchewan, to the ban list. They cite unspecified harmful organisms of which no evidence has been brought forward they even exist. Trade with China accounts for 40 per cent of the industry’s business in Canada and roughly $2.7 billon. According to the Canola Council of Canada, canola is a $2 billion crop in Alberta with an economic spinoff of $7.1 billion, providing 72,500 jobs.

We have seen many times the mere whisper of what a health concern in the ag sector can do to its vitality, it wipes it out and takes years to recover.

One would expect the federal government to jump up to protect this industry. As it revolves around international trade, it is their job.

The prime minister’s biggest statement as of Wednesday, however, came at a stop in Winnipeg, and it was only mentioned because he was pressed on it by questions from reporters.

“We’re very much looking at the possibility of sending a high-level delegation to China,” he said, before adding the required boilerplate that we produce top-quality canola.

You’re looking at sending a delegation to China? Why aren’t they already there? How about a little protection for the 45,000 producers who are out there risking their livelihood to meet the demand created by trade missions with China.

If this was Bombardier those negotiations would already be underway and bailouts would be in the process of being arranged. This has been reality many times in recent years, because, as finance minister Bill Morneau said in 2016, the aerospace sector is “critically important” to Trudeau’s vision of Canada’s future.

Despite the incompetence of those running it.

It’s also a Quebec-based company.

It has been three weeks and hardly a peep about the canola industry from the prime minister.

Of course, there have been complicating factors.

Most notably the extradition process of Chinese tech giant Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou to the U.S., which has forced a wedge into the formerly peaceful relations between Ottawa and Beijing. It is also a leading theory as to what has sparked the canola ban.

There has also been a certain scandal that has rocked Parliament and forced several of Trudeau’s top aides and cabinet ministers to resign, all in the name of protecting another Quebec-based business, SNC-Lavalin. All the PMO has been accused to have done is subvert the rule of law to help a company in Trudeau’s backyard that is facing corruption and bribery charges. I suppose we should excuse him on canola, he has been distracted. And on vacation in Florida.

One might even argue that this would be the perfect opportunity for the prime minister to show he cares about those provinces between B.C. and Ontario. He could run to the front lines, call out the Chinese government on their actions on a daily or even weekly basis, have scientific proof in hand that Canadian canola is safe, and be ready with financial packages to aid farmers who could lose everything.

It would even potentially earn himself some respect back out on the prairies with an election due this fall.

Instead, he is willing to let others like Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe do the heavy lifting and actually start the engagement process between the provinces and the federal government.

What cannot be lost in this is the impact to the local ag sector. When one looks in our own backyard, Parkland County is currently looking at expanding its prime agriculture zoned land by as much as 40 per cent to help diversify the local economy in the face of the coal phase out. Not all of those new acres, of course, would be land devoted to canola, but it is a major cash crop that already has a foothold in the region.

With the announcement of the first ban, the price per bushel of canola dropped by 30 cents. That’s tens of thousands of dollars for a farmer. That can easily be the point of making it or breaking it.

These families and producers are not political pawns. They are Canadians who desperately need the support of their government, regardless of the province they live in.

It wasn’t about left versus right. It wasn’t about serving up a powerful digital cudgel for those seeking to bludgeon Justin Trudeau’s Liberal brand to oblivion.

“Liberal arrogance became the story – and so now we’re all really trying to turn the story back where it actually belongs, with the focus on Grassy Narrows,” said Mark Calzavara of the non-partisan Council of Canadians.

But one day, nearly half a million views and one official Trudeau apology later, the engineers who delivered the 45-second video clip — in which Trudeau responded with glib sarcasm as protesters hijacked the donor-only gathering, telling them again and again, ‘Thank you for your donation’ — found themselves scrambling to steer attention away from what they regard as the sideshow of Trudeau’s reaction and back upon the actual issue.

Their goal wasn’t to feed the hyperpartisan beast such a tasty, virally shareable morsel so that everyone could feast upon Liberal arrogance. All they were looking for — the only thing they really want — is justice for the people of Grassy Narrows , a community that has seen 50 years of federal governments come and go, Conservative and Liberal alike, without a single one of them ever “doing the right thing” for Northern Ontario’s longest-suffering victims of mercury poisoning.

But the telltale encounter had actually been months in the making. Earlier this winter Calzavara and his co-strategist, David Sone of the Free Grassy Narrows campaign, began plotting fresh ways to amplify their message. They settled on a strategy of audacious infiltration, aiming to burrow inside gatherings where they are least expected – and upon loudly exposing themselves, to broadcast it all in real-time on Facebook Live.

Calzavara was the person holding the cellphone camera on Wednesday night inside the 17th-floor ballroom of the King Edward Hotel – and simultaneously, he was shouting down Trudeau, demanding the Prime Minister follow through on his government’s pledge to fund a $17-million treatment centre for Grassy Narrows victims.

“I starting getting emails at a frantic rate and 99 out of 100 are basically spam. But then I saw the message about Trudeau coming to Toronto to speak to party donors. I messaged David right away and we decided, ‘This is the one.’ We had three days to pull it together.”

Calzavara recalls how the Stephen Harper campaign team went to considerable lengths to vet attendees of political gatherings, hoping to weed out message-busting protesters.

By contrast, Trudeau’s Liberal Party made it remarkably easy. Though most published reports suggest the protesters entered after forking out donations $1,500 apiece, that wasn’t the case. The Laurier Club – the donor arm of the Liberal Party – has a handy payment plan. So Calzavara and his partner-in-confrontation, Grassy Narrows ally Lana Goldberg, signed up for the first monthly instalment of $125 each, intent upon cancelling all future payments after the event.

The Liberal Party’s media notice, sent to reporters in advance of the event, actually emphasizes the point, saying, “The Liberal Party of Canada has committed to the strongest standards in federal politics for openness and transparency with political fundraising events, and is challenging other parties to do the same.”

There’s always a risk of arrest in such direct action at events so rife with RCMP protection. Calzavara said this one was planned so that Sone and his group of about 20 actual Grassy Narrows survivors were outside the building on King Street, a safe distance from whatever might ensue in the confrontation upstairs.

“We agreed to handle the confrontational stuff on behalf of the Grassy folks for lots of different reasons – but one is that Aboriginal protesters, overall, tend to get treated differently. In this case, Lana and I were gently ushered out of the room but that isn’t always the case,” said Calzavara.

They struck immediately, almost the moment Trudeau stepped out with microphone in hand. Goldberg led the way and as security closed in, Calzavara followed up – it is his voice you hear, from behind the camera, shouting the question in personal terms to the Prime Minister. “If it was your family that’s been waiting 500 days – if it was your family suffering from mercury poisoning – what would you do? Would you accept it? Mr. Trudeau, for 500 days you have not kept the commitment.”

Calzavara explains that in the final seconds of the clip, the jostling you see was triggered by an older woman – presumably a supporter trying to protect Trudeau – trying to “rip the camera out of my hand.”

“I didn’t expect that! But it was just a flash reaction. I try to stay cognizant of the fact that if you are doing something that is raiding the energy of the room, you can’t know how people will react and you should expect things might get weird.”

Weird – but also pointless. The protest world has transformed thanks to platforms like as Facebook Live, which let the cat out of the bag in real time. Even as the woman was grasping, the damage was already registering online – beamed directly to the Council of Canadians Facebook page. And soon thereafter, onto the Free Grassy Narrows Twitter feed, where “it really went into the stratosphere.”

Trudeau was still speaking to donors as the disastrous clip began to catch fire. Minutes later, as The Star caught up with Sone, Calzavara and the smattering of protesters outside the hotel on the north side of King Street East, all were hunched over their phones, watching and rewatching the clip with increasing excitement as it gained momentum online. Often such efforts result in as few as a dozen viewers. This one, obviously, was different. And as it took off, the protesters who triggered were still trying and make sense of Trudeau’s response. What was he thinking, they wondered?

“Trudeau’s usual protest-management strategy is to say, ‘Thank you, that’s an important issue, thank you for sharing your thoughts – and yet here he was like a windup doll, standing in a room full of donors and repeating over and over, ‘Thank you for your donation.’ I really can’t imagine what he was thinking,” Sone told the Star on King Street.

If there was any political imperative behind Wednesday’s protest action, it was informed by concern that Trudeau is already in trouble – and by extension, time is fast running out for this government to deliver on the pledge made 500 days ago by then-Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott.

“Who knows what will happen in October with the federal elections?” said Sone. “It would be devastating if this were to become one more broken promise to the people of Grassy Narrows. Something like this, that’s 50 years overdue, should not be hanging in the balance on the popularity of this government.”

One day later – with the story focusing more on Trudeau than Grassy Narrows and an apology from the Prime Minister already in hand — Sone declined to comment, asking instead that reporters speak with senior tribal leaders in a bid to steer emphasis back toward mercury victims.

Calzavara, for his part, was actively doing interviews with similar intent, trying to remind people what this is really all about.

“In a few minutes I’m about to go on air with a right-wing media personality who is known for Trudeau-bashing. I had a look at her feed and I didn’t notice a single thing on issues relating to First Nations,” said Calzavara.

“So she’ll want to talk about Trudeau’s arrogance but I see this as a wonderful opportunity to try to get her listeners to understand the 50-year history of Grassy Narrows being ignored by everyone from Joe Clark to Brian Mulroney to Jean Chrétien o Stephen Harper till now. There’s lots of blame to go around and this is a chance to reach people who won’t normally listen to us.

“If people are focused on the fact that Trudeau said something flippant and rude and had to apologize, we’ll take it. That’s just reality today. But the much more important story here is the actual issue of Grassy Narrows. And making sure that federal action matches the words.”

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a trial by paying a fine instead.

The crisis may well threaten Trudeau’s reelection chances in a vote this October. Polls show his center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

Wilson-Raybould made public around 40 pages of documents revealing more details of what she said were attempts by officials to force her change her mind even after she insisted they desist.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and resigned the following month, first made the allegations in almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month.

Trudeau says officials were trying to make Wilson-Raybould understand that thousands of jobs would be at risk if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty of bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau insists he and his team did nothing wrong.

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest personal aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy, Michael Wernick.

Wilson-Raybould included a recording of a phone call with Wernick last December in which he told her he was worried about “a collision” between her and Trudeau “because he is pretty firm about this.”

Wilson-Raybould, who stressed she thought the call was inappropriate, told Wernick she was waiting “for the other shoe to drop” because she was under no illusion about how Trudeau “gets things that he wants.”

Opposition legislators said the documents reinforced their demand for a public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau says is not necessary.

“She is actually trying to speak truth to power, trying to say, ‘You can’t do this,’ ... and it keeps happening,” New Democratic Party parliamentarian Nathan Cullen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau’s office was not immediately available for comment.

And there’s no end in sight.

There’s only one sure exit from this scandal. The question now is whether the Trudeau Liberal government is willing to consider it. Or determined to continue bleeding, everyday.

Again last week the Liberals attempted to suffocate the story, shutting down the justice committee and tryng to change the channel to their budget. When that failed, Liberals reacted with internecine attacks on former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott.

It was another failure. The counter-attacks on Wilson-Raybould and Philpott gave more fodder to pundit shows and newspaper columnists—and picked the weakest ground to fight on. According to IPSOS pollster Darryl Bricker, surveys show Canadians are twice as likely to believe Wilson-Raybould than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

For seven weeks the Liberal Party has been losing a war of siege and attrition. In January the Conservatives were languishing, the NDP was on its back and the Liberals were cruising. Now the Liberals risk falling beneath 30 per cent support, Nanos and IPSOS show the NDP has rebounded to 20 per cent and the Conservatives have climbed to the mid or high 30s.

Against this siege the Trudeau Liberals have no ammunition. If the Liberals had evidence that Wilson-Raybould’s story was untrue, Liberal MPs would have brought it to the justice committee weeks ago. But none of the justice committee testimony has refuted the central claim that there were multiple improper attempts to interfere in a criminal prosecution.

Now the siege is about to tighten. Soon, Wilson-Raybould will table more evidence, including emails and texts. Only she knows what it will say. But it will not help the PM. And it will be news.

By now it should be crystal clear to Liberal strategists and party grandees they cannot prevent Canadians from getting the truth about the PMO’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould. There is too much interest in this story—rightfully so, because any attempted interference in a criminal prosecution is profoundly serious—and it appears, one way or another, Wilson-Raybould is determined to tell it.

The Trudeau Liberals need to stop doing what can’t work—and take the only path that might.

The Prime Minister needs to tell Canadians he’s done some real soul-searching. He needs to admit to making mistakes. Ask for forgiveness. Call an inquiry. And commit to working hard to get back on agenda and rebuilding trust.

Yes, it will hurt. More PMO staff may resign. There could be a finding that Trudeau broke the constitutionally-embedded legal principle of non-interference in prosecutions.

But the alternative is more painful. The Trudeau Liberal government isn’t just facing weeks of more damaging evidence with a loser communications strategy. An election is seven months away. Based on polls today, the most likely outcome of is some sort of minority Parliament. And that opens the door to the justice committee—even if the Liberals continue to govern—investigating the scandal fully, calling witnesses and issuing subpoenas.

Those who are loyal to their political principles know that defending what’s not defendable isn’t just a fool’s strategy. It’s political tragedy. Mistakes made can’t be unmade. No amount of spin annihilates them. The true test of political principle and loyalty isn’t telling a leader he’s always right, it’s telling him when he’s wrong. For Liberals, it’s that time now.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A former cabinet member at the heart of a crisis that could cost Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau his job on Friday released documents to back up her case that she had been pressured to help a large corporation avoid a corruption trial.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a trial by paying a fine instead.

The crisis may well threaten Trudeau's reelection chances in a vote this October. Polls show his center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

Trudeau says officials were trying to make Wilson-Raybould understand that thousands of jobs would be at risk if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty of bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau insists he and his team did nothing wrong.

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest personal aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy, Michael Wernick.

Wilson-Raybould included a recording of a phone call with Wernick last December in which he told her he was worried about ""a collision"" between her and Trudeau ""because he is pretty firm about this.""

Wilson-Raybould, who stressed she thought the call was inappropriate, told Wernick she was waiting ""for the other shoe to drop"" because she was under no illusion about how Trudeau ""gets things that he wants.""

Opposition legislators said the documents reinforced their demand for a public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau says is not necessary.

""She is actually trying to speak truth to power, trying to say, 'You can't do this,' ... and it keeps happening,"" New Democratic Party parliamentarian Nathan Cullen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau's office was not immediately available for comment.

The crisis is opening rifts inside the Liberal Party and some legislators want Wilson-Raybould to be kicked out of the parliamentary caucus, a move Trudeau has so far resisted.

OTTAWA — The federal government is defending its refusal to disclose the contents of a 60-page memo the country's top bureaucrat sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

In a statement Friday, the Department of Justice said the memo sent by Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, to Trudeau last October was completely blacked out by government lawyers.

Norman's lawyer Marie Henein revealed the memo's existence during a pre-trial hearing Thursday, saying the government had withheld its contents because of solicitor-client privilege.

After both Henein and Justice Heather Perkins-McVey noted that Wernick was not a lawyer, the judge agreed to set aside two days in April for Henein to challenge the privilege claim.

In its statement, the Justice Department said the memo was handled the same way as the other documents requested by Norman's legal team and blacked out by government lawyers.

""These redactions were applied by legal counsel,"" the Justice Department said, adding that ""such redactions are consistent with the normal process applied to all documents.

""The final say on these redactions and relevance of the documents rests with the court.""

Friday's statement is the latest from the Justice Department about the Norman case, some of which Henein flagged to the court earlier this month as being ""inaccurate.""

Suspended as the military's second-in-command in January 2017, Norman was charged last year with breach of trust for allegedly leaking government secrets to pressure the newly minted Trudeau government to approve a $700-million shipbuilding contract.

That contract, negotiated by the Harper Conservatives and finalized by Trudeau's Liberals in November 2015, involved leasing a converted civilian ship from Davie Shipbuilding in Quebec as a temporary naval supply vessel.

Norman has denied any wrongdoing and his politically charged trial is scheduled to start in August and run through much of the fall federal election.

Norman’s legal team has been fighting since October for access to thousands of internal government documents they say will prove the suspended military officer's innocence and show that the government interfered in his case.

Subpoenas were issued last month for internal communications from senior officials in the Prime Minister’s Office and the Privy Council Office about the case, including emails, BlackBerry messages and other records.

Trudeau ...,"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came under withering criticism Thursday after a sarcastic put down of a protester highlighting mercury poisoning in a First Nations community.

Trudeau offered a swift apology for his lack of respect, but his comments at a high-end Liberal fundraising event on Wednesday drew widespread condemnation.

“Trudeau’s apology rings hollow while our people are suffering without the care and support that we need,” said Rudy Turtle, the chief of the Grassy Narrows First Nation, the northern Ontario community suffering the impact from mercury poisoning.

Perry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the prime minister’s comments were “completely unacceptable and offensive,” and called on Trudeau to visit the affected communities in order to “see the impacts of the mercury contamination firsthand.”

Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that

Trudeau apologized after a video surfaced of him making a snide remark to protester Lana Goldberg after she unfurled a banner in front of the prime minister as he addressed a $1,500-a-ticket fundraiser in Toronto.

“Prime Minister Trudeau, people at Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning,” she said.

As she was dragged out, the prime minister said, “Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate it,” drawing applause and laughter from the audience.

On Thursday, Trudeau apologized for his comments to the protester and to the broader First Nations community.

“From time to time I’m in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and I always try to engage with them in a positive way,” Trudeau told reporters in Halifax.

“Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.”

Any funds that the protesters contributed in order to gain access to the event would be refunded, he added.

“They wanted to express their concerns about an issue and I do take that seriously and I apologize to them.”

“I’ve never seen him give that kind of cynical or shut-down response,” said Mark Calzavara, a member of the advocacy group Council of Canadians, who captured the comments on his phone. Calzavara was also raising awareness about the First Nations community.

Opposition members of parliament blasted Trudeau’s comments as being flippant, saying it contradicted the Liberal government’s carefully crafted brand of reconciliatory and progressive politics.

“What a smug, mean, aloof ass,” NDP MP Charlie Angus said on Twitter.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel called Trudeau “smug” and “arrogant.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted, “Instead of showing respect for people fighting for clean water & funding, Trudeau sides with his rich donors to get a laugh.”

Grassy Narrows has been suffering from mercury poisoning in its local water supply for decades, after an upstream pulp and paper mill dumped thousands of pounds of effluent into the English-Wabigoon river system through the 60s and early 70s.

Meanwhile, a medical treatment centre in the community promised by Ottawa lags behind schedule.

In November, Federal Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott announced that Ottawa would provide $170,000 to fund a feasibility study for a long-term treatment centre in Grassy Narrows. Ottawa also promised a treatment centre in the Wabaseemoong, or Whitedog, First Nation that has had similar mercury poisonings.

The facility in Grassy Narrows, designed to hold around 20 beds, was meant to begin construction in the fall of 2018, but has not yet broken ground. One person familiar with the matter said that in discussions with the community in December, Philpott said she expected the project to get underway around June of this year, already months behind its initial start date.

Members of the Grassy Narrows and Whitedog First Nations have been found to have uncommonly high levels of mercury in their blood stream, largely from eating fish from the English-Wabigoon river system. Mercury is often carried in fish, particularly white fish species like walleye, and it “bioaccumulates” — meaning it is often passed down from one generation to the next through childbirth, and is nearly impossible to rid from the body.

Sufferers of mercury poisoning have been known to have learning disabilities, blurred vision and difficulty balancing, among other ailments.

I’ve never seen him give that kind of cynical or shut-down response

The estimated cost of the Grassy Narrows treatment centre is $17 million, but due to the inter-generational existence of mercury the community is calling on Ottawa to provide maintenance and services to the facility over a 30-year period, for a total of roughly $88 million.

Chief Turtle said the community, about 100 kilometres north of Kenora, Ont., needed to have the money put into a trust to ensure that future governments did not suddenly take away the promised funding.

“I acknowledge Trudeau’s apology, but more importantly he needs to deliver on his government’s promise to build a Home and Treatment Center so our mercury survivors can be cared for with dignity,” Turtle said.

Japanese researchers have been studying patients in Grassy Narrows for decades, and have found residents of the community displaying symptoms of Minamata disease, named after a small Japanese town where 900 people died as a result of eating fish tainted with mercury.

In December, a report found that mercury poisoning of the local river system was causing a number of health issues for youth in the community, particularly pregnant women, including anemia and attention deficit disorder.",Opposition lashes out at ‘arrogant’ Trudeau after he thanks First Nations protesters for donations,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/news/smug-arrogant-opposition-lashes-out-against-trudeau-after-he-thanks-first-nations-protestors-for-their-liberal-party-donations/wcm/4105e35b-6d6c-4277-9d8d-768902105882

In a statement to Global News, the PMO also said it was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

WATCH: Secret recording of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s phone call with Michael Wernick on SNC-Lavalin released

The statement emerged amid the release of a recording in which Wilson-Raybould could be heard telling Michael Wernick, the outgoing clerk of the PCO, that she was concerned about the appearance of political interference if she were to override the director of public prosecutions and offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA).

In their phone conversation, which took place in December 2018, Wilson-Raybould told Wernick that “this conversation, previous conversations I’ve had with the PM and people around him are entirely inappropriate. It is political interference.”

The recording backs up most of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony before the parliamentary justice committee, in which she alleged that Wernick made “veiled threats” against her with regard to a prosecution deal for the Quebec-based engineering company.

During the conversation, Wernick could be heard telling Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister was in a “mood” about this matter and that, “I think the way he sees it and the advice he’s getting is you still have things you can do that are entirely lawful.”

Wernick also said, “he’s in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so I’m a bit worried.”

“A bit worried about what?” Wilson-Raybould responded.

“It’s not a good idea for the PM and his attorney general to be at loggerheads,” Wernick said. He added that the prime minister “doesn’t have the power to do what he wants, all the tools are in your hands.

Wernick has denied making any threats to her.

In the statement, the PMO said the prime minister “should have spoken directly with the former justice minister and attorney general about this matter — and wishes that she had come to him.”

The PMO went on to say that there was “clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months between PMO, the clerk of the Privy Council, and the former justice minister and attorney general.”

“The prime minister took responsibility for the situation and announced several next steps, including external expert opinions on a number of things as they relate to the set of issues raised over the past few weeks,” the statement said.

The PMO concluded by saying, “all the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the prime minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

The tape came as part of a submission package in which Wilson-Raybould also relayed concern that her successor, now-Justice Minister David Lametti, could offer SNC-Lavalin the deal that she refused to help them secure.

Wilson-Raybould acknowledged that it was wrong to record her conversation with Wernick, but she said she did that because she was worried that the conversation would be inappropriate — and that it could follow the pattern of the exchanges she had with others in parliament.

The community hopes to build a world-class mercury treatment facility to help deal with the fallout from the poisoning, which causes often irreparable damage, including impaired vision; muscle weakness; speech, hearing and cognitive problems; and numbness or stinging pain in the extremities and mouth.

Grassy Narrows staff met with former Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott in December to discuss progress on the facility, shortly after giving the government a feasibility study for the project. At that time, Philpott said the government was actively working to get it built.

Trudeau should go to Grassy Narrows to apologize to the people there directly and in person, suggested Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde.

""This incident highlights the need for action now,"" said Bellegarde.

When a leader increases their party’s seat count from 36 to 184, as Justin Trudeau did in his majority-winning 2015 election campaign, he’s entitled to some good will. The question now staring Trudeau’s Liberals in the face is: how much?

It’s a question at least some of the herd must be asking after their colleagues on the Ethics Committee shut down yet another potential line of enquiry into the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Or, if not that, the question is being asked in light of the government’s cack-handed (and pathetic) attempt to smear Jody Wilson-Raybould using the Chief Justice of Manitoba as a canvas, a move that finally got the legal community off its arse on the mega-issue dominating the political agenda.

Heaping smear on top of political interference in the criminal justice system isn’t what any Liberal ran on in 2015, and it’s something no Liberal should want to run on later this year. So why are most Liberal MPs still fronting Trudeau’s nonsense?

Come to think of it, do most Liberal MPs even know what happened? Have any of them pressed Team Trudeau for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Does the backbench know what Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott (and presumably Cabinet) knows, or are they operating on blind faith?

If it’s the latter I would recommend they take their head out of the sand forthwith, because it’s their asses that are on the line. If Trudeau is caught up in something awful—an impression he grants every time he muzzles a person or an investigative body—they are going to wear it too.

READ MORE: On the elimination of inconvenient Liberals

At root, it’s a question of what our politics is meant to be. Solidarity come hell or (possibly criminal) high water, or a declaration of principles that are to be adhered to even if the King decides they are no longer convenient? All that’s certain is that Liberals of good faith are running out of time to keep the taint from the party brand that, believe it or not, should extend beyond their leader.

Every once in a while, anyway, there is a glimpse of steel. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have clearly made their stand, and MPs like Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and Wayne Long have encouraged the Prime Minister to allow their colleagues to speak freely. Sadly, they are the exception that proves the rule of caucus solidarity. For every independent mind there is a ‘good soldier’ like Judy Sgro around to tell them to get back in line.

Now, someone like me would delight in all of this, wouldn’t I? But I speak from experience. I’ve put my cack hands to use in the service of scandal, too.

I will bet you the vast majority of Conservative backbench MPs in the last Parliament would rather we had vomited out the Mike Duffy business all at once so they could make their judgments about its propriety in 2013 rather than come election time, when it was before the courts. Sometimes the attempt at a political cover up becomes the crime (as it was with Duffy—with the caucus never losing faith in Harper as their leader), but other times the cover up is there to blanket an actual crime. It would be good for Liberals to know with which they’re dealing. At least you’d think. But politics is a funny business and partisanship is a hell of a drug.

Given that Wilson-Raybould herself has said the approaches made to her over the back end of last year on SNC weren’t—in her view—illegal, one suspects the unrevealed bits of the SNC saga speak more to Trudeau’s character, and not the legality of his actions, or the actions of those in his employ. Given the Liberals are so reliant on Trudeau as the figurehead and his image as their brand, it would explain why Trudeau’s office would fight tooth and nail to keep any contrary evidence out of public view. We’ve had a glimpse of angry Trudeau before, including the recent bust-up with Celina Caesar-Chavannes, and it hasn’t always been pretty.

Either way, the truth will out.

In case the Prime Minister hasn’t figured this out yet, the two former ministers arrayed against him are both smarter and more determined than he is. Given their un-shifting story, they also appear to be on firmer ground. They think Trudeau’s pulled some funny business and they aren’t going to rest until all of the dirty laundry is aired in public. And if the PMO tries to smear them, they will punch right back, and land the heavier blow.

And you know who will be cheering that on? Team Orange and Team Blue, that’s who. Forget that people aren’t really warming to Andrew Scheer; if Trudeau has done something very ugly it won’t take a political genius to beat him. Remember Doug Ford?

If I were a Liberal MP who was still in the dark over the truth I would be asking for some light. Stat. The Liberals not named Trudeau need to ask themselves what they’re in Ottawa to try to accomplish. Are they in it for their platform and their party, or are they in it for the (potentially dis)honourable Member from Papineau?

In other words, are they Liberals, or are they a Trudeau’s men and women?

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

221,Politics,2019-03-30T02:38:00.0000000Z,(Bloomberg) -- China is ramping up pressure on Justin Trudeau in a feud that already had the Canadian prime minister facing few good options.

The Asian nation halted certain canola shipments from Canada this month in the aftermath of last year’s arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. executive in Vancouver on an American extradition request. Officials in Beijing are now, in the same breath, defending the canola move and invoking Canadian “previous mistakes,” in an apparent nod to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the tech giant’s chief financial officer and daughter of its founder.

Trudeau doesn’t have a clear solution. His government can’t legally intervene in Meng’s case at this point, even after President Donald Trump hinted she could be a bargaining chip in U.S.-China trade talks. The prime minister was already grappling with China’s continued detention of two Canadians on national security grounds and a looming decision on banning Huawei from his country’s next-generation wireless networks. Now he’s getting an earful from farmers whose crops are being turned away.

“This is part of the usual playbook that is used by China,” Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said Wednesday on BNN Bloomberg television. Australian coal exporters are facing similar pressure tactics from Beijing, which struck a canola deal with Trudeau’s government three year ago that was supposed to run through 2020.

“Nothing has changed in the meantime -- except we have entered into this big bilateral crisis following the arrest of Ms. Meng,” Saint-Jacques said.

Billions in Trade

The northern nation shipped C$4.4 billion ($3.3 billion) of the crop to China last year, according to the Canola Council of Canada. Beijing has confirmed the suspension of exports from Glencore Plc-owned Viterra Inc. and Winnipeg-based Richardson International Ltd. Trudeau is considering sending a Canadian delegation for talks on the rejected orders.

China says the move is due to quarantine rules but hasn’t yet offered evidence. China says it found pests in shipments that had already been cleared by Canadian inspections.

“The Chinese side has taken these precautionary quarantine measures to ensure safety,” China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said Wednesday. “As for China-Canada relations, we hope that the Canadian side could work with us to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations. The Canadian side should take some concrete measures to correct its previous mistakes.”

In recent years, Beijing’s displeasure with smaller trading partners including South Korea, the Philippines, and now Canada have all been accompanied by economic pressure through import restrictions, store inspections and safety warnings to Chinese tour groups.

Trudeau, speaking Tuesday, cited diplomatic tensions as one cause for the canola problem. Jim Everson, president of Canada’s canola council, supports the idea of sending a delegation. “We’re really eager to talk to China about the issues they’ve raised,” Everson told BNN Bloomberg television. Farmers “are increasingly perplexed by what the issues are.”

Detained Canadians

Meng was arrested on Dec. 1. China detained Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both Canadian citizens, on Dec. 10. The two remain in Chinese custody.

Canada agreed this month to allow Meng’s extradition hearing to proceed, a move that angered China. Meng then launched a civil suit in response. Then on March 4, China’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said Kovrig had violated Chinese law by spying and stealing state secrets while working for the International Crisis Group, and said Spavor was his primary contact.

“It’s unfortunate that we ended up in this mess, thanks to our friends, the Americans. We have to try to use all avenues to try to resume a dialog with China, to try to lower the temperature related to the case of Ms. Meng,” Saint-Jacques said. “And let’s not forget that we have two people in jail in China that are going through some very difficult interrogation problems.”

Trudeau is weighing whether to ban or restrict the use of Huawei equipment in Canada’s 5G networks. He said this week there’s “significant concern” around privacy, though upside to Canadian businesses having cutting-edge technology. He gave no timeline for a decision.

222,,2019-03-29T16:36:00.0000000Z,OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is apologizing after he sarcastically dismissed demonstrators who paid to attend a Liberal fundraiser in Toronto Wednesday night to voice concern about mercury poisoning at the Grassy Narrows First Nation. Video from ...,"""I always try to be respectful…I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that,"" Trudeau said.

The Star has reported extensively on the effects of an industrial mercury dump 50 years ago upstream from Grassy Narrows First Nation, revealing that fish near the community are the most contaminated in the province, that there is mercury-contaminated soil and river sediment at or near the site of the old mill, and the provincial government knew in the 1990s that mercury was visible in soil and never told anyone inGrassy Narrows or nearby Wabaseemoong (Whitedog) Independent Nations.

New research reported in December indicated children in Grassy Narrows whose mothers ate fish at least once a week while pregnant are four times more likely to have a learning disability or nervous system disorder.

People in the community have also developed tremors, slurred speech, impaired hearing and tunnel vision, and lost muscle co-ordination, the Star has reported.

On top of that, the fishing industry in the region has been decimated.

Trudeau's jibe toward demonstrators at the Liberal fundraiser was greeted with criticism. Perry Bellegarde, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, posted on Twitter that Trudeau's comments ""unacceptable and offensive"" and said he should apologize directly to those involved.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters on Parliament Hill Thursday that Trudeau's comment was ""callous."" He called the situation in Grassy Narrows a ""horrible tragedy"" that should be approached with compassion.

""I think we were all deeply offended by Mr. Trudeau's remarks,"" Singh said. ""The fact that Mr. Trudeau didn't respond with compassion maybe speaks to the fact that he doesn't actually care about what people are going through, and that's something that's really hurtful.""

Justin Trudeau’s government welcomes BC’s support on carbon tax, but is siding with Alberta’s Rachel Notley in fighting against BC’s right to regulate oil ...","The federal government’s treatment of British Columbia shows the Trudeau Liberals’ “incoherence” on climate change, says an environmental campaigner.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

On one hand, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna is calling B.C. an “exemplary climate leader” on Twitter, because the provincial government supports its carbon tax.

At the same time, the Trudeau government is fighting to force the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion through B.C. over the provincial government’s objections and accusing B.C. of hurting the country’s economy.

As a result, B.C. is involved in three court cases concerning environmental issues that involve the federal government.

In two, the province is intervening in support of the federal government to argue in favour of a national carbon tax.

In the third, B.C. is asking if it has the right to control what hazardous materials come across its borders, which could give it the ability to block the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

The conflicting legal cases show a basic problem with the federal government’s climate change policies, Dogwood BC campaigner Sophie Harrison told The Tyee.

“It speaks to the fundamental incoherence in the federal government’s climate change policies,” she said. “Out of one side of their mouth they are talking about leading on climate, they are talking about making polluters pay for climate damages... and out of the other side of their mouth they pay oil companies to pollute. And they do this with subsidies and tax breaks.”

The federal Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act comes into effect Monday.

The tax will start at $10 per tonne of carbon emissions, gradually rising to $50.

People and industries that already have a carbon tax in place — like B.C. — won’t see any impact.

Saskatchewan and Ontario are fighting the carbon tax and challenging its constitutional legitimacy in court.

Saskatchewan argued in the province’s appeal court in February that dealing with carbon emissions is a provincial responsibility, and the federal government does not have the right to tax provincial Crown corporations SaskPower and SaskEnergy, which would be affected.

Ontario’s similar challenge will be heard in the province’s appeal court in April.

In both cases the federal government is arguing greenhouse gases are a national concern and fall under its jurisdiction, according to court documents.

B.C., which adopted a carbon tax in 2008, has been cited as an international example of how a developed economy can grow while at the same time reducing carbon emissions.

In a court document prepared for the Ontario case, Tim Lesiuk of the B.C. government’s Climate Action Secretariat argued the lack of a national carbon tax has allowed pollution to flow freely from other provinces to harm British Columbians — citing rising sea levels, fiercer fire seasons, melting permafrost and ocean acidification, among other concerns.

The David Suzuki Foundation, represented by Ecojustice, is also intervening in support of Ottawa in the two cases, arguing the federal government has the right to set a federal carbon price because climate change is a national emergency.

B.C. and the federal government agree in the carbon tax cases — action or inaction in one jurisdiction affects other provinces.

But in the Trans Mountain expansion court case, the federal government is opposing B.C.’s argument that it has the right to regulate the flow of potentially harmful substances through the province — in this case in a pipeline.

B.C. is asking the Court of Appeal to rule on whether it has the right to amend the Environmental Management Act to control oil or bitumen shipments in the province and whether the federal government could override that law.

The proposed amendments would require companies transporting hazardous materials through B.C. to gain permits first.

But federal lawyers argued the changes were unconstitutional, because the federal government has jurisdiction over interprovincial infrastructure.

Ecojustice lawyer Kegan Pepper-Smith told media outside the courthouse March 18 the province has the right to act if it sees gaps in federal protection.

The court has reserved its decision on the province’s application.

The National Energy Board released its second review of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in February where it found the project could have “significant adverse environmental effects.” But it recommended the federal government approve the project in the name of Canada’s public interest.","Court Battles Reveal ‘Fundamental Incoherence’ in Trudeau’s Climate Policies, Says Campaigner",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/03/29/BC-Climate-Leadership-Fundamental-Incoherence/

The recent SNC-Lavalin scandal and a number of earlier missteps have taken its toll.

A new Global News Ipsos poll finds Trudeau’s approval rating (40 per cent) is now below Trump’s (43 per cent), even as the Conservative Party established a double-digit lead over the Liberals.

The Liberal government’s federal budget was uninspiring to a lot of Canadians and did little to change the sagging fortunes of the Liberals.

The Conservatives now enjoy high numbers in Ontario and British Columbia, meanwhile PM Trudeau is falling behind among two key demographics -women and young people.

If an election were held tomorrow, the Conservatives would receive 40 per cent of the vote among decided voters, according to the poll of 1,002 Canadians conducted between March 25 and 27.

The Liberals would receive 30 per cent of the vote — down one point — while the NDP would receive 21 per cent and the Bloc Quebecois five per cent.

In seat-rich Ontario, the Conservatives (40 per cent) have opened up a 12-point lead over the Liberals, who are tied with the NDP at 28 per cent.

The Tories also enjoy a double-digit lead in British Columbia, where the Liberals and NDP are in a scrap for second place.

Alberta looks to be a foregone conclusion, with the Conservatives (63 per cent) light-years ahead of the Liberals (17 per cent) and NDP (15 per cent).

Liberals are only ahead in Quebec, where they have the support of 38 per cent of respondents.

The NDP, with only 12 per cent of the vote support, is poised to lose most if not all of its seats in Quebec.

Trudeau’s 40 per cent rating is also lower than that of former PM Stephen Harper at this stage in 2015, with Harper having a 47 per cent rating in April 2015.

Still there are several months before Canadians go the polls and a lot can happen between now and then. -CINEWS",Trudeau has lower approval rating than Trump,Canindia.com,http://www.canindia.com/trudeau-has-lower-approval-rating-than-trump/

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was confronted by protesters who hoped to draw his attention to mercury contamination in the First Nation communities of Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong during a Liberal fundraiser in Toronto on Wednesday night.

The prime minister’s response?

“Thank you for your donation.”

WATCH (March 25): Trudeau says he’s ‘changing’ processes in PMO after SNC-Lavalin affair

That was according to a video posted to Twitter that showed Trudeau delivering a speech during the Laurier Club event at the luxury Omni King Edward Hotel.

Laurier Club members are considered high-end Liberal donors who must contribute a minimum of $1,500 in order to join the ranks.

“Mr. Trudeau, people at Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning. You committed to addressing this crisis,” a protester could be heard saying as she held up a banner calling on the prime minister to compensate people within the community.

The protester was subsequently ushered away. That’s when Trudeau addressed her directly.

“Thank you for being here, thank you for your donation tonight. I really appreciate it,” he said, to laughs, applause and cheers from the audience.

The prime minister then continued: “As you know, the Liberal Party is filled with different perspectives and different opinions, and we respect them all.”

Another protester, still in the audience, then said off-camera: “If it was your family that’s been waiting for 500 days, if your family was suffering from mercury poisoning, what would you do? If it was your family, would you accept it? Would you accept 500 days for one per cent?”

READ MORE: ANALYSIS — Biggest peril for Team Trudeau is that Liberals are at war with each other

A Facebook event promoting the protest alleged that Trudeau is “failing to help Grassy Narrows, a key test of his ‘commitment’ to meaningful relationships with First Nations and to a healthy environment.”

The event post said that in November 2017, then-minister of Indigenous services Jane Philpott had “promised to build and operate a Mercury Survivors Home and Care Center in Grassy Narrows.”

However, 500 days have passed since that commitment, and “only one per cent of the cost to build the facility has flowed and the project has stalled.”

WATCH (Nov. 28, 2017): ‘Canada has to wake up’ to Grassy Narrows mercury contamination crisis

The event post went on to say that all but six per cent of Grassy Narrows people have received “no compensation for the intense impacts of the ongoing mercury crisis on their health, culture and livelihood.

“Instead of getting the support they need, they face chronic denial as they live with deep poverty and severe food insecurity.”

Philpott, who has since left the Liberal cabinet, indeed pledged federal funding to the Grassy Narrows First Nation to fund a treatment centre to help people suffering the effects of mercury contamination.

Mercury contamination has been an issue in the area for half a century, after a paper mill located in Dryden, Ont., dumped thousands of kilograms of mercury into the English-Wabigoon river system in the 1960s.

“This is what they need and should have, and we are very happy to support them in it,” Philpott said at the time.

A health survey published by the Grassy Narrows First Nation last year showed that the health of people there was “significantly worse” than other First Nations in Canada.

The community had fewer elders, and this survey suggested that people there were dying prematurely.

The Supreme Court of Canada has said it will hear a case over whether Ontario’s provincial government can force Weyerhaeuser Co. and Resolute Forest Products to clean the former mill site in Dryden.

The provincial government had ordered them to clean the site in 2011, but they claimed they had received indemnity.

A recording that Wilson-Raybould had secretly made of a call between herself and the Privy Council Clerk as well as emails, texts and her written statement were tabled to the committee.

In a statement, Scheer said: “These documents and recordings are concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution. He personally gave the orders and when the former Attorney General refused to follow them and break the law, she was fired.

“Ms. Wilson-Raybould repeatedly told the Prime Minister and his top officials that their actions were ‘entirely inappropriate’ and amounted to ‘political interference’. Despite her objections, the Clerk of the Privy Council pressured her and made it clear that her job was on the line.

“Justin Trudeau also told Canadians what he knew to be false. He knew that his Attorney General had serious concerns about his plan to get SNC-Lavalin off of serious criminal charges. But he looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him. This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation.

“The entire SNC-Lavalin scandal is corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.

You had government by PMO’

BY RATTAN MALL

FORMER federal minister Herb Dhaliwal, who served in Jean Chretien’s Cabinet from 1997-2003, told The VOICE this week that among the steps that Justin Trudeau needs to take to get out of the political mess he’s in is to bring some new people into the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

He told me: “He had a lot of inexperienced young people who were probably very smart but didn’t have the wisdom and the experience and I think he’s got to make changes. He’s already made some changes – he’s actually made my former chief of staff George Young to liaison with the Caucus and I think it’s a sort of the first step to better manage his Caucus.”

Dhaliwal added: “I think they have learned that managing caucus is very important in politics and I think that’s one thing they didn’t really understand. So now they’ve made some changes.”

He said Trudeau has to decentralize power in the PMO because a few people started centralizing power in that office. “One of the things they can do is – as has traditionally been – have a regional minister. They never had a regional minister. So, of course, that gave more power to the people in the Prime Minister’s Office. They need to appoint a regional minister for each part of the country.”

Dhaliwal said: “The other thing I think is that he has to reach to the whole Liberal Party – Liberals from the past, Liberals from the present, Liberals of the future. And I think that’s one thing he’s not done well. He needs to do that because it’s important.”

He pointed out: “Remember they were all talking about Trudeau and the Team? They have to start talking about the Liberal Party. It’s a great political institution and they had forgotten the history of this party. So they need to now re-establish the strength of the larger Liberal Party – people from the past, people from the present and people who are going to come in the future. So that’s important.”

DHALIWAL bluntly noted: “They also have to get back to governing by Cabinet. The PMO people were trying to tell ministers what to do. I never had that problem when I was minister. And you need to have government by Cabinet. You had government by PMO and they need to change that.”

He added: “The other thing is that they used to have the Prime Minister’s Office attend the Liberal Caucus meeting. We never had that. There was a reason for that. Because Prime Minister Chretien wanted everybody to be open, upfront, to speak up and not to be afraid just because there were people from the Prime Minister’s Office. We never had people from the Prime Minister’s Office in the Liberal Caucus meeting – we never had that!”

Dhaliwal said: “So you have to manage Caucus better. It’s like having a board of 170 directors. You have to listen to them. You have to hear them out. You have to give them access to you. … It’s very important to manage them and I think they didn’t realize how important it was. Now they are learning how important it is to manage Caucus.

“The other thing in politics is you have to walk the talk. You can’t talk; you have to walk the talk. We talk about transparency. Let’s be transparent and tell it like it is. So they’ve mishandled this because they weren’t transparent, open from the beginning; they kept changing the story.”

As reported in The VOICE, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister, tweeted on February 12 that she had resigned from Cabinet. The MP for Vancouver-Granville, who was Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence, tweeted a link to her resignation letter.

She was under tremendous pressure to give her version regarding a Globe and Mail report that she had been pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to help Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution.

On March 4, Jane Philpott, President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government, resigned from the Trudeau cabinet, stating that she had “been considering the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks,” referring to the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Philpott tweeted: “It grieves me to resign from a portfolio where I was at work to deliver an important mandate. I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.”

DHALIWAL told me that he thinks that if Trudeau makes the changes he is suggesting, “he may be able to survive; otherwise, we’re looking at a minority government and maybe even a change.”

Dhaliwal stressed: “He has to re-establish his leadership and start governing by Cabinet, managing the Caucus better. I mean it’s unheard of that a minister resigns and they don’t even know. That’s a real lack of not understanding your Cabinet colleagues.”

He said: “They were totally surprised by [Philpott’s resignation] and you would think that if she was [resigning], the Prime Minister should have talked to her personally right away and brought her into his office and said ‘well, we need you. You can’t resign … Government needs you.’ … They should have started building a better relationship. I mean that’s part of the people around the Prime Minister – they shouldn’t get to the point where ministers are resigning and they don’t even know [what] they are upset about with the Prime Minister and the government.”

Dhaliwal then pointed to his own example when he was serving in Chretien’s Cabinet.

He related: “I wasn’t going to run the third time in politics. I had mentioned to one of my staff that I wasn’t going to run. You know the Prime Minister knew about it very quickly – within a few days he called me [and said] ‘I want to see you at 24 Sussex [the residence of the Prime Minister].’ When I was there, he said ‘look, I understand you are not interested in running next time.’ I said ‘yeah, I wanna get back to my business.’ He said ‘no, you have to run. I need you. It’s very important for you to run because if you don’t run, I could lose other seats and we need you to form government and you have to run.’ So I said ‘okay. There are a couple of conditions. One is after two years if I want to leave, you will allow me to leave politics.’ He said ‘fine.’ And I said ‘I’d like to have an economic portfolio.’ He said ‘fine, Done!’ And once he shook hands, that was it.”

Dhaliwal said the PMO people should have known that Philpott was so upset that she was going to resign and they should have been trying to resolve the issue.

He added: “So I think if he makes some of those changes he could recover from this. He has to start taking advice from experienced people who’ve been there, done that. And in the past, unfortunately, he hasn’t.”","Trudeau and his circle didn’t know how to manage the Liberal Caucus, says former federal minister Herb Dhaliwal",Voice Online,https://www.voiceonline.com/trudeau-and-his-circle-didnt-know-how-to-manage-the-liberal-caucus-says-former-federal-minister-herb-dhaliwal/

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

The release of the former attorney general ...","The recording former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould taped of her Dec. 19 phone call with outgoing Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, released publicly this afternoon, largely corroborates her account of that exchange.

“The PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can, within a legitimate toolbox, to try to head that off. He’s quite determined, quite firm, but he wants to know why the DPA [deferred prosecution agreement] route, which Parliament provided for, isn’t being used. And I think he’s going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that,” Mr. Wernick is heard telling Ms. Wilson-Raybould during the first few minutes of their phone call.

The purpose of the call, as Mr. Wernick characterized it, was “to pass on” information on the prime minister’s concerns that SNC-Lavalin could move its headquarters or be sold. “It seems to be real, and not a bluff. There’s another rising anxiety, as you can imagine, about a signature firm and job loss and all that coming after the Oshawa thing,” Mr. Wernick says, referring to recent layoffs at General Motors in Oshawa.

It was included along with a handful of documents the House Justice Committee released today, days ahead of the House’s return from its weeklong hiatus. The Prime Minister’s Office announced Friday that Mr. Wernick’s successor, Ian Shugart, will assume the post on April 19.

In the 17-minute phone call with Mr. Wernick, Ms. Wilson-Raybould is heard raising concerns about intervening in the SNC-Lavalin case, saying that their conversation is inappropriate and amounts to political interference, as well as other conversations she’s had calling on her to consider a DPA.

Mr. Wernick had raised the possibility of asking someone like former chief justice Beverley McLachlin to weigh in on the case, if she felt “uncomfortable” about intervening.

“What I am trying to do is to protect him [the prime minister],” she said in response. “I am just issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue that decisions that are made by the independent prosecutor are their decisions.”

Her 43-page submission to the committee includes text messages between her and her then-chief of staff, Jessica Prince. In one text exchange, on Dec. 18, Ms. Prince tells Ms. Wilson-Raybould that then-principal secretary Gerald Butts allegedly said, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” Mr. Butts, who resigned over the issue, claiming responsibility for a “breakdown in trust” between himself and the former AG, has repeatedly denied there was inappropriate interference.

During her four-hour testimony before the Justice Committee on Feb. 27, Ms. Wilson-Raybould (Vancouver Granville, B.C.) said she spoke with Mr. Wernick on Dec. 19, during which he allegedly said that the prime minister is “determined” to find a way to get a deferred prosecution agreement for the embattled company and that he and his AG can’t be at “loggerheads” over this issue. Ms. Wilson-Raybould has expressed concern that she was shuffled out of her role as AG and moved to Veterans Affairs for her refusal to grant the company a DPA.

In responding to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s account of that call, during his second appearance, Mr. Wernick said he had no “independent recollection” that there was inappropriate interference, saying he did not “wear a wire” during his conversations with the ex-minister.

The publication of the documents and recording will likely re-energize opposition parties’ push for the government to allow the ex-minister to fully air her side of the story and potentially add to calls from some Liberal MPs for her to be expelled from caucus.

The affair has roiled the Trudeau government for more than a month, and has overshadowed the release of its pre-election budget. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced a “consistent and sustained” effort involving political staffers and bureaucrats, including Mr. Butts, and Ben Chin, chief of staff to the finance minister, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec engineering giant facing fraud and corruption charges, to protect 9,000 jobs.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) has repeatedly denied there was ever any inappropriate pressure, saying that he takes responsibility for the erosion of trust between his Mr. Butts and his former AG.

The release of the former attorney general’s submission to the Justice Committee comes after days of leaks on the judicial appointment process for the Supreme Court, something that’s supposed to be confidential, which Ms. Wilson-Raybould has said need to be investigated and the PMO has denied came from it.

Mr. Trudeau and his ministers have been touring the country for the past few days to sell the budget to key voting blocs, including young Canadians and seniors. Throughout his engagements, Mr. Trudeau has faced questions over whether his office orchestrated the leaks that alleged he questioned Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s judgment over her recommendation for a Supreme Court chief justice. Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s political motivations have also been an object of speculation of late, with some pundits raising questions about her end-game and concerns about the ethics of releasing an audio recording.

Questions have also been mounting over whether Ms. Wilson-Raybould and ex-Treasury Board president Jane Philpott (Markham-Stouffville, Ont.), who resigned over the government’s handling of the affair, will remain in caucus.

Despite her resignation from cabinet, Ms. Wilson-Raybould has repeatedly indicated that she intends to run under the Liberal banner in October’s election. Ms. Philpott, for her part, has said she supports the party’s policies and intends to remain a Liberal. Speaking to reporters in Maple Ridge, B.C., on Monday, Mr. Trudeau appeared to signal that the two would remain in the party, saying, “I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward.”

Even before the release of the documents and audio recording, several MPs were clamouring for both ex-ministers to be booted from caucus, according to a CBC report. The publication of the documents and audio file could add to those calls.

Liberals on the Justice Committee twice blocked opposition parties’ push to recall Ms. Wilson-Raybould to respond to the testimonies given by Mr. Wernick and Mr. Butts, which conflicted with her own. In an interview with CBC, Liberal MP Francis Drouin (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Ont.), who was subbing in for his colleagues on the committee, said he had “heard enough,” noting that the option is open for Ms. Wilson-Raybould to submit more information, expanding on her testimony.

Opposition parties earlier this week attempted to use the Ethics Committee as a forum to continue the Justice Committee’s probe, but the motion was voted down. The Justice Committee, meanwhile, is meeting in private next week to discuss committee business and its new focus on a study on online hate.

An audio recording and transcript of the Dec. 19 call with Michael Wernick, the country's top public servant, was released as part of additional written testimony Wilson-Raybould submitted to the House of Commons Justice committee, which last week shut down its examination of her allegation that she was relentlessly, improperly pressured to intervene in the case.

article continues below

The 17-minute recording backs up Wilson-Raybould's version of the words spoken during the conversation, about which she told the committee on Feb. 26 during nearly four hours of oral testimony. But it doesn't resolve the question of whether the Privy Council clerk's words constituted ""veiled threats,"" as she has alleged. Wernick's tone throughout is calm and respectful, while Wilson-Raybould becomes increasingly agitated as she tries to impress on him her belief that intervening in the case would be perceived as political interference in the justice system.

In her written submission, the former minister acknowledges the ""extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step"" of recording the conversation. But she says she was at home alone in Vancouver at the time and was ""anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.""

""This is something I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.""

Wernick declined to comment directly but his lawyer, Frank Addario, said recording the call was ""inappropriate.""

""A lot of the tape is her making a speech for a different audience, since she could have just told him she did not want to discuss it further. I don't know any lawyer who records conversations with work colleagues or clients. I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,"" Addario said in an email.

""She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar.""

The code of conduct for the Law Society of Ontario, of which Wilson-Raybould is an honorary member, prohibits a lawyer from recording a client without the client's permission. As justice minister and attorney general at the time, Wilson-Raybould was the government's chief lawyer. A spokesman for the law society said Friday that it ""does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

The Canadian Bar Association code of conduct prohibits a lawyer from recording anyone without permission.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January shuffle as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

In the recording, Wilson-Raybould repeatedly tells Wernick that the director of public prosecutions had decided to pursue a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its work in Libya and that she would not use her power to step in to override that decision and insist upon a remediation agreement. Essentially akin to a plea bargain, such an agreement would mean the company would have faced stiff financial penalties while averting a possible criminal convictionbility.

During the call, she acknowledges she has the legal right to intervene but argues it would be unprecedented and viewed as political interference.

""This goes far beyond saving jobs. This is about the integrity of the prime minister and interference. There is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference, if I was to step in,"" she says.

""I would be a mockery. And that is not the problem. The bigger problem is what it would look like down the road for the government.""

At another point, Wilson-Raybould says she's trying to ""protect the prime minister from political interference"" and if he doesn't accept her advice ""then it is his prerogative to do what he wants."" She tells Wernick several times she feels ""uncomfortable"" just having the conversation with him.

Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau ""wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate toolbox"" to head off the possibility of SNC-Lavalin leaving the country and putting thousands of Canadians out of work. He says Trudeau is ""quite determined, quite firm"" about this and adds: ""I think he's going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kind of mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.

""It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads,"" he says later. ""I am worried about a collision, then, because he is pretty firm about this.""

He tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau is ""not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He is asking you to use all the tools you lawfully have at your disposal.""

Towards the end of the call, Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick she's ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here"" — a reference to former U.S. President Richard Nixon's attorney general resigning rather than follow the president's order to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. She also says she's waiting for ""the other shoe to drop.""

""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants.""

Wernick's lawyer said nothing said by the clerk constitutes a veiled threat.

""He was asking for information that only she could give. The clerk said this (remediation agreement) is a legitimate tool and why are we not exploring it here and he asked repeatedly for an explanation to pass on to the prime minister and she refused to give it. She didn't shut the call down,"" said Addario.

Addario said Wernick did not know the call had been recorded until it was released Friday, although he appeared to anticipate it during his second appearance at the justice committee on March 6. In response to questions about his recollections about the conversation, Wernick snapped: ""I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes.""

In a statement late Friday, the Prime Minister's Office said Wernick did not brief Trudeau about his Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould and he was unaware of its full contents until the recording was released.

Addario said the day after the conversation, ""everyone went on holidays."" By the time they returned at beginning of January, ""the first burning issue"" was Scott Brison's retirement and the consequent cabinet shuffle.

""The SNC issue never made it back to the top of the discussion list. The clerk never discussed SNC again with the PM or PMO until someone leaked the story to The Globe and Mail in early February.""

The PMO statement reiterated Trudeau's previous admission that ""he should have spoken directly"" with Wilson-Raybould about the matter and that ""he wishes she had come to him"" with her concerns about improper pressure. He again attributed the controversy to an ""erosion of trust"" between her office and his, and tried to close the door on the fiasco, which has engulfed his government for two months, cost him two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and Wernick, who officially retires on April 19 after concluding he's lost the confidence of opposition parties following his combative testimony at committee.

""All the facts are on the table now and everyone involved has shared their perspective,"" the statement said, adding it's time to ""move forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians.""

However, Liberal backbenchers appear to be in a less forgiving mood.

Montreal MP Alexandra Mendes called Wilson-Raybould's secret recording ""horrendous"" and called for her and Jane Philpott — who resigned from cabinet earlier this month saying she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC affair — to be booted out of caucus.

""If they had any sense of decency, they would resign before it would even get there,"" Mendes said in an interview, questioning why anyone would want to stay ""where they're clearly not wanted.""

Liberal MPs have been growing increasingly upset with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott's seeming desire to keep fanning the flames of the controversy and have been quietly discussing among themselves this week — a break week for Parliament — how to deal with the pair. The expectation now is that caucus members will insist on expelling them at their next meeting on Wednesday, or earlier if an emergency meeting is called. Precisely how to go about that is being debated since votes are not normally taken in caucus.

The documents released Friday also include transcripts of text messages and notes on phone calls Wilson-Raybould or her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, had with various senior government staffers.

One of them is a phone call between Prince and Justin To, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's deputy chief of staff, in which he says that there is a sense that Wilson-Raybould ""has a philosophical problem"" with the concept of remediation agreements, a new tool for dealing with cases of corporate corruption that went into effect last September.

""That she hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To allegedly told Prince, who told him that wasn't true.

In her submission, Wilson-Raybould also complains that the controversy over her allegations has included ""undeniable elements of misogyny, much of it aimed at myself.""

And while she says, ""I do not believe I have anything further to offer a formal process regarding this specific matter,"" she say she would comply ""if compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's latest revelations are ""so compelling and well documented"" that they prove the need for an independent public inquiry into the whole affair.

READ MORE: N.B. legislature continues to grapple with impending carbon tax

The party says Scheer will be in the southwestern community of St. George Monday afternoon, where he will take questions and discuss the impact the carbon tax will have on the province.

The $20-per-tonne carbon tax is slated to go into effect in New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario on April 1, resulting in a significant increase in the price of gasoline.

The carbon price will go up until $50 in 2022.

WATCH: Carbon tax ‘not an environmental plan,’ Scheer says

Trudeau calls the tax a “price on pollution” and says it will be an incentive for companies to lower emissions, but Scheer has said it’s a “bogus” way to do so.

New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said in the legislature last week that he intends to continue to fight the carbon tax. Trudeau, who was in southwestern New Brunswick last week, said he “regrets” that the New Brunswick government “doesn’t think that putting a price on pollution is important.”

“It’s the 21st century. We know climate change is real. We know that one of the challenges we have is that pollution has been free. We need to put a price on it,” Trudeau said last week.

Make that swamps. Yes, the ...","With Justin Trudeau and the Liberals’ botched SNC-Lavalin response now rolling into Week 8, there exists a golden opportunity for Andrew Scheer to drain the swamp.

Make that swamps.

Yes, the Conservative leader needs to rid the capital of the considerable Liberal murk surrounding SNC, but he also needs to use Trudeau’s troubles as a pretext to rid his movement of its more dubious elements so that disillusioned Liberal voters have more than one new home to pick from should they abandon ship.

And while its axiomatic that you never interrupt an opponent while he’s beating himself up, it’s also true that you should never let a good crisis go to waste. Scheer needs to use Trudeau’s crisis as an opportunity to let Canadians know where he stands on values.

This is not to accept that Scheer currently has a values problem; it’s only an acceptance of the fact Liberals — having no good answer on SNC — will use the perception of a CPC values problem — and any spiky tone — to their advantage every chance they get, as evidenced by the recent kerfuffle over the “United We Roll” protests on Parliament Hill. With each bad news cycle, the Liberals will shift further from “sunny” to “smeary” ways.

To be clear, this was always going to be the Liberal re-election strategy. Sunny ways was just the smokescreen for what promised to be a very negative campaign.

The Liberals are certainly busy smashing the Project Fear button now in the hopes of stalling more defections over SNC, with MPs and online surrogates arguing against a further airing of the SNC drama lest it — and let me see if I can follow their logic here — help ease the path of the Nazis to power in Canada. Yes, some people are that irrational about the baby-faced dad-bodded former Speaker of the House now living in Stornoway.

And if you think the Nazi bit is a stretch, you haven’t been touring the green shamrocked quarters of Twitter, which now piles into every critical mention of Trudeau with a fury like what they must imagine the alt-right are capable of mustering. Forget potential interference in the justice system, this shamrock brigade thinks Trudeau could shoot someone on Sparks Street and still deserve to be prime minister. Because Scheer is a monster. Or something.

Even the wise owls are now beclowning themselves. Former justice minister Anne McLellan has now been drafted in to run interference for Trudeau’s office. Meanwhile, Liberal MP Judy Sgro, herself no stranger to (multiple) scandals, has told Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to “put up or shut up”. And let’s not forget Sheila Copps, whose tweets on SNC are only a few irregular capitalizations away from MAGA-ville.

Of course, these hysterics hardly ever convince anyone. But that doesn’t mean their tactic is wrong. A more credible voice could land the blow and the Liberals will be asking their surrogates to land it. That’s why Scheer needs to nip it in the bud, no matter how bad SNC gets. Just as Republicans held their nose over Trump because they hated Clinton more, Trudeau is counting on a similar dynamic to see him through on SNC-Lavalin.

An animal backed into a corner also comes out fighting.

Trudeau will absolutely play politics on hot button files such as white nationalism, using tragic events such as the Christchurch mosque shooting as a hook. He will paint opposition to his carbon tax plan as proof of utter indifference to the world and future generations. He will rail against alt-right attitudes toward immigration. What SNC now gives Scheer is a chance to paint it all as Liberal desperation.

To do that, however, Scheer first needs to set out his stall on all of these questions. He’s said things in bits and bobs before and in response to various events over the past year but he now needs to bash it out in one go in a highly visible setting.

On the culture war, Scheer must condemn the Trumpy-types who see a “globalist” or “mooslim” plot everywhere they look. Being uncomfortable with the unfamiliar shouldn’t be disqualifying but Scheer should lead the conversation in steering conservatives toward safer harbours when it comes to Islam. A good start would be to embrace the Muslim community in unequivocal terms when it is targeted.

And on the environment, Scheer should finally announce his long-delayed plan, and buttress it with a clear statement of his belief in the science about climate change.

On both fronts, Scheer needs to leave centrist voters feeling their vote is safe with him. He needs to build immunity against the attacks he knows are coming.

And if that sends a few votes Maxime Bernier’s way, then so be it. It’s a price worth paying for the centre ground.

In his remarks to the Manning Centre networking conference on Saturday, Scheer said he ""unequivocally"" condemns hateful ideologies.

""The criticisms are completely baseless.""

Those criticisms have been plentiful in the past few weeks.

Says he misheard conspiracy question

Scheer has come under fire for speaking at the recent United We Roll rally on Parliament Hill, which had picked up participants who were making racist and anti-immigrant comments. The Prime Minister's Office also condemned Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" with Faith Goldy, a commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

Scheer was also chastised for not shutting down a question at a recent town hall about a widely debunked conspiracy theory connecting former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring.

In that particular instance, Scheer insisted he hadn't heard the question properly.

Whether racism or disinformation, Scheer says he and the Conservatives oppose such rhetoric.

""People know that the Conservative Party is open and welcoming,"" he said.

""We denounce any elements of society that would promote hate speech.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

'Cheap political points'

His comments at the Manning Conference were the first time he's fully addressed the accusations against him, though he's taken questions on the matters at news events in the past few weeks.

Scheer was also heavily criticized for tweeting out his condolences to the victims of the New Zealand mosque attacks without mentioning the words 'Muslim' or 'mosque'.

In another statement later that day, Scheer did use both.

On Saturday, he accused the Liberals of targeting his post to ""score cheap political points in a disgusting manner,"" adding that Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Gov. Gen. Julie Payette released statements omitting both terms as well.

The Tory leader said it's important to speak out against those who put one group of people over another.

SNC-Lavalin still top of mind for the Tories

Scheer turned to the SNC-Lavalin affair as well, calling on Canadians to put pressure on Trudeau to allow all sides of the story to be heard.

The Liberal majority on the justice committee shut down an investigation into the matter, and now the ethics committee will begin its own.

Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott are free to speak, the prime minister has said, but so far neither of them have taken that full opportunity.

Scheer said the crux of his issue with the conduct of top government officials is that politicians should not involve themselves in deciding what legal tools are available in prosecutions.

In what was clearly a speech with an eye toward the upcoming election, Scheer told the audience that being an Opposition leader isn't always easy, because you're not as high-profile as the prime minister.

However, now that the SNC-Lavalin affair is casting doubt onto Trudeau's character, it's easier for people to see ""the real Andrew Scheer,"" he said.

Scheer also shredded the new federal Liberal budget, calling it a multi-billion dollar attempt to distract from the ethical questions about the government.","'The criticisms are completely baseless,' Scheer says of claims he's too soft on hate groups",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-pizzagate-united-we-roll-new-zealand-extremism-1.5069197

Still, Canadians aren’t so much embracing the Conservatives but instead deserting the Liberal party in droves, according to a new Angus Reid Institute poll.

Andrew Scheer and his Conservatives are picking up some votes from disenchanted Justin Trudeau Liberal supporters, according to a new poll. ( Sean Kilpatrick )

That’s a benefit to other parties — including the New Democrats, Green Party and the newly-minted People’s Party of Canada — who are seeing their fortunes rise as the governing party falls out of public favour. “The Liberals are just seeing quicksand. The floor is no longer stable,” said Shachi Kurl, Angus Reid executive director. “Trudeaumania was very, very real but Canadian voters are no longer feeling very manic.” In 2015, “Trudeaumania” convinced first-time voters, youth and non-regular voters to come out and cast a ballot. But it’s unclear whether the party will be able to retain that youth base this time around.

Kurl pointed to Pierre Trudeau’s rise to power in the late 1960s noting he enjoyed “Trudeaumania” before ending his last term as prime minister in 1984 as a polarizing politician. And if an election were held tomorrow, it is unlikely the Liberals would hold onto a majority: Fewer than 60 per cent of 2015 Liberals would vote for the party again. In contrast, the Conservatives are holding 90 per cent of their 2015 base. Levels of Conservative support remain essentially unchanged from last month — where they captured 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote. Noting the Liberal Party’s relatively low retention of 2015 supporters, Kurl said it’s interesting to see where those voters are going. As the party bleeds votes, one in eight 2015 Liberals say they would support the Conservatives; one in 10 say the same of the NDP. Kurl added a handful have drifted to the Greens, while a significant portion remain undecided. Demographics are a huge driver of partisanship: Men and older Canadians slant Conservative, while women and younger voters stick with the Liberals or other left-of-centre parties.

Meanwhile, nearly half of all Canadians said they “strongly disapprove” of Trudeau in comparison to less than 10 per cent who “strongly approve.” “We’ve seen those stratospheric approval numbers that were in the 60s come down to the 30s over the last three years,” Kurl said. “Trudeau’s personal star is dimming. Not just the campaign, the party, the government, an entire international brand is built around a single person.”

Article Continued Below

That’s where the Liberals are running into “massive” trouble across the country, she added. Now, Canadians have a more favourable view of Scheer (44 per cent) and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh (39 per cent) than Trudeau (36 per cent). And while the Liberals lead by a wide margin in the city of Toronto, they are neck-and-neck with the NDP in the city of Vancouver, and trailing in the rest of B.C. and Ontario. In B.C. — where the NDP and Greens support is strongest — Scheer’s Conservatives hold a wide lead over the Liberals. The survey noted this likely helped to split left-of-centre respondents. Meanwhile, the Conservative party is leading by wide margins in Prairie provinces and by smaller four-point margins in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Quebec, the one outlier, is seeing a four-way split in support between the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and Greens. Still, a lot can change during election campaigns. For instance, in 2015, each of the three main parties held the lead in Angus Reid Institute polling between the time the writ dropped and election day. Kurl said there is enough time and space for the Liberals to bounce back and coalesce the left-of-centre vote. And it doesn’t mean that Trudeau should step down, she argued. Instead, it would require a pivot to focus less on the man and instead, more on the party, its policies and mission. “We’ve seen leaders do this in the past,” Kurl said, pointing to Jean Chretien’s 1993 campaign which was fraught with leadership critiques. “So what did the Liberal party do? They effectively built a team. It wasn’t Team Chrétien, it was Team Liberal.” Kurl said Trudeau can do the same thing. But, there isn’t evidence of that — yet. “The vote bleed, where it is going, and just how devastating it is for the Liberals today as people abandon the party based on a visceral reaction to Justin Trudeau says to me that the Liberals maybe need to take the weekend and go have a very deep think about what’s next,” Kurl said. Poll results were based on an online survey conducted from March 11-25 among a randomized sample of 5,807 Canadian adults who are members of the Angus Reid Forum. It carried a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

“I pointed out that globally, Canada is up against big countries (China, for one) that can address some major issues quickly,” he wrote on Twitter at the time. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to suggest that I of all people would trade our rights and freedoms for any other system of [government].”

Scheer went on to comment on the recent decision by the Chinese government to stop accepting shipments of Canadian canola oil. Earlier this month, China started blocking canola imports from Canada, citing the detection of “hazardous organisms.” International Trade Minister Jim Carr, however, denied this claim, as Global News previously reported.

The canola dispute comes shortly after comes Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver on behalf of the U.S.

Tensions between Canada and China have increased since she was arrested, as two Canadians in China were arrested and remain detained on espionage charges. The international community has called for their release.

Scheer blames the emerging trade obstacles on Trudeau’s handling of Chinese relations.

“Farmers in this situation are paying for the mistakes that Justin Trudeau has made,” he said.

Trudeau pledged near the end of 2018 that Canada was looking to broaden trade opportunities with China, potentially leading to an eventual free trade agreement between the two countries.

Scheer, however, suggested during his conversation with Stephenson that a free trade deal may be premature, given the robustness of China’s economy when compared to Canada’s.

The opposition leader also touched on several top-of-mind topics for Canadians.

Scheer also suggested that the SNC-Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the Liberals is only contributing to tensions with China.

“We have a very tense situation with the CFO of Huawei being with the extradition process, and our responsibility as a government, as a Canadian government, has been [that] we don’t interfere in the rule of law, we don’t interfere in criminal court cases, we respect the independence of our judiciary. That was the message to China,” he said.

“A couple weeks later, there’s Justin Trudeau interfering in a criminal court case, putting pressure on the attorney general to get a better outcome for his well-connected friends. That, I believe, is a big part of why this situation with China is further deteriorating,” he continued.

He encouraged Canadians to “put pressure” on Justin Trudeau to cooperate with the ethics’ committee investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which gets underway next week.

“What we know for sure is that there is more to be said,” Scheer told the crowd. “Right now, [Trudeau] is engaged in a cover-up the likes of which we’ve never seen. He’s used a CAD$40 billion budget to distract us from it, making it the most expensive cover up in the history of cover ups.”

Since the story broke in early February, Trudeau and several close advisers have been facing accusations of pressuring the then-attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to grant a remediation agreement to the embattled engineering firm SNC-Lavalin amid charges of fraud and corruption.

Trudeau countered Wilson-Raybould’s account of their conversations, saying that he and his advisers simply hoped to confer with her about her decision rather than apply pressure. Opposition members, including Scheer, have been consistent in calling for the prime minister to resign.

Both Scheer and Trudeau are ramping up their public appearances as they kick off an election year. Recent polls suggest that amid the SNC-Lavalin affair, Scheer’s Conservatives are beginning to gain headway on the Liberal leader’s largely bruised popularity.

It’s in the pizzagate.”

Scheer gamely answered the question as though he hadn’t just been asked about one of the most notorious (and widely debunked) conspiracies in modern political history. He later claimed to have not heard the question. To be fair to him, the audience began clapping loudly at the man’s suggestion that one of the biggest charities in America was secretly trafficking and sacrificing children. In any event, the question was indicative of the conundrum Scheer now faces, as he attempts to harness the raucous strain of anti-Trudeau animus sweeping across the country: embrace the motivated populist anger of these crowds, along with the unhinged bits seemingly inherent in them, or cede this support to his rightward rival, Maxime Bernier and the People’s Party of Canada. Scheer has chosen a third option, which is to welcome the crowds while denying the ugly bits even exist — even as they pop up in front of Scheer’s very eyes. Consider his February appearance at a rally organized by United We Roll, which has a well-established connection to the country’s yellow vest movement, the proudly anti-immigrant group that sprung up in the wake of a similar movement in France.

Article Continued Below

Scheer’s speech, which focused on Trudeau’s alleged hatred of the oil and gas industry, was a play for truckers and their supporters, United We Roll’s ostensible supporters. Yet an apparent conspiracy-obsessed heckler peppered his three-minute spiel with familiar “He’s attacking your children” rhetoric, while another wondered out loud, in both official languages, what Scheer was going to do about the United Nations. A sign outside Ottawa’s West Block also critiqued the U.N. and said Trudeau should be charged with treason. The relationship between Scheer and these populist crowds is mutually beneficial. He gets a friendly audience, while this audience has the implied stamp of approval from the man who may well be the next prime minister. The conspiratorial types who keep showing are just an unfortunate by-product, it seems. When I asked a Conservative adviser about them, he shrugged his shoulders. “We can’t control who shows up to these events,” he told me, seemingly by rote. Yet it is difficult to understate the danger of Scheer’s gambit. By appearing at events like United We Roll, Scheer gives legitimacy to voices that would otherwise (and deservedly) exist only on the fringes of Canada’s political discourse — and which have become notably loud and brazen over the last several years. It used to be that Trudeau’s critics pilloried the prime minister for his conspicuous liberalism. Now some are calling for his head. “You are working for your globalist partners. I wonder how much they are paying you to betray Canada,” a woman said to Trudeau during Regina town hall last January. “What do we do with traitors in Canada, Mr. Trudeau? We used to hang them, hang them for treason.” Scheer is in a difficult spot. Populist fury against the current government is widespread and politically active. Yet emboldened in part by the example of scorched-earth nationalism espoused by the current American president, it has also become decidedly more visceral and conspiracy-oriented as we march closer to the October election.

By all means, Scheer should criticize Trudeau for being an out-of-touch, tax-and-spend elite. But he should just as conspicuously call out those would-be supporters who believe the 23rd prime minister is but a product of their conspiracy-addled nightmares.

Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer told a crowd at the Manning Centre Conference on Saturday that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget, but wouldn’t say by when.

“Yes, we will balance the budget,” Scheer said to applause at the conservative networking event, during a Q&A with Global News’ Mercedes Stephenson.

Scheer said balancing the budget would be done through “a combination of big ticket items with controlling the rate of growth.”

“There’s been such rapid increases in the rate of growth of government spending that we can get a lot of the way there just by restricting the growth of government spending back to closer to inflation and population growth,” Scheer said.

Scheer said a Conservative government would cut funding of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which was established under the current Liberal government, as well as to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Scheer offered little specifics about when a Conservative government would deliver a balanced budget however, only saying it would be “over a shorter period of time,” if elected in the October general election.

The Trudeau government presented their final budget of this mandate, which projects a $19.7 billion deficit for 2019-20. In 2015, the Liberals ran on a campaign promise of returning to a balanced budget by the upcoming year. They have yet to post a surplus or an annual deficit less than $14 billion since assuming office that year. In this year’s budget, the Liberals are projecting the deficit to fall slightly next year, before declining to $9.8 billion in 2023-24.

At one point during the event in Kitchener, Ont. last night, a member of the audience rose to ask Scheer a two-minute question touching on several subjects, including immigration funding and international aid. He then linked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the mythical conspiracy known as ""pizzagate,"" which gained traction around the 2016 United States presidential election.

""Trudeau gave $600 million to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation is part of child trafficking and child sacrifice, if you study it. It's in the pizzagate,"" he said.

""The PM, if he knows about the foundation, should he be in jail for that one? Also, he needs to pay back the $600 million plus his trips to the Canadians.""

Watch the townhall exchange

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was asked about the government's contribution to the Clinton Foundation during a townhall. He later said he didn't hear a reference to ""pizzagate."" 5:12

The conspiracy theory accuses Clinton and her team of running a child sex ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza shop in Washington, D.C.

Pizzagate is often cited in discussions about the real-life dangers of false news online. In 2016, a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside the restaurant as he attempted to ""self-investigate"" the unfounded internet rumours about Democrats hiding child sex slaves there.

While no one was injured in that incident, a U.S. judge told gunman Edgar Welch that his actions ""literally left psychological wreckage."" Welch was sentenced to four years in prison.

Pizzagate — which the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has called ""a fictitious online conspiracy theory"" — is largely believed to have gained momentum after WikiLeaks released emails from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, mentioning pizza parties and a fundraiser at the Comet restaurant. Some online communities theorized it was code for something more heinous.

In his response to the town hall questioner, Scheer did not say the pizzagate theory was false — although he did pick up on the Clinton Foundation angle to talk about Trudeau spending taxpayers' money on what he called ""personal projects.""

""Yes. Well, I appreciate your concerns on this,"" he replied.

""I can assure you that when you look at where Justin Trudeau has spent money, it's clear that a huge sum of the dollars that he is taken from Canadian taxpayers has gone to his own personal projects.

""You mentioned that the Clinton Foundation ... there are other examples where Justin Trudeau's government has given grants to hire people for groups that are, you know, advocating for their own particular ideology, specifically fighting against things like pipelines and building our infrastructure to be able to get our energy to international markets.""

When asked why he didn't confront the conspiracy theory at the time, Scheer said he didn't hear that part of the question.

""I heard the question was related to the government's, Justin Trudeau's decision to give a grant to the Clinton Foundation. That was what I answered. I didn't hear anything about the other aspect that you just mentioned,"" he told reporters during a stop in Rosser, Man. today.

""I didn't hear that. I heard the Clinton Foundation part of the question, I heard other parts of the question, but I certainly didn't hear that.""​

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

The Liberal government has pledged $20 million over five years to the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which is affiliated with the foundation.

According to the Global Affairs website, the money is helping the initiative improve access to sexual and reproductive health services for women and girls in Nigeria.

A quick tally of the numbers posted to the government's website shows the previous Conservative government, of which Scheer was a part, actually contributed more to the initiative.

Going back to 2013, the Harper government spent nearly $19 million to help the initiative deliver vaccinations, $14 million on diarrhea treatment and about $460,000 to a fund tuberculosis research project on miners in African countries.

Scheer 'does not keep up with paranoid' theories

A spokesperson for Trudeau accused Scheer of promoting falsehoods, citing his attacks on the federal government's embrace of the UN Global Compact on Migration. Scheer has said he fears the document could exert an influence over Canada's immigration system — even though it is not a treaty and is not binding on the nations that support it.

Spokesperson Eleanore Catenaro also criticized Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" at the recent United We Roll protest with Faith Goldy, a former Rebel Media commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

(Jessica Gresko/Associated Press)

""It's no surprise Andrew Scheer refused to condemn this, given his clear history of promoting conspiracy theories and spreading misleading information, including his comments on the UN migration compact,"" said Catenaro. ""He has also refused to condemn the hateful language at recent events on Parliament Hill at which he shared the stage with far-right groups.""

Scheer's press secretary told CBC News today the Conservative leader ""does not keep up with paranoid, American alt-right conspiracy theories and as such was not familiar with the term until it came up in the questioning today.""

""Since learning about the pizzagate conspiracy, Mr. Scheer obviously believes it is ridiculous and dangerous, and that such conspiracies have no place in our political debate,"" said Daniel Schow in an email.

Trudeau also has been confronted with false allegations during his town hall tours.

The leaders of Canada’s largest labour organization and a prominent national Muslim group say Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is emboldening far-right extremists by failing to call out Islamophobia following the New Zealand mosque shootings and attending events with people who promote hate speech.

Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) president Hassan Yussuff criticized Mr. Scheer’s response to the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last week that left 50 people dead and dozens more injured. Mr. Scheer issued a lengthy statement about the terrorism attacks Friday after his initial Twitter message on the shootings were criticized for failing to mention that the victims were Muslims.

“Unfortunately the opposition leader had to be shamed to do a 180-degree turn to actually acknowledge what happened. Had he not been shamed, I’m not sure he would have changed his position,” Mr. Yussuf said Thursday.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), said Mr. Scheer’s initial decision to avoid saying that the victims were Muslims and the attacks took place at mosques “felt very deliberate.”

“There is a real danger that this kind of association helps to embolden others to feel like they now have licence to act out on their hatred and on their ideologies,” Mr. Gardee said.

Mr. Yussuf also condemned Mr. Scheer for sharing a stage with “racists and bigots” at a protest led by a convoy of pro-pipeline, anti-carbon-tax demonstrators in February. Former Rebel Media personality Faith Goldy also attended the rally on Parliament Hill, where she told Indigenous counterprotesters to leave Canada if they didn’t like it.

Mr. Yussuf said Mr. Scheer should know better than to attend events with right-wing figures such as Ms. Goldy.

A spokesman for Mr. Scheer said the Tory leader was “very clear and emphatic” in his condemnation of the anti-Muslim hatred that motivated the New Zealand mosque attacks.

“Further, in his speech to the House of Commons earlier this week, he called for action to defend a concept of Canada rooted in shared civic values, respect for the principle of universal human dignity and freedom of religion for all,” said Brock Harrison, Mr. Scheer’s spokesman.

The CLC and the NCCM shared their concerns at a media conference about the rise of Islamophobia in Canadian workplaces, where they released a new report on the matter.

The report cites a steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslim communities in Canada over the past several years, fuelled by far-right politics at home and abroad. It makes several recommendations aimed at reinforcing the responsibility of employers to educate management and staff about legal obligations around human rights and religious accommodations for Muslims. It also calls on governments to do more to support anti-racism awareness campaigns and develop strategies to combat online hate speech.

“What we’re talking about here is the everyday micro-aggressions that inform this fearful environment that many Canadian Muslims exist in and infiltrates every aspect of their daily life,” said Leila Nasr, NCCM communications co-ordinator.

""I reject anyone who would, you know, who would speak out based on Islamaphobic principles whether or not, you know, that's somebody who is trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith in together, or whether it is people who are trying to antagonise elements of the society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith,"" Scheer told the crowd of Conservatives, peppering his comments with uncharacteristic ""ums"" and ""ahs.""

""To me the important thing is to speak out against those who would in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other,"" he said.

Scheer was criticized this week for failing to do just that.



The president of the Canadian Labour Congress, Hassan Yussuff, told reporters Thursday that Scheer should be held responsible for failing to condemn yellow-vest protesters who showed up in Ottawa in February to demonstrate against pipeline delays while spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric.

""For the leader of the Opposition not able to condemn them ... and stand on a stage with someone who is associated with hate and racism and somehow to not acknowledge that? ... That is a fundamental, I think, failing on his part, and I condemn his behaviour,"" Yussuff said at an event outlining efforts by the union movement to combat Islamophobia and the steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslims.

""I don't think he should be excused for it, because he should know better, and if he doesn't, something is fundamentally wrong with his leadership, in my view,"" Hassan said.

Scheer spoke to the crowd of protesters, many of whom had lost their jobs in the energy sector and driven from Alberta and Scheer's home province of Saskatchewan to make their point to the government. The protesters also heard from Faith Goldy, the social media personality with white nationalist ties.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said he was concerned that not calling out behaviour against Muslims would give licence to others to act on their hatred and their ideologies.

""We are looking to our leaders for leadership, and being naively ignorant or wilfully blind, neither is acceptable and Canadians should demand better,"" he said.

Earlier during Scheer's chat with Global television's Mercedes Stephenson, the Tory leader was asked how he deals with accusations that he is ""not being tough enough"" with groups advocating violence.

""I deal with [it] by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,"" Scheer responded.

Last week, the Conservative leader was criticized for issuing a statement in response to the massacre in New Zealand without mentioning that the attacks had taken place in mosques, against Muslims gathered for Friday prayers.

He said his statement condemned hateful ideology by anyone who promotes any type of superiority of one race or religion over others. ""I condemn that unequivocally.""

The Liberals, Scheer said, had tried to ""score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner"" by politicizing his original statement and the attacks. The Liberals, he noted, did not levy the same criticism against Governor General Julie Payette's comments, which also did not mention the victims were Muslims.

The Tories, he said, are an open, inclusive and welcoming party for people of all faiths and backgrounds.

In a speech in the House of Commons on Monday, the prime minister said events such as the carnage in Christchurch were precisely the right time to talk about politics.

""The best way to support people is to acknowledge that there is a problem and take concrete steps to fix it,"" he said. ""As a global community, we have a choice to make. Will we denounce our leaders who turn a blind eye to those who incite violence?

""Undoubtedly, I feel more secure, among all the countries, in Canada right now,"" she said as Trudeau smiled, his head bowed. She received a standing ovation from the crowd.

The Liberals have sought to differentiate themselves from the Tories vis-à-vis their relationship with Muslim Canadians.

Scheer, in some ways, has helped them. He voted, for example, against a motion two years ago condemning Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination. The motion called for a study on Islamophobia, data collection on hate crimes and a government strategy to deal with religious discrimination.

Scheer argued that the motion, by singling out one faith, was not inclusive.

""Andrew Scheer here.""

If you live in the four provinces where the federal carbon tax is being introduced, you might get a text message from the Conservative Party leader telling you to fill your gas tank this weekend.

The mass-texting campaign against the carbon pricing policy that will take effect April 1 in New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan will direct voters to the Conservatives’ petition against the carbon tax. And the texts might pop up on your phone even if you’ve never given your phone number to the Conservative Party of Canada.

In addition to pulling phone numbers from its own databases, the party will use software that auto-generates numbers with specific area codes in order to blast out the text messages.

One of those texts might look like this:

""Andrew Scheer here.

Trudeau’s carbon tax will raise gas prices on Monday.

So fill your tank!""

The party is also running radio ads against the carbon tax in Saint John, Ottawa, Toronto and Winnipeg, among other markets.

“This effort will be about informing Canadians about the cost of this Liberal tax on everyday items, including the price of gas, and how for wealthy Liberals like Justin Trudeau, an extra $100 a month on bills might not be a big deal, but it matters a lot to a family trying to make their household budget last to the end of the month,” Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said in an email to CTV News.

Hann said there will also be co-ordinated social media campaigns and door-to-door canvassing efforts in the affected provinces over the weekend.

The Liberal government is requiring provinces to impose a price on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per tonne this year and rising by $10 per tonne annually until it hits $50 in 2022. Since Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick have refused to introduce their own carbon pricing plans, Ottawa is imposing its own tax on them.

The Liberals have said the carbon tax is necessary to combat the effects of climate change, and pointed out that rebates will be available to the residents of the four provinces through the tax system.

Joan Bryden, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Andrew Scheer says criticism over his initial failure to mention that Muslims were targeted in the recent mass murder in New Zealand is “completely baseless” and driven by “disgusting” Liberal efforts to score political points from the tragedy.

But in answering a question Saturday about how he deals with that criticism, the federal Conservative leader once again initially made no reference to Muslims.

“I deal with it by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,” Scheer told the Manning Networking Conference, an annual gathering of this country's conservative thinkers, strategists and politicians.

“When you look at statements I've made condemning hateful ideologies, those who would promote any type of superiority of one race or religion over the others, I condemn that unequivocally.”

Scheer noted that the second statement he issued on the day of the New Zealand shootings “absolutely did include the reference to the faith community that was attacked,” although he did not at first identify that faith community.

On March 15, an avowed white supremacist shot and killed 50 Muslim worshippers at two New Zealand mosques. In a statement posted that day on Twitter, Scheer condemned the attacks as “a despicable act of evil” against “peaceful worshippers,” without specifically mentioning where they occurred or who was targeted.

A few hours later - after the initial statement drew criticism - Scheer issued a second statement, which he referred to Saturday as his “official statement.” It specifically referred to the horrific “terror attack on two New Zealand mosques” and voiced his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community.”

On Saturday, Scheer blamed the Liberals for stirring up the controversy, accusing them of attempting “to score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner.” Moreover, he argued that initial tweets by Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Governor General Julie Payette also didn't specifically mention mosques or Muslims.

Later, as he took questions from members of the audience, Scheer was asked why he's never said the word “Islamophobia.”

“I don't believe that's true,” he responded, noting that all parties supported a motion last week in the House of Commons. That motion, which he didn't describe, condemned the mosque attacks and affirmed the need to “confront hatred, Islamophobia, and white supremacy, in all their forms.”

“I reject anyone who would speak out based on Islamophobic principles, whether or not that's somebody who is trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith in together or whether it's people who are trying to antagonize elements of society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith,” Scheer added.

“To me the important thing is to speak out against those who in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other.”

Scheer also used his appearance at the Manning conference to promise that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget - but he didn't say when.

He said the Liberals have made such increases to government spending that a Conservative government could get most of the way to balance simply by holding annual spending increases to the rate of inflation and population growth. As well, he said billions could be saved by scrapping “some big-ticket items” introduced by the Liberals such as the federal infrastructure bank.

The longer Prime Minister Justin Trudeau goes racking up large annual deficits, the harder it will be return to balance, Scheer suggested. But he said Canadians have “a window” in this fall's federal election to “limit the damage and get back to balanced budgets over a shorter period of time.”

At a press conference this morning, Scheer demanded that the standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics agree to hold a study of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The standing committee on justice and human rights ended a study of the matter last week, prompting accusations by opposition members of a Liberal coverup.

Conservative members will put forward a motion at tomorrow’s committee meeting, which will ask Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to waive all constraints currently preventing Wilson-Raybould from speaking fully.

In recent days, there has been public debate over whether Wilson-Raybould can speak freely without penalty in the House of Commons under parliamentary privilege or if another waiver from Trudeau is needed.

Scheer said the concern about parliamentary immunity is it doesn’t “absolve” the former ministers from the oaths they had taken, referring to the cabinet pledge to the Privy Council Office to “keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council.”

“That is what Justin Trudeau waived for Ms. Wilson-Raybould but only for a narrow period of time,” Scheer said, adding that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should be allowed to speak about events occurring after the former justice minister resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“Clearly there were events that happened after her time as attorney general.”

Last month, Trudeau waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences about the SNC-Lavalin affair, but the order-in-council only applies to Wilson-Raybould’s time as attorney general and excludes discussions between her and the director of public prosecutions.

Asked about the potential repercussions of Wilson-Raybould speaking in the House, Scheer said there are “clearly consequences to people’s reputations when they’ve taken oaths.”

“We’re saying don’t put them in that position if you’ve really got nothing to hide,” he said.

Scheer added that after a number of Liberal MPs recently said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should speak their mind in order to settle the affair, there is now “consensus” on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely.

The committee motion will also ask Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott to testify before April 5 and to allow the committee to table its findings in Parliament. Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4 over the Liberal government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

There are nine voting members of the ethics committee, including six Liberals, two Conservatives, and one NDP. The chair, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, does not have a vote.

The SNC-Lavalin controversy began on Feb. 7 when the Globe and Mail reported allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to reverse a decision made by the director of public prosecutions to move forward with a criminal case involving the Montreal-based engineering giant.

Since then, Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerry Butts, Wilson-Raybould, and Philpott have resigned from their jobs. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick has also announced his retirement.

At a press conference in Ottawa Monday, Andrew Scheer again called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fully waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence for Wilson-Raybould ahead of an ethics committee meeting Tuesday on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Scheer also said Trudeau must waive cabinet confidentiality for Philpott, who told Maclean's magazine last week that there is more to the controversy that must come out.

Watch:

The Tory leader noted how some Liberal MPs have, in recent days, publicly challenged Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to speak freely about the matter in the House of Commons, where parliamentary privilege protects members from facing legal action for their words.

Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould upped the ante in an interview with Global's ""The West Block"" that aired Sunday, saying that if both ex-ministers feel more needs to be said, they should ""put that on the record.""

""This is clearly a coordinated communications attempt over the last few days,"" Scheer told reporters.

There is ""now consensus on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely about their involvement in the SNC-Lavalin affair,"" he said.

If Liberals want to hear more from Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — who resigned as Treasury Board president over the government's handling of the controversy — then the prime minister should ""make it official"" and absolve them of constraints, the Tory leader said.

'When I take oaths, it's serious'

But Scheer, a former House Speaker, poured cold water on the idea that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott can easily stand up in the House and air things out.

While parliamentary privilege protects MPs from ""recourse about what they say,"" Scheer offered, it does not absolve them of the ethical and reputational consequences of breaking oaths without a greenlight from the prime minister.

""When I take oaths, it's serious. It's a matter of conscience for me,"" Scheer said. ""It's not something that I would break. There are clearly consequences to people's reputations when they've taken an oath. We're saying, don't put them in that position.""

Current and former cabinet ministers are part of the Privy Council, a body appointed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the prime minister to ""advise the Queen on issues of importance to the country."" Membership in the exclusive club comes with the title of ""Honourable"" and lasts for life, unless the appointment is withdrawn by the Governor General.

As a condition for joining cabinet, both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott swore they would:

""... be a true and faithful servant to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, as a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council for Canada. I will in all things to be treated, debated and resolved in Privy Council, faithfully, honestly and truly declare my mind and my opinion. I shall keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council. Generally, in all things I shall do as a faithful and true servant ought to do for Her Majesty. So help me God.""

Scheer took the same oath when he was sworn into the Privy Council in 2017. The Tory leader thanked Trudeau at the time for the honour.

Trudeau partially waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences for Wilson-Raybould ahead of her explosive testimony to the House justice committee last month.

The waiver allowed the former attorney general to speak about the issues surrounding SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution when she served in the role, but not about the events that transpired after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14.

Over four hours, Wilson-Raybould told MPs that she faced sustained and inappropriate pressure from Trudeau and other government officials, when she was attorney general, to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial on fraud and bribery charges.

Though her words sparked immediate calls from Tories for Trudeau to resign, the prime minister denied Wilson-Raybould's version of events. His former principal secretary later testified that Wilson-Raybould did not raise concerns about inappropriate pressure until she was shuffled from her powerful role.

Speaking about the issue with reporters in Maple Ridge, B.C. Monday, Trudeau said his government issued an ""unprecedented waiver"" which allowed Wilson-Raybould to speak about the specific issue of whether or not she faced undue pressure over SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general.

Trudeau also said he had a ""cordial conversation"" with Wilson-Raybould last week. The Vancouver-Granville MP has said she will seek re-election as a Liberal MP this fall, as will Philpott in the Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville.

""I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward,"" he said. ""They have both indicated that they look forward to running again as Liberals in the next election and I look forward to continuing to have their strong and thoughtful voices as part of our team.""

Wilson-Raybould promises more 'evidence'

Asked if he agreed with the growing number of Liberal MPs encouraging Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to speak out in the House, Trudeau said those are decisions to be made by the ex-ministers.

""What we have done as a government is grant an unprecedented waiver so that a full airing could happen at the justice committee of everything in regards to the SNC-Lavalin file and the time that is in question, when the former minister of justice was minister of justice,"" he said.

Last week, Liberal MPs on the justice committee ended the group's investigation into the matter. On Friday, Wilson-Raybould wrote to the committee to says she will make a written submission to the group and provide copies of emails and text messages she referenced during her testimony.

""I also have relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my committee appearance,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

246,,2019-03-26T17:35:00.0000000Z,Note that in February Tory leader Andrew Scheer spoke at the same event as Faith Goldy — an internet personality with white nationalist affiliations who once lent her voice to a Neo-Nazi podcast. Note that earlier this month Scheer neglected to include ...,"When asked about his apparent refusal to use the word ""Islamophobia,"" he denied that this is true and referenced a recent motion condemning the mosque attack that passed in the House of Commons.

He said: ""I reject anyone who would speak out based on Islamophobic principles, whether or not that's somebody who's trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith together or whether it's people who are trying to antagonize elements of society to have a more negative reaction to those who practise that faith.""

It's interesting: he rejects them and yet he speaks directly to them and on the same stage as them. February's United We Roll event where Scheer and Goldy spoke respectively wasn't only about pipelines and economic anxiety.

According to the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, a nonprofit that monitors hate groups, the rebranded United We Roll movement (previously Yellow Vest Convoy) is also home to many members who peddle in racist conspiracy theory and hate speech about Muslims, immigrants, government, and media.

None of this is to say that Scheer is responsible for any attack against any group. Crazy hateful people do crazy hateful things all the time absent the influence of politicians.

But when they do these things, it's imperative that our leaders name and embrace the communities they target.

It's imperative that leaders do this immediately — not hours later after everybody else tells them to. And this one should be obvious: it's imperative that they decline to speak at the same events as neo-Nazi sympathizers.

Scheer's defensiveness in the face of wholly legitimate criticism this month is not only inappropriate; it undermines any genuine statement he does make condemning white nationalism.

If he truly wants to prove to Canadians that he isn't courting racist voters, he should do what the Toronto Maple Leafs did earlier this month when defenceman Morgan Reilly was accused of uttering a homophobic slur on the ice.

An NHL investigation cleared Reilly of the charge but Leafs management held a press conference anyway devoted entirely to the problem of homophobia in hockey.

This is how you clear things up. Not by going on the defensive and certainly not by saying one thing and doing another.

Of all the reasons to give Justin Trudeau a pass on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the one the Liberals and their supporters seem most confident of is the existence of Andrew Scheer.

It’s pretty clear, at this point, that Justin Trudeau and his staff put pressure on the top law enforcement officer in the country to try to affect her decision about publicly prosecuting a large engineering company.

The Liberals are trying to suggest that it’s all a big misunderstanding and that the attorney general misinterpreted some everyday talk about this big issue. We’re all friends here, they say. Nothing to see here, they say.

And certain portions of the public have been more than ready to lap up whatever excuse the Liberals come up with because they are terrified of the thought of Andrew Scheer as prime minister.

Of course, Andrew Scheer’s existence is as relevant as my kid’s conjunctivitis to whether Trudeau acted wrongly or rightly.

If he was wrong, he was wrong even if you don’t want to vote for Scheer (or Singh or Bernier).

But what do you do, when everybody is due a thrashing? Holding your nose at the ballot box is a cliché because we accept that sometimes there is no great option.

If we should electorally punish those who do the wrong thing for political reasons, should we not also punish those who choose not to do the right things for political reasons?

One of the reasons people are so uncomfortable with Scheer is because of his and his party’s rhetoric over the past couple years on the topic of immigration, the border and other Trumpy topics.

Among all the many topics they can choose from, the Conservatives have been loudest about issues that, perhaps unsurprisingly, roil up the relatively tiny portion of Canadians who love to bash out angry caps-locked comments on Facebook.

To keep those folks from fleeing to whatever Maxime Bernier is doing, the Conservatives have railed against a tepid condemnation of Islamophobia and given voice to those fearmongering about a similarly bland United Nations migration agreement that will have not a whit of impact on Canadian policy.

There is little in Scheer’s background to suggest he is not a typical middle-of-the-road Canadian Conservative likely to continue with typically unoffensive Conservative immigration policy. He says the right things when pushed, and needs the votes of the huge number of Canadians who prize this country’s reputation for tolerance.

But recently, Scheer seems to have decided that the best political move is to avoid confronting those people who say Muslim immigrants are to be feared, not welcomed.

As a conservative, Scheer has credibility with those who detest Trudeau and are irrationally afraid of Muslims. At a town hall, John McCain famously defended Barack Obama as a good man, even as he strove to defeat him at the ballot box.

Scheer, similarly, has a chance – one that isn’t open to others – to try to de-radicalize a fearful segment of voters, while making it clear that a change in government won’t alter how welcoming Canada is to Muslims. He could forcefully and repeatedly try to reach that segment of the population and convince them that while he thinks policies should be changed, immigration does not pose a safety risk to Canadians.

He has not yet done so, but it’s still not too late.

Making decisions for political reasons is often, and thankfully, the worst political move of all.

Sometimes it’s best to just do the right thing and sleep well at night.

That is, if the province’s new secularism legislation, Bill 21, becomes law.

That’s what Quebec MNA Christopher Skeete, who serves as the parliamentary assistant to Quebec’s Premier Francois Legault, told Evan Solomon during an episode of CTV Question Period, airing Sunday.

“While [Singh] is working, if he chooses to be a police officer, we would ask him to remove his turban while at work, yes,” Skeete told Solomon.

Singh would be just one of many people impacted by the secularism bill, which was introduced in Quebec’s National Assembly Thursday. The proposed legislation would prevent certain public sector employees from wearing overt religious symbols at work. The bill specifically mentions teachers, police and court clerks, among other people in positions of authority in public sector workplaces.

“We’re saying that when you come to work, when you exercise the power of the state, that you leave your religion at the door, and I don’t think that’s too much to ask in a secular society,” Skeete said.

“Of course, they can always wear their religious symbols when they’re finished work.”

The bill has come under fire from civil rights groups and groups representing religious minorities. While the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedoms of conscience, religious expression and the right to equality, the bill invokes the notwithstanding clause to override those charter rights.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who represents a Quebec riding in the House of Commons, also criticized the proposed legislation.

“I don't think a lot of people feel that in a free society we should be legitimizing discrimination of our citizens based on religion,"" he said, speaking with reporters in New Brunswick on Thursday.

Singh has addressed Bill 21 as well. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he said “it’s something that’s going to hurt people.”

“I remember what it’s like to grow up and not feel like I belong, and I think about all the young people in Quebec right now that won’t be able to pursue, maybe, their dream job that won’t be able to become a police officer or a judge or a teacher -- and that, to me, is sad,” Singh said.

The Quebec government, however, has been defending its proposed legislation. They say they’re addressing something that has been a conversation in Quebec for 12 years -- and Skeete said Quebecers support the proposed law, even if advocacy groups warn it could tread on minority rights.

“Well we do live in a democracy, so you know, the majority often does determine the orientation that we take, but we always have to be careful when we make laws like this to make sure that we do respect minority rights,” he said.

Skeete emphasized that the legislation is all about balance.

“I think it’s just a question of how do we balance individual rights from collective rights and I realize that we’re on that line… but I do believe that ultimately it’s more important to have a truly secular state,” he said.

Skeete said the bill will undergo a consultation period where it will seek support from other parties and hear the concerns of affected groups. While he said the government is open to changing the bill, he said the changes would only take place “where we think it’s acceptable,” and “where it’s in line with what the population wants.”",Proposed secularism bill would force Singh to remove turban in public sector gig: Quebec MNA,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/proposed-secularism-bill-would-force-singh-to-remove-turban-in-public-sector-gig-quebec-mna-1.4358767

Singh intends to announce the policy proposal Friday during his keynote speech at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit, an annual gathering of progressive thinkers and New Democrats near Parliament Hill.

NDP MP Peter Julian, left, looks on as NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh speaks during a news conference in Ottawa on March 13, 2019. Singh wants to raise the tax paid on capital gains. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

In an interview with the Star on Thursday, Singh said he wants to increase the proportion of capital gains profits that are taxed by the federal government. This “inclusion rate” is currently set at 50 per cent — meaning only half the profits people make by selling property or securities investments is subject to income tax. The NDP wants to increase that rate to 75 per cent, which Singh said party researchers predict would bring an additional $2.7 billion in tax revenue to the federal government each year. Capital gains are profits made from selling real estate — other than your primary residence — and from the sale of other investments, like stocks or certain businesses, that aren’t held in registered retirement or tax-free savings accounts. “The vast, vast majority of people that use this benefit are the wealthiest, the richest people in Canada,” Singh said, contrasting the capital gains inclusion rate with how most people’s salaries are taxed.

Article Continued Below

“We want a fairer system.” Capital gains taxes have been around for decades, and the inclusion rate Singh wants to increase has been changed as well — most recently in 2000, when the Liberal government led by Jean Chrétien slashed it from 75 to 50 per cent. Singh would reverse that change.

Article Continued Below

There were several media reports ahead of the 2017 budget that saw business analysts warn that increasing the proportion of capital gains that gets taxed would deter investment and innovation in Canada. Singh dismissed such concerns on Thursday, arguing a 75 per cent rate still gives capital gains better tax treatment than employee income. He added that the change would bring in more money that an NDP government would use to extend public health care to cover prescription medicine, dental and eye care, as well to build affordable housing units and fund a transition to cleaner energy. “There’s got to be some fairness to pay for the things that people need,” he said. “This is one of the ways we can do it.” The proposal to increase the tax on capital gains follows an announcement last fall, when Singh touted a trio of policy changes to crack down on tax dodgers and prevent the wealthy from hiding their money. He said the NDP would make changes to prevent companies from moving money overseas to avoid corporate taxes, and ban special types of company shares — called bearer bonds — that don’t require disclosure of who owns them. Singh also called on the Liberal government to close the so-called stock option “loophole,” which allows corporate executives to avoid income taxes by receiving compensation in company shares instead of through regular paycheques. The Liberals banned the issuance of new bearer bonds in legislation last year, and the Trudeau government announced in the recent federal budget that it intends to cap stock compensation at $200,000 per year so high income earners no longer benefit disproportionately from the option. But Singh said he does not believe the Liberals will follow through on the stock option limit, contending Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demonstrated he is beholden to business interests through the SNC-Lavalin controversy and by not moving faster to create a government pharmacare program for all Canadians. “The track record of this government now makes it clear that they’re not going to make changes that will help out everyday families,” Singh said. Friday’s policy announcement is part of a series that Singh and the NDP plan to make in the coming weeks. The party has said its entire 2019 election platform will be public before the end of spring.

The party estimates the move, which would also apply to the sale of most real estate but not primary residences, tax-free savings accounts or registered retirement plans, would generate nearly $3 billion in additional revenue for the federal treasury.

""When you go to work, you're taxed on almost all of your income,"" Singh said. ""It doesn't make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half.""

The inclusion rate for capital gains has fluctuated since it was introduced in 1972, when it was 50 per cent. It was raised several times in the intervening years to a high of 75 per cent, before Jean Chretien's government cut it to its current rate in 2000.

A hotly debated topic

The question of raising the inclusion rate on capital gains has been hotly debated for years, with some suggesting it would address inequality and others arguing it would hurt Canadians' savings and make the country less attractive for investors.

New Democrats have also previously talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens they say help the rich hide their wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

The government in its most recent budget moved to address the stock-option loophole by putting a $200,000-limit on the tax-deductible amount on employee stock options.

The stock-option deduction works by taxing only 50 per cent of the earnings an employee receives when they cash in any stock options received as part of their compensation packages, if certain conditions are met.

The new limit appears aimed at tightening the loophole while acknowledging concerns that closing it entirely would make it more difficult for companies to attract talent and discourage start-ups.",Singh: New Democrats Will Tax The Rich To Pay For Pharmacare,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/29/jagmeet-singh-pharmacare_a_23702695/

OTTAWA – While the richest use loopholes to evade their taxes, regular people are paying the price. In a keynote speech at Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made an announcement that unlike Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, the NDP will have the courage to address our unfair tax system that is preventing Canadians from getting the public services they need.

“For far too long, people have been working hard to make ends meet, and they just want things to be a little easier. When you go to work, you’re taxed on almost all of your income. It doesn’t make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half,” said Singh. “Trudeau’s Liberals have refused to limit the capital gains tax benefit for the wealthiest. This is hurting hard-working Canadians who are forced to pay the price.”

To make our tax system fairer, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will increase the capital gains inclusion rate from the current 50 to 75%. This plan will bring in almost $3 billion more in government revenue every year to fund the services Canadians need, like childcare, education, and housing. New Democrats are committed to a fairer and more progressive tax system and will get rid of tax loopholes for the wealthiest, by increasing taxes on investment profits and by getting tough on tax evasion.

As it stands, 88% of the capital gains tax benefit goes to the 1%. Under the Liberal tax plan, people earning less than $45,000 get nothing – and that’s the majority of Canadians. Meanwhile, those earning over three times that salary receive much higher tax cuts. This is unfair for people who are trying to build a better future for their families.

“A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, childcare, affordable housing and post-secondary education,” added Singh. “Everybody wins when we deliver better services that Canadians can rely on. New Democrats have the courage to bring in a fairer tax system that will help people build a better future.”",Singh: Let's Help People by Bringing in a Fairer Tax System,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/singh-lets-help-people-bringing-fairer-tax-system

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection -- made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart -- ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.",NDP's Jagmeet Singh makes history in House of Commons,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/ndp-s-jagmeet-singh-makes-history-in-house-of-commons-1.4340972

He is the first person of colour to lead a federal party.

In a speech after he was sworn in, Singh thanked the people of Burnaby South for allowing him to be their voice in Ottawa, as well as his friends, family and supporters.

""Any time you achieve anything, there are so many people that made it possible. You never do it alone.""

Singh said, as a young boy he could have never imagined he would run for prime minister one day, but he wants all children now to have a more diverse image of what a prime minister can be.

""That image is now going to be more and more clear for young people in this country,"" he said.

""I'm only here today because other people broke barriers for me.""

Singh won a byelection in Burnaby South at the end of February.

He will enter the Commons on a busy week that includes a federal budget and continuing drama around the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He also spoke about the mosque attacks in New Zealand that left 50 people dead, saying it's time to tear down the root causes of hate, not just denounce the actions. He called for an end to policies and language that treat people as less than human.

Being a leader means serving: Singh

Singh says his strategy in the House is to push for more affordable housing, an environmentally responsible economy, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and better healthcare.

He says he'll treat his role as rooted in the Punjabi translation of the word 'leader,' which translates roughly into English as ""the one who serves.""

""We're going to have a tough road ahead of us,"" he said, acknowledging the party only has a few months to convince Canadians that the NDP is a viable option.

""Together we're going to change this country.""

The NDP’s standard bearer in the riding will be selected on Saturday.

The byelection already features an interesting cast of characters, including a jilted Conservative who lost a bid for her party’s candidacy and jumped to Maxime Bernier’s Peoples Party of Canada (PPC); a Green candidate who had a falling out with the NDP ahead of the last federal election; and a Liberal Indigenous candidate with as big a profile as Jody Wilson-Raybould when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited her for the Liberals in 2015.

Singh, who took a seat in the House of Commons for the first time last week after winning his own byelection in the greater Vancouver riding of Burnaby South last month, will greet the NDP candidate in Nanaimo on Sunday, his office told iPolitics.

A roster of four NDP candidates suggests the New Democrat’s confidence in the riding, despite a late entry into the race and a hike in Green Party support in the past years. Prime Minister Trudeau announced the byelection on March 24.

A day after Trudeau set the byelection date, he surfaced in Nanaimo to circulate and draw attention to a star Liberal candidate, who the party had announced only a week earlier. That candidate, Michelle Corfield, is a prominent and highly successful Indigenous leader who holds a doctorate from Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business.

Corfield is also chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of Ucluelet First Nation and a founding member of a settlement trust at Ucluelet First Nation on the western coast of Vancouver Island. Corfield is an executive resident at the Beedie School’s Indigenous Business and Economic Development Knowledge Exchange.

Despite the credentials of his party’s candidate, or perhaps to ensure Corfield was the one in the limelight during an ongoing confrontation between Trudeau and one of his star 2015 candidates, Vancouver Liberal MP and former justice minister Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau declined to take questions from local news media.

Even with as prominent a candidate as Corfield, the Liberal party faces an uphill battle toward May 6.

Vancouver Island resisted the Liberal wave of 2015, voting in New Democrats in six of the island’s seven federal electoral districts. The seventh, Saanich—Gulf Islands, was won by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for her second term in the House of Commons.

The contests were close and Angus Reid Institute’s polling analyst Shachi Kurl notes that Vancouver Island has been a tug-of-war between New Democrats and Conservatives over the past years.

“The island has a tendency to swing orange or blue,” Kurl said in a phone interview from her Vancouver office.

Nanaimo News Bulletin reporter Nicholas Pescod says he expects the NDP will continue to hold Nanaimo—Ladysmith. “I suspect the NDP will do well,” he said in a telephone interview from the News Bulletin newsroom.

Kurl noted low-turnout byelections can hinge on local organization, for which the NDP is famous in B.C.

Nanaimo—Ladysmith was left vacant after popular former NDP MP Sheila Malcolmson, announced last fall that she was making the jump to provincial politics. She resigned her Commons seat on Jan. 2 to contest and win a byelection in the provincial electoral district of Nanaimo. That Jan. 30 byelection was crucial for the survival of the province’s NDP coalition government.

For the May 6 federal byelection, the NDP field of four candidates also includes a prominent Indigenous candidate, Bob Chamberlin, who is vice-president of the long-established Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and chief councillor with the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation at the north end of Vancouver Island.

The other three NDP hopefuls include Lauren Sample, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson, a past president of Nanaimo Pride, and a women’s rights advocate; Maeve O’Byrne, a founder of the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation who coaches volunteers working in refugee camps; and Fred Statham, whose electoral experience includes two attempts at election to Nanaimo city council.

The nominated field for other parties is just as unique.

The Green Party and Conservative candidates launched their nomination bids last fall, after Malcolmson announced she would not seek re-election federally.

Green candidate Paul Manly, who came third against Malcolmson in 2015, was acclaimed as the Green candidate on Feb. 3, after launching his nomination campaign last Oct. 25. According to commenters on a Reddit forum and other media, Manly tried to contest the NDP riding’s general election nomination in 2015, but claimed later his candidacy was rejected because he protested Israel’s treatment of his father, former NDP MP Jim Manley, who was arrested after taking part in an attempt to breach Israel’s 2012 sea blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The nominated Conservative candidate for the byelection, Sun Life office manager John Hirst, won his nomination on Nov. 17 last year. His opponent for the Tory nomination, Jennifer Clarke, was picked up to run for the PPC.

By winning a seat in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South, Jagmeet Singh becomes the first visible minority leader of a federal political party in this country’s history. He did so in the face of withering critiques, notably from former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as to his prospects and abilities, as well as a dominant narrative that suggested the Liberal Party of Canada was quickly usurping the NDP as Canada’s leading progressive voice. We are better as a country with Jagmeet Singh in Parliament.

Now the bad news. Though he is now leader of a political party with significant representation in Quebec, Singh soon wouldn’t be allowed to guard prisoners, police the streets, serve as a judge — or even teach schoolchildren in the province. That’s because the provincial government plans on banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain civil servants, teachers included, in the name of secularism.

And were Singh to show up at the National Assembly to protest the forthcoming legislation, he wouldn’t be allowed in. Unlike Canadian Parliament, the National Assembly still considers the kirpan, the ceremonial dagger worn by many practising Sikh men, to be a dangerous weapon. He wouldn’t make it past the X-ray machines.

I bring all of this up not to relive the long and often tiresome debate about the place and space allowed religious minorities in Quebec, but rather to illustrate the uniquely challenging political context Singh now finds himself in the very province that helped launch the NDP’s rebirth eight years ago.

In a few months’ time, Singh will be tasked with campaigning in a province that overwhelmingly supports the above-mentioned legislation. It has the potential to be a jarring spectacle. Policy-wise, the NDP under Singh, an unabashedly progressive counterpoint to Thomas Mulcair’s Liberalesque leadership, is the stuff of dreams to the province’s centre-left electorate. Yet it is tough not to see the party’s sudden and inherent disadvantage: its leader happens to be a brown guy in a turban.

Quebec’s political class is obsessed with identity issues like immigration, which took up an outsized proportion of the oxygen during the last provincial election, according to Influence Communication, a Quebec-based media analysis firm. For this you can at once point to history (francophone Quebecers’ collective and existential worry about the survival of their language and culture) and blame politicians for exploiting this worry for political gain.

This tinder is regularly turned to flame by way of certain columnists — almost all of whom are from the Journal de Montréal — who tend to portray Quebec’s religious minorities as an invading horde bent on undermining Quebec’s proudly secular society.

The end result is a zealous rejection of conspicuous religiosity. Consider how some 61 per cent of Quebecers, far and away the largest percentage of respondents in the country, say the wearing of the turban or other religious symbol by teachers is “unacceptable,” according to a national Léger Marketing poll published last December. Never mind that at least three teachers’ unions have said the government’s proposed ban is patently unworkable. The decade-long politicization of the issue has ensured gut feeling, not cold logic, rules the day.

Singh is about to step into this politically perilous breach, his religion conspicuously displayed. To be fair, he has a lot going for him. He’s good on TV and great on the stage — a necessity in the Trudeau age of campaigning. Most important, his French is excellent. And on the island of Montreal, at least, he has a multicultural beachhead where his appearance is an advantage, or at least less of a disadvantage.

But beyond our fair city? I worry we aren’t yet ready for a leader like Jagmeet Singh. I can only hope I’m proven wrong.

Jagmeet Singh was sworn in to the House of Commons as Burnaby South’s newest MP on Sunday, March 17! Surrounded by family, friends, and our NDP Team, Jagmeet became the first racialized leader of a Canadian political party to be sworn in to the House.

People across the country watched as Jagmeet took his seat in the House and aksed his first question on Monday, March 18. He talked about the people he’s met who are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of housing – worried about how they’ll be able to make rent, pay their mortgage, or whether their kids and grandkids will ever be able to own a home.

He pressed Trudeau on refusing to address the housing crisis – and asked him to commit to half a million new units of affordable housing.

Jagmeet is in the House to fight for us. While Trudeau’s Liberal government keeps siding with their rich friends, Jagmeet and our NDP team are pushing for the solutions everyday people need now.

People across the country supported Jagmeet online, using #JagmeetintheHouse to share their excitement and hopes for the future. Here’s what people had to say:

article continues below

He won a byelection in Burnaby South on Feb. 25 to replace former MP and current mayor of Vancouver Kennedy Stewart.

Singh also made history as the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Parliament.

Singh used his first speaking opportunity during question period to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on housing.

He repeated a story he told many times during the byelection campaign, saying he met a teacher forced to live in her parents’ basement due to Burnaby’s unaffordable housing market.

Singh asked Trudeau whether the Liberal government would commit to building 500,000 new homes, alluding to the NDP’s proposal to do so over the next 10 years.

Trudeau welcomed Singh to Ottawa and said he hopes New Democrats back the Liberal government’s ongoing efforts to create affordable housing.

Singh also joined many Conservative MPs in calling on Trudeau to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify in front of the justice committee for a second time to address the the SNC-Lavalin affair. He also repeated his call for the Liberals to launch a public inquiry into the case.

“For Canadians watching at home, this doesn't look any different than when the Conservatives were in power – special access for powerful corporations, a closed door for everyone else,” he said. “Why is this prime minister so afraid to launch a public inquiry?”

Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger deflected the calls from the opposition parties, saying Wilson-Raybould already had her chance to speak.

Singh also addressed the mosque shooting that killed 50 and injured dozens more in New Zealand last week. An avowed white supremacist has been charged in the massacre.

“That attack reverberated across the world. Though it happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, the pain impacted all of us,” he said. “It hurts here in Canada, where Muslim brothers and sisters – our friends, our close ones, people who work with us – are thinking about their own loved ones when they go to masjid, when they go to prayer, and how much it hurts to know that you're being targeted for being who you are.”

Singh said the attack was borne of white supremacist and Islamophobic hatred.

“Hate knows no bounds. Once hate is allowed to grow, it consumes all in its path. Hate is like a fire – once it's allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everything,” he said.

Singh joined Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer in condemning Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, but said Canada must go further by addressing the root causes of such hatred.

When people refer to migrants as “illegal” or “barbaric,” they dehumanize them, he said.

“The purpose is to dehumanize and then, once you dehumanize, it leads to fear and hatred,” he said. “Let's be conscious of the words we use so we never create any ground for hate to grow.”

Singh made the comments after Trudeau and Scheer made their own statements condemning the attack and expressing solidarity with the people of New Zealand and Muslims around the world.

Trudeau addressed the various forms of prejudice and discrimination he said lead to terrorist attacks around the world.

“It's anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, anti-black, anti-Indigenous, misogynistic, homophobic – the list goes on and on,” he said. “This rhetoric is dangerous, hateful and vile; it lives and festers online, spilling out into the real world with deadly consequences.”

Scheer expressed similar sentiments.

He said the attack in New Zealand was reminiscent of the 2017 attack on a Quebec City mosque in which a white nationalist killed six men in their place of worship.

Scheer called for unity among political parties in condemning hateful ideologies.

“I say to my colleagues in all parties, we certainly have our differences on important policy matters that deserve rigorous and spirited debate, but on this – the very compassion and humanity of our Canadian society – there can be no debate,” he said.","Jagmeet Singh presses on housing, calls out dehumanizing language in Parliamentary debut",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/news/jagmeet-singh-presses-on-housing-calls-out-dehumanizing-language-in-parliamentary-debut-1.23667389

“It’s an incredible honour. I’m humbled. I’m blown away by the immensity of the role I’ve been granted,” said Singh, a former criminal lawyer who was born in Scarborough and is the son of immigrants from India. “If I could have in some way broken down barriers for people, I would have done something good with my life,” he said. Singh’s debut in the Commons is a result of his Feb. 25 byelection victory in Burnaby South, the British Columbia riding he moved to last year in a bid to win his first federal seat. He used the occasion to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the government’s affordable housing plan, demanded the Liberals increase carbon price charges on heavy polluters, and repeat his party’s call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

For Singh, the moment comes at a challenging time for the party he leads. Fundraising has sunk from $18 million in 2015 to around $5 million last year, while the party has taken out a $12 million mortgage on its national headquarters, the Jack Layton Building. Meanwhile, about a quarter of the party’s caucus has resigned their seats or announced they won’t run in the general election this fall, including veterans like B.C. MPs Nathan Cullen and Murray Rankin, Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Ontario stalwarts David Christopherson and Irene Mathyssen.

Singh himself has received negative attention for communications stumbles, including occasions when he seemed unaware of his own party’s position on issues like the Liberal government gun legislation and the question of whether Canada was right to recognize Venezuela’s opposition leader as the country’s legitimate president. In the months leading up to his byelection run, as Singh toured the country in a series of “JagMeet and Greet” events, many NDP insiders argued he needed a seat in the Commons to change the narrative that had settled in over the first year of his leadership. On Monday, Singh finally appeared in the House, tapping the breast of his suit and waving to his family as he was escorted to take his seat at the head of the NDP benches. His younger brother, Ontario MPP Gurratan Singh, said afterwards that it was “an historic and momentous occasion for all Canadians.” He looked on from the public gallery with Singh’s wife and parents, and wore a yellow turban that matched his brother’s on the Commons floor below. “For people who don’t see themselves represented in politics, today was a milestone,” he said. Singh spent much of question period listening intently. During the opening exchange between Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, he pressed his earpiece against his head and took notes. Later, after he had asked his own questions, Singh got up and left for a few minutes. When he returned, he briefly walked down the wrong aisle and had to double back to get to his seat. He has seven months to learn where it is before he has to win it again. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @aballinga

This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto.

Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation.

But he may have to wait a few more months – until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign – for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

The NDP leader’s belated entry in the Commons comes at a time when the current Parliament is on its last legs - with its most productive days behind it.

Tuesday’s budget – the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office – marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future.

In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda.

One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more.

But the SNC-Lavalin affair – and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction – has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic.

As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue.

Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring.

So might Singh.

The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives.

It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage.

Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000.

On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals.

Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner.

Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago.

Like Clark, who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs, the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.

In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of New Democrat MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at nine per cent, two points ahead of the NDP.

The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall.

As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

On March 17, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was officially sworn in as the MP for Burnaby South. The election of the first racialized federal party leader to Parliament is of great historic significance.

Wanting to do my part, I travelled to BC to campaign for Singh. I wanted to make a positive contribution to the effort in light of the gloomy press coverage (some predicting Singh’s demise) that was hanging over the campaign like a dark cloud.

I was eager to know what people on the ground were thinking and feeling about the by-election. It quickly became apparent that young people engineering Singh’s operation were enthusiastic, dedicated and curious.

There were also some of the more seasoned organizers. One who flew in from Brampton proudly told me that he just got accepted into law school at the University of Ottawa, my alma mater. I asked how it felt. He said it paled in comparison to the idea of Singh winning the riding. People were nervous as they confronted the weight of history.

This was no casual by-election. The media, taking the attitude of “do or die,” reminded us of that every day. This was an election that would either usher in a new era in Canadian politics or turn back the clock for under-represented communities.

So when the polls closed and the results finally poured in, the scene was electric at the Hilton Vancouver Hotel. We did it. The moment to shift the national discourse into an unapologetically progressive direction is here.

There is a real opportunity for an NDP breakthrough in this volatile political climate, but it must articulate a bold and truly transformative agenda on climate change, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, electoral reform, criminal justice reform, pharmacare and the housing crisis. The plight of working-class people across this country demands aggressive no-nonsense representation.

In Burnaby, Singh was able to appeal to a multiracial working class constituency with a left-populist campaign that focused on the fundamental unfairness of the economy and issues of housing affordability. Throughout his political career, he has demonstrated an ability to appeal to marginalized communities that represent a growing share of the electorate.

Many activists on Singh’s campaign were inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing women of colour recently elected to congress in the U.S. who are challenging conventional wisdom and calling for a Green New Deal, free tuition, medicare for all and immigration reform.

There are lessons to be learned here from this new group of political leaders south of the border. It’s time for a new generation of progressive activists in this country, ones who boldly stand for social and economic justice and reflect the diversity of modern Canada, to step forward.

The win means Singh can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the party reins from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

In a statement, Singh says he will use his new position to pressure the Liberal government to take action on affordable housing and bringing down prescription drug costs.

He says as a kid, he never would have imagined being in this position.

""I would've never imagined that someone who looks like me could ever run to be prime minister,"" Singh said in a statement issued by the party on Sunday.

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

Sporting a bright yellow turban, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh entered the House of Commons for the first time as an MP Monday to loud cheers.

Singh is the first minority leader in the Commons in Canadian history.

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

Singh won his new Burnaby South seat in a February byelection sparked by the departure of former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who ran for mayor of Vancouver.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons will help the party turn the page on a difficult period, marked by challenges with morale and fundraising.

Anyone who followed the 2013 B.C. election or the recently Nanaimo byelection will know that polls can be pretty unreliable.

article continues below

So keep this in mind while reading the results of a Nanos Research poll posted today that has the federal NDP – led by new Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh getting a pretty big bump in support.

The latest Nanos federal ballot tracking has the Conservatives at 35.5 per cent, followed by the Liberals at 32.6 per cent, the NDP at 19.9 percent, the BQ at 3.2 per cent, the Greens at 7.7 per cent and the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) at 0.5 per cent.

The NDP for the longest time has been mired at 13 to 14 per cent, with the party also struggling to raise money.

So to have a showing at nearly 20 per cent is to be considered positive news. The CBC’s poll tracker – which aggregates all publicly available polling data – has the NDP at 15.9 per cent.

The bad news for Singh is the other number Nanos had.

Nanos tracking has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the preferred choice as PM at 30.3 per cent of Canadians followed by Scheer (27.3%), Singh (8.9%), May (7.2%) and Bernier (2.8%). Twenty-two per cent of Canadians were unsure whom they preferred.

So Singh is way down the list and has a lot of work to do. Things could get better now that he is an MP and gets to speak in the House of Commons. He needs to build his profile and fast because October is getting closer and closer.

Singh is getting huge assists from Trudeau with SNC-Lavalin and Scheer with his blunder after the New Zealand massacre.

Let’s see what he can do with these missteps.

For theNanos poll, the data is based on a dual frame (land + cell-lines) random telephone interviews using live agents of 1,000 Canadians using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week, 18 years of age and over. The random sample of 1,000 respondents may be weighted by age and gender using the latest census information for Canada. The interviews are compiled into a four week rolling average of 1,000 interviews, where each week the oldest group of 250 interviews is dropped and a new group of 250 interviews is added.

A random telephone survey of 1,000 Canadians is accurate ±3.1 percentage points, plus or minus, 19 times out of 20.","NDP surges in poll, but Jagmeet Singh's own rating stays in single digits",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/opinion/blogs/ndp-surges-in-poll-but-jagmeet-singh-s-own-rating-stays-in-single-digits-1.23668370

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

Less than seven months before Canadians are scheduled to take to the polls, the NDP has nominated 42 candidates, with incumbent MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau selected Wednesday night to run again in the Quebec riding of Berthier—Maskinonge.

The effort to help NDP leader Jagmeet Singh win the Burnaby South byelection in part also explains the party’s relatively slow pace at finding new candidates, said strategist Robin MacLachlan. ( Jonathan Hayward / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

That amounts to confirmed candidates in 12 per cent of the 338 federal ridings in Canada — a tally that puts the NDP way behind other major parties. As of this week, the Conservatives have confirmed candidates in 226 ridings and the Liberals have “more than 170,” party spokespeople told the Star. The Green Party, which has one seat in the House of Commons, has nominated 70 candidates. In a phone interview Wednesday, NDP campaign co-chair Marie Della Mattia downplayed the party’s relative dearth of nominees. She said another 32 nomination contests are already scheduled before the end of April and that the party will be ready with a full slate of candidates even if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unexpectedly breaks with Canada’s fixed-date election law and drops the writ this spring. Even so, Della Mattia said the NDP takes longer to secure nominees because of rules to ensure efforts are made to attract a wide range of candidates — including women, racialized people and members of Indigenous communities, and those who identify as LGBTQ or disabled. Local riding associations need to prove outreach efforts to the party before they nominate their candidates, and the party wants more than half of its candidates this year to be women, trans or non-binary people, she said.

The Liberals introduced a similar requirement this year for associations in ridings without a Liberal MP. The party requires associations “to document a thorough search for potential women candidates and other candidates who reflect the demographics of the community,” according to its website. But Della Mattia said the NDP is also taking time to allow for robust nomination contests in ridings such as Nanaimo—Ladysmith, a B.C. constituency where a high-profile Indigenous chief and community activist are squaring off to run for the party in a coming byelection. “What we’re trying to do is build into our process the time and space for those conversations to happen,” she said. “It just takes longer for us.” At the same time, the NDP is looking for candidates to replace the host of incumbent MPs that has moved for the exit door since Jagmeet Singh became leader in October 2017. Fourteen of the 44 New Democrats elected in 2015 have either resigned their seats, announced they won’t seek re-election this year or — in the case of Saskatchewan’s Erin Weir — have been expelled from caucus.

Most of the remaining incumbents have been confirmed as candidates, but two told the Star this week that they remain undecided. Christine Moore, the MP for the Quebec riding Abitibi—Témiscamingue, said by email that she will decide whether to run again after she gives birth in the coming weeks. And Pierre Nantel, another MP first elected in the 2011 “Orange Wave” in Quebec, is also “still in reflection” on whether he will seek re-election, his office confirmed. Robin MacLachlan, an NDP strategist and vice-president at Summa Strategies in Ottawa, said it’s still too early to get concerned about the NDP falling behind on candidate nominations. If there are organizational delays, though, he said they could be explained by the party’s all-out focus on Singh’s byelection campaign in the B.C. riding of Burnaby South, which he won Feb. 25 to become a federal MP for the first time.

“There’s no doubt that there’s a lag that we’re trying to catch up from,” he said, adding that “there’s no way to sugar-coat the situation” where incumbents retiring and party fundraising has dropped from $18 million in 2015 to around $5 million last year. But he described the turnover as a “natural changing of the guard,” and pointed to new candidates competing in long-held NDP ridings like Hamilton Centre, where local city councillor Matthew Green is vying to inherit from party stalwart David Christopherson, who was first elected there in 2004. MacLachlan also pointed to well-known candidates like former MPs Svend Robinson and Andrew Cash running again for the party. “There’s a new leader, and he’s breathing new life into the party. But it’s clear that he was starting from the position of great challenge: not having a seat in the House of Commons, the NDP having not formed government in the 2015 election and NDP members feeling a bit of malaise after that election,” MacLachlan said. “He has to simultaneously demonstrate that he’s up to that challenge in the House of Commons while making sure that the party apparatus is nominating the right candidates.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The NDP caucus brought in Janice Rubin of Rubin Thomlinson in Toronto and Ayla Akgungor of Field Law in Edmonton to investigate the allegations and file a report. The issue has resurfaced on social media during the election campaign, with some asking why the party did not release the names of the accused. “In both cases, the claimants that raised the concerns wanted to maintain their privacy,” Notley said Friday.

“In so doing, we must also then maintain the privacy of those who were the respondents in the case.” She added the party has followed the recommendations of the independent investigators, though she did not elaborate on what the discipline entailed. “We know that both of the complainants were made aware of what those recommendations were and we thought that they were satisfactory,” Notley said. NDP spokesperson Cheryl Oates said in an emailed statement that the reports cannot be released publicly because they would jeopardize the privacy of the complainants, who both requested the reports not be released. “We take all of these matters — whether they involve staff or elected officials — very seriously,” Oates said. “Our policy for investigating these is very similar to that used by the Legislatively Assembly Office — and we followed that policy in both of these matters.” Kevin Maimann is an Edmonton-based reporter covering education and marijuana legalization.

The party today announced it was opening nominations in all 40 districts.

The Newfoundland and Labrador NDP have opened nominations in all 40 districts for this year's provincial election.

A date hasn't been set for the election yet. The fixed date is Oct. 8, but Premier Dwight Ball can change that. The federal election is currently set for Oct. 21, and the two campaign periods cannot overlap.

A spring election is a possibility. Ball hasn't tipped his hand either way, but says he'll narrow down the election timeframe by April 1.

So far, three people have said they will seek the nomination for the NDP in provincial districts:

New leader Allison Coffin, who will seek the nomination for the St. John's East-Quidi Vidi district, as MHA and former NDP leader Lorraine Michael will not be seeking re-election.

Jenn Deon, who will be seek the nomination for Virginia Waters-Pleasantville in St. John's.

Former Newfoundland and Labrador Teachers' Association head Jim Dinn, who will seek the nomination in St. John's Centre, currently held by NDP MHA Gerry Rogers, who has likewise announced she won't be running again.

The move, which would cover prescription co-payments for seniors with incomes less than $75,000 per year, would cost the province about $110 million per year.

“Right now there are seniors in Alberta who are actually forced to choose between filling their prescriptions or filling their fridges,” said Notley at a Sherwood Park news conference Friday. “That’s not right.”

Currently seniors pay 30 per cent of the cost of a prescription up to a maximum of $25. That’s through a Blue Cross insurance plan for Alberta seniors over 65.

Notley said such costs add up, and prescriptions can be a financial barrier.

“I’ve heard many personal stories from seniors over the years who basically did not factor in the costs of prescription co-pay when they were planning for their retirement,” she said, flanked by NDP Sherwood Park candidate Annie McKitrick and NDP Strathcona-Sherwood Park candidate Moira Vane.

One third of seniors have a chronic need for more than five prescriptions at a time, and five per cent need 10 prescriptions or more, she said.

“This is extremely costly for those who are living on fixed incomes.”

It leads seniors to not fill their prescriptions because they can’t afford them, Notley said.

The NDP estimates the change would apply to four out of five seniors and save them an average of $200 a year.

Notley also touted a deal reached under her government in March, which extended the agreement determining how pharmacies are funded until 2022.

Last year, the Alberta government and the Alberta Pharmacists’ Association created a funding framework set to expire March 31, 2020. That deal, projected to save the province $150 million, was extended for two more years. The agreement saves 8,700 seniors more than $100 per year in prescription costs, and seniors with significant prescription costs will save even more, according to the province.

Notley said Friday that the NDP considered universal funding for seniors’ prescriptions, but is moving forward on an “incremental basis.”

“It would be obviously preferable to make it universal, but in a case like this we also have to balance the cost.

“We are hopeful that we’ve struck the right balance.”

It’s the latest health-care promise from Notley, who continues to double down on the message that the NDP will protect Alberta from a two-tier system she believes would be created under the UCP.

She previously announced an NDP government would add 2,000 more long-term-care beds, costing about $170 million. She has also promised $90 million per year to help reduce surgical wait times and to increase emergency care.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney, who has said his party will guarantee public and accessible health care, is pushing for private options, much like the system in B.C. and Quebec.

The party also committed Thursday to fully funding growing student enrolment each year at an estimated cost of $72 million. It would add an estimated 600 new teaching and support staff positions for the 15,000 more students expected to arrive in Alberta schools by the fall.

“Notley’s plan for the next four years invests in education and supports Alberta’s young learners by strengthening and modernizing Alberta’s education system,” a Thursday news release from the NDP said. “Our kids deserve nothing less.”

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has said he will “maintain or increase” education funding, but has not provided specifics. His plan puts students’ education at risk, Notley said.

Notley announced the party’s plans sitting with supporters around a kitchen table in Calgary Thursday.

An NDP government would also make permanent and increase the classroom improvement fund (CIF) to $100 million a year from the current $77 million, a party news release said. It should add another 400 teachers and support staff to Alberta classrooms, Notley said. Schools and boards decide what staff to hire with their provincial funding allotments.

The classroom improvement fund was introduced in 2017 as part of a collective agreement with teachers. School boards must spend it on classroom personnel and to help students with complex needs and those learning English.

Notley said Thursday the NDP would next week release more detailed financing information for the party’s platform.

New language programs

In addition to a new K-12 Filipino language curriculum the NDP has already committed to introduce by 2020, the party pledged to introduce new provincial courses in Punjabi, Somali and Cantonese. The government already offers K-12 courses in 26 languages other than English and French. Although some schools may already offer classes in Filipino or Punjabi, school boards must develop and pay for the courses on their own.

The NDP also committed Thursday to continue a $5 million-a-year grant program, which offers up to $250,000 to replace playgrounds at schools in mature neighbourhoods. New and modernized elementary schools will also come with a promise of $250,000 for each playground.

A $16-million school nutrition program for 30,000 students would continue, an NDP spokeswoman said.

Following UCP Leader Jason Kenney’s announcement that he intends to roll back privacy rights and other legal protections for LGBTQ students and staff in Alberta schools, Notley said an NDP government would keep current laws in place.

The law requires all schools to publicly post policies outlining their rights, and requires school principals to “immediately” approve students’ requests to start a gay-straight alliance.

“It’s utterly cruel for us to be thinking of going backwards on this,” Notley said, saying there is no reason to re-litigate the issue.

A group of parents and private religious schools are challenging the law, saying it infringes on their religious freedom.

The NDP is also committing to completing its revamp of the K-12 curriculum in English and French. Kenney said a UCP government would “pause” the review to do further consultation.

Notley said it would be “damaging” to throw out the work done so far to make curriculum current. So far, 100,000 people have given input or worked on the curriculum review.

The plan is expected to form a key plank in the NDP’s election platform this fall alongside other policy proposals that the party says will target the rich, pay for more services for Canadians and cool the housing market.

The NDP is specifically looking to tax 75 per cent of profits on investments, up from the current rate of 50 per cent, which it says will raise about $3 billion for the federal treasury.

288,,2019-03-29T23:34:00.0000000Z,"VICTORIA — For two afternoons this week, Green leader Andrew Weaver hammered away at the New Democrats, accusing them of hypocrisy and worse on the LNG file and using their own words against them.","VICTORIA — For two afternoons this week, Green leader Andrew Weaver hammered away at the New Democrats, accusing them of hypocrisy and worse on the LNG file and using their own words against them.

It happened during debate on Bill 10, the enabling legislation for some of the tax breaks and incentives in the NDP government’s deal with the LNG Canada project.

Weaver’s complaint being that the New Democrats were now engaged in the very thing they denounced when the B.C. Liberal government offered tax breaks and incentives to attract LNG investment.

“I have a litany of quotes that I will be reading during the course of the debate,” said Weaver at the outset of his remarks on Tuesday. “I had to ask my staff to pare them down because I’ve got 20 pages of quotes that I look forward to bringing in.”

Moreover, as the Green leader went on to show, in some cases the New Democrats were offering richer breaks and more incentives than the Liberals had done.

“This is a government, now, that literally hurled abuse, rhetoric, catcalled, name-called, all sorts of things for four years,” said Weaver at one point. “Now what they propose to do is take what the B.C. Liberals did to a whole new level.”

Not content with a general attack on his partners in power sharing, Weaver went after individual New Democrats in personal terms.

He quoted Energy Minister Michelle Mungall’s comments against LNG development from her days in Opposition. Then he noted that protesters in her Nelson-Creston riding were preparing to stage a “funeral” to memorialize the passing of her credibility.

“Well deserved, frankly,” said Weaver. “She has no credibility in this file.”

Next on the hit list was Agriculture Minister Lana Popham, who like Mungall was known as an environmental activist before she gained a seat at the cabinet table.

He quoted her on the LNG file circa 2016, when she faulted the Liberals for “not legislating like we’re in the most important races of our lives, the race to slow down the effects of climate change. This is not a joke.”

Now he sees Popham as part of a government engaged in a “despicable” version of “greenwashing.” He disputes the NDP claim that a massive increase in LNG production can be reconciled with targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Weaver to Popham: “Where are you now? Do you have the courage, do you have the moral fortitude to stand up for what you believe in and you said so back in 2016?”

While showing no mercy to ministers Mungall and Popham, when Weaver quoted some earlier words from NDP backbencher Doug Routley, he chose not to identify him in the usual way by naming his riding.

“I’ve become quite good friends with this member,” the Green leader explained. “I recognize that this member is probably struggling with the decision because I truly believe this member’s heart is in the right place. I’ll let you guess who this member is.”

But Weaver didn’t hold back when going after Premier John Horgan.

He quoted the NDP leader from his Opposition days, accusing the Liberals of giving away the store on LNG and covering up the details.

“If anything, we’re becoming less transparent from where we were with the B.C. Liberals,” said Weaver.

As for the alleged sellout, Weaver noted the NDP’s terms on taxes, electricity rates and carbon tax rebates were even more generous than those of the Liberals.

“The sellout on steroids,” said Weaver. “Hats off to LNG Canada negotiators. They really were dealing with a bunch of suckers, I tell you.”

The Green leader believes Horgan and crew missed the boat: “I don’t think the Premier and his party have thought this through. They haven’t reflected upon the comments they made historically and they don’t see how they apply now more than ever.”

Capping his comments was a question he put to everyone on the government side: “How do you sleep at night, knowing that you are putting before us a generational sellout that actually goes against everything you campaigned on in the last election?”

In reply, the New Democrats ignored Weaver, knowing the Greens will vote with them on confidence matters, as they have done twice in the current session.

The Greens, for their part, made two motions Tuesday and another Wednesday to try to derail the LNG legislation. Each was defeated by a massive margin, the Liberals joining the NDP in voting them down.

Much as the Liberals enjoy Weaver bashing away at the New Democrats, they recognize it as a pillow fight, and a one-sided one at that.

Weaver has no difficulty inhabiting two political worlds, the one where the New Democrats are hypocrites and generational sellouts with no credibility, the other where he votes to keep them in power.

His most useful contribution to the debate, other than documenting the NDP’s world class record of hypocrisy on the LNG file, was the airing of a letter alleging a massive giveaway on natural gas royalties in B.C.

Weaver did not name the author, saying only that he resigned earlier this year from the energy ministry.

Nor were the claims checkable within the narrow confines of legislative debate.

But the contents were sufficiently detailed to warrant further attention, if not by a legislature committee, then by the independent auditor general.

During question period on Thursday, Saskatchewan Opposition Leader Ryan Meili once again brought up the subject of yellow vest protesters attending pro-energy rallies in the province in recent weeks.

The yellow vest movement in Saskatchewan was inspired by the months-long protests in France that began in opposition to planned gas tax hikes and have evolved to target other government policies.

The NDP leader accused Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe of refusing to distance himself from the movement in Canada, despite suggestions that factions of the group have expressed anti-immigrant sentiments at rallies and online.

“The Pipeline News said the other day, the yellow vest moniker is so tainted that now no one wants anything to do with it,” Meili said.

Meili’s NDP party has refused to join several rallies in the province in recent weeks where yellow vest protesters have been present.

Earlier this month, Meili called on Moe to instruct his cabinet ministers to not attend pro-pipeline rallies if yellow vest protesters were in attendance.

The premier, however, said last week that his government condemns anti-immigrant sentiments. He said members of his cabinet who have participated in rallies with yellow vest protesters were there to oppose federal energy policies.

“We should in no way paint all of these individuals with the same brush due to a few comments by a few individuals,” he said at the time.

On Thursday, Moe responded to Meili’s questions about the yellow vest protesters.

“I have had no one else that has talked about me being affiliated with any movement Mr. Speaker outside of defending the economy, the industries, the jobs,” he said.

Another pro-pipeline rally is planned in front of the Saskatchewan legislative building next week, but posters for the event explicitly state that yellow vests are prohibited.

Meili said he’s still considering whether he’ll attend.

“We’ll look into whether I can come and say a few words, but certainly I will be looking at the details of the rally and I hope to attend,” he told reporters on Thursday.

With yellow vests banned from the upcoming rally, members from both provincial parties have expressed interest in attending the rally.

It’s all ...","VICTORIA — When is a person not a “person”? When they are a farmer, applying to remove their own land from the agriculture reserve under the NDP government’s new legislation.

It’s all there in Bill 15, tabled in the legislature earlier this month.

The New Democrats are cancelling the right of individual owners of farmland to apply to the provincial Agricultural Land Commission on their own initiative for exclusions from the reserve.

The change is not all that great in practical terms. Applications for exclusions from farmers and other owners of agricultural land have little chance of succeeding and do so only with full backing from local government.

But the NDP’s chosen language seems calculated to give offence to farmers, by denying them personhood in legal terms.

Here’s the key passage: “A person may apply to the commission to have land excluded from the agricultural land reserve if the person is the owner of the land and is the province, a First Nation government, a local government, or a public body.”

No mention that persons should also include living, breathing individuals.

At the same time the bill repeals a section in the existing Agricultural Land Commission Act that says: “An owner of land may apply to the commission to have their land excluded from the agricultural land reserve.”

So to recap, in future only governments can initiate applications to remove land from the reserve; individual owners of farmland will no longer have that option. Instead they can only proceed through local government from the outset.

Justifying the change in the name of bureaucratic efficiency is Agriculture Minister Lana Popham.

“Let me just back up and just talk about why we’ve chosen to change the process for exclusion applications,” she explained to host Gregor Craigie on CBC’s On the Island this week.

“Currently, a landowner makes out an application, gives it to local government, local government then has to pass it through to the ALC, and they can do that with either negative feedback, positive feedback, or no feedback at all.

“So these applications for exclusion can hit the ALC without any background, which creates a lot of work for the ALC. They have to go back to local government and ask them, ‘Does this work for your long-term planning?’

“So what we’re saying is if a landowner wants to have land removed from the ALR, they need to work with local government and their local government will submit an application on behalf of that landowner.”

Popham, an activist’s activist on agricultural land, also says the change will relieve a “burdensome” weight of applications to the commission, while ending the “swiss-cheesing” of the land reserve itself.

At one point in the legislature this week, she even insisted that “nothing has changed” on the matter of personhood under Bill 15.

Defending Popham on the need for the legislation is Richard Bullock, chair of the commission under the last B.C. Liberal government until he was fired five months before his term was up.

“Dismissed by the previous Liberal government for doing my job,” as Bullock, clearly a believer that revenge is a dish best eaten cold, put it in an opinion piece distributed recently to The Vancouver Sun and other news outlets.

“Some believe there is a ‘right’ to apply to exclude land from the agricultural land reserve,” wrote Bullock in reference to the ending of the option for individual landowners.

On the contrary, says the former chair: “This is not about property rights. It is about reducing speculation on agricultural land.”

During his tenure from 2010 to 2015, Bullock says he “observed that the large majority of the exclusion applications were not from farmers and ranchers but instead from folks looking to make a substantial financial gain from paving over good agricultural land.

“One-off applications are most often financially driven and have little to do with good land use planning,” he continued.

The move to confine exclusions to “a broader joint local government and commission land use planning process makes sense,” argues Bullock. “After almost 50 years of opportunity for individual landowners to make an application to remove land from the ALR, the proposed change to that process is the next logical step.”

Notwithstanding the suggestions from the current minister and the former chair, the commission has not been inundated with applications for exclusions.

Nor, for that matter, do the handful of successful applications lead to the removal of substantial amounts of farmland from the agricultural reserve.

By Popham’s own admission, there were only 39 applications for exclusions from all sources in the past year — scarcely regulatory overload for a commission with an annual budget of $5 million.

Of those applications, only a dozen were granted, leading to a mere 28 hectares of farmland being excluded out of a total agricultural base of 4.6 million. (By comparison, the Site C project entails the flooding of 5,000 hectares of agricultural land.)

On that basis, it is difficult to see why farmers should be denied the option of filing applications on their own, never mind that they would appear to have little chance of succeeding. “Not even the right to ask,” as Liberal MLA Greg Kyllo complained on social media recently.

Even less defensible is Popham’s insistence on legal language that would declare owners of farmland to be unpersons, for all the satisfaction it may give to herself and her fellow activists.

EDMONTON – The United Conservatives say Rachel Notley and the NDP need to show how they are going to pay for big-ticket spending promises they are making during the campaign for the April 16 Alberta election.

Jason Nixon, the UCP’s house leader, says Notley needs to explain which taxes she would increase to keep her promise to balance the budget by 2023.

Notley has promised new money for many projects, including more funding to hire teachers, to reduce surgical waiting lists and to cover drug costs for low- and middle-income seniors.

Nixon says the NDP has a poor track record on financial management, given that the provincial debt is projected to hit $95 billion by 2023.

Notley has said her party will soon be releasing its financial projections, which remain on track for a balanced budget in 2023.

Nixon says the NDP has no credibility since it originally said it intended to balance the books by 2017.

“Albertans will have paid $2 billion in interest on the NDP debt this fiscal year alone, which is more than 19 of 23 government departments,” Nixon told a news conference Friday.

“It is clear that the NDP are not serious about balancing the budget. This will have real consequences for Albertans. Higher debt and more interest (payments) simply means less for public services.”

Photo: BC Government Flickr.","B.C. Agriculture Minister Lana Popham has been under fire over changes that would prevent individual farmers from applying to remove land from the province’s Agricultural Land Reserve, but a former head of the Agricultural Land Commission says the government is making a needed change.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

Richard Bullock, who chaired the commission from 2010 to 2015, said the changes would send a strong message to would-be speculators of B.C.’s agricultural land.

“Some believe there is a ‘right’ to apply to exclude land from the Agricultural Land Reserve,” said a statement from Bullock. “After almost 50 years of opportunity for individual landowners to make an application to remove land from the ALR, the proposed change to that process is the next logical step.”

The ALR — intended to protect farmland, with restrictions on non-agricultural uses — includes 4.6 million hectares, almost five per cent of the province.

Earlier this month the government introduced Bill 15, the Agricultural Land Commission Amendment Act, but it has not yet been called for further debate.

“This bill really focuses on the governance of the Agricultural Land Commission and the way applications are processed,” Popham said.

The opposition has criticized how the bill defines “person” so that individual farmers aren’t included among those who can apply to have land removed from the reserve.

On Monday, BC Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson said during question period that farmers who were visiting the legislature were fed up and angry with the government.

“They need to be able to manage their lands to produce food. They’ve found that under this agriculture minister, their property rights are being seriously trampled on,” he said.

Popham responded to Wilkinson that the government is doing a lot to support farming.

“You can’t really farm if you don’t have an Agricultural Land Reserve to do it on,” she said. “We’re making sure that we’re revitalizing that reserve. We’re making it stronger than ever.”

The changes will make it more viable for farmers to make a living, she said.

Wilkinson quoted a farmer named Ben Dhiman who’d participated in a rally in Surrey, saying, “There’s been a constant attack on our way of life... and, most importantly, our rights as property owners.”

Popham said that Wilkinson and other BC Liberals had been misleading people in their constituencies.

“I understand why the Official Opposition is so upset. For 16 years, they considered the Agricultural Land Reserve a bank for development,” she said. “Well, we consider it a reserve for agriculture and food production. I’m sorry if that upsets you.”

In an interview, Popham said that the BC Liberals have used a two-week break in the legislature to “spread misinformation about the bill.”

Landowners have always had to go through a municipality if they wanted their land removed from the ALR, she said, but in some cases municipalities forward those applications to the land commission without commenting on whether or not they support the withdrawal.

The commission then has to go through an onerous process, meeting with owners and local government representatives to see if the proposal fits with official community planning, she said. About 40 of the 600 applications the commission received last year were for the removal of land from the ALR.

The change the government is making will make the process more efficient for the commission and more transparent for landowners and local governments, Popham said.

ALR Chair Told Libs: Don't Do It read more

“If the landowner wants to have an application to exclude land, they would work with local government, and local government would submit an application on their behalf after running through whether or not there’s a community benefit to doing so.”

The landowner can still correspond with the commission to express what they want to happen with their land, she said. Landowners can also still make other kinds of applications to the commission.

“It’s really about protecting the Agricultural Land Reserve,” Popham said, adding that most people who are farming don’t want to get their land out of the reserve, and the bill sends a strong message to people speculating on farmland. “We’ve tightened that up, so it’s not as easy to do.”

In his statement, Bullock said the changes would protect farmland and make it more affordable than it otherwise would be.

“As chair, I observed that the large majority of the exclusion applications were not from farmers and ranchers, but instead from folks looking to make a substantial gain from paving over good agricultural land,” he said.

“Moving to have exclusions of land from the ALR be part of a broader joint local government and commission land use planning exercise makes sense.”

People often forget the commission and local governments have already made a lot of effort to refine the ALR boundary, he said.

“This is not about property rights. It is about reducing speculation on agricultural land. As long as the ‘door is open’ to an individual or company to make an application to remove agricultural land from the ALR, speculation on these lands will continue.”

Bullock’s term as chair of the commission ended early when the BC Liberal government fired him in 2015, saying that the government was changing regulations and it was time for new leadership.

Bullock had been strongly critical of those changes.

During the fall sitting of the legislature, the BC NDP government passed legislation it said would strengthen the land reserve.

It restricted the size of homes that can be built in the ALR, reversed a decision by the former government to split the reserve into two zones with different levels of protection, and increased penalties for breaking the law.","NDP Changes Will Better Protect Agricultural Land Reserve, Says Former Commission Chair",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/03/28/NDP-Changes-Agricultural-Land-Reserve/

""I don't think we appreciate what is actually coming,"" Kate Ervine, a Saint Mary's University professor with expertise in political ecology and carbon markets.

Ervine was at the legislature Tuesday to speak in support of an NDP bill that would create an economic plan focused on green jobs.

The bill would create a 15-person task force representing a variety of sectors and communities to develop a plan to transition the province to a greener economy.

It also calls for a reduction of the province's greenhouse gas emissions to at least 50 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The province is currently 30 per cent below 2005 levels.

""The economic era of fossil fuels is rapidly yielding to a new economic era,"" said NDP Leader Gary Burrill.

Financial forecasts for the next 20 years show that $7.8 trillion will be invested in renewable energy in the United States, while a fraction of that will go toward fossil fuels, he said.

NDP Leader Gary Burrill says Nova Scotia needs to have a plan to help the province's businesses operate in a green economy. (CBC)

""Nova Scotia's economic present, our prospects, our future, depend upon our success in making this great transition.""

Part of the aim of the bill is recognizing people working in fossil fuel-related industries will eventually see fewer job prospects and will need support in terms of training and other options as they transition toward jobs more in step with a green economy.

""We can't simply tell people that change is coming and hope that they accept it,"" said Ervine.

Jobs in the technology and green sectors were the fastest growing in the country last year, she said.

""We're tapping into something that actually is happening, and it makes no sense not to do that.""

Ervine pointed to Spain, where the government is working with unions representing coal industry workers to help them transition for a time when the coal mines shut down.

Premier Stephen McNeil said the government continues to work toward further expansion of the green economy in Nova Scotia.

Efficiency Nova Scotia is expecting growth of five per cent in its GDP, he said, adding many of the agency's programs are geared toward supporting small businesses that help people reduce their carbon footprint.

""We believe not only can we do what's right for the environment, but we can also continue to grow the economy,"" said McNeil.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Goals and Sustainability Act, which governs a variety of reduction targets for the province, is due for its regularly scheduled review. Environment Minister Margaret Miller said that work is happening now and will be completed later this year.

Miller said she expects part of that work will look at the issue of green jobs.

FREDERICTON -- New Brunswick's NDP has picked a 21-year-old former candidate as its interim leader.

The party says its provincial council chose Mackenzie Thomason, a veteran of the hospitality and customer service sectors, at a meeting last weekend.

During the budget presentation in Victoria ...","British Columbian families will be forking out about $687 more to the government this year, so don’t let politicians tell you there are no new taxes.

During the budget presentation in Victoria, the NDP-Green government said we aren’t getting tax hikes this time around, delivering what many called a “nothing budget” — but that’s far from the case.

Don’t believe it? Let’s add up the bills and take a look at the total.

ICBC rates are going up this year by an average of $133 per driver for the basic rate. For a two-vehicle household, that’s an extra $266 per year. The government still hasn’t released its optional rate increase, which could be in the double digits. (The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has filed a freedom-of-information request to find out how much the optional rate increase will cost.)

The government will argue that insurance premiums aren’t a tax. In most places, they’re not. But in B.C., ICBC is a monopoly. British Columbians aren’t allowed to shop around for the best price on insurance. That makes ICBC rate hikes a lot more like taxes than premiums.

The B.C. carbon tax is being jacked up again to $40 per tonne, translating to a hike of 9.8 cents per litre of gasoline, including the GST tacked on top of the tax. If you have a two-vehicle household with a Toyota Camry and Dodge Ram and you fill up once a week, this hike to the B.C. carbon tax is going to cost your family an extra $146 per year for commuting to work, dropping the kids off at school and driving to the grocery store.

Tax-hike subtotal: For insurance on our vehicles and the carbon taxes to fill them up, our bills are going up by $412 for the year.

If this family lives in Langley and they pay the Metro Vancouver TransLink tax on gasoline, which is being hiked another 1.5 cents per litre of gasoline, that means they will pay an extra $146 per year.

Tax-hike subtotal: $558 more per year thanks to this government, and we’re not even out of the car yet.

Average households will pay an extra $21.75 on their natural gas bills thanks to this carbon tax hike, so it will cost you more to heat your home and cook your meals.

Tax-hike subtotal for driving, heating and eating in B.C.: $579.75.

The carbon tax and ICBC aren’t the only tax and rate hikes this year. The Employer Health Tax, EHT, has kicked in, on top of the Medical Services Premium. Most job creators with a payroll of more than $500,000 per year need to pay this new tax. The City of Vancouver is jacking up property taxes by 4.5 per cent in 2019, with an average increase of $108 per year per household, largely because of the EHT also hitting municipalities.

For many employers in B.C., the EHT is a quadruple tax kick.

The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has spoken with small-business people who are getting hit hard. First, they already pay the MSP. Second, they are being forced to pay the new EHT. Third, since municipalities need to pay the EHT, that means the job creator’s business location is getting a property tax hike. And fourth, business owners also face a personal property tax hike on their homes. That’s getting taxed four ways from Sunday for the sin of employing people in this province.

All told, this year’s tax increases will cost your household an average of $687 more.

When provincial politicians tell you that they aren’t costing you more this year, do the math and hold on to your wallet, because their promise is as good as a three-dollar bill.

The next step is a formal vetting process by a green-light committee, which could take more than a week to complete.

Rene Ephestion, leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Multicultural Inclusion Commission, has also expressed his interest in seeking the leadership. He could not be reached for comment.

A leadership convention has been scheduled for June 21-22 in Saint John.

Vickers issued a statement Friday saying he is looking forward to speaking with Liberals “about a new path forward.”

He has drafted a five-point plan that calls for growing the province’s economy and population, improving health care, “transforming” education, ensuring environmental protection and making sure provincial finances are well managed.

His statement also took a shot at the governing Conservative party.

“With this year’s provincial budget, we saw the finance minister raise his hands in despair against the economic and demographic headwinds that New Brunswick faces,” Vickers said.

“We’ve also seen no provincial action on climate change, despite the fact that we’re a year removed from record flooding in key parts of the province.”

He is hoping to replace former premier Brian Gallant, who lost power last fall after the Liberals failed to form a minority government in the weeks following the Sept. 24 provincial election.

The party’s executive director, Keiller Zed, said the leadership race is getting the party revved up.

Still, Canadians aren’t so much embracing the Conservatives but instead deserting the Liberal party in droves, according to a new Angus Reid Institute poll.

Andrew Scheer and his Conservatives are picking up some votes from disenchanted Justin Trudeau Liberal supporters, according to a new poll. ( Sean Kilpatrick )

That’s a benefit to other parties — including the New Democrats, Green Party and the newly-minted People’s Party of Canada — who are seeing their fortunes rise as the governing party falls out of public favour. “The Liberals are just seeing quicksand. The floor is no longer stable,” said Shachi Kurl, Angus Reid executive director. “Trudeaumania was very, very real but Canadian voters are no longer feeling very manic.” In 2015, “Trudeaumania” convinced first-time voters, youth and non-regular voters to come out and cast a ballot. But it’s unclear whether the party will be able to retain that youth base this time around.

Kurl pointed to Pierre Trudeau’s rise to power in the late 1960s noting he enjoyed “Trudeaumania” before ending his last term as prime minister in 1984 as a polarizing politician. And if an election were held tomorrow, it is unlikely the Liberals would hold onto a majority: Fewer than 60 per cent of 2015 Liberals would vote for the party again. In contrast, the Conservatives are holding 90 per cent of their 2015 base. Levels of Conservative support remain essentially unchanged from last month — where they captured 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote. Noting the Liberal Party’s relatively low retention of 2015 supporters, Kurl said it’s interesting to see where those voters are going. As the party bleeds votes, one in eight 2015 Liberals say they would support the Conservatives; one in 10 say the same of the NDP. Kurl added a handful have drifted to the Greens, while a significant portion remain undecided. Demographics are a huge driver of partisanship: Men and older Canadians slant Conservative, while women and younger voters stick with the Liberals or other left-of-centre parties.

Meanwhile, nearly half of all Canadians said they “strongly disapprove” of Trudeau in comparison to less than 10 per cent who “strongly approve.” “We’ve seen those stratospheric approval numbers that were in the 60s come down to the 30s over the last three years,” Kurl said. “Trudeau’s personal star is dimming. Not just the campaign, the party, the government, an entire international brand is built around a single person.”

Article Continued Below

That’s where the Liberals are running into “massive” trouble across the country, she added. Now, Canadians have a more favourable view of Scheer (44 per cent) and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh (39 per cent) than Trudeau (36 per cent). And while the Liberals lead by a wide margin in the city of Toronto, they are neck-and-neck with the NDP in the city of Vancouver, and trailing in the rest of B.C. and Ontario. In B.C. — where the NDP and Greens support is strongest — Scheer’s Conservatives hold a wide lead over the Liberals. The survey noted this likely helped to split left-of-centre respondents. Meanwhile, the Conservative party is leading by wide margins in Prairie provinces and by smaller four-point margins in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Quebec, the one outlier, is seeing a four-way split in support between the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and Greens. Still, a lot can change during election campaigns. For instance, in 2015, each of the three main parties held the lead in Angus Reid Institute polling between the time the writ dropped and election day. Kurl said there is enough time and space for the Liberals to bounce back and coalesce the left-of-centre vote. And it doesn’t mean that Trudeau should step down, she argued. Instead, it would require a pivot to focus less on the man and instead, more on the party, its policies and mission. “We’ve seen leaders do this in the past,” Kurl said, pointing to Jean Chretien’s 1993 campaign which was fraught with leadership critiques. “So what did the Liberal party do? They effectively built a team. It wasn’t Team Chrétien, it was Team Liberal.” Kurl said Trudeau can do the same thing. But, there isn’t evidence of that — yet. “The vote bleed, where it is going, and just how devastating it is for the Liberals today as people abandon the party based on a visceral reaction to Justin Trudeau says to me that the Liberals maybe need to take the weekend and go have a very deep think about what’s next,” Kurl said. Poll results were based on an online survey conducted from March 11-25 among a randomized sample of 5,807 Canadian adults who are members of the Angus Reid Forum. It carried a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

If Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott’s motives were pure, they would be following her lead. It makes no sense to claim non-confidence in the government and stay in caucus. Caucus is the legislative branch of government, empowered to act on cabinet’s executive direction. Cabinet and caucus go hand in hand. You can’t have one without the other.

A caucus is a place where members speak freely without fear of public broadcast or leaks. Trust is an important part of building political confidence. Opposing view: Should dissident Liberals stay in caucus? Yes Neither former minister trusts Trudeau, and the feeling is mutual. I have received dozens of communications from Liberal caucus members who do not feel comfortable speaking freely in the presence of two members engaged in derailing their leader. In every profession, people work with colleagues whom they may not like. Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and his finance minister, Paul Martin, were not exactly bosom buddies. But together they produced results. But not being friends, and working actively to dislodge your leader, are two different things.

The Big Debate

Philpott claims there is more to come. Their ongoing whisper campaign is strengthened by their presence inside the Liberal tent. Once departed, the bleeding would be cauterized very quickly. Canadian Liberal parliamentarians could learn from long-serving American politician Mo Udall. The self-described one-eyed Mormon Democrat from Conservative Iowa once said, “When the Democratic Party forms a firing squad, we form a circle.”

Article Continued Below

The firing squad facing Justin Trudeau is just such a circle. The leaks did not come from the opposition. Nor did they stop with an unprecedented invitation to speak to cabinet and more than four hours of justice committee testimony. When is enough, enough? Both women want this issue in the headlines, but refuse to avail themselves of their right to speak in Parliament, protected by privilege. If they stayed, it wouldn’t be the first time enemies worked together. But participating in caucus involves speaking and listening, something that Wilson-Raybould does not appear to embrace. THE BIG DEBATE: For more opposing view columns from Toronto Star contributors, click here. A former Vancouver riding president said they parted company because of her unbridled resistance to listen to anyone. During her parliamentary committee testimony, Wilson-Raybould produced copious notes from assistants. But she could not name a single colleague with whom she had consulted on the deferred prosecution agreement question. The self-described truth teller did not tell the whole truth about her cabinet move to veterans affairs. The prime minister asked her to lead the dissolution of the Indian Act as minister of Indigenous services, an offer she conveniently omitted from her lengthy testimony. The offer was subsequently compared to having Nelson Mandela administer apartheid. She is no Nelson Mandela. He embraced the challenge to dismantle apartheid. She spurned it. Philpott’s explosive Maclean’s interview also confirmed that Wilson-Raybould did not complain to the prime minister about undue pressure. So what is the end game? Just last week, Wilson-Raybould penned a 684-word letter to constituents. She confirmed that she “currently” plans to run for the Liberals in the next election. This bizarre descriptor was the only Liberal mention made, even though the letter was supposed to explain her decision to stay. Wilson-Raybould went to great lengths to explain how she was so different from other self-serving politicians who came before her, writing “I found myself in a situation I never expected to be in. I was just doing my job, and I did not expect it to become a national focus.” That statement is a blatant lie as personal details leaked to the Globe and Mail could only have come, directly or indirectly, from her. Philpott and Wilson-Raybould refuse to leave the caucus. Instead, from the inside, they co-ordinate a full court assault on the leader. Another Udall aphorism outlines the difference between a cactus and a caucus. “On a cactus, the pricks are on the outside.” This caucus must be pruned.

308,Business,2019-03-30T14:11:00.0000000Z,Liberal Finance Minister Bill Morneau ... Data from Mortgage Professionals Canada would suggest that as many as 18 percent of Canadian homeowners could now be trapped with the current lender ...,"Tom Kmiec, Special to the Sun

Across the country, an entire swath of young Canadians are being consigned to a life of renting — their homeownership aspirations tempered in the wake of a series of policy failures by the Ottawa Liberals.

​

The Liberal government rode to power in 2015 on a promise to champion the middle-class and those working hard to join it. Yet Canadians have seen a series of stealth policy moves from this government that have made one of the single biggest determinants of middle-class status — homeownership — unaffordable for an entire generation of Canadians.

Foremost is the introduction of the mandatory two percent mortgage stress test in January 2018, which means that Canadians buying a home need to prove that they can afford mortgage payments based on the higher of the five-year benchmark rate or their contract mortgage rate, plus two percentage points. The policy was supposedly introduced to protect Canada’s major banks and prevent households from taking on excessive debts. At least that’s what the federal bank regulator has said. Liberal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, as well as several Liberal backbench MPs, have instead suggested that the stress test was not about economic safeguards, but instead has the desired effect of reducing real estate prices in major urban centres like Toronto and Vancouver.

Despite the best of intentions, it’s clear that these new mortgage rules have stymied a national housing market in recovery, robbed young families of the ability to step into their first home and spun the wheel of fortune in favour of wealthy cash buyers and leveraged investment funds. Mortgage Professionals Canada has estimated that 100,000 Canadians have been prevented from buying a home due to the stress test and that 18 percent of prospective buyers, who could currently afford their preferred home, would fail the stress test. Recent data from the Bank of Canada data shows that mortgage growth has hit a 17-year-low in Canada with more and more middle-class buyers being priced out of the market.

While young Canadians and first-time home buyers are most acutely impacted by this punishing new stress test, the losers include pretty much everybody. As the Liberal changes continue to suppress the market, Canadians will see their positive equity eroded or their negative equity increased. What’s more, the economic slump spurred by the stress test is estimated to cost Canada about 200,000 jobs over the next three years.

The winners of the Liberals’ stress test are the big banks. A family whose mortgage comes due for refinancing can only renew with their current lender if they fail the stress test. Data from Mortgage Professionals Canada would suggest that as many as 18 percent of Canadian homeowners could now be trapped with the current lender who, aware of their clients’ vulnerability, will surely go to no great lengths to offer them the best rate.

Ottawa has also dealt a blow to Canadian homeowners by unnecessarily increasing mortgage insurance premiums through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) — a federal Crown corporation that insures lenders against losses from mortgage loans.

The Liberals increased CMHC mortgage insurance premiums in 2017, despite the fact that the government-run corporation had been posting sizable profits in recent years. Shortly after the Liberals hiked insurance premiums on homeowners, (CMHC) was instructed to pay a special dividend of $5.6 billion to the federal government for the first time ever. Prior to last year, the CMHC never paid the federal government any dividends or profits; the premiums that they charged were always used to capitalize the insurer in the event of a major loss scenario, such as a recession.

The Liberals’ use of heavy-handed one-size-fits-all regulatory tools has swung the pendulum to the opposite side, curtailing growth and actually fostering instability in what was a recovering housing market — particularly markets outside of the major urban centres.

A series of missteps and failures on the part of the Ottawa Liberals have restricted the real estate market to make it significantly harder for first-time buyers and those wishing to move homes. Without the Liberals’ tinkering, Canada would likely be seeing a healthy cohort of young first-time buyers entering into homes, facilitating their transition into the middle-class while also contributing to their personal savings over the long term. Instead, more and more young Canadians are consigned largely to renting, and increasingly, at prices higher than the cost of servicing a mortgage.

He dragged along Bernadette Jordan, the minister of rural economic development, in order to give the Nova Scotian a little positive press instead of having to hear the vitriol being hurled around Ottawa over the Lavscam scandal.

And, it conveniently got Justin Trudeau the hell out of Dodge, too, although he did make a fool of himself the night before when he yelled out, “Thank you for your donation” to a fundraiser crasher in Toronto who was protesting the decades of mercury poisoning at the Grassy Narrows First Nations reserve.

But we have grown to expect such arrogant flippancy from our leader.

The Trudeau Liberals are desperately trying to turn the page on the SNC-Lavalin cockup, of course — the cabinet resignations of marquee players like Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, the abrupt “retirement” of Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, as well as Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts martyring himself in an attempt to save Trudeau from his sorry self — and move on to discuss, or at least remember, that there was a budget recently tabled.

There were approximately 400 pages in that budget, if memory serves, so it is not something to just toss in the recycling bin with a thud, walk away, and then forget that it ever existed.

There’s supposedly very important stuff in that document, the kind of stuff the Trudeau Liberals would love to ride to victory in October’s election if that pesky two-month-old Lavscam controversy would simply dry up.

But it’s hanging on like a bad rash.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, the blue-chip Bay St. chap who tabled that budget, and who has been out in the hustings promoting how the Liberals are fighting for the middle class “and those who want to join it,” started the week on Global TV’s The West Block, defending himself to host Mercedes Stephenson from assaults coming from the big shots in business that he “failed to address the fundamental issues” facing Canadian companies.

It was the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, after all, and not some backwater organizational rube, that accused him of not doing enough to help businesses become more globally competitive.

“I don’t agree with them at all,” said Morneau, stating there were measures in the budget that propose to make it a lot easier for Canadian companies to attract and train the employees who will ultimately enhance their bottom lines.

The key word, of course, is “propose.”

If the Trudeau Liberals are not re-elected, well, it all dies on the vine, including the pharmacare measures that will supposedly assist geezers like me as we make our way towards the inevitability of eternal rest.

In between pitching the positives in his budget, Morneau attended a $500-a-plate fundraiser in Edmonton to support the local Liberal riding association, as other highfalutin Liberals fanned out across the country to trumpet the budget.

Like Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor; Employment Minister Patty Hajdu; Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau; Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos; Treasury Board President Joyce Murray; Seniors Minister Filomena Tassi in Nanaimo; and Public Services Minister Carla Qualtrough.

That’s a lot of Liberals trying to turn the page.

But, then again, their political lives depend on it.

CBC News has learned that MPs will discuss expelling the two women when they return to Parliament from their ridings next week.

Some MPs who don't want to be identified say that if the matter of the two MPs' caucus status isn't on Wednesday's caucus agenda, they'll stand up at the meeting and ask their colleagues to vote on ejecting Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

Liberal MPs from all regions of the country tell CBC News they feel the two former cabinet ministers can't stay.

""I've come to the conclusion that they both have lost any right to be a part of this team,"" Quebec MP Alexandra Mendès wrote in an email. She said serving in a party caucus requires ""loyalty and team spirit.""

Many caucus members who once said they thought Wilson-Raybould and Philpott could remain now say they don't understand how they can continue to identify as members of the Liberal Party given the damage done to the government by the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Trudeau punts on question of caucus status

At an event in Halifax yesterday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked if he thinks the two MPs should be permitted to stay.

""As for what Dr. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould intend to do as next steps, people are going to have to ask them,"" he replied.

CBC sent emails to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott; so far, neither has responded.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking an agreement that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4, saying she had lost ""confidence"" in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

Other senior Liberals have suggested that while the caucus is inclined to expel them, they feel the better option would be for Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to leave of their own accord, as did Whitby, Ont. MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes. She quit the Liberal caucus March 20 to sit as an independent.

Some Liberal MPs aren't ready to say one way or the other.

""Both of them have been great colleagues and, you know, we'll see how that evolves. But again, decision's not going to be mine. I'll be, of course, part of the caucus, but we'll just wait and see how things evolve from here,"" said New Brunswick MP Pat Finnigan.

'It would be a mistake to expel them' — MP Wayne Long

""I mean, any member who wants to stay part of the caucus has to say that they support the prime minister and, obviously, they support the Liberal agenda. We all got elected under the Liberal Party of Canada. I mean, I'll leave that question up to Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, whether or not they want to remain part of the caucus,"" said Ontario MP Francis Drouin.

Some caucus members say they still think the two MPs should be permitted to remain.

""I strongly believe that our caucus is made stronger by the continued presence of Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott within it, and that it would be a mistake to expel them from caucus,"" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long said in an email.

""I'm proud to be a member of a caucus in which members who share the same set of progressive values are free to express their views, and those of their constituents, on the issues that matter to them, even when they disagree with our leader or the majority of caucus members on those issues.""

A decision on expulsion could come as early as next Wednesday.","Pressure building in Liberal caucus to eject Wilson-Raybould, Philpott",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-philpott-snc-lavalin-trudeau-1.5076998

On Monday evening, hours after Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn D. Joyal got dragged into the mess for no good reason — pending further excavations — she finally hit rock bottom.

Joyal is a highly respected jurist who had been shortlisted by a non-partisan committee for appointment to the Supreme Court. But in Copps’ telling he is “homophonic (sic), anti-abortion (and) anti-Charter” — and former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, for some crazy reason, wanted to make him Chief Justice.

To the extent that’s based on anything, it’s on accounts by anonymous sources to CTV News and Canadian Press alleging Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau very much disagreed on the appointment.

Former AG decries release of CONFIDENTIAL (her caps) discussions re. Trudeau’s refusal to support her recommendation of a homophonic, anti-abortion, anti-Charter Chief Justice. Who released CONFIDENTIAL details of her discussion with the PM 7 weeks ago? — Hon. Sheila Copps (@Sheila_Copps) March 26, 2019

Well, I say “alleging.” It’s not actually controversial: No one disputes the appointment was ultimately the PM’s to make, or that the justice minister was allowed to have her opinions. No, this is just sort of an FYI leak. People thought we should know that Wilson-Raybould supported a Supreme Court candidate whom Trudeau worried (per CTV correspondent Glen McGregor) “wasn’t committed to protecting rights that have flown out of interpretation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly LGBTQ2 rights and even abortion access.”

“Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of ‘significant disagreement’ with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as ‘the party of the Charter’,” Joan Bryden reported for CP. “Internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment … are typically considered highly confidential,” Bryden added. But, you know, Anonymous Sources just thought we should know Trudeau had done his research, and had come across a speech Joyal gave to the Canadian Constitution Foundation in 2017.

In that speech, he soberly explains his entirely mainstream concerns that Canadian courts have over the years progressively asserted a policy-making dominance over the legislatures that the Charter’s framers had never intended, and with some deleterious effects to the country’s “political culture.” Perhaps Trudeau might also have come across Joyal’s 1993 Master’s thesis from the University of Manitoba, in which he makes similar arguments and analyzes R v. Morgentaler, among other cases.

“Irrespective of one’s position on the excessively difficult substantive issue, abortion like capital punishment was undeniably one of the two subjects mentioned in the discussion before the Parliamentary committee about which it was assured that such substantive outcomes would be left to Parliament,” he wrote in his thesis. If stakeholders had known what Charter cases would look like in 35 years, in other words, we might not even have the Charter.

Joyal doesn’t ever seem to have articulated a personal position on abortion. I can’t find a word he’s said about same-sex marriage in any context. To imply such a person is unfit for the bench is outrageous. To impute from his analysis of R v. Morgentaler that he’s anti-abortion and homophobic is almost parodic demagoguery. It makes “Why do you hate the troops?” look like something out of Plato’s Republic. As for “anti-Charter”: “Put simply,” Joyal told the CCF, “as a foundational part of Canada’s constitutional architecture, the Charter deserves our respect and demands our compliance.”

Many Canadians seem to truly believe that Margaret Atwood’s Gilead is but one misplaced ballot and one moderately conservative judge away

This is all a brand new low for the Anonymous Sources. But it’s entirely typically Liberal thinking, as well: “Joyal has concerns about judicial overreach. Therefore he is a conservative. Conservatives hate abortion and gay people. Ergo Joyal applied to sit on the Supreme Court in hopes of repealing R v. Morgentaler and the same-sex marriage reference and goodness only knows what else. QED.

“So obvious and appalling is this, furthermore, that we must suspect Jody Wilson-Raybould of holding similar hidden aspirations — or at the very least of woeful incompetence.”

After 10 years of Stephen Harper doing nothing on abortion, and with Andrew Scheer understandably pledging to continue doing nothing, many Canadians seem to truly believe that Margaret Atwood’s Gilead is but one misplaced ballot and one moderately conservative judge away. Three-quarters of Canadians now think it’s “great that … two people of the same sex can get married,” according to a 2017 CROP poll — up from just 41 per cent 20 years earlier. No one is challenging same-sex marriage in court. No prominent Conservative politician has made a peep about it in at least a decade. But the Anonymous Sources want us to believe the Chief Justice of Manitoba poses a mortal threat to marriage equality.

Incidentally, one of the deleterious effects of Canadians becoming so used to “judicial adjudication of political and social issues,” Joyal argued in his CCF speech, is that there is “less room for long-term legislative results and solutions premised upon the tools of negotiation, persuasion, bargaining and compromise.” Whatever the disease, the symptoms are acute. Ideally, the utter shabbiness of the Liberals’ behaviour since the Lavalin story broke might help wake us from this never-ending paranoid fever dream that passes for election-year politics.

The Liberal majority on the committee voted down a motion backed by Conservatives and New Democrats that would have seen former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott testify about the controversy.

“The coverup continues,” Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre said after the meeting ended.

Wilson-Raybould told the justice House of Commons justice committee last month that she was pressured by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior advisers and senior ad visors to the finance minister, to overrule the decision by the director of public prosecutions not to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin rather than proceed to a criminal trial on fraud charges.

She believes she was shuffled out of justice in January because she wouldn’t change her mind.

Trudeau has denied anything improper occurred but has been unable to change the channel from the saga that has badly hurt his public image. He said the whole thing boils down to a breakdown in trust between him, his aides and Wilson-Raybould.

During the almost two-hour-long meeting Tuesday, Conservatives and New Democrats urged their Liberal colleagues to put partisan issues aside and agree to have the ethics committee take on the probe after the Liberals ended the justice committee’s investigation last week.

Liberal MP Nathaniel Ermine-Smith, who voted in favour of an NDP motion in February to hold a public inquiry on the matter, said at the ethics committee Tuesday a new probe may only result in relitigating what has already been said at the unless the two former cabinet ministers were granted wider waivers to testify on the issue.

Trudeau has not indicated any willingness to do that saying the waivers were already unprecedented and allowed for the facts relevant to the matter at hand to be made public.

The justice committee heard from 10 witnesses over five meetings but opposition parties say Wilson-Raybould named 11 people who she felt crossed the line and all of them should be asked to testify. Only two of those people were among the witnesses the justice committee did hear from.

Trudeau faced renewed questions about the controversy during a morning event in Winnipeg where he was trying to promote his government’s budget introduced one week ago. He would not, however, say whether he rejected Wilson-Raybould’s 2017 recommendation for chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Sources told The Canadian Press that Trudeau turned down Wilson-Raybould’s recommendation that Glenn Joyal be elevated from chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench to chief justice of the Supreme Court over Joyal’s views on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Shortly after Trudeau told Wilson-Raybould he did not support her choice, the sources said Joyal withdrew his name from consideration.

In a statement Monday, Joyal said he submitted an application for consideration for the Supreme Court in 2017, only to be forced to withdraw his name for personal reasons related to his wife’s health.

Instead, Trudeau appointed Sheila Martin to the high court and named Richard Wagner as chief justice. Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper appointed Wagner to the high court.

Trudeau said Tuesday he would not discuss the matter nor would he say whether his office was involved in the leak of what is usually a highly confidential appointments process.

Trudeau said it is the prime minister’s choice of who to nominate for the Supreme Court, as well as for chief justice, and that Canadians can and should continue to have faith in their judicial system.

Speaking at the ethics committee meeting, Kent said the breach of a highly confidential judicial appointment process would warrant a parliamentary investigation on its own. He also said the story could compromise the integrity of the appointment process, and possibly some sitting justices.",Liberals deny second committee request to investigate alleged political interference in SNC-Lavalin case,Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/national/trudeau-stays-mum-on-clash-with-wilson-raybould-over-high-court-pick-info-leak

The annual exhibit, held in the sprawling Sands Expo Centre on the outskirts of the city’s downtown casinos, is limited to representatives from armed forces, police services, tactical police units, the gun industry and related associations. It is not an event open to the general public, and no one under age 16 is allowed in.

The annual event is put on each year by the U.S. National Shooting Sports Foundation — a lobbying arm for the U.S. Firearms Industry Trade Association. The industry generates $13.6 billion annually manufacturing small arms and ammunition in the U.S. and another $3.1 billion at the retail end.

Attendance to the Vegas trade show has grown to more than 62,000 from around the world. The events website totals over 500 suppliers, with more than 1,600 exhibitors.

Under the rules of procedure for government responses to the order paper questions from MPs, all departments had to submit responses to the question under Doherty’s name.

Only three departments or services responded that employees had attended the mammoth Jan. 22 to 25 exhibit — the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The amount spent by all three branches on flights, accommodation, meals and other costs totalled $158,431, with the DND contingent accounting for the lion’s share of the expenses, reporting $130,961 in costs. An RCMP troop of three Mounties who attended submitted expenses totalling $10,992 while expenses for five CBSA agents who also attended came to $16,478.

Doherty did not respond to a request for an interview for this story. His office connected iPolitics with Mathew Clancy, a press secretary for the Conservative shadow cabinet in the House of Commons. Clancy, by email, responded on behalf of Quebec MP Pierre Paul-Hus, the party’s critic for public safety.

“It is unacceptable that Justin Trudeau’s government sent dozens of public servants and spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayers’ dollars to attend a conference in Las Vegas,” Clancy’s email said. “This is yet again another example of Justin Trudeau’s lack of respect for Canadian taxpayer dollars,” Clancy quoted Paul-Hus as saying.

Word that the government agencies assigned personnel to the show spread quickly. Doherty, or a member of the Conservative caucus research bureau on his behalf, tabled the written question about government expenditures for the show on Jan. 29 — the first Commons sitting day after the show ended.

There were at least two other Canadians related to the arms industry who also attended the arms bazaar: Rod Giltaca, founder and head of the fledgling Canadian Coalition for Firearms Rights and a qualified firearms licence instructor, and Alison de Groot, managing director of the Canadian Sporting Arms and Ammunition Association.

The coalition has been strongly opposed to controversial Liberal gun-control legislation, Bill C-71, while the sporting arms group has advocated for firearm businesses and retailers as the bill has made its way through Parliament.

All three government branches responded to Doherty’s request for department rationale for sending personnel to the event.

The RCMP response explained that federal cabinet and Treasury Board had approved ongoing funding for the annual RCMP attendance at the trade show in 2005. The response did not mention it, but a Liberal government was in place at the time.

Two of the Mounties who participated are with the RCMP Specialized Firearms Support Services Unit, which the response described as the “policy centre” for national firearm classification in Canada.

The unit is responsible for development and maintenance of the Firearms Reference Table, a national database accessible only to licensed firearm businesses and firearm officers. The response describes the database as the “most comprehensive, single-source firearms reference in existence” and said it is used by law enforcement and other agencies in 190 countries via Interpol.

The other participant in the Mountie contingent was the senior armourer and technical authority for the RCMP’s National Armoury Program, which approves all firearms and accessories procured by the national police force.

The Canada Border Services Agency said its agents focused on knowledge of trends, innovations and health and safety regulations, as well as shooting range design, development and maintenance. The CBSA is still monitoring and reviewing the use of sidearms by its agents at borders, in a program that began in 2006.

By publication time, the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces had not yet responded to questions about its contingent, but pointed to the rationale the department explained in its response to Doherty’s question.

“These employees attended the event to improve corporate knowledge of innovation within the industries of small arms, ammunition and accessories for law enforcement and military applications, and to meet with different vendors,” the department’s House of Commons response said.

The department later provided a lengthy explanation of personnel work at the exhibit.

The Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces contingent included staff from the department’s science and technology branch, the assistant deputy minister of materiel branch, the Canadian Army and the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command.

The group included members of a coalition project involving Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States that is developing a new-generation digital night vision goggle. A senior technician from the same branch attended to view new technology involving day and night vision rifle scopes.

Another member came from the Canadian Army Infantry School Sniper cell, while members of a Force Development team responsible for next generation weapons, ammunition and optic systems also attended.

“While no purchases were made directly as a result of attending the SHOT Show, attendance at these types of events helps to ensure that the CAF remains a first-class military, ready to face the challenges of the 21st century by helping to identify and target the requirements of the CAF,” said media liaison officer Daniel Lebouthillier.",Tories blame Liberals for federal spending on Las Vegas arms show,iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/03/26/tories-blame-liberals-for-federal-spending-on-las-vegas-arms-show/

New evidence from former attorney general Jody Wilson ...","A former director of the Federal Liberal Agency of Canada is adding his voice to the Conservatives' call for a public inquiry into SNC-Lavalin.

Bert Paul, a long-time Liberal, says a non-partisan inquiry that includes testimony under oath is the only way to find out what happened.

""I believe Canadians should know the truth,"" Paul said in an interview with CTV News Vancouver's Mi-Jung Lee this week.

Developing story: New evidence released Friday

Paul served as the chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency, the chief agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

The party has been under the microscope for weeks after allegations surfaced suggesting political influence in a corruption and fraud case against the Montreal-based engineering and construction company.

There are already two investigations into the affair, being conducted by the justice committee and the federal ethics commissioner.

But Paul feels there should be a third, non-partisan review of what exactly occurred.

""It would be done independent of the parliamentary system,"" he said.

""It would have powers associated with the ability to subpoena, so they could request information, they could request documentation. They could also require individuals to come and to give testimony so that Canadians can find out what the facts are.""

The allegations of obstruction of justice are serious, he said, and should be dealt with before the federal election.

When asked how he thought the scandal was being handled by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Paul said most Canadians find it perplexing.

""The question is, what did he know and when did he know it? I think Canadians are frustrated, as am I, because I believe we have not had a full and independent investigation of the issues, and I think we owe it to the Canadian public to do that,"" he said.

New evidence from former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould regarding SNC-Lavalin is set to be made public Friday.

Additional documents include copies of emails and text messages as well as a new written statement, which Wilson-Raybould is providing to supplement testimony she gave one month ago. Read a recap of that testimony on CTVNews.ca.

Paul also spoke out against recent leaks about the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, calling them an attempt to undermine Wilson-Raybould's credibility.

Economists, think-tanks and credit rating agencies all warn that the prime minister’s big spending could spell trouble for the economy. And in a swipe at Trudeau, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer says balancing the budget would be a top priority under a Conservative government.

But the big question is, do people really care about deficits? Do voters reward deficit hawks and punish free-spenders? Polling on the issue is a mixed bag, and the better gauge may be how people actually vote when faced the choice, such as in the recent Quebec election.

The topic, which could be a ballot box issue in the fall, took centre-stage after the Liberal government unveiled a budget that projects more deficits in a year the books were supposed to be balanced. Criticism flowed, along with warnings of potential economic disruption. The trouble is, despite such warnings in recent times, governments of all shades continued to ring in deficits — and win elections. Which leaves open the question of whether people are as concerned about deficits as some might think.

True, there was a time, particularly in the 1990s, when slaying the deficit was a national obsession. With the Ontario and federal governments facing record deficits and on the brink of economic meltdown, most people accepted deep and often painful spending cuts to rein in bulging deficits and soaring debt.

Jean Chretien’s Liberal government led the way, balancing the budget in 1997-98 and leaving a string of surpluses. Conservative Mike Harris also balanced the Ontario budget in 1999 and was rewarded with re-election. That was the golden decade of deficit-busting.

By the 2000s, however, the war on deficits appeared to lose steam.

Harris’s successor, Ernie Eves, recorded a deficit, and Liberal Dalton McGuinty who followed in 2003, ran more deficits than surpluses. Federally, Stephen Harper’s decade-long record was mixed.

Harper balanced the budget on occasion, but recorded several deficits. For both Harper and McGuinty, the 2008 global financial crisis may have been a factor, but importantly by that time, people appeared to have soured on austerity.

The governments of the day understood the changing mood, and the spending trend continued.

Ontario voters soundly rejected Conservative leader Tim Hudak’s plan for big spending cuts to balance the budget in the 2014 election. Liberal Kathleen Wynne, whose platform included significant spending, won.

Perhaps the most telling example of the shift in public mood was last October’s Quebec election. Premier Philippe Couillard inherited a deficit and chose to focus on its elimination in short order, slashing services, including education and health care.

He succeeded but Quebeckers were not amused. Instead of kudos for the man who slew the dragon, they sent him packing. Ironically, the new Coalition Avenir Québec government is splashing out on services with surpluses left behind by Couillard.

Next in line is Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a deficit hawk, whose budget comes down April 11.

Interestingly, the shift in the public mood is happening not just in Canada. Even in the United States, where cutting spending and deficits was religion to Republicans, President Donald Trump has been racking up deficits. The U.S. deficit is set to top $1 trillion this year, and Republicans just shrug their shoulders.

Reneging on his promise to balance the budget this year, and instead splashing billions on services, Trudeau is gambling that program spending will trump deficit reduction in the eyes of Canadians.

Scheer has taken the opposite view and when voters speak in a few months, we’ll know who got it right. Of course, the public mood can change quickly to Trudeau’s disadvantage if the economy tanks. Deficits don’t really matter to New Democrats, who want even more spending. But as the Conservatives digest the Liberal budget and plot election strategy, they may do well to reconsider deficit-slaying as the centrepiece of their campaign. The sand has shifted on the issue and on recent evidence, an arm-to-arm combat on the deficit with Liberals could be risky.

Deficit busters, beware.

Canadian activists want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to pass what the activists see as mainly timid reforms in Bill C-71 and then move to more ...,"In the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks and New Zealand’s rapid legislative response, Canadian gun control advocates are increasing their efforts to get Ottawa to follow suit.

“The government of New Zealand has swiftly and responsibly responded to the atrocities…by almost immediately committing to ban the type of weapons that facilitate such extreme violence,” Natalie Provost told CBC News.

Provost is a survivor of the 1989 gun massacre at École Polytechnique in Montreal in which 14 women were shot and killed.

Provost’s view was echoed by Heidi Rathjen, a coordinator with the gun control group PolySeSouvient, in a CBC interview.

“The huge difference is that New Zealand is acting and Canada is not–and yet we have a government that promised to get handguns and assault weapons off our streets,” Rathjen said.

“The Liberals are so terrified of this. The public is in favour of a ban but they’re terrified of the gun lobby, which is extremely active and threatening in terms of elections and votes.”

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, moved quickly following the mosque attacks, issuing a cabinet order that bans people in her country from owning semi-automatic firearms and semi-automatic firearms capable of use with a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds.

She is also moving to a ban on gun accessories like bump stocks that enable a firearm to discharge ammunition faster.

Firearms commonly used by farmers and hunters, such as rifles with small, non-detachable magazines–will be permitted.

Canadian activists want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to pass what the activists see as mainly timid reforms in Bill C-71 and then move to more controversial changes, such as a handgun ban.

Possession of fully automatic firearms is prohibited in Canada, any would-be gun owner must submit to a background check and Canadians must register restricted firearms, including handguns, with police.

Last week’s federal budget revealed the Trudeau government’s plan to move forward on national pharmacare.

The problem, however, is that the government still hasn’t outlined exactly what it means by “national pharmacare” or why it thinks middle-class and wealthy Canadians need it. Essentially, these are marching orders to an unknown destination.

Let’s be clear. Recent studies repeatedly indicate that some Canadians (8%, 11% or 23% depending on the data source) have difficulty paying for the prescription drugs they need. If there were ever a role for policymakers, it would be to clearly identify and help these Canadians.

Unfortunately, Tuesday’s budget seems to indicate a vague and likely inefficient approach that may not even help those Canadians in greatest need.

Take, for example, the proposed creation of the Canadian Drug Agency (CDA), which would assess the effectiveness of prescription drugs and negotiate better prices on behalf of insurers. This may sound like good news, but agencies such as the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health already exist for these purposes.

And yet, this government has committed $35 million over four years to establish a “transition office” to help create this new bureaucracy. That’s right — taxpayers will spend $35 million to create an agency (the transition office) to help create a new agency in the future (the CDA) to do work that’s already being done by other agencies. While some may argue for this type of amalgamation, this seems like a very expensive game of musical chairs.

When finally created, the CDA will help provinces “develop a comprehensive evidence-based list of prescribed drugs.” Again, the necessity of such an approach is unclear. Most provinces already maintain their own lists (known as formularies), likely tailored to demographic requirements of their specific populations.

It’s also unclear if this will mean a basic formulary of a few hundred “essential” drugs or something much greater. Either way, it’s extremely unlikely that such a list would match the comprehensive lists of drugs routinely covered by private insurance plans across the country. The all-important question of who will ultimately be responsible for funding drugs listed on this new national formulary is entirely absent.

All of this raises a fundamental question — who, exactly, are these new bureaucracies and national formularies targeting?

At best, these proposals may help subsidize a basic list of prescription medications for the vast majority of Canadians who don’t need financial assistance. Meanwhile, it remains unclear if any of these changes will meaningfully improve the lives of Canadians in greatest need.

If governments are truly interested in helping these Canadians, they could explore further reducing or eliminating deductibles and other charges for lower-income individuals and families (among other clearly identifiable vulnerable groups). Provincial governments, specifically, could also consider shifting from inefficient age-based plans to income-based plans, targeting those in financial need irrespective of age rather than potentially subsidizing seniors who may be millionaires.

In fact, the only direct assistance offered in Tuesday’s announcement was the allocation of up to $500 million per year (starting in 2022) to help Canadians with rare diseases. But even here, it’s unclear how much of this money will go directly towards patients since the announcement also includes the creation of another “national strategy” for decision-making and negotiation.

No Canadian should be forced to forego basic medicine due to cost.

However, instead of blindly marching towards some mythical notion of “national pharmacare” and building bigger bureaucracies that are largely unnecessary, we should focus first on those Canadians in greatest need — those who have difficulty paying for their medications.

Although none of their biological parents is Canadian, Alexandra and Calder are Canadian citizens because they were born in the country, and their fathers say it's an important part of their heritage.","With two kids under two, the Berney-Edwards household in southeast England is a busy one. There are toddlers running all over the place. One pokes his dad in the eye and laughs before accidentally hitting his sister with a toy vacuum cleaner, causing her to wail. It can be a bit chaotic.

But Graeme and Simon Berney-Edwards wouldn't have it any other way. As gay men, there was a time when they thought they could never have any of that.

Now, however, they have their twins, the result of an arrangement involving a Canadian surrogate and Canadian surrogacy laws they feel are more progressive than those on the books in the United Kingdom.

""You see them tearing around and they're having fun, and just for a moment, you just sort of step back and go 'Wow, this is it. They're here,' "" Simon Berney-Edwards said in an interview at their home in Redhill, south of London.

""It can be very surreal,"" his husband Graeme Berney-Edwards chimed in.

When they decided surrogacy was the way they would have a family, they reached out to a surrogacy organization that helped them understand their options.

That organization connected them with a clinic in Las Vegas where in vitro fertilization took place. That's also where they learned they could have twins and each be a biological father to one child by fertilizing half of their American donor's eggs with Simon's sperm, the other half with Graeme's sperm, and then implanting the embryos in the same surrogate.

It means Alexandra and Calder, now 21 months old, are twins but only half-siblings. Born just minutes apart, they have the same biological mother, but different fathers.

They quickly chose to have the birth take place in Canada rather the U.K. That was because, they say, the surrogacy laws in their country are dated, primarily as a result of the U.K. considering the surrogate, and her partner, if she has one, to be the legal parents for the first six weeks of the child's life.

""And in that time, if the surrogate decides to change their mind, you have no recourse,"" said Simon Berney-Edwards. ""Basically, that's it. Your child is gone.""

Andrew Spearman, a British fertility and surrogacy lawyer, said the U.K. laws are ""archaic"" and that many of his clients turn to Canada for surrogacy.

""I think it gives an element of certainty. It gives the transparency, which we can't offer always, and it gives a very clear structure,"" he said in his London office.

Graeme and Simon Berney-Edwards were pleased to welcome their twins in Hamilton on June 25, 2017. (Submitted by Simon Berney-Edwards)

Spearman said while U.K. surrogates and intended parents do draw up contracts outlining their agreement, the contracts aren't legally binding as they are in Canada.

Neither country allows surrogates to be paid, other than to cover their expenses, which Spearman said helps British parents explain the process to English courts when they return home. They still need to get a ""parental order"" in the U.K. that makes them legal parents and gives their children U.K. citizenship.

The Berney-Edwards say they were also drawn to the altruistic nature of Canadian surrogacy because they wanted more than a ""transactional"" experience.

""We wanted someone that was prepared to be part of a family throughout the children growing up,"" said Graeme Berney-Edwards.

After consulting a website that has profiles of women wanting to be surrogates, they found that in Meg Stone of Hamilton, Ont. Stone said that's also what drew her to them.

""They mentioned that they wanted twins and I'm always up for a challenge,"" she said. ""And they also said they wanted lifelong friendship, which was also something I wanted.""

After a couple of false alarms that saw the dads dashing off to Canada early, Alexandra and Calder were born on June 25, 2017, in Hamilton, where they stayed for the first seven weeks of their lives.

Stone, who has two of her own children, has continued to watch the twins grow from afar, swapping messages and photos and even making the trip to England for the twins' first birthday.

Her 12-year-old son, Jeffrey Seroski-Stone, said he's proud of his mom for helping to create a family.

""I think it's exciting how my mom ended up helping them out by giving them children, and I think we usually have a really good time, so I consider them to be like family to me,"" he said.

Stone is pregnant with twins again, helping another same-sex family have children.

""I love being a mom and why wouldn't I want to help somebody else do that, too?"" she said.

She maintains she wouldn't want to be paid for helping others have children, but there is a debate in Canada about whether paying surrogates should be decriminalized.

Simon and Calder have fun at a park near their home in Redhill. (Kayla Hounsell/CBC)

The current Canadian law came into force in 2004 and prohibits paying surrogates other than to reimburse them for certain medical and maternity costs.

The federal government is reviewing the legislation, including identifying categories for reimbursement and making them more clear. A Liberal MP tabled a private member's bill that would decriminalize payments to surrogates but opponents say it amounts to commercializing a woman's body.

Stone disagrees with the idea that a surrogate be given the chance to change her mind, as is set out in the current U.K. law.

""I never felt like they were mine to give away,"" she said. ""They were [with] me to watch and nurture until Simon and Graeme were able to.""

The Berney-Edwards say when it comes to surrogacy law, Canada has it right, but that doesn't mean it was easy or cheap.

They won't put a figure on it, but experts say they would have spent tens of thousands of dollars on Stone's expenses, agency and legal fees, not to mention three trips back and forth to Canada.

""But it was worth it,"" said Simon.

""Every single penny, cent, was worth it,"" said Graeme.

While the Liberals have struggled in recent years to elect candidates in Saskatchewan ...,"Many questions remain about the federal government’s pitch for national pharmacare, but Canada’s employment minister says the election-year budget item that lays the groundwork is about doing the right thing over the long term.

“If you don’t start somewhere with prevention, you will always be playing catch-up,” Patty Hajdu, who represents Thunder Bay — Superior North and has served in cabinet since 2015, said Monday in an interview with the Saskatoon StarPhoenix.

“As people age, you’re going to see a higher and higher hit to provincial coffers (and) to municipal coffers, who are picking up the cost for people who are living in poverty, who are losing their housing maybe as a choice between affording medication and paying their rent.”

Hajdu, who was in Saskatoon this week to promote what she signalled is likely to be a Liberal Party of Canada plank in the upcoming federal election, acknowledged that it’s too soon to say how much national pharmacare would cost or when it could be available.

She noted, however, that it has been on the government’s agenda since at least last year.

In his last budget, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the creation of an advisory council on national pharmacare. That group’s report is not expected until later this spring, but Morneau’s 2019 budget included more than $1 billion in new spending aimed at making drugs affordable.

That includes $35 million over four years to set up a Canadian Drug Agency to negotiate better drug prices and create a national formulary, and $1 billion over two years, beginning in 2022-23, to help people with rare diseases more easily acquire costly medications.

The budget also contemplated $500 million in ongoing annual spending beyond 2024-25 to help cover the cost of expensive drugs.

“Responsible leadership is about making investments in ways that are going to pay off long-term, and prevention is always a difficult argument because you can’t see it right away. You can’t actually see prevention the minute you spend,” Hajdu said.

“Is it in an election-year budget? Yes. Will it be in our platform? Yes. It’s the next logical step to the kinds of things that we’ve been investing in,” she added.

Hajdu made much the same pitch at a campaign-style event at a Saskatoon seniors’ home.

According to a Canadian Institute for Health Information study published last year, prescription drug spending in Canada was forecast to hit $33.7 billion in 2018, up four per cent from 2017. Around $14.4 billion of that total was expected to have been publicly funded.

The institute said in the same report that the 14 per cent of beneficiaries who received $2,500 or more from publicly-funded drug programs in 2017 accounted for 70 per cent of all public spending on pharmaceuticals.

Public drug programs paid $2,500 or more toward drug costs for 13.8 per cent of beneficiaries — 2.3 per cent received $10,000 or more — accounting for 69.7 per cent of all public drug spending, the institute said in the report.

In his budget, Morneau said the country’s “patchwork” of drug coverage, including more than 100 programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, “is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.”

According to the government, the proposed Canadian Drug Agency could cut the cost of drugs by $3 billion per year.

It is not clear, however, what national pharmacare would look like. Hajdu said the new spending — in a budget with a deficit pegged at $19.8 billion and forecast to decline to $9.8 billion by 2023-24 — represents the “first steps” toward such a program.

While the Liberals have struggled in recent years to elect candidates in Saskatchewan — only one of the province’s 14 MPs, Ralph Goodale, represents the party in Ottawa — Hajdu said she hopes the new pitch will help pick up seats in the fall.

The federal government is not likely to be aided in that mission by the Saskatchewan government, which has wasted few opportunities to blast Ottawa for failing to stand up for oilpatch jobs and imposing a “job-killing” price on carbon.

Asked whether they would consider voting for each of the federal parties, 49.1 per cent of Canadians say they would consider voting Liberal, while 45.7 per cent would consider voting Conservative. Four in 10 (42.3%) would consider voting NDP, 34.7 per cent would consider voting Green, 11.2 per cent would consider voting for the People’s Party and 30.9 per cent would consider voting for the BQ.

Nanos tracking has Justin Trudeau as the preferred choice as Prime Minister at 30.1 per cent of Canadians, followed by Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer (26.3%), NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (8.6%), Green Party Leader Elizabeth May (8%) and PPC Leader Maxime Bernier (2.5%). Twenty three per cent of Canadians were unsure whom they preferred.

He also agreed with the Conservatives and denounced what seemed to be a deliberate leak to CTV and Canadian Press aimed at showing relations between the prime minister and Wilson-Raybould ...,"""No one is going to hold her back,"" and he added, ""I understand all of that information is to be made public.""

""So one, this is appropriately before justice and we ought to see what justice does in the wake of information that is provided, and two . . . I have not found committees like ours to be very effective at conducting inquiries,"" said Erskine-Smith, who was the only Liberal to speak at the meeting.

Pointing to its earlier investigation of the Cambridge Analytica affair, he said committees are not best placed to do investigations.

""We ran into roadblocks and were unable to proceed based on our inability to compel document production in the same way, revisit previous testimony in the same way, frankly the tools we have at our disposal are more cumbersome.""

Still, Erskine-Smith broke with many of his Liberal colleagues, saying that if Wilson-Raybould and Philpott feel they cannot speak fully on the issue, then the prime minister should act to ensure they can.

He also agreed with the Conservatives and denounced what seemed to be a deliberate leak to CTV and Canadian Press aimed at showing relations between the prime minister and Wilson-Raybould had soured as early as 2017 when they disagreed whether a conservative Manitoba judge should be named to a Western vacancy on the Supreme Court. The reports named the judge, Glenn Joyal, who was forced to publicly disavow his candidacy, saying he withdrew his name because his wife had cancer.

""It is outrageous that there's a leak with respect to the Supreme Court judicial appointment process and without question that kind of leak undermines the confidence in the judicial selection process and appointment process. So I think people from all parties ought to condemn that kind of thing. Completely inappropriate.""

Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee last month that she faced ""inappropriate"" and ""sustained"" political pressure from Trudeau and senior officials last fall to mediate criminal charges against the Quebec construction and engineering company.

Trudeau and his team deny they pressured her, and said they only urged her to consider a second outside legal opinion. A mediated agreement would allow the company to avoid a criminal prosecution and with it, a 10-year ban on federal contracts, which had sparked fears within government of job losses.

Ramsay, who is a vice-chair of the justice committee, said there is little hope that committee will resume its hearings into the affair.

And she said the Liberal chair Anthony Housefather has publicly declared there's nothing more to be studied, he'd made up his mind.

In an opinion piece in the National Post last week, Housefather wrote that in his view it is ""duty"" of an attorney-general to consider new facts relative to a possible remediation agreement ""seriously and on an ongoing basis.""

David Moscrop, a political scientist with the department of communication at the University of Ottawa, said the day's proceedings left him ""frustrated."" He said he doesn't believe the office of the federal ethics commissioner is well-suited for this sort of inquiry. And he said the shutdown of the justice committee and now the refusal of the ethics committee to launch an inquiry underscores his belief that a public inquiry is the only forum to get at the facts.

""This is the sort of information that Canadians would like to have ideally before the election so it was frustrating to watch,"" Moscrop said an interview.

""It raises the broader question, can the House and its committees effectively hold the government to account in the current system, I think the answer is not really,"" he said.

""The only thing that's going to ultimately, I think, result in fundamental changes is if voters decide they're not going to have any of it,"" he said.

324,Politics,2019-03-30T06:02:00.0000000Z,"If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade ... and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend ...","We have learned so much. Within minutes Monday afternoon, two good reporters had stories (here and here) about the Chief Justice of Manitoba, who was a candidate to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and who, later, wasn’t. Both reporters unfurled similar yarns about a lone Prime Minister standing athwart the tide of conservatism by blocking—shudder—a Harper appointee from sitting on the top court. Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

CHARLOTTETOWN – Prince Edward Islanders will be going to the polls on April 23, Premier Wade MacLauchlan announced Tuesday night.

“This is Prince Edward Island’s time,” he told a nomination meeting for a local candidate at a Charlottetown hotel. “This is a time to decide if we go forward.”

The Liberal government didn’t have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7 under the province’s fixed-date election provisions, but there was an apparent desire to avoid overlap with the federal election this fall.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Tories a party of division and opposition, and said support for the surging Greens would be an expensive social experiment.

He touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half.

“Prince Edward Island is working,” he told the partisan crowd. “There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and strive.”

Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Green party seen as a legitimate contender for power.

A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and he has worked to build the Green brand, mainly by challenging the notion that the party is devoted to nothing more than environmental activism.

The party snagged a second seat when Hannah Bell, the 48-year-old head of a businesswomen’s association in Charlottetown, won a 2017 byelection.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan – a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier – is personally unpopular.

The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890.

MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day.

The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform – asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model.

EDMONTON – Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan says he would give municipalities a veto over oil and gas drilling within their boundaries if his party were to win the April 16 election.

He says that would allow local governments to plan for safe and sustainable growth and development.

Khan also says he would provide municipalities greater autonomy by amending the Municipal Government Act to formally recognize them as “a new order of government.”

New revenue-generating powers would go to Edmonton and Calgary, and those cities and their voters would be free to make decisions on taxes and spending.

A Liberal government would open talks with smaller municipalities to come up with similar powers.

Khan says he would also create an equitable cannabis revenue-sharing model.

“The NDP government has unfairly compensated cities on cannabis sales relative to the costs they are incurring for legalization,” he said in a release Wednesday.

Urban municipalities currently face unpredictable funding, downloading of costs and a lack of co-operation, he said.

“Our municipalities play an increasingly important role in the life of Albertans, but they are disrespected by higher orders of government.”

Criticism flowed, along with warnings of potential ...","Justin Trudeau is taking flak from assorted experts for racking up deficits.

Economists, think-tanks and credit rating agencies all warn that the prime minister’s big spending could spell trouble for the economy. And in a swipe at Trudeau, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer says balancing the budget would be a top priority under a Conservative government.

But the big question is, do people really care about deficits? Do voters reward deficit hawks and punish free-spenders? Polling on the issue is a mixed bag, and the better gauge may be how people actually vote when faced the choice, such as in the recent Quebec election.

The topic, which could be a ballot box issue in the fall, took centre-stage after the Liberal government unveiled a budget that projects more deficits in a year the books were supposed to be balanced. Criticism flowed, along with warnings of potential economic disruption. The trouble is, despite such warnings in recent times, governments of all shades continued to ring in deficits — and win elections. Which leaves open the question of whether people are as concerned about deficits as some might think.

True, there was a time, particularly in the 1990s, when slaying the deficit was a national obsession. With the Ontario and federal governments facing record deficits and on the brink of economic meltdown, most people accepted deep and often painful spending cuts to rein in bulging deficits and soaring debt.

Jean Chretien’s Liberal government led the way, balancing the budget in 1997-98 and leaving a string of surpluses. Conservative Mike Harris also balanced the Ontario budget in 1999 and was rewarded with re-election. That was the golden decade of deficit-busting.

By the 2000s, however, the war on deficits appeared to lose steam.

Harris’s successor, Ernie Eves, recorded a deficit, and Liberal Dalton McGuinty who followed in 2003, ran more deficits than surpluses. Federally, Stephen Harper’s decade-long record was mixed.

Harper balanced the budget on occasion, but recorded several deficits. For both Harper and McGuinty, the 2008 global financial crisis may have been a factor, but importantly by that time, people appeared to have soured on austerity.

The governments of the day understood the changing mood, and the spending trend continued.

Ontario voters soundly rejected Conservative leader Tim Hudak’s plan for big spending cuts to balance the budget in the 2014 election. Liberal Kathleen Wynne, whose platform included significant spending, won.

Perhaps the most telling example of the shift in public mood was last October’s Quebec election. Premier Philippe Couillard inherited a deficit and chose to focus on its elimination in short order, slashing services, including education and health care.

He succeeded but Quebeckers were not amused. Instead of kudos for the man who slew the dragon, they sent him packing. Ironically, the new Coalition Avenir Québec government is splashing out on services with surpluses left behind by Couillard.

Next in line is Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a deficit hawk, whose budget comes down April 11.

Interestingly, the shift in the public mood is happening not just in Canada. Even in the United States, where cutting spending and deficits was religion to Republicans, President Donald Trump has been racking up deficits. The U.S. deficit is set to top $1 trillion this year, and Republicans just shrug their shoulders.

Reneging on his promise to balance the budget this year, and instead splashing billions on services, Trudeau is gambling that program spending will trump deficit reduction in the eyes of Canadians.

Scheer has taken the opposite view and when voters speak in a few months, we’ll know who got it right. Of course, the public mood can change quickly to Trudeau’s disadvantage if the economy tanks. Deficits don’t really matter to New Democrats, who want even more spending. But as the Conservatives digest the Liberal budget and plot election strategy, they may do well to reconsider deficit-slaying as the centrepiece of their campaign. The sand has shifted on the issue and on recent evidence, an arm-to-arm combat on the deficit with Liberals could be risky.

Deficit busters, beware.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown ...","On Friday, Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen offered some advice to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he is likely to ignore. Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

Liberal Leader Wade MacLauchlan began his second day of campaigning by focusing on the thorny issue of health care access in P.E.I.

""In addition, we will invest in the development of a long-term health services plan that is modern and responsive, through the Kings County Memorial Hospital, to patients needs in the region.""

The emergency room had its hours reduced by two hours in July due to a shortage of physicians.

MacLauchlan committed to improving walk-in clinics, increasing the number of family doctors in rural areas, doing away with ambulance fees, reducing wait times for surgical procedures such as hip and knee replacements, and providing financial support and subsidized Confederation Bridge passes for off-Island health appointments.

MacLauchlan said other health-care announcements focusing on mental health, addictions, seniors and West Prince issues would be forthcoming.

""Our Liberal health-care plan is comprehensive, it is realistic, it is costed and it will put patients first,"" MacLauchlan said.

Over the tenure of MacLauchlan, the complement of family physicians has largely remained unchanged. According to Health P.E.I., between 2015 and 2018, the number of family physicians working P.E.I. has remained at 120, although the number of specialists has increased from 100 to 109.

Currently, 12,904 Islanders lack access to a family doctor. The numbers are highest in Queens county at 8,584.

Incumbent Health Minister Robert Mitchell said the Liberal plan would result in an addition to the total complement of family physicians, but these would be concentrated in the new collaborative practice clinic in Queens County.

""The vision for that would be probably four family physicians, three or four (nurse practitioners) and then all resource staff that would be required for that,"" Mitchell said.

The new clinic would be a collaborative practice and would allow access to a variety of health professionals, Mitchell said.

According to data collected by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, surgical wait times have increased significantly during MacLauchlan’s tenure. In 2015, 85 per cent of patients needing hip replacement surgery, and 83 per cent of patients needing knee replacement surgery, received them within six months. By 2018, only 49 per cent of hip replacement surgeries and 26 per cent of knee replacement surgeries took place within six months.

In 2015, the Liberal platform included a pledge to reduce wait times for hip, knee and cataract surgery, as well as a promise to ensure provincial return-in-services agreements would ensure “adequate physician resources,” particularly in rural regions.

We’ve all seen the video of the Viking Sky cruise-ship disaster.

The water rushing in. The chaotic scenes from the bow as the ship is tossed to-and-fro. The helpless tub, dead in its tracks, threatening to crash on the rocks.

Ah, yes. The Leaky Ship Liberal.

Perilously listing. Its passengers screaming for help. A showpiece of negligence and neglect, going nowhere fast.

With Captain Trudeau asleep at the wheel and his first mate Lametti lounging as it leaks. Both are completely confounded by the sudden turn of events that has set their once proud and seemingly invincible ship-of-state reeling.

Holy crap. Now we learn that the former chair of the Liberal Agency of Canada audit committee is bolstering calls for a public inquiry into the LavScam debacle.

Do they even know how ridiculous they look, trying to maintain a stiff upper lip while doing diddly squat to respond to their government’s latest self-inflicted catastrophe?

Do they have the faintest clue how inept, insensitive, and foolhardy they appear in posing as mere bystanders in the accident-in-the-making in the name of the partisan flag now in tatters?

I am referring of course to the appalling attempt by some unknown miscreant to discredit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by leaking confidential information aimed at painting Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as an avowed enemy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

If you are not yet quite up to speed on that fiasco—perhaps, because you’ve been too busy throwing up from the other endless sickening swells in the LavScam disaster—you can learn all about it here, here and here.

The attacks on Justice Joyal were vicious, malicious, and possibly criminal in their motivation, in their abuse of power and position, and in their potentially defamatory content and design.

They were enough to prompt him to respond with remarkable self-restraint, “I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

They were enough to prompt Conservative MP Lisa Raitt to write to Marc Giroux, Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs, urging him to investigate the matter.

He responded by stressing that “The release of any such confidential information is wholly inappropriate,” but that “in light of [his] particular role and [its] enabling statute, he is “not in a position to accede to [Raitt’s] request to investigate”.

The deputy leader of the Conservatives, Lisa Raitt, wants an investigation into the leak concerning the chief justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal.

And what of the intended target of the Liberals’ scurrilous leaks intended to present her as a de facto anti-Liberal, whose own first choice as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada was supposedly someone who stood to undermine Trudeau’s father’s proudest legacy?

Puglaas has proved yet again that she is a woman of dignity, sound bearing, and righteous resolve who is not to be trifled with or so easily disparaged by those on her Liberal “team” (“more united than ever!”) who are so intent on doing her harm.

She forcefully responded with a call to investigate the breach of confidence, to find the leaker, and to hold him or her or them duly accountable. We should expect no less of her, as someone who could give current attorney general David Lametti lessons in what the office she held really demands in its leader.

“I do feel compelled to say that I have not—as some have suggested—been the source of any of these stories, nor have I ever authorized any person to speak on my behalf,” she said.

“I strongly condemn anyone who would speak about or provide information on such sensitive matters. Any commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC [Supreme Court of Canada] appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process, our institutions and potentially sitting justices.”

And JWR and Raitt were far from the only persons sending out an SOS.

Others called out the nefarious leakers and urged the prime minister and Lametti to act.

The Canadian Bar Association offered this condemnation:

“There is a process to get informed input about the merits of the applicants. It rightly goes on behind closed doors. Keeping the deliberations confidential respects the privacy of applicants and guards against interference,” said CBA president Ray Adlington.

“Breaching confidentiality by releasing the names and commenting on the suitability of the other applicants after the appointment demeans the selection process and ultimately all those who hold the office of judge.”

The Law Society of Manitoba issued this statement:

“The Law Society of Manitoba is very concerned when circumstances arise that will weaken the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. A highly confidential process has been established to encourage the best and brightest candidates to put their names forward for appointment to all levels of courts.

“The integrity of that process is called into question when the confidentiality of deliberations and discussions about candidates appears not to have been maintained.

“Confidentiality is critical to protecting the reputation of all applicants including sitting judges, who are not able to respond to unjust criticism. The aspersions cast in recent media reports on Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench represent an unwarranted attack on a distinguished judicial career.”

Oh, yes. Trudeau’s leakers also had no compunctions about compromising CTV’s journalistic best interests in choosing that esteemed forum as the most suitable outlet for their spurious counter-rationale for JWR’s supposed longstanding friction with the prime minister.

A false twist on the true treachery, as it were, that was supposed create new cover for Trudeau’s firing of the main person who could be trusted to protect the rule of law and the independence of her office as Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

David Lametti was sworn in as attorney general and justice minister at Rideau Hall as Justin Trudeau looked on. Adam Scotti/Prime Minister's Office

Yet despite that crescendo of outrage crying out for action, echoed by so many pundits, columnists, and others, what have we heard in response from Trudeau and Lametti?

After three days, no less?

Absolutely nothing of hard consequence.

Neither Trudeau nor Lametti apparently have any intention of investigating that wanton breach of public trust.

They have so far failed to take any action to investigate that egregious violation of personal privacy and that calculated smear on a sitting justice and on JWR, which is at its core yet another deliberate affront to justice.

Lametti’s Twitter response was pathetic.

It was as weak as Trudeau’s mealy-mouthed prattle that could be interpreted as he damn well knows or suspects that the leaks came from within his own office. And it seems he won’t be doing anything to try to identify and potentially prosecute the person(s) responsible.

Video of Raitt demands investigation into SCC appointment leaks Watch Lisa Raitt tell CTV why she thinks there needs to be an investigation.

This, from the guy who only last month waxed on about his father’s deep commitment to justice.

Who bleated that “those principles of justice are fundamental to me in what we are as a country, what we want to be as a society. And I have spent my entire political career fighting for justice and for people … the SNC-Lavalin file was not an exception.”

Some fight. He has done more in his single term in office to erode Canadians’ confidence in justice and the rule of law than any other prime minister in living memory.

Meanwhile, the whole Liberal crew hides behind the ludicrous tweets of Sheila Copps, who seems to be quite comfortable debasing herself with no end of attacks aimed at discrediting JWR and former treasury board president Jane Philpott and driving them both out of caucus.

The party that once held itself above all others as a moral force of international repute is now a rudderless vessle awash in its own bilge water.

It doesn’t look, act, or smell anything like its former “renewed” post-Adscam, self. And that won’t change as long as the guy with the real dirt on his hands is at the helm.

His arrogance knows no bounds, as he demonstrated yet again at the Liberal fundraiser in which he laughed off protesters from the Grassy Narrows First Nation who were concerned about mercury contamination in their communities with the sarcastic dismissal: “Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.”

This is what it’s come to, really? Making jokes aimed at disparaging Indigenous peoples whose health is being threatened by mercury poisoning and tainted water supplies that successive governments have done nothing about?

Yeah, that’ll go a long way to advancing the goal of reconciliation.

Despite his belated apology after getting pounded by all who watched the clip, that type of “leadership” goes a long to explaining why Trudeau’s approval rating is now lower than Donald Trump’s, according to one new poll.

I say again, it ought to be Trudeau who walks the plank if his battered ship is to have any chance of winning back the public confidence needed to convince Canadians it’s safe to ride for another term in government.

And if the contrast between Puglaas and Lametti previously flattered the former, the latter is now also looking like he might be unworthy of the independent office that he was invited to uphold.

Get off your sorry butt and at least pretend that you are not so afraid to offend your sinking captain by getting to the bottom of this matter that was so wrongly initiated under his watch and in his perceived partisan interests.

Like the greater LavScam scandal that gave rise to this new wrongdoing, this fiasco threatens to corrode and degrade all it touches in its filthy wake.

[Please note, this is a very long read.]

I am beginning to think that maybe Justin Trudeau’s best hope for burying his LavScam scandal might be to hire Donald Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, or perhaps his former nemesis and now BFF, Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Barr’s summary of the Mueller report findings reads like The Donald’s wet dream.

No (new) indictments. No evidence of collusion to conspire or coordinate with the Russians for electoral advantage. And not enough evidence to warrant charges of obstruction of justice.

Obstruction of justice? Pfft. “Totally exonerated,” says Trump.

“While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

Many Liberals would probably be quite happy with a similar ambivalent outcome from the ethics commissioner or—god forbid, from the RCMP—as their beloved leader heads into the fall campaign.

Enough of being haunted by “groundless” suspicions of collusion aimed at the obstruction of justice in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, they might now be thinking.

When the chips are down, who you gonna call? Ghost busters.

Mueller might be available, if a special prosecutor was ever required to step in for director of public prosecutions (DPP), Kathleen Roussel.

That might be a challenge if the RCMP ultimately declines to investigate the scandal. So far, the five former federal and provincial attorneys general and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer who have all called for a police probe are still in the dark, like all Canadians.

More to the point, Canada doesn’t have a clear legislated and/or policy process for appointing special prosecutors in such politically charged cases—unlike British Columbia and some other provinces, or for that matter, the Canadian military.

It is astounding, when you think about it, that the Department of Justice Act or the Criminal Code doesn’t already explicitly empower the DPP to unilaterally appoint a special prosecutor in any situation where the AG’s legal oversight is itself untenable.

Leaving the AG even notionally in charge of a prosecution involving the prime minister who appointed her or him to their job and to cabinet should be legally unthinkable and impermissible.

Ditto for a prosecution of anyone accountable to the PM, or of a person or corporation with obvious political connections to a political party. Especially those who have been large donors to party coffers, or one that illegally contributed over $100,000 to the governing party.

Conceptually, it's an inherent conflict of interest.

As such, I can’t imagine that Canada’s current AG, David Lametti, would ever see fit to even titularly oversee the charge assessment process or prosecution of any political figures in this case, if it should ever come to that.

And that is a big “if”, no doubt. But it is one we should all be thinking about now, if the stuff that has already hit the fan turns out to be as stinky and sticky as the odour emanating from the justice committee and from what’s leaking about all that’s gone on behind closed doors.

David Lametti (second from right) is in an awkward legal position, given what's been declared to date by Jody Wilson-Raybould (far left). MCPL MATHIEU GAUDREAULT, RIDEAU HALL

David Lametti's predicament

Someone should ask Lametti what steps he might take to prevent the appearance or reality of a conflict of interest in any such hypothetical scenario.

What process would apply for appointing a special prosecutor that would completely extricate him from his statutory oversight in such instances?

What process would further apply in appointing a special prosecutor to also remove Ms. Roussel from having further false aspersions cast on her conduct, decisions and/or judgement—especially by those acting on behalf of the prime minister?

Which is really at the root of this scandal. To say nothing of the implied lack of confidence by the prime minister and his crew in the former AG’s judgement, competence, and statutory decision-making.

It was that that gave rise to the pressure they allegedly exerted on her to commission an outside “expert” to “help” her overrule the DPP and to “help” her provide “cover” for taking and defending their desired actions, which ran counter to her own unwelcome professional assessment.

Maybe Anne McLellan should add that requirement for appointing a special prosecutor in such cases to her “to do” list.

She, who has been tasked as the prime minister’s handpicked special advisor, to submit “independent” recommendations for reforming the AG’s role.

She, who can no longer attend Liberal fundraisers to help her party fight the opposition parties that hope to convert this controversy into votes and seats for themselves.

Apart from being the right thing to do, it could be worth its weight in gold and goodwill for her party, as it struggles to regain public confidence in a leader who seems genetically incapable of understanding the concept of prosecutorial independence.

After all, it would be tough to imagine that Lametti would ever preside over the criminal prosecution of anyone in the Trudeau government on the LavScam file.

I mean, given that his predecessor (JWR) feels she was fired from that same office that Lametti now holds, allegedly, for not bowing to her boss’s desire to politically intervening in a criminal prosecution. In respect of the same subject that he maintains may yet qualify for a DPA, because no decision is ever final until a verdict is rendered.

Not that there’s any reason to believe that will ever come pass, as things stand.

Which is also not to confuse the potential for criminal charges with the likelihood (or unpublicized reality) of an RCMP investigation.

Obstruction of justice and breach of trust are notoriously hard to prove, as Trump has now happily discovered in the first instance. And as I expect Vice-Admiral Mark Norman will yet again confirm in the second instance.

It is ironic that even Trump allowed for the special prosecutor’s investigation to go forward that Trudeau is using the full weight of his office to prevent from ever materializing in getting to the bottom of his scandal.

To date, most of the focus in the LavScam controversy has centered on two provisions of the Criminal Code.

Section 139(2) makes it an offence to willfully attempt to “obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice in a judicial proceeding”.

Section 423.1(1) makes it an offence “to engage in any conduct with the intent to provoke fear” in a “justice system participant in order to impede him or her in the performance of his or her duties”.

Of course, both are relevant concerns that Canadians deserve to be assured are either pertinent or inapplicable in this affair.

The mainstream media and opposition parties might also want to focus more attention on s. 122 of the Criminal Code, which deals with “breach of trust by a public officer.”

In R. v. Boulanger the Supreme Court of Canada set out a five-point test for establishing that crime. The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following:

The accused is a public official; The accused was acting in connection with the duties of his or her office; The accused breached the standard of responsibility and conduct demanded of him or her by the nature of the office; The conduct of the accused represented a serious and marked departure from the standards expected of an individual in the accused’s position of public trust; and The accused acted with the intention to use his or her public office for a purpose other than the public good, for example, for a dishonest, partial, corrupt, or oppressive purpose.

The first four of those points would all seem to apply to at least some of the individuals and conduct that JWR identified and illuminated in her testimony to the Commons justice committee.

But it is the last point that is really key in this instance. For it speaks to whether anyone used their public office for “a purpose other than the public good, for example, for a dishonest, partial, or corrupt purpose”.

Now, I am just a layman, but my reading of that test suggests it might extend to anyone who deliberately misled an attorney general and/or cabinet about a supposed “public good” rationale for politically intervening in a criminal prosecution.

Say, for the “dishonest, partial, or corrupt purpose” of winning votes in Quebec and elsewhere.

Say, for an ulterior purpose of saving seats for the governing the party, including the one held by the prime minister, or maybe benefitting a company that has been a major donor to the Liberal party.

I’m not suggesting that’s the case here; but it begs to be examined and explicitly ruled out if all is as legally defensible as the prime minister would have us believe.

The truth, as it were, should set him and his government free from all suspicion and doubt, if he has nothing ontoward to hide.

My point is, it is not just the prospect of some illicit personal benefit or monetary gain that constitutes a breach of trust, which no one is now suggesting might be applicable in this instance.

But also, whether information was illegally shared and used in tandem with other inappropriate conduct for “dishonest, partial, or corrupt purposes” of partisan advantage, masked as having been pursued in the “public interest”.

Lest there be any doubt, I am not accusing anyone of any criminal wrongdoing in this LavScam controversy.

Not being a lawyer, or privy to any inside knowledge of the facts beyond those reported by the media, I am left with only my political antennae in trying to guess at where this affair is now legally heading.

Yet my political ""spidey sense"" tells me that the threads of truth that are gradually coming to light are all spinning out a web of intrigue that raise grave questions about the legality of the conduct at issue.

Questions that cry out for closer inspection by the RCMP.

Staff reporting to Bill Morneau and Justin Trudeau repeatedly tried to get Jody Wilson-Raybould to consider a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.

Why is Trudeau obfuscating?

Despite JWR’s statement to the justice committee that the pressure she experienced was inappropriate, but probably not illegal, it is what she doesn’t know and what she was not aware of that begs to be scrutinized by someone beyond the ethics commissioner.

For as Jane Philpott rightly said, “My sense is that [the commissioner’s office] will not have the appropriate tools to be able to get at all of this.”

That is obvious, which is why Trudeau has tried so hard to suggest the opposite.

It is why he is so content to hide behind the ethics commissioner’s review, hoping that Mario Dion’s severely constrained legal mandate will preclude him from really addressing the most serious questions. Whenever he returns from his “prolonged” medical leave.

It is why Trudeau is so deathly afraid of extending the privilege waiver to release JWR from her sworn oath of cabinet confidence beyond January 14.

It is why he has refused to fully release her from solicitor-client privilege restrictions that he well knows still prevent her from speaking freely about what happened outside of the justice committee that has now terminated its investigation.

He knows that she risks being disbarred for violating that tenet, which she is now being urged to do by those who suggest she should cast caution to the wind and “let 'er rip” in Parliament.

It is why he won’t release Jane Philpott to say anything that would reveal what she knows that might now be protected by cabinet confidence.

And as we all know, she maintains “There’s much more to the story that should be told.”

As she said, “I believe the former attorney general has further points to make. I believe that I have further issues of concern that I’m not free to share.”

It is why seasoned Liberal lackeys like MP Judy Sgro are now attacking JWR and Philpott, challenging them to “put up or shut up”, when their own leader is doing his level best from allowing that to happen.

What Sgro, her cowardly caucus colleagues, and the Liberal social media trolls all really mean by that appalling slapdown of two brave women who had the courage of their convictions to speak truth to power is to just “shut up"".

Because they know that neither of the courageous women they accuse of not being team players are not keen on simply ignoring their sworn oaths and saying their piece under the questionable protection of parliamentary privilege.

That is, to the extent that they might even be afforded a few minutes to make a statement in the House, which really needs to be fully aired and questioned through many more hours of committee testimony.

To make their case in Parliament, they would have to obtain the Liberals’ consent to be heard, which is ridiculous, given how they are the only reason why JWR and Philpott have been largely silenced.

If they really mean what they say, those Liberals should add their voices to those calling on the prime minister to remove any need for parliamentary privlege to trump cabinet privilege or solicitor-client privilege.

They should be calling on him to simply release JWR and Philpott to share their full story, instead of supporting his efforts to clam them up and prevent the truth from outing.

It is now patently clear that the prime minister is panic-stricken by the prospect of allowing his two former senior ministers to say anything about what really transpired from the date of the cabinet shuffle through their respective resignations from cabinet.

He surely must know that something very damaging to him and his government hangs in the balance of their forced silence.

The muzzle that he has put on JWR and Philpott is intended only to prevent him from experiencing the harsh truth—that their bark is itself their bite.

He is terrified of inviting any new testimony from the officials that JWR has identified as key players in this controversy, or from others who may have done things that might provoke an RCMP investigation.

He is petrified at the prospect of anyone being called to testify under oath, at penalty of perjury for lying, to prove his laughable contention that he did nothing wrong.

And yet, the hits just keep on coming.

With every new front-page scoop in the Globe and Mail. With JWR’s next round of written evidence soon to be submitted to the justice committee.

And despite his Liberal lapdogs’ incorrigible attempts to silence JWR and betray that forum’s mandate by shutting down its investigation.

RCMP hasn't revealed anything yet

All of which isn’t just dumb politics on the PM’s part that is backfiring, big time, on him and his party. It further reinforces the need for an RCMP inquiry.

Indeed, I’d wager that an RCMP investigation may already be underway, if only because of its deafening silencing in either confirming or denying whether one has been initiated.

Sure, that’s the standard line they usually give when they don’t want to compromise an active or prospective investigation.

It is one thing to refuse to “confirm” that an investigation is taking place, if it is, and you don’t want to alert its subjects of that fact. Which seems unlikely in this instance, given what it would entail and who the RCMP would be obliged to talk to.

It is quite another thing to refuse to “deny” that an investigation has been launched if it has not been, regardless of what might happen in the future. Especially when it is the government itself and the prime minister’s political neck that is on the line.

When such denials are not forthcoming, inquiring minds race, and rightly so.

Because where there’s smoke, there is usually fire, whether or not it rises to a level hot enough for anyone to get burned with actual criminal charges being laid.

I submit, there is already more than enough on the table to warrant a formal investigation by the RCMP. Especially in the absence of any parliamentary process to help clear the air that is now choking us all in clouds of suspicion, doubt, and poisonous particles of toxic truth.

Here is just some of what we know.

We know that one or more individuals in the prime minister’s office were aware of highly sensitive and privileged information about the status of the SNC-Lavalin prosecution that they should not have been in any position to have.

Information that ostensibly did not come from Public Prosecutions Services and that conflicting accounts suggest may or may not have come from SNC-Lavalin. Information that might have been illegally shared.

I would think that that question and how (or if) SNC-Lavalin might have also been privy to such privileged information is a mystery that cries out for a closer look by the RCMP. Now more than ever, in view of the Globe and Mail's latest story.

We also know that numerous direct overtures were made by SNC-Lavalin officials and/or designates to the former head of the Privy Council and others, through activities that were not listed by the company in its monthly lobbyist activity reports.

What was said, implied, requested, or not in those unregistered communications is unknown.

Nor is it clear if any of those conversations, meetings, and/or written contacts may be construed as constituting lobbying activities as defined under the act.

SNC-Lavalin assures us that all of its communications were in total compliance with the law. I have previously speculated why I believe that is probably the case.

However, we also know that the company’s president and CEO, Neil Bruce, has publicly stated that at no time did he or his agents threaten to move SNC-Lavalin’s head office. Nor did he ever suggest that 9,000 were at risk, or did he or his company ever argue for a deferred prosecution agreement based on national economic interest arguments that would be against the law.

In fact, he said he never asked for a DPA on any of those bases, noting that “Yes, the 9,000 people will get a job. I have no doubt whatsoever about that … But they’ll be working probably for a U.S. company.”

All of which stands in direct contrast to the rationale cited by the prime minister and his senior staffers in pressuring JWR to overrule the director of public prosecutions to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial for fraud and corruption.

Note as well that the company’s recent statement to clarify Bruce’s earlier statements really do little to change that fact. It said this:

“Mr. Bruce indeed stated the Government of Canada was never threatened by SNC-Lavalin, however, the company had made it very clear to the Government through its advocacy campaign that the implementation of a remediation agreement (RA)—also known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)—was the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs through its more than 5,000 suppliers across Canada. The company still asserts this position.” [Emphasis added.]

None of which changes Bruce’s fundamental assertion: that SNC never threatened to move its HQ from Montreal, that it never threatened that jobs would be lost, and that it never suggested that such economic interest imperatives should make it eligible for a DPA.

[March 28 update: It is an assertion that would now seem to be directly contradicted by today’s Canadian Press story about a PowerPoint presentation made by SNC-Lavalin to federal prosecutors last fall.

The company apparently said that it was considering its options if it did not get a DPA. One of those options was “Plan B”.

As CTV reported, “Under that plan, SNC would move its Montreal headquarters and corporate offices in Ontario and Quebec to the U.S. within a year, cutting its workforce to just 3,500 from 8,717, before eventually winding up its Canadian operations.”

In short, it is tough to know who or what to believe about what was really said, in the absence of some sort of formal investigation, since the “jobs threat” story seems to be “fluid” and changing by the day.]

Political considerations and legal concerns

We also know that those false threats of economic sanctions were advanced, either deliberately or unwittingly, by people within the Trudeau administration.

To convince JWR to politically intervene in a way that she and her chief of staff repeatedly expressed would be clearly inappropriate and that had never been done before in a criminal prosecution.

To pressure her to make “her own decision”, using what she perceived to be “veiled threats”—including that she might be fired as AG if she refused to act against her expressed will and contrary to her repeatedly asserted position.

All in an effort to reframe the “national economic interest” considerations, which are expressly outlawed in the Criminal Code in determining whether to grant a DPA, as instead of “public interest” arguments that might be used to effectively nullify that prohibition.

We know that several senior officials in the PMO, the PCO and the finance minister’s office repeatedly tried to convince JWR and her chief of staff to get an outside legal opinion that would give the attorney general reason to politically intervene in a way in which she was unwilling to do.

We know that multiple officials from the prime minister, on down, repeatedly cited ulterior electoral considerations that pointed to political motives.

And that those considerations were communicated to JWR and to her chief of staff in pressuring her to “get it right” by politically intervening on behalf of SNC-Lavalin to overrule the DPP’s decision and spare it from a criminal trial and prospect of being barred from bidding on government contracts for up to 10 years. A benefit that could potentially be worth billions of dollars in new business for the company.

Those suggested political considerations had nothing to do with the public interest and everything to do with partisan interests that were of concern to the prime minister if the company didn’t get the special deal it was after.

Political interests that were heightened by conversations with the premier of Quebec and which JWR says she directly warned the prime minister were plainly inappropriate to raise with her or her staff. Legal advice he ignored.

His “people” persisted in advancing false economic arguments, which we know Quebec’s justice minister also says she also refused to entertain and advance on SNC-Lavalin’s behalf in pressuring her federal counterpart for a DPA.

And finally, we also know that the Federal Court has rejected SNC-Lavalin’s application for judicial review of the DPP’s decision not to negotiate a DPA.

Justice Catherine Kane stressed that the DPP had duly considered the “extensive information” and “had conducted a detailed review of the documents submitted” by SNC-Lavalin “regarding how they met the relevant criteria” in making her decision.

Yet, despite that fact, which JWR had reviewed and properly supported, the Liberals repeatedly tried to undermine her decision.

They ostensibly did so on the basis of their ill-informed judment that she had not given due regard to the economic threats that have now been exposed as groundless, and equally, to the partisan political imperatives that she rightly refused to entertain.

JWR feels she was harangued, threatened, and ultimately fired from her post for being seen as either too politically obstructionist for the prime minister’s liking, or too resistant to accommodate his desire to do things that no one in her former position should be asked to do.

The worst of it is, that is not even the half of what we already know.

And it is only a fraction of the hard truth that screams to be fully heard and thoroughly investigated by the RCMP.

So many other factors reinforce that need.

They include how the prime minister’s people are now all lawyered up.

They include how the prime minister’s former principal secretary was so rapidly given access to records that he relied upon for his testimony to the justice committee. Which stands in stark contrast to the interminable process that Vice-Admiral Mark Norman has gone through in trying to get access to his own records in defending himself in court. Why the difference?

They include the extraordinary efforts that the prime minister has taken to prevent JWR and Philpott from sharing their evidence.

That includes the unconscionable actions just taken by the Liberal members of the Commons ethics committee, who used their majority to block the opposition’s efforts efforts to have that forum complete the work that their Liberal colleagues on the justice committee brazenly voted to short-circuit.

They include the disturbing attacks on JWR’s character that Liberals have advanced in trying to justify the PM’s decision to dump her as AG.

One of those spurious assaults relates to JWR’s supposed attempts to isolate the PMO from information about potential Supreme Court nominees. Specifically, her alleged recommendation to appoint Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as the SCC’s chief justice.

As a conservative appointee of Stephen Harper who had challenged certain aspects of judicial interpretations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, those Liberals who tried to raise his appointment in trying to undermine JWR only added new fuel to their party’s own fire.

In trying to besmirch her character and her commitment to the charter, they apparently also leaked confidential cabinet information and tried to sully a sitting judge in the process.

It obliged Justice Joyal to issue an extraordinary statement.

“I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong,” he said.

No kidding, that’s wrong, like the other examples I have summarized above. All of it stinks to high Heaven.

With JWR’s evidence expected later this week, that smoke that the prime minister’s team has tried so hard and so unsuccessfully to douse will only grow bigger and blacker.

The longer Liberals ignore it and try to pretend that all is well, when they should know their collective goose is already being savagely cooked, just makes them look foolish.

Odds are, no one will ever be charged with a crime in this scandal, given how hard the government is trying to suppress the truth and how hard it is to prove criminal intent.

Nevertheless, the prime minister’s personal handling of this fiasco is a politically criminal abdication of leadership and an abuse of Canada’s highest elected office.

And whether this scandal ever results in criminal charges, which now seem unlikely, I predict the RCMP will inevitably feel compelled to investigate this firestorm. If it isn’t doing so already.

Because no privilege—not parliamentary privilege, not cabinet privilege, and not solicitor-client privilege—should ever protect a party that is trying to hide behind those shields to frustrate the evidence that goes to the heart of the rule of law.

Valid questions and concerns demand to be explored and answered.

Ones that are not simply political in nature, but that are also of legal and potentially criminal consequence.

The best way to truly clear the air in this case is to insist on an RCMP investigation that has the full force of the law behind it.

Preferably, under the auspices of a special prosecutor.

Because if even if Trudeau somehow reverses course and decides to let JWR and Philpott speak, that will not and should not be the end of it.

All of the actors and evidence in this controversy need to be exposed and duly questioned.

As I believe they will be, by those whose only interest is to serve and protect us and our democratic institutions—the RCMP.

Posted on March 27, 2019 by Sunny South News

Government budgets often offer some benefits for voters, but when the budget precedes an election, there’s a lot in common with Christmas — there are plenty of gifts, and you try not to think about having to pay for them later.

So it is with the Liberal government’s federal budget tabled last week that will dole out billions of dollars in new spending on all sorts of goodies for Canadians — many of them aimed at helping middle-class voters save money.

The Liberals were aided by the fact that a stronger economy has produced higher-than expected revenue — a projected extra $27.8 billion over the next six years.

Based on Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s plan, the Liberals will spend $22.8 billion of that additional money.

The budget includes: $1.7 billion over five years, and $586 million a year after that, for a Canada Training Benefit to help workers upgrade their skills and learn new ones while staying in their current jobs; $1.18 billion over five years to tighten border security, including hiring more judges to handle judicial reviews of asylum applications; $3.9 billion for farmers (the majority of them in the vote-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec) in supply-managed industries affected by new trade agreements with the U.S. and Asian countries; $2.2 billion for municipalities’ and First Nations’ infrastructure projects; $950 million for municipal governments to make their buildings more energy-efficient and to provide subsidy programs to help homeowners do the same; $300 million over three years for rebates of up to $5,000 on electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles.

The budget also calls for putting money toward lowering the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to the prime rate, and to create a new Canadian Drug Agency to centralize evaluations of new drugs and to buy in bulk nationwide, instead of province-by-province.

The provisions include measures to make housing more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers, by increasing the amount they can borrow from RRSPs and by having the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. contribute a small share of equity for down payments.

The budget also provides new rules that will let working seniors keep more of the money they earn before triggering a claw-back in the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The Canada Training Benefit will provide a tax credit of up to $250 per year to help with covering up to half the cost of job training, such as fees for a college course or other professional training programs. Such training is increasingly becoming crucial to help workers keep their skills up to date in a fast-changing workplace.

Similarly, helping working seniors keep more of their earnings in their pockets will be useful in a world where more seniors are having to remain on the job in order to make ends meet.

Of course, all these goodies have to be paid for, and the money for that ultimately comes from taxpayers’ pockets.

The Canadian Press points out the new budget will result in a 2019-20 federal deficit projection of $19.8 billion, including a $3-billion “risk adjustment,” an increase of $200 million from last year’s forecast. The Liberals’ plan includes a gradual reduction in the deficit, but that will happen more slowly than the government anticipated last year.

Morneau’s 460-page budget is titled “Investing in the Middle Class,” but it could perhaps be more appropriately called “Investing in Middle-Class Voters.”

Rather than using the unexpected windfall to reduce the debt or balance the budget, the Liberals have opted to spend the money like a carefree Vegas vacationer who just got lucky at the slot machines.

After 40 years of farming, 20 of those years on the farmer elected advisory committee to the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) and one term (the first term) on the Board of Directors who were to control the CWB, I thought I had heard and saw it all.

article continues below

I was at the table when embargoes were placed on Canadian grain for one reason or other, I saw the federal Government implement Ad Hoc piecemeal programs to help take the sting away when agriculture was financially hurt for so many different reasons. The worst of all that changed the prairie landscape was when USA started a trade war against the European Economic Community and Canada was seriously got in the cross fire on Wheat prices. That trade war appeared to last forever and almost bankrupt 1/3 of Western Canadian primary agriculture. I was at the table where I saw the rise and the disasterous fall of Farmer Owned Canadian Grain companies, the likes of UGG, MPE, AWP, and of course SWP which sometimes I still can’t believe it happened. Many today who exited their farms during that period are still being dogged by debts and judgements that carried forward with their names. I was also at the CWB table through those dark days when just about everyone turned on the CWB as the cause of there personal problems. I sometimes wish I could have kept footage of public meetings when individuals heaped UN-imaginable criticism on myself and others for the financial demise of their farms, personal bankruptcies, family breakdowns and even divorces and suicides where all pointed at, that the CWB was the reason why. People don’t care who or why a situation occurs all they want to do is blame someone for there own personal problems. And the Right -Wing Zealots of Western Canada led the way in the all out character attacks until they won the day with the Previous Harper Conservative Government to, sabotage and destroy the CWB, kill any essence of orderly marketing and single desk selling in Canada, take away from western Farmers the business contacts, the infrastructure, the contingency fund (which was in the millions and all Western Canadian Farmers Money) sell most of the assets for pennies on the dollar to a multi-national and place all the funds (I hope) to the general receipts of the Government of Canada.

So what has all this to do with the current situation of China refusing to buy Canadian Canola? Which is known as Canada’s Cinderella crop. Pretty much everything, let me explain. Firstly with China normally purchasing about 40 percent of Canada’s Canola, which amounts to billions of dollars of trade, it is no wonder the price is dropping faster then the Titanic sunk, and we may have not seen the bottom yet.

Does anyone wonder why Richardson Pioneer has been singled out in this new trade war?

Well in case you don’t know your facts, Richardson is one of the last of solely a Canadian Grain Company and as well a big player on the crushing side of Canola and canola meal. So this attack is on Canada, Canola is a Canadian oilseed developed from Rapeseed which was used for industrial oil, but Canadian plant scientist and pathologists worked endlessly to create one of the Worlds best, most popular and healthiests oils and rightfully so named it Canola as in Canadian Oil. The other multi-national companies who buy and sell canola in Canada can move this product to another Country of Origin and continue selling to China under a different disguise. This was done in the past when Canadian cereals where embargoed by certain Countries, The prices dropped in Canada to ridiculous amounts, but yet through multinationals that operated in our and other countries their exports to the country of question would go surprisingly up through one of their other country operations. However Western Canadian products may still be bought but at a much much lower price. Yes Cinderella may have just lost both her glass shoes in Canada.

So if this is a attack on our Canadian Government then we need a all out effort by the Trudeau Governemnt at this time to bring a sensible solution to a unrealistic situation. Please remember China does like and want our Canola Meal, and Canola both raw and manufactured But I would bet anything that talks have been and are going on now between Chinese importers and Canadian Multinationals as to how that product can be redirected through other countries of choice. Remember there is no maple leaf in shipments of Canola so games will be played.

So think about it how can western Canadian Farmers get strong action from the Trudeau Liberals?

I guess our Provincial Premiers could and should get the ball rolling, Oh that’s right most of them are fighting, and in Saskatchewan’s case in courts with the Federal Government over the introduction of a carbon tax. Oh well back in the day this would somehow be turned into a “its the CWB’s fault that this has happened”. So who can we blame now??

It was met with an unseemly display by the Opposition in which they repeatedly chanted, jeered, and carried on with such vigour that no one could hear the minister speak. The Speaker of the House shut down all of the microphones but it didn't help.

article continues below

I say ""unseemly"" but perhaps ""childish"" would be a better term. Yes, getting to the bottom of the Jody Wilson-Raybould affair is important but by protesting in the house during the reading of the budget speech, the Opposition did neither themselves nor the public a favour.

If I was leading the Opposition right now, I would stop talking about the whole affair and let it play out on its own. The Liberals seem to be doing a good job of shooting themselves in the foot all by themselves. They don't really need a hand at this point.

Instead, I would use the time devoted to the budget to focus on the budget. It has an interesting take on our finances going forward but perhaps more importantly, it is not the balanced budget we were promised during the last campaign and in the first budget after the election. Essentially, the government is once again putting off the payments for another year.

Why is that? And what would the Conservatives, for example, do differently?

After all, the last two times the Conservatives were in power, they ran up the national debt to record levels and in unprecedented fashion. For a party which claims to be fiscally conservative, it is hard to understand how they can be so irresponsible with our money.

Perhaps this is why Minister Morneau's speech was turned into a tantrum about a completely different issue. It allowed the members of the opposition to avoid providing an alternative vision for our finances. After all, if you can't beat them with logical sound arguments, maybe a smoke screen is the next best approach.

However, as the Conservatives have yet to provide us with a vision of how they would handle the economy, we are left to speculate based on their previous performance. And in this case the Liberals win, hands down.

The central theme of the budget was ""Investing in the Middle Class."" The Liberals argue they have been doing this since day one and it has resulted in well-paying jobs, a stronger and more connected country, and opportunities for our youth and Indigenous people.

They claim the creation of 900,000 jobs over the past four years - most of which are full time and 54 per cent going to women in the last year alone. Their stewardship has led to the lowest unemployment rate in 40 years.

Our economy hasn't led the world in growth, but that is to be expected as some countries are so far behind and racing to catch up. But within the OECD, we are doing very well and amongst the G7, we are second to the U.S.

If, as pundits often say, ""It's the economy, stupid,"" then the Liberals have done their job. They have strengthened the middle-class. They have provided a stronger economy. They have lowered unemployment or increased employment rates. They have engaged in diversification. They have done much for the average Canadian and haven't really disadvantaged the rich.

To my mind, this is one of the hallmarks defining the different approaches taken by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Under the previous Conservative governments, the approach taken was to give big tax cuts to the wealthy so they will spend their money in a way that it trickles down to the middle class. Give the rich more and everyone else will benefit.

Except it doesn't actually work. Instead, we have a ridiculous situation where the average CEO earns as much money in their first day of work in any given year as their average employee makes in 365 days. How is this allowed to happen? The Conservative argument is wealthy people will give to and provide for those less fortunate. But is this really the case?

The Liberals take a much more direct approach. Instead of providing for the top few earners and hoping the largess will wind its way downward, they are targeting the middle class directly. It is the Henry Ford approach - if you want people to buy your cars, you need to pay your workers well so they can afford them.

The budget does run a deficit, although the $22.8 billion being bandied about is over the next five years. But the deficits are a consequence of previous policy which shed responsibility by providing tax cuts to the top earners thereby limiting revenue. Federal revenue growth is falling behind real growth.

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The main opposition party in Alberta's April election is using Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a proxy foe, analysts say, channeling a long-standing sense of western alienation rather than directly attacking a popular premier.

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada's energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to ""the Notley-Trudeau alliance,"" emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada's former justice minister.

""If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it's all Rachel Notley,"" said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. ""The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.""

The UCP's focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

""(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,"" said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta's energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada's economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp's Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley's camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

""The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn't call it an alliance,"" said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. ""A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.""

Kenney was part of the federal Conservative government defeated by the Liberals in 2015. The UCP campaign declined to discuss its election strategy.

The crisis is opening rifts inside the Liberal Party and some legislators want ...","A former cabinet member at the heart of a crisis that could cost Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau his job on Friday released documents to back up her case that she had been pressured to help a large corporation avoid a corruption trial.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since February 7 over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a trial by paying a fine instead.

The crisis may well threaten Trudeau's reelection chances in a vote this October. Polls show his centre-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

Wilson-Raybould made public around 40 pages of documents revealing more details of what she said were attempts by officials to force her change her mind even after she insisted they desist.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted to Veterans Affairs Minister in January and resigned the following month, first made the allegations in almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month.

Trudeau says officials were trying to make Wilson-Raybould understand that thousands of jobs would be at risk if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty of bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau insists he and his team did nothing wrong.

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest personal aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy, Michael Wernick.

Wilson-Raybould included a recording of a phone call with Wernick last December in which he told her he was worried about ""a collision"" between her and Trudeau ""because he is pretty firm about this"".

Wilson-Raybould, who stressed she thought the call was inappropriate, told Wernick she was waiting ""for the other shoe to drop"" because she was under no illusion about how Trudeau ""gets things that he wants"".

Opposition legislators said the documents reinforced their demand for a public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau says is not necessary.

""She is actually trying to speak truth to power, trying to say, 'You can't do this,'... and it keeps happening,"" New Democratic Party parliamentarian Nathan Cullen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau's office was not immediately available for comment.

The crisis is opening rifts inside the Liberal Party and some legislators want Wilson-Raybould to be kicked out of the parliamentary caucus, a move Trudeau has so far resisted.

The report’s key findings, according to the CWTA, “shows the significant positive economic impact the industry makes when it comes to GDP, jobs and capital investment,” with year-over-year growth.

Specifically, the CWTA says “in 2017, Canada’s wireless industry contributed $27.5 billion to the Canadian GDP, an increase of 9.1% from $25.21 billion 2016.”

When it comes to jobs, the wireless sector had 151,550 full-time equivalents (FTE) jobs in 2017, an increase of 9.8% over 2016.

As for capital investments, Canadian wireless operators had spending totalling $2.92 billion in 2017, an increase of 13.2% compared to 2016.

“The Nordicity report highlights the critical contribution our industry makes to the Canadian economy,” said Robert Ghiz, President & CEO of CWTA, in a statement.







Nordicity Partner Stuart Jack said, “Our report shows that Canada’s wireless sector contribution to the Canadian GDP continues to increase and is a key growth enabler of the overall Canadian ICT sector.”

In a nutshell, the Canadian wireless industry says a report they commissioned to a third party, has concluded the Canadian wireless industry is very important in Canada.

He had a distinguished career and was well respected. He served in different departments under several ministers in governments led by the Conservative and the Liberal parties.

Wernick's retirement, as a result of the controversy surrounding SNC-Lavalin is, certainly, a sign of things to come for our country.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick leaves after testifying before a justice committee on the SNC Lavalin affair on March 6, 2019.

The political discourse has gone downhill. While we had, in the past, debates on ideas, it has now become about people. You either ""like"" or ""dislike"" a politician or a public servant. Ideas matter little.

The House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights met on several occasions to hear from former Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould and other officials — including Wernick — on the controversy surrounding the granting of a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

As a result of his testimony in front of the Justice Committee, he received insults calling him a ""traitor,"" ""dirty"" and other similar nonsensical and unfounded epithets. He asked parliamentarians to look at the emails and social media messages containing the insults — they chose not to. It was easier for the MPs in this committee to go back to the squabbling and foster more negative social media.

Wernick was right to warn Canadians about his concerns about what politics in Canada is becoming. In his presentation, he mentioned that a deterioration of the political discourse could possibly lead to political assassination and violence. Some viewed this as going too far. But you don't need to go far to show that an increasingly polarized society leads to violence. On March 21 this year, Cesar Sayor Jr. pleaded guilty in the U.S. to trying to bomb opponents of President Donald Trump in the U.S.

Social media, encouraged by the behaviour of some politicians, has enabled people to insult others without being held responsible for the language and tone used. Mr. Wernick called social media a ""vomitorium"" — and, again, he is right.

Mass/mainstream media is not without blame.

Repeating the insults, giving airtime to the childish behaviour that some politicians engage in (shouting in Question Period, banging on desks, etc.) can encourage the behaviour.

And, when looking at the main political shows on the various channels like CBC and CTV, the style is to bring in partisan individuals to comment on the news of the day. The polarization then continues to increase.

Some (often media type themselves) believe that the majority of news coverage of politics is presented with context, criticism and expert opinion. I disagree. While the ""right"" and ""left"" wings of the political spectrum blame the other (and related media) for the polarization, some simply believe that the media is not doing enough.

Our political leaders and the media should work to elevate the discourse rather than help it further deteriorate.

Where discourse is heading around the world

What happens when politics descend into the theatre of the absurd? Simple, we observe results similar to what is happening in several countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia.

In Brazil, in 2018, a politician was elected despite telling a female colleague that he wouldn't sexually assault her because ""she's not worthy of it."" He received 55.5 per cent of the votes in the national election and is now the president. A very similar situation exists in the Philippines where President Rodrigo Duterte uses language that I wouldn't repeat to describe women.

In Europe, we have people in the streets burning stores and restaurants in the centre of Paris; far-right and far-left politicians joined together to lead Italy; a surprise Brexit vote a few years ago in the U.K.; far-right politicians making gains in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Germany. In Ukraine, a newcomer on the political scene — and comedian — is now leading the polls for the upcoming presidential election.

Many of these politicians were elected because they were seen as outside the mainstream movement of politics.

It is not necessary to evoke U.S. President Donald Trump. Canadians take pains to paint Canada as ""different than the U.S.,"" as if what is happening south of the border couldn't take place here. I'm not sure that's true. We have in the U.S. a president that doesn't believe in traditional media — in Ontario, we have a premier that also doesn't believe in traditional media. Other examples abound.

'Descent into the abyss'

In Canada, the words ""traitor"" and ""corrupt"" (and many other words not worth repeating here) are being used to describe elected officials and public servants. While most politicians usually refrain themselves from using these words, they certainly — by their words and actions — encourage the descent into the abyss.

Having worked for more than 25 years around Ottawa's Parliament Hill, I have seen great politicians and public servants and observed... others. I've agreed with some and disagreed with others. But respect — if not of the individual, at least of the function — is essential for our parliamentary democracy to survive.

Former Prime Minister Harper wrote that ""the current populist upheaval is actually benign and constructive compared with what will follow if it is not addressed."" I'm not sure that the current populist upheaval is ""constructive"" or ""benign"" but I agree with him that if legitimate concerns are not addressed, the result will be worse. Interestingly, he chastises ""some leaders and much of the media"" for their response to the populist movement.

Leaders in the mainstream parties should be careful and observe what happens in other countries. Because when voters have lost complete faith in the political system, they turf out ""mainstream"" politicians to elect the extreme. It would be wiser for political strategists to look beyond the short electoral term and observe odds for long-term political survival. If the system is to survive, it needs to be reformed.

Media is saying that Wernick resigned under a cloud. The cloud hasn't gathered over Wernick; he is a distinguished gentleman that served Canada well.

While the benefit ""is no panacea ...","Investors are becoming increasingly convinced that Canada is headed towards recession.

A key indicator of rough times ahead, known as the yield curve, recently inverted for both the U.S. and Canada, something that usually happens shortly before the economy starts shrinking. Long story short, investors are betting Canada's interest rates are going to be coming down, which usually is a sign of hard times.

Couple that with the economy's surprisingly weak showing at the end of last year, and you have a recipe for trouble ahead. But one major part of the picture is signalling just the opposite: Canada's labour market, which is going from strength to strength these days.

Watch: Canada's most in-demand jobs in 2019. Story continues below.

Statistics Canada data released Monday showed there were 548,000 job vacancies nationwide in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 16.6 per cent in a year. All 10 of the largest industrial sectors saw an increase in job openings. Among provinces, only Saskatchewan saw a decrease in job openings, and only by about 500 jobs.

Even with anemic exports and consumer demand slowing down (retail sales have fallen for five of the past six months), Canadian employers are showing no signs of slowing down their hiring.

Long-term job vacancies are also on the rise, with the number of job openings sitting vacant for three months or more hitting record highs around 400,000 over the past year, according to data from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

This shortage of workers means that Canada's employers are — finally — beginning to seriously raise the wages they're offering to new hires. The average offered hourly wage in Canada jumped 5.2 per cent over the past year, to $21.10.

Ontario saw the strongest spike in offered wages, up 7.6 per cent in a year, to $21.85, though this coincided with the large increase to the province's minimum wage at the start of 2018, StatCan noted.

HuffPost Canada

The job vacancy rate ""points to further employment gains ahead,"" wrote Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank of Canada, in a client note.

But while the labour shortage is good news for those looking for work or a raise, at these elevated levels it's actually beginning to harm the economy.

A report from the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC Canada) issued in January found 53 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses say the shortage will cause them to limit business investment this year.

That's a bad sign for Canada in the longer term, because business investment is pretty much the only thing that drives job growth in the private sector.

Some businesses ""will not accept new clients, they will refuse contracts. They just can't do it,"" BDC Canada chief economist Pierre Cléroux told HuffPost Canada last month.

Skills 'mismatch'

Rangasamy believes the spike in the job vacancy rate over the past few years, as the jobless rate dropped, is a sign of ""inefficiency and (a) skills mismatch"" in Canada's labour market.

This argument is strengthened by the fact that, despite record low unemployment rates recently, the average length of unemployment in Canada is nearly as long as it was in the last recession.

Simply put, the 1.1 million people on Canada's unemployment rolls today largely don't have the skills employers are looking for (or are unwilling to work the jobs available for the pay being offered).

Policymakers are waking up to the problem.

The federal Liberals' latest budget, unveiled last week, included the creation of a new Canada Training Benefit to ""help pay for training, provide income support during training, and, with the cooperation of the provinces and territories, offer job protection so workers can take the time they need to keep their skills relevant,"" according to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC).

That program is also meant to address the growing risk of automation, with one in 10 Canadian jobs at ""high risk"" of being replaced by machines, ESDC said.

She outlined a two-pronged strategy beginning with a rebate of up to $5,000 to purchase a vehicle powered by an electric battery or hydrogen fuel cell and with a price up to $45,000. The government has committed $300 million over three years to that program.

Added to that, businesses who buy them will be eligible for a full write-off on their capital cost allowance in the year of purchase, compared to 30% per year allowed for gas-fueled vehicles. And the limit will be $55,000 plus sales tax, up from $30,000.

""This can become a hugely, hugely important incentive for fleets to change over to zero-emission vehicles,"" Bennett said during a media event at the University of Northern British Columbia.

In answer to a concern the $45,000 cap will limit the choice of vehicles people can purchase and still get the incentive, Bennett said those looking at pricier vehicles, ""probably don't need the rebate to make that choice.""

However, she said it's possible the made-in-Canada Chrysler Pacifica minivan could be included at a future date.

The incentive was included in the federal budget released earlier this month, as was a $130-million commitment over five years to establish more charging stations across the country. It comes on top of $182.5 million committed to that cause in previous budgets.

""We want to make it easier for Canadians to make greener choices by making it more convenient to use electric vehicles,"" Bennett said, speaking from a podium placed between two electric-powered vehicles and in front of one of the two charging stations on the UNBC campus.

Suzanne Goldberg of ChargePoint, who also attended the event, said a target for the number of charging stations the $130 million should deliver has not yet been set but the previous commitment of $182.5 million was to support about 900 of them.

The aim is to have all vehicles sold in Canada being zero-emission by 2040. In the lead up, gas-free vehicles would make up 10% of market by 2025, and 30% by 2030 under the strategy.

The transportation sector accounts for 25% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions and three-quarter of that come from trucks, cars and commercial vehicles, Bennett said.",Federal Liberal showcases electric vehicle strategy in Northern B.C.,Alaska Highway News,https://www.alaskahighwaynews.ca/regional-news/federal-liberal-showcases-electric-vehicle-strategy-in-northern-b-c-1.23775622

HALIFAX — Nova Scotia's Liberal government took steps to renew its struggling health care system in a balanced budget Tuesday, though critics say the efforts are incomplete and poorly targeted.

Finance Minister Karen Casey introduced her government's fourth consecutive balanced budget, projecting a thin $33.6-million surplus for 2019-20, on planned spending of about $11 billion.

There are no increases in taxes or fees, but more than $178 million in additional funds from Ottawa are helping cover the costs.

Spending increases by Premier Stephen McNeil's government are sprinkled in small increments including more funding targeted at homecare, new tax credits to assist new firms, and new public awareness programs that will begin as the sales of edible marijuana products start up.

However, the Liberals biggest spending increase by far is in the health budget.

The government confirmed $157 million in capital grants for ""the largest health care redevelopment projects in Nova Scotia history,"" at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Centre in Halifax and the Cape Breton Regional Health Centre in Sydney.

The budget notes that 120 long-term care beds will eventually be added as part of the Cape Breton project, as well as beds that are part of replacement projects in Meteghan and Mahone Bay, but these additions won't be coming this year.

In addition, the budget for the Nova Scotia Health Authority — the province's merged health agency — is up $57.2 million.

Overall, when compared to last year's budget estimate, spending on health would grow by more than $191 million over the amount spent in 2018-19.

Casey devoted close to a quarter of her speech to the province's health care system, which has come under continuing criticism for hospital crowding, doctor shortages and high numbers of pressure injuries among nursing home residents.

""When we looked at what the needs were and what the province could afford we were certainly identifying health as a priority,"" she told reporters just before speaking in the legislature.

The province's health spending has grown by almost one fifth in five years to $4.6 billion, consuming a steadily rising percentage of the government's revenues.

However, a portion of this year's projected increase is the result of health transfer and equalization payments from the federal government, which make up about one-third of all Nova Scotia's revenues.

This included an agreement that provided an additional $28.5 million for mental health care.

The province is also planning $16.8-million for home care, and another $10-million for collaborative care centres to help battle the persistent shortage of family doctors.

The province's opposition parties criticized McNeil's government for failing to spend enough on what they said are some of the root causes of the province's health care problems.

""The government can spend more money but the delivery of health care is not improving,"" said Tory Leader Tim Houston.

""Health care in this province is getting worse and worse.""

Meanwhile, NDP Leader Gary Burrill said hospitals will continue to be too crowded, and as a result people will wait hours in emergency rooms.

He diagnoses the lack of nursing home care beds as among the key root causes, and noted there was little in the budget to address the shortfalls.

""It's a dumpster full of disappointment ... Every front line health care worker says the source of this is there's an inadequate supply of long-term care beds to move people out of hospitals,"" he said.

McNeil defended his government's health spending, saying it will make a difference in service delivery.

The premier pointed to doctor-recruitment initiatives such as 15 new residency seats and a program that attaches foreign-trained doctors to family practices in order to help them get their Canadian credentials faster. He said the investments in health infrastructure will also make a difference.

""People are recognizing that in order to recruit and retain health care providers we need new and modern infrastructure and this budget reflects that.""

On average, homes are twice the cost here than in the U.S., though traditionally the two numbers have been at parity. Even with some easing in ...","With last week’s budget, Ottawa reversed course somewhat on measures to cool the country’s overheated housing market. Having tightened borrowing rules to reduce the risk of people defaulting on their mortgages and help ease the unsustainable upward pressure on home prices, the government is looking to make borrowing easier for first-time buyers.

Over three years, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) will make up to $1.25 billion available under the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive. The program will provide such buyers a shared equity mortgage equal to five per cent of the cost of a resale home or 10 per cent for new construction. Only households with annual incomes of less than $120,000 qualify, with the maximum mortgage value set at four times household income.

The maximum rate will cover the average sale price in much of the country, but not in the particularly troublesome markets of Toronto and Vancouver, where average prices are $765,000 and $925,000 respectively.

The budget also boosts the Home Buyers’ Plan (HBP) tax-free RRSP withdrawal limit to $35,000 from $25,000.

The government’s moves are something of a pre-election sop for millennials – the entire budget is an attempt at vote-buying, of course – and will be welcomed by groups that balked at the previous measures, particularly those who profit on the backs of homebuyers. They want to see the government back into pumping the real estate market that’s driven a good chunk of the economy while putting Canadians even deeper into debt, all the while excluding growing numbers of people with artificially high prices.

The bigger picture must be taken into account, particularly the on-again, off-again bursting of the housing bubble.

A series of reports, from agencies with no horse in the race, raises doubts about the sustainability of a decade-long upward trend that slowed only marginally during the worst of the 2008 recession, the same one that continues to plague housing prices in parts of the U.S.

There are glaring differences between the housing markets in the two countries. Where the U.S. wilted under foreclosures and soft sales, the Canadian market remained hot in many quarters. On average, homes are twice the cost here than in the U.S., though traditionally the two numbers have been at parity.

Even with some easing in Vancouver and Toronto, average home prices remain far out of reach of many residents.

None of that sounds sustainable. Some economists and market watchers are waiting on a correction. Still, there are plenty of us who see housing as a safe investment, unlike, for instance, the stock market, which remains volatile. Both markets are a gamble, however, and both were and continue to be heavily manipulated by the financial sector, the very industry responsible for the systemic corruption at the root of our economic woes.

Speculation, of course, is another word for gambling. When you buy stocks, you’re betting they’ll go up in price (or down, if you’re shorting). Other than securities, there are a host of speculative investments for those willing to take the risk. Speculation also extends to the housing market. This applies not only to people who buy homes to flip them, or farmland in the hope of a future subdivision, but to many who’ve entered the housing market in recent years.

Moves that counter risk and end the speculative aspect of real estate can only be a good thing. The real goal is housing people, after all, and the lower the price, the better.","Looking for votes, Liberals change tack on housing issues",ObserverXtra,https://observerxtra.com/2019/03/28/looking-for-votes-liberals-change-tack-on-housing-issues/

Earlier this month, Chinese authorities cancelled the sale license for Winnipeg-based Richardson International, a major Canadian canola distributor. The Chinese claimed that the decision was made because the canola was contaminated, but they have failed to produce any evidence to prove their claim. This week, the ban was extended to Regina-based Viterra Inc. on the same basis. In fact, orders from China have disappeared across a number of canola sellers.

We all know and understand the importance of agriculture for the Canadian economy. The sector employs many of our family members, friends, and neighbours both directly and indirectly. On top of that, Canada exports more canola than any other country in the world. In 2018, about 40% of our canola went to China – worth around $2.7 billion. This is why it’s important that the Government of Canada act swiftly and decisively to resolve this situation.

Without question, the accusations levelled by China are baseless. Farmers right here in southeast Manitoba and across Canada produce quality canola. That’s why we know that China’s decision to block our canola imports has nothing to do with the quality of our canola and everything to do with the quality of their relationship with Justin Trudeau.

The Prime Minister’s missteps on the world stage are hurting Canadian farmers, but if he works with parliamentarians across party lines, we can address this situation.

The main opposition Liberals and the second opposition Québec Solidaire caucus remained seated Thursday ...","QUEBEC — Teachers, judges, lawyers, transit commissions, municipalities, school boards and the staff of provincial government bodies would be bound by the Coalition Avenir Québec’s proposed bill enshrining “the laicity of the state.”

Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette called the bill “the logical followup” to Quebec’s Quiet Revolution, a period of rapid social change in the 1960s, when the role of the Roman Catholic Church in education and health care was scaled back.

The bill would amend Quebec’s human rights charter to affirm the religious neutrality or “laicity” of the state.

A ban on wearing religious signs by designated officials, including the Speaker and Deputy Speakers of the Quebec National Assembly would be imposed under Bill 21, which the government of Premier François Legault hopes to see adopted before the assembly’s summer adjournment.

The bill, presented Thursday, also includes two notwithstanding clauses to override guarantees in the Quebec and Canadian human rights charters protecting fundamental rights, including religious freedom.

“It’s a very important day today,” Legault told reporters on his way into the assembly.

“What I want to try to do in the next few weeks is to unite as many Quebecers as possible.”

And he appealed for a “serene debate,” although Quebec’s human rights commission and religious minorities in the province have expressed opposition to the bill even before it was presented.

Legault said the issue of dealing with religious differences has been left unresolved in the province for too long, calling his bill “an important act” to resolve an issue that should have been dealt with “years ago.”

In Halifax Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said “it is unthinkable for me to legitimize, in a free society, discrimination against citizens based on their religion.”

To get more support for his bill, making Quebec officially a secular state, the premier said, he has agreed to remove the crucifix from the National Assembly and has agreed to a “grandfather clause” that would allow teachers who wear them on the job to continue to do so.

“Because my goal is really to unite Quebecers,” he explained.

Bill 21 makes no mention of the crucifix, leaving it to the assembly to decide. However, the assembly voted unanimously Thursday morning to remove it.

Judges in the province have told the government they cannot be bound by a ban on religious signs, under the separation of powers protecting the judiciary. The bill calls on Quebec’s Conseil de la magistrature to enforce the ban.

Bill 21 does not appear to apply to federally-appointed judges, named to Quebec Superior Court, Federal Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal.

While teachers, principals and vice principals in public schools would be subject to the ban on religious signs, their counterparts in Quebec’s subsidized private schools could still wear religious signs.

In Quebec, there are few religious signs worn by judges, prosecutors or peace officers. Some teachers, who are Muslims, do wear the hijab head covering. In addition to judges, court staff such as clerks, sheriffs and bankruptcy registrars could not wear religious signs on the job.

The ban would apply to Quebec prosecutors and persons designated by the National Assembly, as well as police and other peace officers.

Bill 21 also includes provisions banning the Islamic niqab and other face coverings, with such a ban applying to elected members of the National Assembly, municipal councillors, school board commissioners, National Assembly and Lieutenant Governor’s staff, and peace officers.

The ban on face coverings applies to doctors, dentists and midwives and daycare staff.

As well, people seeking public services, such as driving tests or health care and those boarding public transit could be refused these services if they refused to uncover their faces.

Exceptions are allowed for reasons of health, disability “or because of the requirements tied to their functions or the performance of certain tasks.”

The Parti Québécois, now the third opposition in the assembly, with nine seats, said it would be willing to support Legault’s bill if he agreed to a grandfather clause, allowing affected employees now wearing religious signs, to continue to do so.

Islanders will go to the polls April 23 in a provincial election announced late Tuesday.

Recent polls have put the Greens out in front, and leader Peter Bevan-Baker believes his party can win a province that has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

“That possibility is there. Emotionally, politically and intellectually, I feel like I’m ready for that challenge, in a way that I wasn’t perhaps a year ago,” he said.

“This could be a truly historic moment not only in Canadian politics but for the future of our grandchildren.”

READ MORE: Liberal premier calls Prince Edward Island election for April 23

Bevan-Baker, 56, grew up in Scotland and immigrated to Canada in 1985, living in Newfoundland and then Ontario before settling in Prince Edward Island in 2003. He became a Canadian citizen in 1992.

A dentist by profession, he became his party’s first member of the P.E.I. legislature in 2015, following nine unsuccessful bids provincially and nationally for the party.

Since then, the Greens captured a second seat on the Island, and have been successful in getting members elected in other provinces, including three during last year’s New Brunswick election.

Bevan-Baker – who celebrated Tuesday’s election call by playing “First Call” on his trumpet at a nomination meeting – said he believes the time for the Green party has arrived.

“That sort of global movement away from conventional politics and unimaginative politicians, you see that expressed everywhere,” he said, citing recent elections in U.S. and Ontario as expressions of disgruntlement with conventional politics.

“I think what’s happening on P.E.I. is a local expression of that global phenomenon,” he said.

WATCH: New Brunswick election: Elizabeth May congratulations Greens for big win

A Corporate Research Associates opinion poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

Bevan-Baker said that both delights and surprises him. He said he has to accept the possibility of forming government.

“We’ve crafted a platform, that for perhaps the first time ever in Canada, a Green platform that might have to be implemented. You come at it with a different lens. You can’t be just aspirational and vague and uncosted. You have to have a detailed and costed platform, which we have,” he said.

But Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan has issued a caution about the Green party, saying the province’s future is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments.

Bevan-Baker said he’s not sure what MacLauchlan is referring to, but believes it could be his suggestion that P.E.I. would be a good place for a pilot program for a universal basic income. He said that would be expensive at first, but pay off in the long run.

For his part, MacLauchlan used the first full day of the campaign to promise at least 3,500 new jobs over the next four years.

He said that’s in addition to the 5,000 full-time jobs added over the last four years.

“As I have said numerous times since I became premier, the creation of jobs and job choices for Islanders has to be the number one priority of government.”

“Our record in this field is strong. However, our present success is no reason to take the foot off the gas. Support for workers, for employers and for the next generations of workers needs to continue.”

The announcement includes a $4.5 million P.E.I. Worker Benefit to assist 12,600 low-income Islanders.

The Liberals would also spend $750 million on infrastructure programs to improve roads, bridges and schools, with a focus on job creation.

MacLauchlan said money would also be spent on a number of training programs, including new vocational facilities at Island high schools, and the small business tax rate would be reduced to 2.5 per cent by 2020.

Repeated calls requesting an interview with Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King were not returned Wednesday.

Bevan-Baker said his party’s platform will be released in its entirety – likely next week.

While the parties have begun to pitch their issues, Don Desserud, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said he believes the election will come down to personalities.

“It’s going to be an election based on the personalities of the leaders and people are going to vote according to whether they like or dislike the leaders of the parties,” Desserud said.

“The Progressive Conservatives are rising in the polls. The Liberals are falling in the polls and the Greens are staying quite steady high in the polls. I think it all has to do with the leaders and how well they’re liked,” he said.

The Island economy has been strong and the Conference Board of Canada recently said P.E.I. would lead the country in economic growth for the year ahead.

Desserud said voters blame the government when the economy is bad, but unfortunately for the Liberals, they don’t often credit the government with the economy is good.

The company secured the funding from existing investors including Green Acre Capital, alongside new investors including Newstrike Brands, a Canadian licensed producer whose strategic partners include The Tragically Hip.

“This financing will enable Green Tank to capitalize on new opportunities on a global scale.”

“This financing will enable Green Tank to capitalize on new opportunities on a global scale,” said Corey Koffler, Green Tank’s COO. “It will allow us to achieve our innovation goal of producing the highest performing vape technology on the market and to become the premiere B2B solution for our brand partners around the world.”

The company, which launched in 2016 by brothers Dustin and Corey Koffler, experienced annual revenue growth of nearly 300 percent last year. It is now working alongside more than 130 brands, and has signed partnerships with over a dozen licensed producers in Canada.

Green Tank said the capital will be used to help the company scale operations, accelerate product innovation, and attract top talent. The funding comes at a pivotal time for the company after the legalization of recreational cannabis came into effect last October, permitting the legal sale of cannabis vapes across Canada.

According to BDS Analytics, vaping is quickly becoming the top cannabis consumption method for recreational and medical use in the United States. In California, vaporizers account for approximately 30 percent of all legal cannabis transactions.

“Our strategic investment in Green Tank underscores our vision of building a premier consumer brand for the adult recreational market, with significant emphasis on the vape category,” said Mark E. Burton, chief strategy officer of Newstrike Brands. “We expect vape products to be a significant part of our overall revenue profile and we are excited to be working closely with Green Tank to design and deliver highly innovative vaporization hardware specifically designed to work seamlessly with our unique cannabis extracts.”

Last year, Green Tank raised a $4.3 million seed round from Toronto-based Green Acre Capital and Snoop Dogg’s venture capital firm Casa Verde.

According to Green Tank, consumer demand, led by vaporizers, is driving cannabis concentrates toward a projected $8 billion USD in retail sales over the next three years, outpacing growth in traditional cannabis flower sales. Vape sales are expected to hit $6.5 billion within the same timeframe.

Health Blue-green algae can have major effects on Canadian lakes Thursday, March 28th 2019, 2:41 pm - New research indicates an increase in blue-green algae found in Canadian lakes may have longterm effects. If you’re a Canadian cottager, your lake, or one nearby, has likely experienced a blue-green algae bloom in the past decade. Until recently, however, any health concern was limited to those who might have had direct contact with the algae, either by drinking the water or swimming in it. But new research out of Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) reveals that particles can become airborne and travel, getting into the lungs of those as far away as two kilometres from the algae itself. RELATED: Blue-green algae made a stink in Toronto last summer Blue-green algae is cyanobacteria, which contains the toxins microcystin and BAMA, both of which are dangerous to humans and animals. What isn’t yet known is at what levels they cause negative health issues and over what length of exposure. SEE BELOW: THE EFFECTS OF BLUE-GREEN ALGAE

Michael Parsons, a professor of marine science at FGCU and one of the researchers, isn’t sounding the alarm yet, though he says more research is crucial to find out whether these detectable levels of toxins can negatively impact health. “There are World Health Organization guidelines that say don’t get in the water if the microcystin concentrations are above a certain level,” says Parsons. “But for the air, there are no strict guidelines around when you should be avoiding the air or not breathing without a filtration device and so forth.” What’s more, he says, “we have no idea how long these toxins stay in our system.”

The bacteria can be found in almost every Canadian lake, David Schindler, a professor of ecology at the University of Alberta, told CBC News last summer, after the deaths of three dogs in New Brunswick were blamed on the bacteria. Most of us don’t notice the presence of the bacteria until we can see it in the form of a bloom and, often, smell it.

John Cassani’s primary concern is chronic exposure. Cassani is the Calusa Waterkeeper in southwest Florida for the Waterkeeper Alliance, a global organization dedicated to preserving water quality. He says that a lot of people are nervous about these new findings. “We’d all like to know more about what it means,” he says, noting that these blue-green algae blooms are happening more frequently and covering a broader area.

Until we get more answers, Parsons encourages cottagers to stay out of the water (and keep pets out) when there’s a bloom. And, he says, “listen to your body. If it smells bad, and you’re not feeling well, avoid the area.”

With Recipe Unlimited — an ownership organization which counts Harvey’s, Swiss Chalet and the Keg among its 16 restaurants — banning plastic straws and the Ontario government exploring the same notion, the co-founder of Cambridge’s Green Circle Dine Ware is looking to be a Canadian power player in the shift from plastic to paper straws.

Ramping up production with a three-man crew, which includes himself and co-founder Ravi Kesh, to establish an inventory at the Sheldon Drive facility, the Guelph resident said talks are in the works with potential customers to try and break into the market soon.

Their line of paper straws and eco-friendly dinnerware was recently launched at a restaurant expo in Toronto.

The dinnerware is being manufactured at his father’s plant in India, as the palm leaves used to produce the plates and bowls would begin to rot or grow fungus during shipment to Canada. However, it will be distributed here.

“What we’re doing is very initial phases of, I would say, selling a product,” Sheth said of the naturally biodegradable plates, dishes and their specialty, paper straws.

“What we’re doing is sending out quotes and pricing, and a lot of people have special requirements in terms of, let’s say, a wrapper or individually wrapping the straws or printing something on the straws. So we’re just trying to entertain them depending on their needs. That’s what we’re doing at this point.”

While Green Circle may be a little behind globally in the paper straw party, they are one of the first in Canada to break into the industry. Sheth said it was important for him to do proper research into the product, as he’s seen paper straws that just don’t hold up to hot and cold drinks.

“They are not to the quality to sip through a drink for two to three hours,” said Sheth, whose company was bolstered with $30,000 seed funding through Innovation Guelph’s Fuel Injection program.

After a fourth quarter of 2018 that included short attacks, lawsuits, and a hostile takeover bid, the company entered 2019 with a major management shakeup that fundamentally transformed the company.

For months afterward, it was all quiet on the Aphria front. But now, the company is back in the news with an announcement that it has received clearance from Health Canada to pursue a major expansion project. This news is a signal that Aphria could be gearing up for even more growth after increasing revenue 154% year over year in its most recent quarter. To understand why this news is so big, we need to take a look at what exactly Health Canada approved.

Health Canada approves expansion

For marijuana growers, nothing is more important than production space. The ability to meet the growing demand for cannabis in this country requires significant grow space, and so far, the cannabis growers don’t have enough of it. As a result, the post legalization era has been marked by major supply shortages.

For Aphria, that may be about to change. Earlier this month, Health Canada approved an 800,000-square-foot expansion to the Aphria One grow space in Leamington. This new space will have the capacity to produce 110,000 kg of marijuana a year for about $800 million in revenue at the current cannabis selling price.

$1 billion in revenue predicted

Partially as a result of the recent expansion, Aphria is now forecasting $1 billion in revenue by the end of 2020. The math behind this makes sense given the figures above: the space the company is adding will be able to generate $800 million a year, and that’s on top of the company’s existing space, which drove about $13 million in sales in the most recent quarter. This would represent phenomenal revenue growth, the only question being whether demand for cannabis will be strong enough to justify it.

Takeover seems unlikely

A final point about Aphria is worth mentioning — this one pertaining to the much-discussed hostile takeover bid from Green Growth Brands.

Thanks to all the good news coming from Aphria, it seems unlikely that the Green Growth bid will go through. The all-stock bid valued Aphria at about $9, but with the company’s meteoric growth, its stock has risen to $13 so far this year. Assuming this price level holds, Aphria will be well out of Green Growth’s reach. This is good news for Aphria shareholders, since it means they won’t be forced to exchange each of their shares for 1.5 shares in a much less proven enterprise. This, combined with the recently approved expansion, indicates that this once maligned company may have a bright future ahead of it.

The last time I ate at 100 Laurier, it was still called the Canadian Museum of Civilization — I was 13; it was a cafeteria, nothing “spectacle,” as they say across the river.

Now, with Bistro Boreal, there are more varied and sophisticated food offerings. Located on the Laurier side of the building, the restaurant is a calm space that mirrors the museum’s graceful curves. (Though it’s a shame it doesn’t take in the waterfront view.)

The menu offers plenty of meat and cheese dishes, as well as creative sandwiches and salads. The salmon rillettes, for example, is presented as a tower of diced salmon atop stone-milled toast, adorned with a caper aioli and pickled red onion. Salmon can be light, but this is different, and the richness is welcome on a chilly day. The wilted micro-greens tossed haphazardly on top, however, signal an issue with the ingredients, the service, or some combination of the two.

Those same greens appear on my open-faced chicken sandwich. The meat portion is huge and surprisingly moist. We are excited to see mention of “local” regarding the brie; however, when asked about the source, the server replies “somewhere in Quebec.” In the end, the chicken overwhelms the brie.

On another lunch visit, the soup of the day is a creamy, subtle purée of carrot and squash with maple notes. The braised-beef poutine is good, though it would benefit from a tangy element. The bison burger is cooked to perfection, and the grilled naan wrap — with juicy chunks of chicken breast in an aioli sauce — is a hit. And the fries are excellent.

Desserts include a bread pudding that is more like fruitcake, but that’s fine — it is warm and comforting and much better than the typical museum café treats. Servers are friendly, but not well informed about the menu. The drinks list offers Canadian and international choices in beer and wine, and a display of Quebec gin hints at an effort to connect with its suppliers.

Overall, there is a sense that Boreal is a cafeteria growing up into the kind of modern eatery people are coming to expect. There are hits and misses at Boreal, but it is heading in the right direction.

Jeremiah Rodriguez, CTVNews.ca Staff





Two Canadian brothers Nick and Will Laporte have been stranded after Icelandic budget airline WOW Air shut down on Thursday.

Nick was set to fly to Sweden from Toronto while his brother Will was scheduled to fly back home to Toronto from Sweden. But both of their flights were cancelled, with both brothers saying they were confused by the lack of clear communication from the airline.

Icelandic budget airline WOW Air ceased operations on Thursday, stranding passengers across two continents. In a statement on its website, the airline, which had earlier suspended all its flights, told passengers there would be no further flights and advised them to check for flights with other airlines for ways to reach their destinations.

Nick told CTV News Channel that -- on his way to the airport -- he initially received a text message from WOW Airlines stating his flight would be delayed by half an hour.

“So no big deal,” he recalled thinking. But the flight kept being pushed back. Nick said after some confusion over the status of the flight, it was eventually cancelled for good.

Will was genuinely thankful for the “very helpful” airport staff not associated with the airline. “I know there were some frustrated passengers that weren’t exactly polite to these people. So it was a tough situation all-around,” he said.

Meanwhile, his brother Will was headed home to Canada after wrapping up his hockey season in Sweden.

He’s now stranded in Osby, Sweden. He told CTV News Channel that he had initially received an email stating his flight was being delayed by 10 hours.

“But this morning, I read the news that they were no longer running their airline … it’s very disappointing,” Will said. He was later informed by an airline employee he “wasn’t entitled to a refund.”

His brother Nick said he’s since had difficulty reaching any representative from WOW Airlines, but has seen that Icelandic Airlines is offering discounted flights to stranded passengers if they filled out a form.

“I’m waiting to hear back from them and as soon as I get the green light for discounted airfare, I’ll be on my way to Iceland,” he said. Nick will ultimately be headed to Sweden for a training camp he hopes can help him qualify for the men’s 100-metre sprint at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

“So I’m just kind of sitting tight until then,” he said.

Three students from Kitchener were also affected by the shuttering. They were returning home from Copenhagen and only realized something was wrong when they reached the airline’s front desk and realized no one was there.

Erin McBurney told CTV Kitchener they had to take a costly $1,300 detour in order to return to Toronto. She said their only other options at the time were a $2,000 three-day flight with Air Canada with layovers or a $5,000 direct flight through another airline.

Other passengers have taken to twitter to voice their own frustrations with the flight cancellations.

The Green Organic Dutchman (TGOD), one of Canada's fastest-growing pot producers, applied for a bylaw exemption last summer to allow a 123,000-square-foot cannabis greenhouse at the corner of Jerseyville and Alberton roads. The current rural size limit in Hamilton for pot is 20,000 square feet.

Council rejected the proposal last year over the advice of its own planners, spurring an appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

A hearing was expected later this year — but council voted late Wednesday to sign off on a settlement proposal, although with unspecified conditions.

Related Content Take a tour of Green Organic Dutchman as it tries to woo Hamilton

The organic pot grower celebrated the settlement in a release that said the decision will ""allow TGOD to operate its cannabis greenhouse in Ancaster"" and start growing by June with a staff of up to 85 people. The company embarked on a lobbying and charm offensive after the fall election in the hopes council would reconsider.

Details of the settlement and proposed city conditions are still secret, so it was not immediately clear if the original planned size of the contentious greenhouse — about one-fifth as big as Lime Ridge Mall — was endorsed by council.

Mayor Fred Eisenberger did not take part in the vote because he is an investor in the company.

TGOD originally earned criticism from some politicians, particularly Ancaster Coun. Lloyd Ferguson, for starting to build the big greenhouse before earning permission to do so.

Ferguson had pushed to fight the proposal, arguing ""monster"" pot greenhouses could pop up across rural Hamilton.

After the city issued a stop work order last year, TGOD applied for an alternate permit to continue building the greenhouse — only for potted mums.","Hamilton settles with medical pot grower, the Green Organic Dutchman, to allow ‘monster’ Ancaster greenhouse",The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9246102-hamilton-settles-with-medical-pot-grower-the-green-organic-dutchman-to-allow-monster-ancaster-greenhouse/

A regular on the undervalued TSX ...","They’re held up as all-weather investments, battle-ready and immune to recession, but could it be that some of Canada’s biggest banks may in fact be vulnerable to a market downturn south of the border? Post-yield curve inversion, let’s take a look at one of the most America-exposed of the Big Six, as well as one regional alternative, plus a member of the elite FAANGs that wants to take over your finances.

Toronto-Dominion Bank (TSX:TD)(NYSE:TD)

TD Bank is fairly exposed to the U.S., and its customer base south of the border may become something of an issue for Canadian investors should the spectre of an American recession materialize into something more tangible. While TD Bank’s stats themselves show little indication of risk, the bank’s position in the U.S. could become problematic should a downturn become a reality (as could others), and investors might start acting on it.

Down 3.07% in the last five days, could the biggest bank on the TSX index be already reacting to news of the American yield curve inversion? Trading at a 37% discount against its future cash flow value, the home of the green leather armchair boasts a slick P/E of 12.1 times earnings, while its one-year past earnings growth of 10.6% is identical to the of the TSX index itself, and very close to the Canadian banking average.

Laurentian Bank of Canada (TSX:LB)

A regular on the undervalued TSX index stocks lists, Laurentian Bank of Canada offers a more Canada-centric option for fans of financials with a more local flavour. Its negative past-year earnings rate is compensated by a five-year average earnings growth of 14.3%, beating the Canadian banking average of 8.6% for the same period, and signifying a solid overall track record.

One area in which TD Bank has the upper hand over Laurentian Bank of Canada is in its tolerance for bad loans, which is higher than that of the latter stock. However, this is a weak spot for the majority of bank on the TSX index, including some of the Big Six. Laurentian Bank of Canada is a strong, undervalued antidote to the usual big name bankers, and pays a handsome dividend yield of 6.25%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Leaning heavily into its reputation for security, Apple is preparing to muscle in on your banking habits with the introduction of its new Apple Card. This new credit card will potentially be available with a spread of APR rates, opening it up to a range of income brackets. They’ll be going in with Goldman Sachs Group to offer the new initiative, which may offer low interest rates to customers with good credit scores.

One might expect better stats from one of the top stocks on the NASDAQ, and while a one-year past earnings growth of 17.7% and five-year average 6.8% are positive, they may denote a market that’s close to saturation. Meanwhile, a P/E of 15.6 times earnings is standard, though a PEG of 5.4 times growth and P/B of 7.7 times book show where the overvaluation is lurking.

The bottom line

TD Bank’s dividend yield of 4.05%, matched with a good-enough 9.7% expected annual growth in earnings, makes for the strongest reason to be invested in this heavyweight TSX index banker. However, U.S. exposure could be a worry, and could lead to real changes in Canadian investment behaviours down the line. Laurentian Bank of Canada makes for a potentially better buy for a defensive investor, meanwhile, and a decently valued one at that.

The Yellowknife Co-op recently installed a hydroponic greenhouse on its property. Its general manager hopes to start selling homegrown leafy greens and fresh herbs in four to six weeks time.

""We've had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce or Canadian produce,"" said manager Justin Nelson.

""There was an opportunity to get involved in a hydroponic greenhouse, so we decided to do an investment in it. We just want to provide to our members some locally-grown produce.""

We've had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce. - Justin Nelson, manager

Hydroponics are systems for growing plants in water— without soil. The co-op's food is growing in a greenhouse made out of an upgraded shipping container from Ottawa-based company The Growcer.

The Growcer's greenhouses use water enriched with nutrients, an artificial light source and carbon dioxide to grow plants ""as quickly as possible,"" said Corey Ellis, a company co-founder. He said the greenhouses can grow seeds into full plants in about six weeks.

The greenhouse, from Ottawa-based company The Growcer, is made out of an upgraded shipping container and is meant for use in cold climates. (Submitted by Yellowknife Co-op)

The sea cans are outfitted to keep plants growing when outside temperatures drop as low as -52 C. Ellis said the greenhouses use about as much electricity as an air conditioner that's running 24/7.

He said the Yellowknife Co-op should be able to stock its vegetables the same day they are harvested, ""which is pretty unique and I think something [customers] will really appreciate.""

The Yellowknife Co-op's sea can greenhouse isn't the first in the North. Ellis said his company has installed them in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, and Kuujjuaq, Que., as well.

Right now, the Co-op is growing kale, spinach and bok choi, as well as a variety of lettuces and herbs.

Nelson said the plants are pesticide-free and when harvested, are expected to be fresher and last longer than their counterparts trucked up from the South.

If all goes well, he said, the store will harvest about 400 plants a week.

Curious Yellowknife Co-op shoppers will be able to watch the in-house farming live.

Cameras have been set up in the greenhouse and the plan is to broadcast a livestream onto a large-screen TV set up in the produce department, said Nelson.

Nelson said the idea is not to produce a cheaper vegetable.

""Power and heat up here isn't cheap, so this isn't something to subsidize produce here,"" he said. ""Produce is cheap, it's no different than other locations in the South.""

The hope is to make a profit off the home-grown greens, said Nelson, and then return those profits to co-op members.

Though he declined to talk about how much the greenhouse costs, Nelson did say he is ""feeling pretty cool"" and ""pretty happy"" about the operation.",Yellowknife Co-op to sell homegrown greens,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-co-op-hydroponic-greenhouse-1.5053970

Westway LAB, Portugal’s first showcase festival and professional music conference, will take place for the sixth consecutive year from 10th to 13th of April in Guimarães, Portugal. Founded in 2014 with a clear mission: to operate a cultural, social and economic transformation through music, crossing borders enabling the construction of sustainable internationalization of artists and professionals from Portugal. During the 4 day event, Guimarães becomes a music city, combining in an innovative way the realization of an event based with three dimensions: Process (artist residencies), Thought (PRO Conferences) and Product (showcases and headline concerts).

According to Rui Torrinha, artistic director of the festival, “continuing to think about the cosmos from this unique place has made Westway LAB a powerful world of possibilities on a human scale, in which the time and space generated have allowed us to recover the original meaning of the word … quality. Not everything here can be said, so discover it and let yourself be discovered but do not miss out, because the spirit is of inclusion.”

And Canada’s stars will be shining soon in Guimarães when the CIMA gang heads to sunny Portugal for a Canadian Country Showcase at Westway Festival! “The Canadian Independent Music Association (CIMA) is always striving to increase export markets for our stakeholders. Westway LAB has an excellent reputation in Europe as a small but bustling festival and conference. We are honoured to have Canada selected as their country of focus for the 2019 edition. The focus on Canada not only strengthens relationships and opportunities between the Portuguese and Canadian delegates but also allows another opportunity for other countries in Europe and abroad to draw their eyes on the talent we have in Canada,” says Trisha Carter, CIMA’s Music Export Manager. “Westway LAB has provided our delegation of artists and companies with curated business-to-business events, market development, showcase opportunities and artistic collaboration. We are proud to include 10 established business professionals from coast to coast and a group of 5 diverse artists within our Westway LAB Canadian contingent. We anticipate great results from this initiative.”

LES DEUXLUXES

Formed by Anna Frances Meyer (vocals & guitar) and Étienne Barry (drums, guitar & vocals, simultaneously), Montreal duo Les Deuxluxes are armed to the teeth with powerful vocals, primal rhythms and two raging guitars. The two-piece band has attitude and the chops to back it up as they mix glitter and sweat into their own fiery blend of rock ‘n roll.

In September 2016, Les Deuxluxes released Springtime Devil, their critically-acclaimed very first album. It offers a collection of 9 songs ranging from fiery rhythms to sexier, heavier melodies. Since then, they’ve stolen the show at many large-scale festivals and toured extensively in Canada, Europe and all across Latin America. Managed by BonSound out of Montreal check them out!

MEGAN NASH

On her new album, Seeker, Saskatchewan Juno Nominee singer/songwriter Megan Nash collaborates with ambient/alt-rock unit Bears In Hazenmore with brilliant results. In sharp contrast to the starkness of her previous acclaimed album Song Harvest Volume One, Seeker takes Nash’s roots-based songwriting into a bold new sonic territory, displaying the undeniable chemistry she has forged with the group over the past year. That shared excitement was the hallmark of the sessions that produced Seeker over the winter of 2017 with engineer Orion Paradis (Library Voices), held at Soul Sound, a space shared with a contemporary dance studio. The flexibility of the location offered Nash the freedom to fully explore the range of her new material, from the atmospheric “Girl Vs Ocean” and “Summer,” to the anthemic “Lavender & Leather” and “Bad Poetry.”But as the concept of Seeker (embodied as well in its title track) suggests, Megan Nash is in the midst of her personal quest for spiritual meaning on her own terms. Her chosen path is through music, and as an artistic statement, Seeker displays the breadth of Nash’s talents as a songwriter, vocalist and producer—the culmination of one stage of her journey while simultaneously beginning the next.

Everything changed in 2018 for the fast-rising eclectic quartet when they played Live at Heart Sweden and Live at Heart Newfoundland, which has now led them to upcoming showcases in France at MIDEM, back to Live at Heart Sweden, Milwaukee Summerfest in the USA and now to the prestigious and innovative WESTWAY LAB in Portugal. With a sound that's hard to peg, but familiar nonetheless, the band are commonly marked as having a fresh vibe - vintage sound', nostalgic yet entirely their own; touching on sounds where acts such as The Eagles, The Lovin’ Spoonful, The Beatles and even the late Tom Petty left off. Their sound and style span decades from the clean, warm pop ballads of the early 1960s to the gritty rock of the mid-1970s modernized by the bands own musical era; the alternative rock of the mid-1990 's-early 2000s.

THE EAST POINTERS

The East Pointers - fiddler/singer Tim Chaisson, banjoist Koady Chaisson and guitarist Jake Charron – write about real life, sketching out its joys and sorrows in vivid strokes. That palpable authenticity makes their instrumental tunes practically cartwheel and infuses their lyric-driven songs with poignancy. And it’s why listening to The East Pointers’ brilliant and hotly anticipated second album What We Leave Behind – produced by superstar East Coast-bred songwriter/producer Gordie Sampson – is akin to meeting up with an old friend. As a follow-up to 2015’s internationally acclaimed, JUNO Award-winning debut Secret Victory, What We Leave Behind shares stories previously unheard but framed by a familiar context. The album reflects on the traditions of Canadian Celtic music, where it comes from, and what it means to the people, but also strides in new directions. With a captivating balance between their traditional-sounding instrumental tunes and catchy radio-ready songs, The East Pointers reach out with open arms to a wide range of listeners, inviting them to discover a new love of folk music. The East Pointers continue to blur the lines between traditional and popular music while developing a devoted fan base around the globe.

OTTAWA—The Canadian economy returned to growth to start the year after contracting in November and December as broad-based growth led by the manufacturing and construction industries offset weakness in the resource sector.

Statistics Canada said Friday real gross domestic product grew 0.3 per cent in January.

Economists on average had expected no growth for the month, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

“There are no two ways about this one, as it was quite simply above everyone’s expectations,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal.

“This nice gain augurs very well, given that Alberta’s oil production cuts were viewed as the biggest drag on the economy at the start of the year, and growth sailed right through that headwind.”

The growth came as 18 of 20 industrial sectors moved higher.

Goods-producing industries increased 0.6 per cent, led by growth in manufacturing and construction. The manufacturing sector rose 1.5 per cent in January, while the construction sector grew 1.9 per cent, its best showing since July 2013.

Services-producing industries rose 0.2 per cent as all but one sector increased.

The better-than-expected result for January came after the economy ended 2018 on a weak note.

Growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 came in at an annualized pace of 0.4 per cent, its worst showing in two and a half years.

The weakness prompted economists to raise concerns about the strength of economic growth this year, while the possibility the Bank of Canada may even look to cut interest rates this year was also raised.

The Bank of Canada kept its key interest rate on hold in its rate announcement earlier this month, but did warn Canadians on of a weaker economic performance in the months ahead.

Weakness in the report Friday could be found in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sector that pulled back 3.1 per cent.

Oil and gas extraction fell 2.6 per cent, due in part to Alberta’s imposition of oil production cuts that began at the start of the year.

Mining, excluding oil and gas, fell 4.0 per cent.

CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld said Friday he’s expecting a more modest gain in February, but noted his bank is raising its first-quarter GDP forecast to 1.3 per cent from 0.5 per cent.

“If that’s on the mark, it’s not slow enough to prompt a Bank of Canada rate cut, but neither is it quick enough to justify a further monetary tightening,” he said.

“Markets had been piling on bets that the Bank of Canada would be pushed into an ease, and today’s data were seen as making that less likely.”","Canadian economy grew 0.3% in January, beats expectations",Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/operations/canadian-economy-grew-0-3-in-january-beats-expectations-229947/

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is asking everyone to switch off their lights from 8:30-9:30 p.m. on Saturday, as part of its annual Earth Hour.

The campaign started in 2007 to promote energy conservation in Australia, and has since morphed into a global movement aimed at raising awareness about the environment. The WWF is using this year’s event to call attention to the loss of biodiversity as hundreds of species die out due to climate change and human activity.

Climate change is more than just rising temperatures🌡️; Extreme weather 🌪️, loss of wildlife species and habitats 🐼, and rising seas all affect us.

Megan Leslie, chief executive of WWF Canada, says turning off the lights is largely symbolic since it won’t have a noticeable impact on the environment by itself.

“It’s not about electricity savings,” she told Global News. “It’s about us coming together as a community to show that we care about this issue, and we’re in it together.”

WATCH BELOW: How constructing new buildings can affect carbon emissions

Some parts of the world have actually reported an increase in electricity use during Earth Hour. In British Columbia, for instance, BC Hydro said energy use crept up by 0.2 per cent during Earth Hour 2018. The utility also reported a net energy savings of just 0.3 per cent for 2017.

Earth Hour doesn’t do much to slow global warming on its own, but it can open the door to greater change, according to Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He says there are many small changes people can make to cut down on the greenhouse gas produced by their everyday actions — something often referred to as a carbon footprint.

The United States produces 16.5 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita, according to 2014 data from the World Bank. Canada produces slightly less, at 15 metric tonnes per capita. That means one person’s annual carbon footprint would weigh about as much as three African elephants.

WATCH BELOW: How to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions

“We need to remind ourselves that climate change is a long-term problem and the solutions are long-term,” Knittel told Global News.

“We need to change habits for decades, not just for one hour.”

Here’s how you can tweak your own habits to knock a few tonnes off your carbon footprint on this planet – and perhaps save it for the generation after you.

The world at stake

Top United Nations scientists warned last year that humans are on the verge of causing irreversible damage to the climate within the next three decades unless drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions and prevent the world’s average temperature from warming by 0.5 C.

READ MORE: New U.N. report on climate change carries life-or-death warning

A massive report from 90 UN scientists paints a dire picture of the situation, and offers little hope that the world will actually rise to the challenge. However, a handful of those scientists are cautiously optimistic.

WATCH BELOW: What half-a-degree of global warming means

“We have a monumental task in front of us, but it’s not impossible,” said Natalie Mahowald, lead author of the study and a climate scientist at Cornell University. “This is our chance to decide what the world is going to look like,” she told The Associated Press in October.

The report also warned that climate change and human activity are proving catastrophic for the world’s biodiversity.

“A major species extinction event, compromising the planetary integrity and Earth’s capacity to meet human needs, is unfolding,” the report says.

Switching off the lights doesn’t go far enough

Turning off the lights is actually one of the least effective ways to save energy around the house, according to Seth Wynes, a PhD candidate studying individual carbon emissions at the University of British Columbia. He also co-authored a paper analyzing the carbon footprint of more than 100 factors in a person’s daily life.

WATCH BELOW: Time lapse video shows Hong Kong going dark for Earth Hour 2016

Wynes says Earth Hour can be misleading because lights are a major factor in our lives, so we wrongly assume that they have a major impact on the environment. He says there are many other less noticeable lifestyle factors that can actually have a greater impact on a person’s carbon emissions.

READ MORE: Everyday plastics quietly pollute as they degrade, study finds

“You can save more energy by switching your washing machine to cold water than by turning off the lights,” Wynes told Global News. He adds that most modern LED lights are extremely energy-efficient, so it’s more helpful to upgrade the lights in your home than to switch them off for an hour.

“That doesn’t require you to constantly make good decisions about turning them off,” he said. “You just purchase LED light bulbs once — they save you money and they’re more efficient all of the time that you use them.”

WATCH BELOW: How small things can make a big difference when saving energy

You can also save a lot of energy by easing up on your use of heaters and air conditioners, according to MIT professor Knittel.

“It’s the sum of lots of smaller decisions that can have a bigger impact,” he said.

Knittel also recommends getting a hybrid, electric or more fuel-efficient vehicle the next time you buy a car, and cutting down on needless travel.

Cutting and taxing carbon to save the climate

Wynes says the most effective way to reduce our individual carbon footprint is to change the way we eat and travel because those are among the largest contributors to a person’s CO2 emissions.

“The best things you can do for the climate would be to eat a plant-based diet, avoid air travel and live car-free,” Wynes said.

Meat generally requires more land, resources and effort to produce than the equivalent amount of any plant-based crop, Wynes says. He adds that eating plants is good for biodiversity because it reduces the need to convert forests into farmland for cattle.

WATCH BELOW: Why people are complacent about climate change

However, the “best hope” to fight climate change is for more countries to embrace a carbon tax, according to Knittel.

“If we can each do our small share to get a carbon tax adopted, then those efforts are going to have a much larger impact than our own individual impacts,” said Knittel, who lives in the United States.

The Canadian government is poised to introduce a federal carbon tax on Monday, which will take effect in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick, where no provincial carbon taxes exist. The pricing scheme is expected to add approximately $2 to the cost of a tank of gas, and $8 to natural gas users’ monthly heating bill.

READ MORE: Carbon tax to kick in next week — but details for small businesses not yet finalized

Wynes says it’s unfortunate that carbon pricing has become a politically polarizing issue.

“It brings up all of these cultural ties that people have,” he said. “When they hear ‘carbon tax,’ that brings to mind whatever political group they are a part of, and often people make their decision based on that rather than the evidence,” he said.

WATCH BELOW: Scheer, Ford and Moe oppose federal carbon tax

Wynes says all governments need to move aggressively to curb global warming through measures like the carbon tax. That’s why he encourages people to support Earth Hour as a symbolic gesture to show lawmakers that their voters care about climate change.

“Turn off those lights, but somewhere in that day, also find time to contact an elected official and let them know … ‘I want you to do more than symbolic action,’” Wynes said.

WWF Canada’s Megan Leslie hopes people will also do more than symbolic actions after Earth Hour.

Based on current weather reports West of the green line should be to warm for ice like that. #ForTheThrone pic.twitter.com/7ugDFULBaU — Erik (@Adremdico) March 25, 2019 Though ...","And it seemed the show's Alberta fans were at least partially right. On Monday evening, YouTube user COWanderer commented on the 360-degree video, saying they had had a ""strange request"" to ship a 600-lb. throne to Tumbler Ridge, in British Columbia. They followed up with a link to a video of Lower Babcock Creek, near Tumbler Ridge, which people can ski up in the winter. Twitter users got to work verifying the claim.

Tumbler Ridge is a nine-and-a-half-hour drive from Calgary, just over the provincial border on the eastern side of the Rockies. The large icicle formations seen in the HBO video and videos of Babcock Creek are ""seeps,"" which emerge from the rocky banks.

YouTube user anathema replied to the supposed throne deliverer saying they drove out to check the location and found Babcock Creek almost entirely melted.

""If you tried to walk on it, you'd be swimming,"" they commented, adding that fans may have to ""bushwhack"" through the forest instead of trekking up the once-frozen creek.

Kevin Sharman, who is retired and spends his winters skiing at Babcock Creek and other nearby locations, told The Star earlier Tuesday that the HBO video was clearly filmed ""several weeks ago."" Now, he said the unusually early warmth is melting the ice in the area, and he and his wife had their last ice ski of the season a couple of days ago.

He said it would be tough to get to the location, and ""brutal"" to go through the forest.

Babcock Creek is likely only knee-deep in most areas, he said, but falling through the ice is still no joke. He added that Babcock Creek rises significantly once spring melting is in full force. By early May, the creek will be ""roaring,"" he said, and guessed the throne could be swept away by the water.

But the moment he saw the 360-degree video, Kevin said he knew where the throne was. In the first interview, he said he played it cool, saying he might try to find the throne in a couple of days. He added in an email later that in fact, he was ""on the phone with one hand and packing with the other.""

Sharman ventured out with his wife to try to find it. When they got to the base of the creek, they saw snowmobiles and a trailer and thought somebody had beaten them to the punch.

In reality, Babcock Creek was melting just as Kevin said it would — the ice was cracked and water was rushing, he said — and so HBO had moved the throne to a location that wouldn't endanger the lives of fans who were looking for it.

Two men emerged wearing long fur coats and leather garb for the throne ceremony, Kevin said, and in ""typical Canadian fashion,"" he and Birgit had trouble deciding who would sit on the throne. In the end, Birgit did, and posed for a photo with the two robed men, wearing a large golden crown. (The heavy crown, which comes with its own stand, is so big that Kevin said he'd need to wear a ball cap for it to fit).

""We were very excited,"" said Kevin, adding that they got to keep the crown.

There are ten new ones just arrived-- I couldn’t get to see two of them—and the Cinematheque is holding its annual 24-hour movie marathon. The films are kept secret but there tend to be 13 or 14, ranging widely through the decades and genres. There are nibblies between and a major food break along the way. It all starts at 10 Saturday morning and tends to be very popular with a hardy crowd.

Sunday night on CBC, you can see the Canadian Screen Awards celebrate our country’s best. Quebec as usual is well-represented. I’d vote for Genesis if I had a chance and you’ll find reviews of two other contenders here today.

DUMBO: The jive-talking crows are gone in this re-make of the beloved animated film from 1941. That’s good; they’d be culturally incorrect these days. But much of the emotional connection has been dropped too in this live-action Tim Burton version that goes for spectacle instead. There are fires and crowd surges and tent collapses and power outages and panic and an explosion. Once those kick in, there’s no stopping the rush.

Before that we get the charming story of the baby elephant with ears big enough to let him fly. He’s watched over by a one-armed World War I vet (Colin Farrell) and his two children inside a failing circus run by Danny DeVito. His celebrity attracts a New York huckster (Michael Keaton) who buys the whole circus and absorbs it into his theme park, Dreamland. (Sort of like an early Disneyland). A glamorous trapeze artist from France (Eva Green) gets to ride him on a tense and thrilling flight over giant crowds inside a huge tent. Then things start going wrong. The ultimate money man (Alan Arkin) wants more box office. The circus staff are fired. Dumbo’s mother is sold and he once again feels separation anxiety. (Small children cry every time it happens). It’s a frantic, noisy and tense sequence that corrects things. The film is beautifully visualized but low on what it really needs lots of: poignancy and whimsy. Purists will note that “Baby Mine,” the songs that won an Oscar for the 1941 version, is sung this time too. (Dunbar, International Village, Marine Gateway and many suburban theatres) 3 out of 5

THE WORLD BEFORE YOUR FEET: This is a terrific film; don’t miss it. It’s funny, captivating, informative and eccentric. It’s for people with a sense of curiosity about the world right in front of them. If you’ve ever just wandered a street or a neighborhood to see what you can find, on vacation in another city for instance, this film will speak to you.

Matt Green is on a marathon walking tour of New York and all its boroughs. Over six years or so he’s covered 8,000 miles of streets, lanes and paths and says he’s not finished yet. A few years ago he walked across the entire US and hasn’t gone back to his engineering job since. With a bit of money he saved, a small income from work as a cat sitter and endless couch surfing at friends’ places to sleep at night, he lives on and spends very little. But you’ll delight as he shows you sights he’s encountered: Houdini’s enormous grave for instance; Basquiat’s modest tiny one, the site on Wall Street where New York’s slave trade was centered, a corn field in Queens, many 9-11 memorials and “the puddle that never goes away”. And many more sights and a lot of history. He can’t explain why he does it except that most of these things he’d never see if he was driving. There’s a buoyant mood in this film and the encounters with people along the way are friendly. A real treat.

Organic is a major success story in the food industry. In North America, organic food sales have increased from almost nothing to over USD 50 billion over 20 years. However, questions are being asked about the future evolution…

Major questions answered

What growth is projected for the North American and global market? How is the competitive landscape changing? As few dedicated organic food enterprises now remain, will large corporations and food retailers wield greater influence? What new certification schemes are emerging? With growing risks of food fraud, how can organic food companies strengthen their supply chains? How can they reduce their packaging impacts? Such questions will be addressed in this new one-day event, organized by Ecovia Intelligence.

Market updates

The morning seminars begin with an update on the US organic food market by the Organic Trade Association. Amarjit Sahota, Founder and President of Ecovia Intelligence (event organizer), will cover major trends and market developments in the global arena. Growth openings will be highlighted for companies looking to build exports to Europe, Asia and other regions.

Standards and labels

Diana Martin from the Rodale Institute will give details of the Regenerative Organic Certification scheme. Backed by pioneering organic enterprises, the new standard adds soil health, social fairness, and animal welfare to organic production methods. Erin Matchett from Non-GMO Project Verified will give an update on GM labeling and transparency in the food industry. Launched in 2010, Non-GMO Project Verified is the fastest growing eco-label in North America with sales now surpassing USD 26 billion.

Marketing trends

Targeting the millennials – some of the most avid buyers of organic foods – will be discussed by the marketing consultant Sourabh Sharma. In his seminar, he will give some insights into how to reach this increasingly influential demographic. How can organic food brands utilize digital marketing? Other seminars will cover organic ingredient trends & outlook, and traceability in organic supply chains. Guidance will be given to companies looking to mitigate risks of food fraud in their supply networks.

Packaging impacts

Plastic packaging is now a major concern for organic food companies. It is estimated that over 8 million tonnes of plastic enters the ocean each year. Andrew Dent, Executive Vice-President at Material ConneXion, will conduct an afternoon workshop. Titled ‘Sustainable Packaging Solutions’, the workshop is a practical guide for companies looking to make their packaging more sustainable.

Trudeau government brought down a notch

Thank you, NOW Magazine, for Enzo DiMatteo's balanced and sane article on the SNC-Lavalin soap opera (NOW, March 7-13, 2019).

The Canadian media has whipped itself into an irrational frenzy over this supposed scandal.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government are not corrupt: a tad unethical, maybe, and somewhat fraudulent, but they hardly meet the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanours that the hapless, silly opposition wants us to think they do.

Trudeau is not Donald Trump. Canadian democracy has worked. We pretty much know what happened – the virtuous Trudeau government has been deservedly brought down a notch and voters will make a decision on his governance in October.

Now it’s time for the media to move on to more important issues.

Crystal meth reality check

Re Crystal Meth Myths (NOW, March 7-13). I have trouble understanding the argument of this article. Is it that the meth=death campaign is ineffective in getting people to stop using Tina, or that Tina is not that dangerous and that people can use it recreationally?

All drugs make a person feel wonderful – that is their function by definition. Some of them while making you feel wonderful are also highly addictive and extremely harmful, not only physically, but also psychologically.

I am the child of two gay men. One has overdosed on meth three times in the past three years. More to the point he has lost his mind and his life is in a seeming never-ending downward spiral. I have lost my father and am essentially waiting for him to die.

I am sure that he felt in control at first and that he could “manage” his use of Tina during sex. Right before he wasn’t in control and it began to destroy him.

Planning Toronto for social cohesion

Thank you to NOW for covering how we’re building for loneliness in Toronto (NOW, February 28-March 6).

Young people and the elderly alike can find the busy city a lonely place. And that can lead to greater chance of death. Planning for social cohesion needs to be a priority and part of all developments.

Growing, cooking, buying and sharing food can be a great tool to bring people together.

Animating public spaces, parks, green spaces and community rooms can work wonders, too, especially within social housing.

Toronto also needs to clear its paths and sidewalks of snow and slush citywide. Not being able to get around with a bad hip, in a scooter, wheelchair or walker further isolates people all winter.

Two days later Zdanowski received an email from the co-ordinator of the Forward Future committee, which she provided to CTVNews.ca.

“We are really sorry, though we both like your film but because of the politics we can’t receive the Canada film this year,"" the email read.

Zdanowski pushed for answers and was told Friday by the same BIFF official: “We have made every effort, but as you know, the censorship in China is very strict and the standards are constantly changing. We tried many ways to get the film through but failed. It’s not the film itself that has political problems, it’s going abroad (I’m sure you’ve heard about Huawei.) So we are very sorry.”

That is a reference to Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the giant Chinese technology firm Huawei, who was detained by Canadian officials in Vancouver on Dec. 1. Court proceedings are underway in British Columbia regarding her extradition to the United States to face allegations she conspired to violate sanctions against Iran.

The case has made headlines in China and Chinese officials have repeatedly demanded her release. Since Meng was detained, China detained two Canadians who were working in the country and halted canola shipments from Canada -- moves largely regarded as retaliatory.

It is unclear whether the BIFF is accepting any Canadian films. The festival does not appear to categorize films by country on its website.

Zdanowski submitted her self-funded film through the Telefilm Canada portal that helps filmmakers submit to international film festivals.

CTVNews.ca has reached out to the Beijing Film Festival, but has yet to hear back.

“To get accepted there, at this massively huge festival, was an opportunity of a lifetime for me,” Zdanowski said in a phone interview with CTVNews.ca. She says representatives of Telefilm Canada were “shocked” to hear of the reversal.

Telefilm Canada told CTVNews.ca that it ""simply facilitate the submissions of Canadian films"" to the festival and does not have ""any more details to provide"" on Zdanowski's case.

“In God I Trust” weaves together three stories set in a town in northern Idaho. Zdanowski says it confronts issues of racism, religion and gun violence.

“It has nothing to do with politics between China and Canada,” she said. “As a filmmaker, I shouldn’t be caught up in this fight between countries.”

Zdanowski co-wrote, directed and edited the film, which was shot on weekends over 18 months while she worked her full-time job in post-production for television.

The movie has already been screened at film festivals in Whistler, B.C. and Omaha, Neb. It’s being screened next week at the Beverly Hills Film Festival and at the European Independent Film Festival in Paris.

It has been nominated for the Borsos Award for Best Canadian Feature, the Alliance of Women Film Journalists Award for best female-directed film and has won the Stars to Watch award for the lead actor’s performance.

The film was to be shown among 17 others in the Forward Future category at the BIFF.

The Forward Future section “is established with the objectives to discover fresh filmmakers, hunt for the future trends of global film industry, encourage the spirits of innovation in filmmaking and display a culture diversity of film art,” reads the letter Zdanowski received.

Zdanowski was born in Warsaw but her parents fled Poland in 1981, fearing communism, when she was a baby. She lived in Johannesburg until she was nine, when her parents immigrated to Canada. She grew up in London, Ont. and studied communications and video production at the University of Windsor.

She worked in television in Vancouver for 14 years, before moving to Toronto in December to pursue her film career.

“I’m super proud that my film is being shown to film festival audiences, but it’s so disappointing about Beijing. It was a chance to showcase Canadian talent to people there.”

The Beijing film festival is in its ninth year and bills itself “as the city's most internationally influential large-scale cultural event, a major platform for global exchange, a bellwether of the film market, an incubator for new filmmakers and new productions, and a new brand of Beijing culture.”",Canadian film pulled from Beijing festival over 'politics',CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/canadian-film-pulled-from-beijing-festival-over-politics-1.4357930

He had a distinguished career and was well respected. He served in different departments under several ministers in governments led by the Conservative and the Liberal parties.

Wernick's retirement, as a result of the controversy surrounding SNC-Lavalin is, certainly, a sign of things to come for our country.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick leaves after testifying before a justice committee on the SNC Lavalin affair on March 6, 2019.

The political discourse has gone downhill. While we had, in the past, debates on ideas, it has now become about people. You either ""like"" or ""dislike"" a politician or a public servant. Ideas matter little.

The House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights met on several occasions to hear from former Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould and other officials — including Wernick — on the controversy surrounding the granting of a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

As a result of his testimony in front of the Justice Committee, he received insults calling him a ""traitor,"" ""dirty"" and other similar nonsensical and unfounded epithets. He asked parliamentarians to look at the emails and social media messages containing the insults — they chose not to. It was easier for the MPs in this committee to go back to the squabbling and foster more negative social media.

Wernick was right to warn Canadians about his concerns about what politics in Canada is becoming. In his presentation, he mentioned that a deterioration of the political discourse could possibly lead to political assassination and violence. Some viewed this as going too far. But you don't need to go far to show that an increasingly polarized society leads to violence. On March 21 this year, Cesar Sayor Jr. pleaded guilty in the U.S. to trying to bomb opponents of President Donald Trump in the U.S.

Social media, encouraged by the behaviour of some politicians, has enabled people to insult others without being held responsible for the language and tone used. Mr. Wernick called social media a ""vomitorium"" — and, again, he is right.

Mass/mainstream media is not without blame.

Repeating the insults, giving airtime to the childish behaviour that some politicians engage in (shouting in Question Period, banging on desks, etc.) can encourage the behaviour.

And, when looking at the main political shows on the various channels like CBC and CTV, the style is to bring in partisan individuals to comment on the news of the day. The polarization then continues to increase.

Some (often media type themselves) believe that the majority of news coverage of politics is presented with context, criticism and expert opinion. I disagree. While the ""right"" and ""left"" wings of the political spectrum blame the other (and related media) for the polarization, some simply believe that the media is not doing enough.

Our political leaders and the media should work to elevate the discourse rather than help it further deteriorate.

Where discourse is heading around the world

What happens when politics descend into the theatre of the absurd? Simple, we observe results similar to what is happening in several countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia.

In Brazil, in 2018, a politician was elected despite telling a female colleague that he wouldn't sexually assault her because ""she's not worthy of it."" He received 55.5 per cent of the votes in the national election and is now the president. A very similar situation exists in the Philippines where President Rodrigo Duterte uses language that I wouldn't repeat to describe women.

In Europe, we have people in the streets burning stores and restaurants in the centre of Paris; far-right and far-left politicians joined together to lead Italy; a surprise Brexit vote a few years ago in the U.K.; far-right politicians making gains in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Germany. In Ukraine, a newcomer on the political scene — and comedian — is now leading the polls for the upcoming presidential election.

Many of these politicians were elected because they were seen as outside the mainstream movement of politics.

It is not necessary to evoke U.S. President Donald Trump. Canadians take pains to paint Canada as ""different than the U.S.,"" as if what is happening south of the border couldn't take place here. I'm not sure that's true. We have in the U.S. a president that doesn't believe in traditional media — in Ontario, we have a premier that also doesn't believe in traditional media. Other examples abound.

'Descent into the abyss'

In Canada, the words ""traitor"" and ""corrupt"" (and many other words not worth repeating here) are being used to describe elected officials and public servants. While most politicians usually refrain themselves from using these words, they certainly — by their words and actions — encourage the descent into the abyss.

Having worked for more than 25 years around Ottawa's Parliament Hill, I have seen great politicians and public servants and observed... others. I've agreed with some and disagreed with others. But respect — if not of the individual, at least of the function — is essential for our parliamentary democracy to survive.

Former Prime Minister Harper wrote that ""the current populist upheaval is actually benign and constructive compared with what will follow if it is not addressed."" I'm not sure that the current populist upheaval is ""constructive"" or ""benign"" but I agree with him that if legitimate concerns are not addressed, the result will be worse. Interestingly, he chastises ""some leaders and much of the media"" for their response to the populist movement.

Leaders in the mainstream parties should be careful and observe what happens in other countries. Because when voters have lost complete faith in the political system, they turf out ""mainstream"" politicians to elect the extreme. It would be wiser for political strategists to look beyond the short electoral term and observe odds for long-term political survival. If the system is to survive, it needs to be reformed.

Media is saying that Wernick resigned under a cloud. The cloud hasn't gathered over Wernick; he is a distinguished gentleman that served Canada well. My assumption — and I don't know him personally — is that he probably just got tired of the ridicule of it all. The cloud is over the political class and the media.

Tory MP Luc Berthold shot back at China during a meeting Friday of the House of Commons agriculture committee in Ottawa.

The committee is debating a Conservative motion to compel testimony from Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, International Trade Minister Jim Carr and Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau to address what they say is a broader political crisis with China that's affecting the livelihoods of Canadian farmers.

China's decision to ban $2 billion worth of Canadian exports is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive with Chinese telecom giant Huawei, at the behest of the United States.

Saskatchewan Conservative MP Randy Hoback said the cabinet ministers need to provide ""comfort"" to farmers by assuring them they'll have a market to sell to this fall.

China says it has found hazardous organisms in the shipments of two major canola exporters, Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra, Inc.

China was infuriated by Meng's Dec. 1 arrest on a U.S. extradition warrant alleging fraud.

Nine days after Meng's arrest, China imprisoned two Canadians — ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor — and accused them of violating China's national security.

'We need a solution fast:' Berthold

The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says China's canola decision has no basis in scientific fact.

Mark Agnew, senior director of international policy for the chamber, says he trusts the assessments by Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency that Canada's crop is safe.

Agnew, however, stopped short of linking the arrest with the canola issue.

""When you look at the numbers the canola industry has put out, there's a massive market here that looks like it's being shut off for Canadian canola exporters,"" Agnew said Friday in an interview.

""We trust what Health Canada and CFIA say about the safety of Canadian exports. It's quite easy to see there's not a science-based justification for what China is doing to Canadian canola exports.""

Berthold denounced the Chinese complaints about the quality of Canadian canola.

""To claim the canola sent to China didn't meet quality standards is completely absurd,"" said Berthold.

""We need a solution fast.""

China is the recipient of about 40 per cent of Canada's exports of canola seed. China is the only country to raise a technical issue with the product.

The Canadian canola industry is urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to press China for solutions.

Uncertainty for farmers

Canadian farmers say China's ban has created uncertainty ahead of the spring planting season. Along with the Canola Council of Canada, they are calling on the government to send a delegation to China to address the issue.

Earlier this week, Trudeau mentioned the possibility of sending a delegation to China, as he defended the quality control of the product as ""top-notch and world-class.""

Hoback warned that unless the government can repair the damaged relationship with China, other sectors could be vulnerable to retaliation, including maple syrup and seafood.

Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China's actions on canola were ""scientific and reasonable.""

Without mentioning Huawei directly, Geng said China hopes Canada can ""get along with us to ensure the sound and steady development of China-Canada relations.""

Geng said Canada should ""take practical measures to correct the mistakes it made earlier"" in the bilateral relationship.",Tories push for probe of political spat with China following 'absurd' canola ban,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canola-committee-freeland-carr-1.5076919
377,Entertainment,2019-03-30T03:52:00.0000000Z,"In fact, it seems the only figure in Canadian politics who is consistently problematized as entertaining white nationalist sentiment is Maxime Bernier. And this is a man who is, for the most part, dismissed as a buffoonish and aggrieved crank with no ...","For more than a week, ever since a heavily armed white man charged into the Masjid Al Noor and opened fire on worshippers, I’ve been heavily occupied with thoughts of cowardice. That of the shooter, of course, but also my own. In fact, cowardice is the reason I’ve been putting off the writing of this column.

Let me explain.

A few weeks ago, Edmonton-based writer and educator Minister Faust asked if I would consider writing about the populist movement coalescing in Alberta, known as the Yellow Vests. I gave it some thought, but decided it was too niche of an issue to pitch my editor. I’ve written about the ideological capture of populist movements by hate groups before, of course. But I rationalized the Yellow Vests as an astroturfed campaign by oil interests which would, much like America’s Tea Party, amount to a brief and self-annihilating costume party for aggrieved white xenophobes.

After the shooting, I exchanged messages with Bashir Mohamed, another Edmonton-based writer, regarding the tendency of Alberta politicians to be photographed or associated with white nationalists. They did so without the prospect of being shamed into resignation by Canadian media. Mohamed was interested in writing a column specifically calling out Kerry Diotte, Member of Parliament for Edmonton Griesbach, and I recommended he broaden the scope to include other politicians, lest the pitch come off as a vendetta column and not cogent political analysis.

In both of these instances, and other conversations I’ve had with writers of colour lately, I did what I promised myself I would never do as a Black writer with a platform, which was to play the role of gatekeeper. I told myself that I was looking for angles that could find a foot through the door of the notoriously white-centred Canadian media. In reality, I had been cowed by hate groups and their enablers in my industry into silence, and I was unconsciously passing on the memo to others.

In January, after I wrote a column asserting the MAGA hat is a symbol of hate, a deluge of racist emails poured into my inbox. Normally I expect hate mail whenever I write about right-wing white populism, but this was not long after I’d received death threats (that, strangely enough, stemmed from another article I’d written years ago), so something about this iteration of being called a “subhuman,” a “savage,” and a “n–ger piece of s–t” got under my skin. It was followed by a brigade of harassment spurred by a Rebel Media reporter (with his own ties to white nationalism), who took one of my tweets and turned it into a streeter for Yellow Vest supporters in Sudbury.

I’ve spoken often with my fiance, family members, and friends about prioritizing my family’s safety over writing and community work. We’ve been recognized in public and approached, and while it’s so far been in a friendly manner, the threats and hate mail I’ve received are never far from the imagination when a stranger comes up to us to say hello. The thing is, while my fiance, children, and I are quite obviously Black (and therefore potential targets for hate crime), we’re also Christians. Our racialization isn’t further complicated by visible markers of religious affiliation—she doesn’t wear a hijab, and I don’t wear a topi cap. My beard grows free and styled according only to my own tastes. Nobody bats an eyelash when we say grace before meals when we dine out.

This isn’t the case for Bashir and other members of the Somali community in Edmonton, a city which is quickly becoming a cancerous node in the spread of overt white supremacy throughout Canada. This also isn’t the case for someone like Ginella Massa, a visibly Muslim anchor for CityNews Toronto, who recently needed to ask security to escort her to her vehicle after a Peterborough-based neo-Nazi made a “hypothetical” open call for the killing of media figures and anti-racism organizations. It wasn’t the case for the Muslim family confronted by a drunk and belligerent white man at Toronto’s Harbourfront, who shouted slurs and told them to “get out of my province,” nor for a Muslim man subjected to a “citizens arrest” on the way out of a London-area Sobeys.

I’ve been occupied with cowardice because, in the wake of the most deadly shooting in New Zealand history, I have shrunk back from my responsibility as a journalist to swing the glare of public discourse towards hatemongers, as well as their enablers in media and government. This is something I profoundly regret.

But there’s a different metric at work when it isn’t your own safety, your family’s, or that of your community consistently on the line. Too many of my white colleagues in journalism still seem to believe their profession and the assumed stance of objectivity places them at a distance from white supremacy.

This, to me, is a different tier of moral cowardice.

A week after Ginella Massa tweeted about the threat of white supremacist violence making it unsafe to leave her workplace without security, PEGIDA (a German-based anti-Muslim political movement) organized a march in downtown Toronto. A CityNews reporter assigned to cover the event, Pam Seatle, found herself confronted (and even followed) by anti-racist protesters to the march, who shouted her for “giving a platform to fascists.” In response, Seatle tweeted “I felt more threatened by them than any of the so called ‘dangerous violent racists.’ ”

The tweet was hastily deleted, probably wisely so. A cornerstone of white supremacist politics is the purported defence of the purity of white women from foreign savages, and PEGIDA supporters have been fairly busy promoting the falsehood that refugees from Africa and the Middle East are essentially roving gangs of rapists. According to PEGIDA’s own philosophy, a white woman like Seatle is the utmost protected class—of course they mean her no harm. The same cannot be said for nonwhites, including her own colleagues.

While Seatle may have had cause to feel unsafe in the moment she was followed by protesters, the fact is, she was covering the march of an organization whose founder, a man who calls refugees “cattle” and filth, was found guilty by a German court for inciting racial hatred. It was not only Seatle’s decision to attend and cover the rally from a rather slanted angle, calling out the protesters’ lack of decorum, but the choice of her news department to approve the segment, if not covering PEGIDA’s rally (and the counter-rally) to begin with.

In Alberta, the United Conservative Party continually finds itself dealing with members who espouse bigoted views (including the recent resignation of Calgary-Mountain View candidate Caylan Ford and Calgary-South East candidate Eva Kiryakos), or have direct ties to white supremacist organizations. For his part, Kenney himself repeatedly reminds people why his reputation for homophobia was well-earned. Yet Kenney and his party somehow continue to deliver press conferences and policy announcements without being pressured to answer how the party could possibly serve all Albertans when bigotry has so clearly infected its ranks.

The people behind the bylines and headlines in Alberta’s media class are, as with the rest of the country, very white. They carry with them the sensibilities that often insulate white supremacy, even if inadvertently (as with the Calgary Herald headline that uncritically repeated Kiryakos’s claim that she was the victim of a ‘smear’ campaign). That is, of course, when they aren’t outright mainstreaming white supremacist smear campaigns against refugees in European countries, as talk radio host and former Wildrose Party leader Danielle Smith recently did during a segment on her program. This is an endless source of frustration for the communities of colour in the province, and across Canada, as we are perpetually dragged back to the same naïve and uncomplicated conversations about racism, even as our communities increasingly come under attack.

When infamous white nationalist Faith Goldy carried her message into the Toronto mayoral election, and was photographed not only with members of the Toronto Police Service, but also the premier of Ontario, neither the leadership of the Toronto Police nor the premier offered an apology or rebuked Goldy directly. Instead, Ford tweeted a condemnation of “hate speech” and “anti-Semitism” should it happen to issue from Goldy “or anyone else.”

And that was that—Ford has more or less moved on from having anything to do with white nationalism (often due to his tendency to surround himself with sycophants of all colours). While his party continues its agenda of governance-by-spite, and while he heralded the arrival of the Yellow Vests’ so-called “convoy” to Ontario, Premier Ford is able to show his face in public without the prospect of being questioned by Queen’s Park reporters just why racism seems to follow him around like a noxious cloud.

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer has also surrendered political principles for the bigot’s vote, presiding over a party willing to virtue-signal anti-immigrant sentiment to supporters whose “Canada First” mantra places them firmly in our country’s white nationalist tradition. There was the empty grandstanding around and misrepresentation of the UN Migration Pact, often reported by media as if the pact were legitimate cause for sovereign concern, with only a nod to the fact that the pact is non-binding. There was also an infamous tweet sent out by the party, meant to stoke further fear and paranoia over asylum-seekers crossing into Canada from the U.S., that just so happened to echo this country’s history of migration pessimism where Black refugees are involved.

Despite this abysmal record, Scheer is given leave to credibly present the Conservatives as a viable governing party that will act in all Canadians’ interests, while retaining the services of staffers who include Georgeanne Burke (who co-founded a political organization which, regardless of its stated purpose, effectively keeps the fear of Sharia in the headlines of right-wing publications) and Hamish Marshall (a former corporate director at Rebel Media). Scheer doesn’t acknowledge the problem of white nationalism in Canada, or within the party ranks, because there is no media pressure on him to do so. Not even when he speaks at the same Ottawa rally promoted and attended by far-right hate groups. That’s simply not the way things are done in this country.

Scheer’s tolerance for subordinates blowing the dog’s whistle is not limited to his office, but has trickled down to regional MPs such as Kerry Diotte, himself a former journalist. In 2017, Diotte tweeted a picture of himself with Faith Goldy, lauding her efforts to “Make the Media Great Again.” The tweet remains on Diotte’s Twitter timeline. When this was called out by Bashir Mohamed as an endorsement of racism, Diotte’s lawyers sent him a letter threatening legal action. Additionally, Diotte filed a lawsuit against The Gateway, a student newspaper at the University of Alberta, which is, to date, the only media organization to pull together his history of dog-whistle politics (which includes tweeting a picture of a “Liberal Buzz Word Bingo card,” including the words “indigenous” and “Syrians,” for which he later apologized).

In a private conversation with a white journalism colleague, I discussed Diotte’s litigiousness against his critics, as well as the picture he took with Goldy. That colleague, as with others, could not be convinced that Diotte’s picture was a problem, as Goldy’s full-bore descent into racism apparently didn’t take place before her trip in 2017 to Charlottesville, Virginia*. Even though her Rebel segments, designed to stoke white paranoia against nonwhite immigrant populations, long preceded that.

It seems that, no matter the amount of evidence pointing towards a problem with white nationalism in our political ranks, white journalists will quickly get on code to inform those of us (who are the most likely targets of white supremacist violence) where the line is to be drawn in naming that problem. In fact, it seems the only figure in Canadian politics who is consistently problematized as entertaining white nationalist sentiment is Maxime Bernier. And this is a man who is, for the most part, dismissed as a buffoonish and aggrieved crank with no viable base outside of the alt-right.

Again and again this happens in Canada, where political figures and movements flirt openly with the very same white nationalist figures and rhetoric that have been cited by multiple anti-racism organizations as catalysts for the surge in hate crimes and mass violence in recent years. But they are only held to account by journalists for as long as their latest faux-pas can carry a headline. After the news cycle has passed, we’re back to square one. This interminable loop not only puts the onus of writing and talking about this problem on journalists of colour, but exposes us and our communities to the opprobrium, and too often the violence, that is increasingly being legitimized under the shifting auspices of normal political dialogue and free speech in this country.

I may have been a coward in failing to speak up when my brothers in Edmonton asked me to say something, or help them find a platform to say something themselves. At the same time, I have thousands of fellow travellers in Canadian media who are not only insulated from white nationalist violence by dint of their political views, but by the fact their whiteness too often qualifies them as Canadian, without question.

Old stock, if you will.

There should, therefore, be thousands of helping hands willing to break this media cycle on white nationalism. But there are hardly any to be found. Instead, we’re faced with a wall of white silence, as if the wave of hate crimes and terrorism in recent years hasn’t been aided by the bigoted rhetoric from acquaintances and even family members they’ve muted in group chats.

Already, we are moving towards the typical both-sides conversation that swings the glare away from white supremacists, and back towards establishing terror-inducing violence as the sole province of people of colour. The expressions of horror and sympathy for the victims of the shooting in Christchurch are quickly fading; the platitudes for peace and tolerance were forgotten almost immediately. As always happens with this sort of thing, enough temporal distance from a terrorist incident causes the incandescent urgency of confronting white supremacist violence to gutter out.

The question I would pose to my professional colleagues, then, is this: knowing that your co-workers, your peers, and people you claim to be your friends are facing danger in our homes, in the streets, and in our places of worship, what will it take for you to do something?

Because our cancerous political climate, and all of the attendant bigotry that arrived with it, is what happens when you do nothing.

MajaZdanowski told CBC Toronto the rejection wasn't because of the film's content. Her first feature-length film, In God I Trust, focuses on racism, religion and gun violence in the United States and had been accepted to the Beijing International Film Festival.

Zdanowski said she went from being excited to devastated in the span of 48 hours.

""It would have been an amazing opportunity for me to showcase the talent that we have here in Canada,"" the independent filmmaker said.

I want people to know that art and filmmaking and expressing yourself should have nothing to do with what's happening with political tensions between countries. - Maja Zdawnowski

Zdanowski's rejection comes during a tense time for Canada-China relations. Recently, China halted canola shipments from this country and detained two Canadians working abroad — moves that came after Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou, the vice-president of the Chinese technology firm Huawei.

In the first email exchange viewed by CBC Toronto, one of the film festival's organizers said they liked Zdanowski's film and apologized for having to remove it from the festival, but only said it was due to ""political reasons.""

In a follow-up email Friday afternoon, they provided a more thorough explanation:

""We like this film very much. We have made every effort, but as you know, the censorship in China is very strict and the standards are constantly changing. We tried many ways to get the film through, but failed. It's not the film itself that has political problems, it's going abroad (I'm sure you've heard about Huawei). So we are very sorry.""

CBC Toronto has also reached out to the Chinese consulate for more information about why the film was pulled.

'My passion is telling stories'

In God I Trust follows three people in a small town in northern Idaho whose stories become intertwined. It touches on heavy subjects like racism, religion and politics.

Zdanowski self-funded the film.

""I just don't understand why they would accept and then deny, because it has nothing to do with the actual film itself,"" she said.

""My passion is telling stories, and it shouldn't be stopped because of some political tensions between countries,"" she said.

'The bilateral relationship is still very, very tense'

Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto and an expert on China and southeast Asia, said was likely canceled not because of its subject matter, but because the festival organizers feared backlash from the central government for including a Canadian film.

""[Local agencies] are afraid of the authorities. They do not want to be seen as doing anything that may defy central orders because they want to protect their own position, otherwise they might be punished if this is seen as an act of defiance,"" she said.

Due to ongoing political tensions, Wong says Canadians working in China or with Chinese organizations may continue to encounter issues.

""Any Canadians who [are] thinking about doing things in China should be prepared for this sort of nuisance when the bilateral relationship is still very, very tense,"" she said.

Zdanowski says her experience as an immigrant — she was born in Poland before her family was forced to flee to Austria, then South Africa and finally Canada — inspired her film.

She's still eager for it to be seen.

In God I Trust has been accepted into several other festivals, including the Beverly Hills Film Festival and European Independent Film Festival in Paris.

But Zdanowski says she's still disappointed politics appear to have blocked a wider release.

Last week, board members, employees and executive spoke about the exciting plans ahead for Stampede Park; the strategic plan for both the Stampede and the new BMO Centre and in general spoke about the strong consensus among all of the Stampede leadership regarding the future of that organization.

I have often referred to the Calgary Stampede as being “not an event but a culture,” and in so many ways, it is a culture that our entire community can be proud of.

One of the most positive aspects of the meeting I attended is the respect that all volunteers, employees and board members have for each other, and the smooth transition of leadership without acrimony.

Contrast that to what we are seeing in our own province these days. Individuals calling each other “liars or racists or incompetent” and it gets worse from there. Is this what Canadian democracy has become — insults over policies and a stream of personal attacks over planning substance.

I cannot imagine what you might drum up if you went back to my 20s and tried to repeat some of the things I said when I was a young man, yet individuals are constantly attacked for what they might have said or done in their youth. Wisdom may not come with maturity, in fact, I am pretty sure that it does not. But maturity does bring a certain amount of realization that what we believed to be absolutely true when we were 20 often proves to be absolutely incorrect when we have the chance to look back over time.

For many years, I have said that we should all have respect for anyone who runs for office. Without people willing to put their names forward for political service, we cannot have a democracy. I have never forgotten the words of the late energy minister Merv Leitch, speaking at a Rotary Club meeting, many years ago. “Canada is unique in the world in the fact that the amount of corruption, self-interest and dishonest action by politicians is undoubtedly the lowest by far of any country on earth,” he said.

I still believe that to be the case, and while I do not endorse much of what is often proposed, I am still naive enough to believe that our political leaders put forward ideas and concepts that they personally believe are the best for their constituents.

With that in mind, I sincerely wish that the discourse in these election battles focus more on policy and much less on personal insults and attacks. I still believe Canada is a special place, a place of tolerance, adaptation and peace.

There is a reason that we call our Parliament buildings the Peace Tower and there are even more reasons why our Constitution calls for “Peace, Order and Good Government.” I still believe that most politicians deserve a “thank you for your service” rather than an attack or insult and that politicians themselves, should be looking for ways to reach more consensus in their strategic plans rather than trying to bounce us from one extreme position to another based on their feelings that they need to score big political points with their political base.

I would urge every single person running for office to bear in mind that at the end of the day, we are all Canadians, we all have a “Canadian way” of conducting ourselves and that if the politics of the day are reduced to nothing more than a series of personal attacks and personal insults, it will only result in an even further loss of respect and an even further reduction in our ability to function as a country or as a province.

“This was the first movie I’ve ever directed,” Zdanowski, 38, told the Star. She’s a former Vancouver resident who recently moved to Toronto. “It was a chance to showcase a Canadian film to a huge Chinese audience. And then, within a span of 48 hours, it got taken away. It’s now super disappointing.” The colourful invitation she received Monday from the China Film Culture Institute of the Beijing Film Academy spoke of the “great honour” of inviting her to showcase her “excellent” film at the festival, which runs April 12 to 19.

The letter promised to cover Zdanowski’s airfare and hotel costs, a benefit worth thousands of dollars. Less than two days later, she received a one-line email from the festival rescinding the invitation, saying that “because of the politics we can’t receive the Canada film (sic) this year.” While Zdanowski attempted to puzzle out the meaning of that, an email arrived Friday afternoon. It blamed the reversal on the ongoing feud between Canada and China, sparked by the arrest in Vancouver last December of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei. The arrest, made on behalf of the U.S. Justice Department, has caused a rift in Canada-China relations that has threatened trade in canola, seafood — and now film, too. A Beijing Film Fest spokesperson named Songke told Zdanowski in an email that although China has strict censorship rules, there’s nothing in the film — a tense race relations drama set in Northern Idaho — that would have prevented the festival from screening it.

“We like this film very much,” Songke wrote. “We have made every effort … It’s not the film itself that has political problems, it’s going abroad (I’m sure you heard about Huawei). So we are very sorry.”

Songke closed by offering to recommend In God I Trust to other Chinese film festivals “when the environment improves.” Zdanowski said she appreciates the candour of the Beijing officials, but she’s unhappy to have been drawn into a battle that’s not of her making. “I kind of feel bad for the festival. They really liked my film and they were really supportive of it. They tried to push the film to go through, but it just got denied.” In God I Trust has been well received by other festivals around the world. It had its world premiere in December at the Whistler Film Festival in B.C., which has a trailer for it still on its website. Zdanowski has also taken her film to the Omaha Film Festival and next week will screen it at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, ironically at the TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Blvd. In God I Trust had been submitted to the Beijing fest by Telefilm Canada, a Crown corporation that helps fund and promote Canadian productions. But Telefilm says there’s little it can do in this case. “We aren’t implicated in the festival’s programming decisions, but simply facilitate the submissions of Canadian films,” said Telefilm spokesperson Andréane Leblanc in an email. She was speaking on behalf of Francesca Accinelli, Telefilm’s national promotions and communications director. “This process is managed between the festival and the film teams. We therefore do not have any more details to provide on this particular case.” Attempts to reach spokespersons for the Beijing International Film Festival and the Chinese embassy in Ottawa were unsuccessful.

In a report issued this week, Al Mussell, research lead at Agri-Food Economic Systems in Guelph, Ont., noted that an outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in China is also disrupting the global meat supply.

“We’re in uncharted waters,” Mussell said. “We’ve never had a structural bull market in agricultural products led by the protein complex, while at the same time experiencing an opposite trend in oilseed.”

Generic lean hog futures have shot up 40 per cent since the beginning of March as a result of the outbreak, one that could wipe out seven million sows according to Rabobank estimates cited by Mussell.

“There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year,” Mussell said, predicting that the demand for all kinds of meat would rise as a result.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says ASF is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. It causes high death rates in infected pigs and can infect swine herds in various ways. There is no treatment.

Mussell said that swine populations in other countries, including Canada, are at risk of infection and that the disease has already spread to Vietnam, Russia and some Eastern European and African countries.

There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year Al Mussell

According to a Bloomberg News report, China may increase U.S. pork imports to a record 300,000 metric tonnes in 2019 as part of a commitment to increase American farm imports to resolve the trade war – 81 per cent more than the 166,000 tons in 2017.

But Pan Chenjun, an analyst at Rabobank International in Hong Kong, noted that increased U.S. pork imports alone would not be enough to offset China’s shortage.

“All protein imports may rise,” as a result, she told Bloomberg.

Ray Price, president of Sunterra Farms in Acme, Alberta, is worried about ASF.

“The biggest risk is people bringing meat into Canada,” he said. “But we have a very high standard of health and biosecurity in this country.”

While the swine flu outbreak poses risks, high pork prices could also create an opportunity Mussell said, and bring about investment in pork production in China and Canada.

“This is an incredible earning opportunity for hog producers and processors,” he said.

That comes in contrast to the potential bear market in oil seeds.

On March 22, the Chinese Government placed a ban on all Canadian canola imports, with both Viterra Inc. and James Richardson International having their canola importing permits suspended for unspecified reasons.

According to the Canola Council, Canada produces 18 million tonnes annually — 10 per cent of which is exported. Approximately 40 per cent of Canadian exports go to China.

Mussell said farmers will need to rotate to different crops.

“This would increase the supply of wheat and other grains at a time when China is drawing down its supply of rice, which will lower the demand for imported feed grains.”

Jay Schultz, co-owner of a 7,000-acre Alberta grain farm, said the Canadian grain sector is in for a rough ride.

“Normally markets are driven by fundamentals, charts, supply and demand — now it might be politics,” he said.

“Right now, we should be locking in new crop pricing for harvest,” he said. “And we haven’t signed futures contracts for next year yet – something we normally do.”

Schultz explained that many farmers have already purchased seed, equipment and chemicals.

“It’s hard to change at this point,” he said.

Mussell’s assessment of the 2019 growing season was in line with Schultz’s.

“Farmers are getting their machines ready for seeding,” he said. “But how are they supposed to know what seeds to plant? What should they expect for fall prices? Who is buying?”

“No one can, with a straight face, tell us that Canadian steel and aluminum pose a threat to American national security,” said federal Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland after a meeting in Washington March 25, as she attempts to get a deal headed to Congress for approval.

“I made the case to ambassador Lighthizer that these tariffs are completely unacceptable to Canada … to impose these tariffs on steel and aluminum on national security grounds is illegal, unjustified and frankly completely absurd,” she said.

Freeland was fresh from a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, where the two spent most of their time discussing that issue in the face of attempting to ratify last year’s three-nation trade deal.

“These tariffs cause many questions about ratifying NAFTA under these conditions…. Many Canadians feel this NAFTA is a free trade deal with the United States. All countries made some compromises to make this deal and in order to move ahead with that deal, the right thing is there should be no 232-tariffs or retaliatory measures between our three countries,” said Freeland.

The U.S. imposed its Section 232 tariffs for steel and aluminum a year ago to create advantages for its domestic producers on the grounds of protecting national security, while leveraging negotiations around the renewal of NAFTA. A program to lift tariffs on the two metals from Canada and Mexico was linked to the renegotiation of the NAFTA but did not make it through that process. Both Canada and Mexico have told U.S. lawmakers that it must be removed for the new NAFTA to be completed.

Freeland said she knows Canada’s retaliatory measures on $16 billion of targeted trade are hurting American businesses. These include import surtaxes on many steel and aluminum products, as well as agriculture and food products, such as processed meats, and many paper items.

Canadian farm equipment manufacturers say they are having to increase equipment and building prices as a result of the effects of the 232 tariffs (see our story on page 1 in this edition of The Western Producer), which have driven up prices for the American metal they have to buy.

Several U.S. lawmakers have said they did not believe the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, or CUSMA as it is known in Canadian legislation, could be ratified by the U.S. Congress if the metals tariffs along with retaliatory duties on American farm and other products were left in place.

The U.S administration has sought quotas on steel and aluminum in lieu of tariffs, but Canada and Mexico have resisted these, arguing that their metals pose no threat to U.S. national security.

USMCA-enabling legislation needs to be placed in front of Congress so it could be considered before the House recesses in August if it is going to avoid being caught up in another border-wall funding fight in the fall or the subsequent 2020 presidential election campaign.",New NAFTA attempts to avoid U.S. politics,The Western Producer,https://www.producer.com/2019/03/new-nafta-attempts-to-avoid-u-s-politics/

CBC's hit comedy Schitt's Creek, which just last week announced next season will be its last, has six nominations, while Crave TV's Letterkenny has three.

But the industry buzz both shows have recently received has less to do with their achievements in Canada and more to do with their success in the U.S. — something that's eluded Canadian-made comedies for decades, even as Canadian comedians became household names. Schitt's Creek, in particular, is enjoying a rare combination of commercial and popular success south of the border: from the glowing New York Times reviews to sold-out live shows by its cast members.

""Schitt's Creek has really broken through in a way that not a lot of even American-produced comedies have done lately,"" says Alan Sepinwall, chief TV critic for Rolling Stone magazine.

Schitt's Creek's journey

Sitting in his office at Pop TV in Los Angeles, Brad Schwartz is beaming with pride and emotion as he recalls the day he decided his small cable channel should broadcast Schitt's Creek to American audiences.

Dan and Eugene Levy, the show's creators and stars, already had CBC secured as the Canadian broadcaster. But Schwartz, a Canadian well established in the U.S. TV system, thought the little show with the funny title just might work there as well.

""It's a show that started with a wealthy family, a riches-to-rags story that in itself doesn't seem like anything we haven't seen before,"" says Schwartz. ""But the writing and the acting is so phenomenal, that the little things happen in the episode and the characters learn from those little things that happen, that change them in the next episode, and change them in the next episode.""

Sharon Wu/CBC More

Schwartz thinks the show benefited from being on a smaller, under-the-radar network in the U.S, where it could find its legs, make mistakes, and grow its audiences gradually. He also concedes that the Netflix exposure helped (the streaming giant picked up the show last year). But he maintains that it's the heart of the show — and maybe a bit of its Canadian spirit — that helped it stand out.

""We live in some dark times, there is some dark political climate, people are arguing and debating,"" says Schwartz. ""Audiences get to go to this joyous place, that just makes you feel good and escape. So yes, it's got comedy, it's got a lot of heart, it's got a lot of things, but it also has some Canadian joy to it that the world needs and brings that through.""

'Broad in its niche-ness'

In another fictional Canadian small town, a group of country folk characters have made their way into the hearts of American audiences. Letterkenny, the comedy, has aired on Crave TV in Canada since 2016 and is based on the wildly popular YouTube series by actor/writer Jared Keeso, called Letterkenny Problems. In fact, it's the audience response to the YouTube videos that suggested to Mark Montefiore, executive producer of Letterkenny, that the show might have potential in the U.S.

""The original YouTube videos were gaining a tremendous amount of traction globally mostly in North America, Australia, UK, Ireland, a lot of English-speaking territories, and I was able to watch that and monitor where was it growing,"" says Montefiore.

Adamonis’ counter-intelligence coup burnishes his ...","Very much in the tradition of the Cold War spy and espionage novels of writers such as John Le Carré or even Graham Greene, Provisionally Yours relays the story of a Lithuanian expat soldier named Justas Adamonis. He is returning to the country in the wake of Czarist Russia’s collapse after the First World War and the creation at Versailles of the modern-day Lithuanian state after centuries of its being controlled by Russia or Poland.

In the afterword of his new book Provisionally Yours , Lithuanian Canadian novelist Antanas Sileika observes how his native land was, for much of its modern existence, poised perilously between the “hammer of Germany and the anvil of the Soviet Union.” With the sabre-rattling, Crimea-annexing antics of Russian president Vladimir Putin currently destabilizing the Baltic region, Lithuanians both at home and abroad are once again fearful about their country’s future and its sovereignty. This makes Sileika’s new novel very timely indeed.

Kaunas becomes the new provisional capital of the country — Vilnius, its real capital, remains in Poland. After the Great War, the boundaries of many European states were in flux. Almost as soon as Adamonis disembarks in Kaunas, he is press-ganged into becoming the director of military intelligence. What ensues is his discovery of a smuggling scam between Berlin and Moscow that implicates and embarrasses much of the new country’s political leadership. Adamonis’ counter-intelligence coup burnishes his reputation and, with his newly acquired celebrity/notoriety, he is on a fast track to leading one of the landmark events in modern Lithuanian history: the liberation of the Lithuanian French-occupied seaport city of Klaipeda.

Adamonis’ motivation for this risky raid is personal as well as political. Early in the story, he falls in love with his beautiful American cousin, Lily, who recently returned to her native land with her blueblood diplomat husband in tow. Divorce is out of the question in Catholic Lithuania, but not in its soon-to-be liberated protestant province. Once Klaipeda is free of the French, Lily could divorce her husband and marry Adamonis. But love and politics form a toxic brew in Provisionally Yours and happy endings, it seems, are better suited to romantic novellas than espionage thrillers. I’ll leave the fate of our star-crossed lovers for intrepid readers to uncover for themselves.

Sileika’s novel is based on actual events in Lithuania’s often tragic modern day history. The Justas Adamonis character is modelled loosely, Sileikas notes in his afterword, on a man named Jonas Budrys who reached his apotheosis as the liberator of Klaipeda and ended his days as a chicken farmer in New Jersey.

Beinisch was Israel’s first female state attorney and the first woman ...","An independent judiciary is critical to upholding minority rights, yet Israel’s strong court system is under attack from many of the country’s political elite, according to Supreme Court Justice Rosalie Abella and Dorit Beinisch, the former president of the Israeli Supreme Court, who took part in a panel discussion in Toronto.

Over 650 people gathered at Beth Tzedec synagogue on March 24, to hear the two speak about the role that courts play in a free and democratic society.

The event was one of a number that are being held to mark the retirement of the synagogue’s senior rabbi, Baruch Frydman-Kohl, who will step down this summer after 26 years on the job.

The justices both stressed how important it is for the courts to remain independent from politics. In democracies, political pressure will, by definition, generally come from the majority. But it is incumbent upon the courts to protect the rights of the minorities, they argued.

“If you parse democracy as what it is, the most important part of democracy is having somebody there to say, ‘Majority, no. What you’re trying to do is bad for society,’ ” said Abella, before listing multiple countries where authoritarian regimes have been validated by majorities at the ballot box.

“It’s happening all over the world and we’re supposed to say it’s none of our business.… We already saw in our lifetime the consequences of ignoring that,” she continued, to applause. “We will not be silenced by people who say it’s none of your business. It is all of our business.”

Beinisch and Abella both have impressive resumes, even for Supreme Court justices. Abella became the youngest judge in Canadian history in 1976 and was the first Jewish woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Beinisch was Israel’s first female state attorney and the first woman to be appointed president of the Israeli Supreme Court.

Beinisch joked that she only became a judge because other political players didn’t want her around once her term as state attorney came to an end. “They thought the quickest way to (remove) my influence there is to send me to the Supreme Court,” she said.

The two justices also spoke about the difference between the judicial system in Canada, where commentators and politicians may disagree with a ruling but respect the institution that administered it, and Israel, where politicians are actively trying to undermine the independence of the court.

“The Israeli court became very strong in the eyes of politicians because of its independence, because we really don’t have to be popular in very difficult situations – when the state fights terror, when we have so many problems,” said Beinisch. “This is a tension that we know everywhere. The situation in Israel became more and more difficult.”

For example, Israeli politicians Nafatali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked want to curb the power that the country’s courts have over the Israel Defence Forces.

Abella said that she admires her colleagues who work in the Israeli judicial system, because they are able to do their jobs with so many external forces working against them.

“The Israeli supreme court is under regular and constant siege, rhetorical siege, from people who are trying to undermine its legitimacy, precisely because it’s doing its job properly and trying to make sure that the country’s feet stay close to the fire of morality and values that they started with,” she said.

Abella gave a lecture in Jerusalem in April 2018 on the independence of Israel’s courts that touched on many of the same themes as her panel discussion with Beinisch.

“Patriotism means upholding the values on which your country is based. Those values in Israel are Jewish and democratic. They include respect for human rights, tolerance, equality and dignity. That is what being patriotic means. Yet in championing those values, the Israeli judiciary finds itself demonized by some for being independent from political expedience and immune to political will,” Abella said in her lecture last year.

Throughout the evening, Abella and Beinisch constantly found themselves echoing each other’s points on the importance of a strong and independent judiciary that protects the rights of minorities.

“You know, we are not the best panel, because we agree on everything,” Beinisch joked at one point.

“That’s my favourite kind of panel,” replied Abella.","Panel hears Canadian, Israeli supreme court justices",Canadian Jewish News,https://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/panel-hears-canadian-israeli-supreme-court-justices

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conversations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence. She entered politics with her mind set on transforming the country and, after three years, came to believe she couldn’t do it as a Liberal. An early party switch meant trying to make the most of what could be her last year in office, she says, noting she had the support of her family and many constituents. But it also meant alienating supporters and staff who fought to get her elected and who now have reason to want to see her lose. Later this year, they will get their say on whether her actions were genuine and, above all, justified.",The Politics of Switching Parties,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/the-politics-of-switching-parties/

The issues the NDP have brought up in relation to Kenney through their attack ads are valid and important. We should be concerned about a party leader who has a track record of pushing for anti-abortion legislation and challenging the idea of same-sex rights. But we also need to be looking deeper into actual political issues facing us, which often transcend party lines due to their systemic nature.



When attack ads draw our attention away from issues and towards individuals, we get sucked into discursive spirals that can put blinders on our political outlooks. I will freely admit I’m no fan of Kenney, but I’m also no fan of Rachel Notely and her uncritical push for pipelines in the face of a global climate crisis.

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada’s energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to “the Notley-Trudeau alliance,” emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada’s former justice minister.

“If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it’s all Rachel Notley,” said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. “The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.”

The UCP’s focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

“(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,” said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta’s energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada’s economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp’s Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley’s camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

“The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn’t call it an alliance,” said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. “A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.”

The Canadian dollar is drifting lower ahead of tomorrow’s release of January Gross Domestic Product data. The forecast is for a modest improvement from -0.1% to 0.0%, which in the big scheme of things, is rather pathetic. Q4 ended on an ugly note, and some analysts believe January could start similarly. Yesterday, data showed January Merchandise Trade deficit narrowing to $4.25 billion from $4.82 billion, but that was less than expected. That result suggests Q1 GDP could be a tad worse than forecast.



A drop in oil prices managed to undermine the Canadian dollar as well. WTI oil fell from a peak of $60.20 U.S./barrel to a $58.80 U.S./b on Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that U.S. crude inventories rose 2.8 million barrels in the week ended March 22.



Broad-based U.S. dollar demand further eroded the Canadian dollar. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that euro-zone interest rates could stay unchanged beyond the end of 2019 which undermined EUR/USD and led to buying of U.S. dollars across the G-10 major currency spectrum. The U.S. dollar closed the Toronto trading session with small gains across the board



Overnight, FX markets were distracted by U.K. politics and wide price swings in GBP/USD. Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement that she would resign her position if the MP’s passed her Brexit deal was initially seen as a good sign for sterling. Prices rallied to $1.3260 just before yesterday’s close. There were eight votes on a series of motions to facilitate a Brexit deal, and all of them failed miserably. GBP/USD plunged to 1.3127.



U.S./China trade talks resume in Beijing today. Analysts believe that both sides are motivated to get a draft of a deal ready to sign before China President Xi Jinping returns to the U.S. in April. There are reports that China is making concessions on key issues like forced technology transfer. More talks are scheduled next week in Washington. If the headlines suggest that the two sides are close to a deal, it could spark a shift into risk-seeking trades and give the Canadian dollar a boost, in the process.



Traders are waiting for this morning’s U.S. data which includes Q4 GDP. Analysts are forecasting growth of 2.4%, down from the 2.6% previously estimated. The weaker than expected Retail Sales data gets the blame for causing the drop.

He is also an active critic, reviewer, translator and teacher.

His first poetry collection received the Gerald Lampert Award for Poetry, and his latest, The Waking Comes Late, won the Governor General’s Award for Poetry in 2016. Two of his works of fiction have been optioned for film.

No less an authority than Al Purdy described Heighton as “one of the best authors of his generation, maybe the best.”

His three later novels depict small communities of people trapped by powerful and hostile forces, natural or political, and pose the question, in the words of reviewer T.F. Rigelhof, as to what “it means to behave responsibly in a world fractured by political and personal responsibilities.”

It is, perhaps, Heighton’s political awareness, together with a recent sense of “sleepwalking through life” that drove him to travel to Greece to assist in the relief offered to refugees from Syria, and his poem, Samos, which describes this atrocious situation, is a finalist for the prestigious Moth Poetry Prize.

The Canadian charter further requires a legislature to renew the declaration every five years, failing which the ...","The Legault government is about to table its long-promised bill banning the wearing of religious symbols in a number of public service jobs, most notably by teachers. The indications are that the legislation will invoke the “notwithstanding clauses” to override the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Quebec was the first jurisdiction in Canada to adopt a comprehensive charter of rights, guaranteeing in law the respect of such basic human rights as freedom of conscience, of expression, of religion, and protection against discrimination. Quebec’s lead role in anchoring these fundamental rights in law was the outgrowth, perhaps the legal culmination, of Quebec’s Quiet Revolution, with the new charter offering a bulwark against a return to the type of state activities that characterized the Duplessis era.

Through the charters, we seek to prevent the recurrence of evils such as the internment of Japanese Canadians in the West or the persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Quebec, perpetrated by our own society in the not-so-distant past.

Both charters, however, allow the legislator to override protected rights by expressly declaring that a law will operate notwithstanding the charters, the so-called “notwithstanding clauses.”

There is an inherent tension, if not contradiction, in enacting a charter to protect fundamental rights from encroachment by the majority and then allowing the majority to override those rights by merely declaring that it wishes to do so.

To dissuade use of this power, the drafters provided that a law must expressly declare that it will operate notwithstanding the charter, in the hope that this would impose a political cost on a government that does so. The Canadian charter further requires a legislature to renew the declaration every five years, failing which the override ceases to have effect. This ensures that the suppression of a fundamental right will continually be put back on the political agenda.

By and large this has been successful. The notwithstanding clauses have rarely been invoked and never been renewed.

The Legault government now seems poised to invoke the notwithstanding clauses so that it may violate freedom of expression, freedom of religion and the protection against discrimination while removing recourse to the courts by the victims of those violations. This is almost breathtaking in its implications.

Premier François Legault may deny that the proposed law violates fundamental rights, or argue that the violations are minor and justified under the charters. But in our society, the courts, not Legault, must be the arbiters of what constitutes a violation of a right. Why, in the case of religious symbols only, should the state prohibit access to the courts to determine whether the measures are compatible with fundamental rights?

Also, contrary to Legault’s stated desire to deal with the issue of religious symbols once and for all, using the notwithstanding clause would ensure that the issue returns to the agenda every five years, a recipe for continuing debate and social discord.

Invoking the notwithstanding clause where fundamental freedoms are squarely at issue would normalize use of this extraordinary power and is an attack on the charters themselves.

If Quebec has moved away from Duplessis era politics, it is not because we are better than our predecessors or are no longer at risk of having a majority trammel the rights of minorities. It is because of conscious choices made to protect ourselves from such excesses. The charters are central to this. Allow them to be set aside so cavalierly, and we are all at risk.

Whatever one’s view on religious symbols, we must vigorously protest use of the notwithstanding clause to prevent access to the courts, especially by minorities, to have our rights determined and protected.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe crossed ...,"Given that Saskatchewan was the first place in North America with a social democratic government, it’s not as if we are strangers to overheated rhetoric.

But there are rules and one of the more important rules here (and most everywhere in the country) is that you confine your politics to your own jurisdiction.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe crossed that line this week in a tweet directed at Alberta voters urging them to unite behind one conservative party to defeat NDP Premier Rachel Notley.

“Dear Albertans, Prior to the formation of @SaskParty 20 years ago, our province was the example of what dividing the free enterprise movement will do: electing NDP governments, over and over again. United we win, divided we lose,” Moe tweeted.

Moe is supposed to be the premier for everyone in Saskatchewan. And he is addressing Albertans?

Essentially, Moe is engaging in the online equivalent of physically knocking on doors for Jason Kenney and Alberta’s United Conservative Party.

Why would he or others around him not get that there may be a problem here?

Sure, Moe has the right to his personal views and stating them in public likely surprises no one. Sure, it’s common to hear barbs thrown across the floor of the Assembly after the election in another province.

But there’s a reason why you have never seen other Saskatchewan premiers like Brad Wall or Lorne Calvert or Roy Romanow or Grant Devine campaigning for another province while in office. Unlike Moe, they were cognizant of their duties, responsibilities and who elected them.

You weren’t elected by anyone in Alberta. You don’t represent “the free enterprise movement.” Nowhere in your job description does it state that it’s your role to prevent “electing NDP governments.” Your job is not to hurry Rachel Notley along to her political demise, which seems an inevitability, anyway.

Good heavens. Can anyone imagine what Scott Moe would be saying if Rachel Notley started campaigning for Ryan Meili? Golden rule here.

Consider how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was rightly crucified for doing the same thing by stumping for then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne. So Moe is now following Trudeau’s lead? How’d that work out for either Wynne or Trudeau?

Mostly, though, you don’t do it because it’s bad for business.

It’s bad when you go to Conference of Confederation meetings and you have to stand shoulder to shoulder with Alberta’s premier — regardless of who that is — to fight for critical regional issues like pipelines. What would happen if Saskatchewan did have an NDP premier and Jason Kenney decided he couldn’t work with the NDP on pipelines? Would Saskatchewan be right to be miffed?

It’s bad the next time Saskatchewan has to go to a western premiers’ conference to talk about the New West Partnership or to talk about stocking Saskatchewan beer in Alberta or even barring Alberta licence plates at Saskatchewan work sites. (Sadly, the latter seems to have been a largely mythical issue that likely did arise over the Sask. Party government’s need to pick a fight with Alberta over something.)

It’s really bad because it represents a mindset of partisanship taking precedent over what’s good for the province. If Moe needs any reminding how problematic this is, he may want to recognize he’s complaining we don’t have a good equalization formula after Wall and his government abandoned pursuit of the equalization formula everyone in this province really wanted so as not to embarrass former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper for what amounted to an unworkable national promise.

But worst of all, it can only heighten the nastiness because voters see it as one more thing that was once unacceptable now becoming acceptable.

We witnessed elected Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities delegates screaming “traitor” at 40-year-elected MP Ralph Goodale. We heard at SARM mindless rants about separation and shipping the socialists to Venezuela.

Is Moe or anyone else thinking about whether this helps political discourse in Saskatchewan? Wouldn’t we be better off to tone down the animosity and rhetoric?

Commodities offered no support for the loonie with gold and oil under pressure from the advance of the US dollar as investors liquidated assets and repatriated funds in the American currency.







US GDP for the fourth quarter of 2018 was lower than expected and strengthened the narrative of slowing down global growth. Canadian GDP will be posted on Friday with a small rebound of 0.1 percent of monthly data expected.

The Bank of Canada (BoC) joined the choir of dovish central banks with no hikes expected this year and the rising probability of a cut if economic indicators don’t improve. Recession alarms have gone off, but for now it would be early as confirmation is lacking as positive signs remains such as employment.

OIL – Crude Recovers Ground After Trump Puts Spotlight on OPEC

Oil had a volatile session on Thursday as supply concerns were put on the back seat as US President Donald Trump took to twitter to put pressure on the OPEC to pump more crude. The OPEC+ agreement to limit production has been the major factor behind price stability considering rising US output. This is not the first time Trump uses social media to ask oil producers to lower the price of oil by introducing more supply into the market.







WTI flirted with the $60 price level but did not make a compelling case to breakthrough and is now back at around $59.15.

The weaker than expected US Q4 GDP sent a negative energy demand signal as global growth concerns rise as recession indicators keep flashing red.







Higher inventories this week piled on pressure on crude, even as the situation in Venezuela could spin out of control as blackouts and political pressure from the opposition could be the undoing of President Nicolas Maduro.

The threat of less waivers for Iranian crude purchases and longer sanctions against Venezuela will keep pushing prices higher alongside the efforts of the OPEC+ to keep soaking up excess supply with their agreement.

GOLD – Dollar Puts Pressure on Gold Ahead of Brexit and Trade Developments

Gold dropped more than 1 percent on Thursday as the US sucked the air out of the market putting pressure on the yellow metal. With the US-China trade negotiations ongoing and Brexit outcomes losing clarity by the minute the greenback was higher as investors preferred it as a safe haven above gold.







It is too early to count gold out for the week, given the British parliament could vote for the third time for Theresa May’s proposal on Friday. The British PM’s option remains the only one firmly on the table after MPs failed to reach consensus on a plan B as the factions remain too far apart to compromise.

May’s proposal despite being more tangible option, it is likely to fail, and with it Brexit itself as it opens the door for remaining if the Conservative government cannot deliver on the drawn-out process.

Starvation and chronic hunger have continuing, epigenetic effects that last ...","It really is the perfect time for Alicia Elliott’s A Mind Spread Out on the Ground to be published. In what the 31-year-old Tuscarora writer calls the Indigenous renaissance, Indigenous artistry has never had so spectacular a presence across Canada’s cultural spectrum. Maliseet composer Jeremy Dutcher took the Polaris Music Prize last year, the third Indigenous winner in ﬁve years, while three Indigenous artists have won the annual Sobey Art Award since 2013. Indigenous poets have won the Grifﬁn Prize, one of the richest and most prestigious poetry prizes in the world, three years running. With a constant presence on bestseller lists and among literary prize nominations and wins, Indigenous literature is now as integral to CanLit as the immigrant story. If the current wave of Indigenous cultural prominence recedes anywhere, it won’t be in literature. Whatever this says about the country’s blind spots in the past, there’s never been a brighter spotlight on or a broader audience for incisive Indigenous cultural commentary.

Elliott delivers that commentary in exceptional essays as arresting as her title, which comes from a richly evocative Mohawk phrase for someone in the grip of depression. Assured enough to mock herself on occasion—“I don’t have all the answers,” she writes, after 200 pages of laying them down with utter assurance, “even if I sometimes imply I do”—Elliott ranges over a wide canvas. She tackles the vexed question of identity, both personal and political, powerfully linking larger questions of Indigenous life—from the residential school legacy to the loss of languages—to the unfolding of her own life. In forthright prose, in a format—a buzzed-about book from a major publisher—that should make it difficult for non-Indigenous Canadians to ignore, she also links past and present, laying out how the colonial legacy still shapes contemporary lives, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. And how real reconciliation is going to require an internal reformation within non-Indigenous Canada.

It’s “complicated,” Elliott says of her own identity, in her ﬁrst use of a word that becomes a theme running right through an interview with her. She calls herself Tuscarora, one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee (historically known to white Canadians as the Iroquois), whose reserve near Brantford, Ont., is the country’s most populous. That’s not the federal government’s assessment of Elliott’s ethnicity. “Haudenosaunee people are matrilineal,” she continues. “But the imposition of the Indian Act changed everything. If you were to look at my status card it would say I’m Mohawk because it traces through patrilineal lines and my father is Mohawk. We had to actually do research into what we would be traditionally, which—going through my father’s maternal line—is Tuscarora.”

Elliott traces herself through her father’s maternal lineage because, complicating matters further, her own mother is white. She describes her “white-passing” skin colour as both a lifelong “shield” against casual racial harassment and a childhood “barrier” between her and her darker cousins, making her “both winner and loser, abuser and victim.” Also, not having been raised on the reserve, Elliott did not have Haudenosaunee culture “slowly, carefully poured into her hands” as those cousins did.

“There’s so much misunderstanding about Indigenous identity,” she says. “I look at it as being a citizen of a country. Indigeneity as a racial concept was something created by colonialism, something that we never acknowledged. We had adoptions into our nations that would have been similar to the way immigration works: you have to agree to certain things, to abiding by the Great Law and so forth. For me to say that I am Native means that is my afﬁliation, my nation, the group I have allegiance to. It doesn’t conflict to say I’m both Native and white-passing, or that I had to come to the culture later in life because of family circumstances. Those are things a lot of people who are Indigenous have to deal with.” Canada’s preferred image of an Indigenous person, she writes, is not “the modern Native girl in a sweatshirt and jeans trying to ﬁgure out how she ﬁts in ‘Reconciliation© Canada,’ ” but a stoic full-blooded Indian man decked out in beads and leather.

“Although,” she adds, in what could be a swipe at an unnamed Joseph Boyden, or, to be precise, at Boyden’s fans, “should the genuine artifact be unavailable, Canada will happily accept a handsome, agreeable white dude with tenuous Indigenous ‘roots’ as a substitute.”

If Elliott’s family circumstances brought her to parse identity closely, they also impelled her toward wider connections. Both her parents have engaged in domestic abuse and been arrested on various charges; the criminal justice system “didn’t help them, or our family.” Her mother’s abuse Elliott links to episodes of severe mental illness, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder, her father’s to intergenerational trauma—what his father inflicted on him. But the depression that has afflicted all of them, Elliott included, she believes to be as much a cultural phenomenon as a matter of personal history and brain chemistry. “We live in a society that is very much about the individual,” she says, where we are each responsible for pulling ourselves up, or where no one’s responsible when mental illness strikes. “The problem with that is that we don’t think of things such as class or race, even when you’re consistently having to worry about where your next meal is coming from or you know that when you’re looking for an apartment people are going to take one look at you and not want to rent. But those things are there—cultural depression, if you will.”

There are a lot of supposed “individual” choices in Indigenous life that are in fact out of people’s control, Elliott notes. Reading a study on the lingering effects of the Holodomor, the Ukrainian famine deliberately induced by a Soviet government determined to extinguish Ukrainian resistance and identity, she feels her breath catching in her throat. Never before had she seen an account of a non-Indigenous people sharing “my people’s experience of genocide,” especially as the decades roll on. Despite high literacy rates and economic success, Ukraine has the highest percentage among 41 countries surveyed of 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds who drink alcohol at least once a week, and 11-year-olds who smoke at least once a week, as well as the lowest life expectancy in Europe, all familiar pathologies in Canadian Indigenous communities. Starvation and chronic hunger have continuing, epigenetic effects that last for generations, among them substance abuse and elevated rates of diabetes among Indigenous people, rates that many non-Indigenous people blame on “lifestyle choices” or Indigenous biology, Elliott writes. “My father has diabetes,” she comments, and she looks warily ahead to her own diagnosis.

Unlike in Ukraine, the original crime continues, she writes. Many observers decry an ongoing “cultural genocide” still levied on Indigenous peoples. Elliott has no use for the adjective—it’s just plain genocide that she sees coming from a Canadian state that has not fundamentally changed its attitude, only its tactics. How else to explain an apology for residential schools co-existing with ongoing underfunding of Indigenous children’s education, or widespread anger over the fate of the murdered Tina Fontaine paradoxically combined with silence over the child welfare system that left Fontaine vulnerable in the ﬁrst place? “Today, the child welfare system abducts Indigenous children at abnormally high rates,” says Elliott. “And it is kind of terrifying to realize the number of Indigenous kids who are currently in the system exceeds the number of kids that were ever involved in residential schools. Yeah, that’s pretty alarming, given the high rates of high school failure and prison time among children from foster care. You know something is at play—it’s not much different from residential schools, just a variation.” Canada carries on as it began, she says, its economic system still “based on Indigenous destruction.”

If there are sparks of hope, one of the brightest lies in the cultural renaissance, in the admiration and respect Canadians are according Indigenous art. Although Elliott believes Indigenous writers are still treated differently in a way that reflects lingering colonial attitudes—“I read a magazine interview with [Grifﬁn Prize winner Billy-Ray] Belcourt in which the interviewer seemed almost offended at the fact Belcourt is very well-educated and uses a lot of big words, when his poetry deals with very complex issues of sexuality, gender and colonialism”—the situation is changing rapidly. “We are moving on from a situation where we had to constantly address who we are, why we matter, constantly explaining things about our culture, things that white writers speciﬁcally don’t have to deal with. They can move on to what actually interests me: what do I want to do stylistically, what really cool things that would play with form or time? We have gone from Lee Maracle ﬁghting to get a foot in the door to Joshua Whitehead writing a cyberpunk poetry book. We’re now able to show our creativity and talk about things other than just our identities.”

Respect for artistry is a balm Elliott acknowledges, but it doesn’t come close to countering continuing assaults on Indigenous life. Canada still wants what it has always wanted, the resources on (or beneath) Indigenous land, which means the path to true reconciliation—which requires acceptance of Indigenous sovereignty—can seem permanently impassable. In her last and most provocative essay, which links domestic violence to state-sponsored violence in the same way she sees her own family as the micro reflection of macro Indigenous culture, she asks her readers a series of questions about their true responses to abuse and exploitation. It culminates in questions about what Elliott, borrowing a term from writer Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, refers to as extract­ionism, the entrenched idea that the land and its resources are there to be plundered. “What do you want? Are those desires based on extraction? Are they dependent on capitalism or colonialism?”

Elliott’s message is clear: For reconciliation to ﬁnally arrive, it’s non-Indigenous Canada that has to change, to become more like Indigenous Canada, rather than the reverse. Otherwise, the past—not dead at all or even really in the past—will carry on and on and on.

Morneau's office to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. The ensuing political fallout has cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers -- Wilson ...","

Jordan Press and Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- SNC-Lavalin warned federal prosecutors last fall about a possible plan to split the company in two, move its offices to the United States and eliminate its Canadian workforce if it didn't get a deal to avoid criminal prosecution, newly obtained documents show.

The documents, part of a PowerPoint presentation obtained by The Canadian Press, describe something called ""Plan B"" -- what Montreal-based SNC might have to do if it can't convince the government to grant a so-called remediation agreement to avoid criminal proceedings in a fraud and corruption case related to projects in Libya.

Under that plan, SNC would move its Montreal headquarters and corporate offices in Ontario and Quebec to the U.S. within a year, cutting its workforce to just 3,500 from 8,717, before eventually winding up its Canadian operations.

""The government of Canada needs to weigh the public interest impact of the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin,"" the presentation reads.

""We must humbly ask whether the public interest is served to prosecute SNC-Lavalin, and to try to achieve a guilty verdict. Such a decision would effectively lead to the end of SNC-Lavalin as we know it today and has been for more than 100 years.""

Of all the options for the future of the company, the plan in the presentation was the ""most obvious"" to follow and ""well advanced"" in terms of planning, say the documents, which the Privy Council Office confirmed receiving in late September, at the same time as prosecutors.

The company's board and senior management were prepared to quickly bundle parts of the business that had no role in the Libya case into a new entity, putting the ""trio of possibly convicted entities"" into another organization that would operate ""on a reduced business level in Canada or heading into eventual wind-up,"" they read.

The details appear to contradict public statements by chief executive officer Neil Bruce, who has denied both that the company threatened to move its headquarters, and that the company cited its some 9,000 Canadian jobs as a reason the construction giant should be granted a remediation agreement.

The company walked back the comments days later in a statement, saying a remediation deal was the best path to protect its Canadian workforce.

SNC-Lavalin spokesman Nicolas Ryan confirmed the authenticity Thursday of what he called a ""confidential document"" that was submitted to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to allow the director of public prosecutions to consider the company's request for an agreement.

""We have always been transparent with our various stakeholders about the importance of the public interest argument/case for Canada in having a globally competitive SNC-Lavalin as part of Canada, headquartered in Montreal,"" Ryan said in a statement.

A remediation agreement remains ""the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs,"" the statement continues.

""We have also said that we have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders and employees, and as such is our responsibility to look at all our options available.... this does not mean that we have chosen one option or that a decision has been taken on which option we will pursue, simply that there are various possibilities we must consider.""

The presentation, which was delivered by mail to The Canadian Press anonymously and without a return address, also suggests the end of seven-figure donations and sponsorships for various community causes, hundreds of millions more in lost tax revenues, and the loss of spending on research positions at universities.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has held up the threat of job losses as the main reason he and others pressed former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to look into the prosecutor's decision.

Wilson-Raybould told the Commons justice committee last month she came under ""consistent and sustained"" pressure -- including veiled threats -- from Trudeau, his office, the Privy Council Office and Finance Minister Bill Morneau's office to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The ensuing political fallout has cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers -- Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the affair -- as well as one of his top aides, Gerald Butts, and Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, who will leave his post as the top federal civil servant before the fall election.

Bruce and Wernick met on Sept. 18 about the company's legal troubles.

Notes taken at the meeting, tabled as evidence with the House of Commons justice committee, show that Wernick told Bruce to take the public interest argument to the director of public prosecutions, adding the company ""will want to get it right.""

Wernick testified earlier this month that he spoke with Wilson-Raybould the next day where the former attorney general appeared ""very firm in her mind"" that the prosecutor's decision to not negotiate a deal with SNC-Lavalin was final. Wernick said Wilson-Raybould told him the only option for the company was to make public interest arguments through its lawyers.

Jaclyn Corin, 18, has become a prominent advocate for gun control after experiencing one of the worst mass school shootings in American history, when 17 of her fellow students and staff were gunned down and 17 more injured on Valentine’s Day, 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. A former student has confessed to the murders.

Corin and other students have channeled their grief, suffering and constant anxiety attacks from that shooting into a push for gun control. Corin is a central figure in the “Never Again” movement and helped organize March for Our Lives, one of the largest youth protests since the Vietnam War. It's a campaign that has prompted fierce opposition from the U.S. National Rifle Association (NRA).

She told an Ottawa crowd on Friday that the tactics she has observed from the NRA are similar to what is now being deployed by the Canadian Coalition for Firearms Rights against Dr. Najma Ahmed, a surgeon at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.

One year ago, the world changed. Thanks for sticking with us. #MarchForOurLives 💙 pic.twitter.com/50acE3EBpf — Jaclyn Corin (@JaclynCorin) March 24, 2019

The NRA, she said, was “among the most powerful special interest lobby groups in the U.S., with a substantial budget to influence — or bribe — members of Congress on gun policy.”

""It's pretty similar to the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, the CCFR, here (in Canada), which, if you guys didn't know, started a campaign telling members to file complaints against a doctor advocating for stricter gun control — someone that actually sees the results of gunshot wounds, someone that is just trying to save people's lives,” said Corin at the Progress Summit, a public policy gathering organized by the Ottawa-based Broadbent Institute, named after former NDP Leader Ed Broadbent.

In response, the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, declined to say whether it was using NRA tactics. But it denied that it was acting in bad faith, and told National Observer that it believed Corin was using ""dismissive and insulting language.""

Canadian doctors plan day of action on gun control

Ahmed, the Toronto surgeon, co-founded Canadian Doctors for Protection from Guns, a group of largely emergency room physicians. She was on call the night of the Danforth shooting in July 2018, when three people died and 13 others were shot and injured.

She has accused the CCFR of being behind roughly 70 complaints against her that were filed with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. This month, the college, which investigates professional misconduct allegations, dismissed those complaints as “frivolous” and “vexatious.”

Meantime, Ahmed is carrying on.

Her group is spearheading a nationwide Day of Action next Wednesday calling for stricter gun control. The group wants to see the Trudeau government’s Bill C-71 passed.

The bill, which has cleared the House of Commons and is now being considered by a Senate committee, would overhaul the background check system and create new retailer record-keeping rules.

In February, Ahmed testified at the committee looking at C-71, saying the bill was ""a small but positive step."" She argued that even though Canada's gun fatality rate was five to six times lower than the United States, it was also eight times greater than other peer nations of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan and Australia.

""Guns are the vector in this preventable public health crisis. They are the key exposure in this epidemic. Physicians are witnesses to the human toll that guns take on our patients, their families and their communities,"" she told the committee.

Gun group: shooting survivor's words 'insulting'

The CCFR, however, says Ahmed’s work with the doctors group means she is “moonlighting as a social justice warrior,” and accused her of “verging on narcissism” for “politicizing” the Danforth shooting.

""You would think someone this educated, with a background in the sciences would be more of a critical thinker,"" the group said about Ahmed on a webpage it has set up about her.

They also say Ahmed's actions detract from “credible work we need to demand on crime, gang violence, mental health and terrorism.” For example, the CCFR believes that the March 26 seizure of 26 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition is ""exactly where the resources being wasted on C-71 should be going.""

CCFR CEO and executive director Rod Giltaca told the Senate committee that C-71 was ""completely ineffective"" as there were ""no provisions that address the root causes of violence in our society.""

""The idea that Bill C-71 is needed to increase public safety isn’t true. The government has been caught lying and manipulating statistics to support this unnecessary bill,"" he said.

Asked on Friday by National Observer about Corin’s comment, Giltaca said the school shooting survivor’s words were out of line.

“In place of a civilized debate, the dismissive and insulting language of Ms. Corin and those in the doctor's group is what we've come to expect from them,” said Giltaca.

Giltaca also argued that the College of Physicians and Surgeons’s dismissal of the complaints were not because they were unfounded, but rather “not the forum for this issue.” The college has said it is unusual to receive complaints about advocacy work instead of patient outcomes.

“Whether we believe that complaints to the CPSO was the correct course of action, the doctors have demonstrably spread misinformation and we fear that Canadians believed it without question because they are doctors,” he said. “We believe that lodging complaints with the licensing body was a reasonable course of action.”

This is EXACTLY where the resources being wasted on C-71 should be going. Into programs, and investigations that have real world, tangible results while leaving law abiding Canadians alone.https://t.co/z4SYMgoOpV — CCFR/CCDAF (@CCFR_CCDAF) March 26, 2019

'Anxiety attacks, memorial visits, vacant desks'

This week, the Parkland students were forced once again to confront their grief after the apparent suicides of two students.

""Thousands of people in my community would now have to redefine their new normal,” Corin told the Broadbent crowd Friday. She described never-ending ""anxiety attacks, memorial visits, vacant desks.”

In 2017, she said, nearly 40,000 Americans died as a result of guns, or an average of 109 people a day. There were 24 school shootings last year that resulted in gun-related deaths or injuries.

""The worst part is, far too many stories of gun violence go untold or are forgotten back home as American society willingly moves on,” said Corin.

""Young people, specifically those who reside in low socioeconomic areas, grow up with gun violence as their reality. Days without gunshots as their background noise seem unusual.”

Trauma doesn’t disappear. — Jaclyn Corin (@JaclynCorin) March 24, 2019

Perhaps the one thing worse than gun violence, she added, is its normalization in society.

“We are coerced by continual propaganda into believing that this reality cannot be changed, as guns have been completely and totally fused into our culture, largely due to the NRA's influence on American politics.""",Parkland school shooting survivor calls out Canadian gun lobby for acting like NRA,National Observer,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/03/29/news/parkland-school-shooting-survivor-calls-out-canadian-gun-lobby-acting-nra

Toronto-based Zdanowski told The Hollywood Reporter she received an official invitation March 25 for her film to screen in competition in Beijing. ""It's a great pleasure to inform you the excellent film In God I Trust is selected by the committee of the Beijing International Film Festival to screen in Forward Future Section and compete with other 17 films for final awards,"" the invitation stated.

The Canadian film In God I Trust by director Maja Zdanowski has been disinvited by the Beijing Film Festival from its 2019 event next month amid a growing diplomatic feud between the U.S. and China over the Chinese mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies.

That was followed March 29 by another email from a coordinator for the Forward Future section that confirmed In God I Trust had been caught up in the diplomatic crossfire between governments in China, Canada and the U.S. related to the Dec. 1 arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei Technologies, at the request of U.S. authorities.

Huawei's Meng, who is out on bail in Vancouver, faces possible fraud charges in the U.S. for her alleged dealings with American banks if extradited to the U.S.

""We tried many ways to get the film through, but failed. It's not the film itself that has political problems, it's going abroad (I'm sure you've heard about Huawei). So we are very sorry,"" the organizer said, before adding: ""We hope that the film will meet Chinese audiences when the environment improves.""

THR has viewed the correspondence between Zdanowski and the Beijing Film Festival organizers.

Officials at the Beijing Film Festival could not be reached for comment on the invitation for In God I Trust being pulled.

""They do not say why, but it's pretty obvious that they are not receiving a film from Canada at this time,"" Zdanowski told THR.

As China-Canada relations get caught up in the geopolitical tensions over the Huawei exec's extradition proceedings, Beijing authorities earlier detained two Canadians in China on vague national security charges, and suspended some Canadian farm product imports as a part of a campaign of intimidation and retribution.

And Toronto-based apparel maker Canada Goose, whose cozy fur-lined jackets are popular with Hollywood celebs and a luxury status symbol in China, has seen its stock price tumble since the arrest of Huawei's Meng late last year, and calls on Chinese social media sites for a boycott of the pricey Canadian parkas.

Diplomatic tensions also veered into the film and entertainment arena in 2016 when China targeted Korean K-pop stars over Seoul's decision to deploy a U.S.-made missile defense system on the Korean peninsula in spite of vocal opposition from Beijing. That was followed by the 2017 Beijing Film Festival choosing no Korean titles in its lineup of around 500 films that year.

In God I Trust, which stars John Cassini, Marc Senior and Steven Roberts, tells the intertwining stories of a young black man, a reckless white nationalist and a pair of traveling vacationers during a random encounter in Northern Idaho.

Scroll through your Facebook feed and you’ll see it’s the Wild West for political advertisers on Facebook, communication experts say. As Alberta heads to the polls on April 16, political parties and third-party advertisers are corralling votes through mobile apps and online advertising.



All of this comes as online advertisers and platforms face increasing scrutiny from federal regulators concerned with interference that could ultimately influence election results.

Going Mobile

However, new federal rules won’t impact Albertans who will see their fair share of targeted political messages this coming provincial election.Targeted Facebook AdsFacebook ads are excellent for reaching audiences advertisers want to connect with. But, it’s the ability to target ads at specific demographics that has some experts, like analyst Sara Bannerman, worried.“What’s concerning to me is the lack of transparency. That we really don’t have a tool for monitoring what kind of advertising is out there,” says Bannerman, the Research Chair in Communication Policy and Governance at McMaster University.Bill C-76, introduced by the federal government last December, is attempting to force online platforms to maintain a sharable database of political advertisements.Google Canada has already decided they won’t be hosting political ads for the next Federal Election due to that requirement. In the U.S., U.K., India, and Brazil, Facebook maintains ad libraries that track who purchases political ads, how much they paid, and how the ads performed.Facebook promises to launch a Canadian ad archive in June, before the next federal election, but after Alberta’s provincial election.Under Alberta law, political advertisers only need to disclose their expenses to Elections Alberta. However, Bannerman insists more information, including how organizations are aiming particular messages to certain groups and which groups are being targeted with specific ads, should be shared with the public.“If ads are only seen by the people who [are meant to] see them, then we’re not even participating in the same conversation.”

Mobile apps are one of the newer tools being made available by political parties. Apps can be used to communicate directly with supporters, gather data, and organize campaigns.

Peter Ryan, public relations professor at Mount Royal University, says Albertans should be concerned about how easily these apps collect users’ private information.

The Alberta NDPs app Forward is the only mobile app made available to the general public.

“If they’re downloading a partisan app, we don’t know what information is getting collected by that party … we don’t know how [the data] is being used, and what effect it will have on the election.”



Ryan added there is also no way of knowing what security is in place in the event of a hack.



So far, the Alberta NDP’s app, Forward, is the only one available within the Google Play and Apple app stores.



The app requests biographical information such as name, constituency, phone number, and email.



However, as of March 14, the app wasn’t completely accessible to the public, as users who provided basic information, and granted notification and text message permissions were never sent the invitation code needed to access any in-app content.

Third-party advertisers

While political parties will be doing their share of advertising online, they’re not the only ones with a stake in this election.

Organizations not affiliated with political parties can spend up to $150,000 on advertising, per legislation introduced by the current government back in 2017.

Third-party advertisers and other groups not directly linked to political parties have the capacity and legal ability to advertise as well, which Ryan says is going to show us a lot about their role in our politics.



“We will learn which political parties will be able to leverage the third-party space to effectively amplify their messages to strategically frame their opposition and drive voters to the polls to support their election policies.”



While these third parties can advertise, they are required by law to register with Elections Alberta but can spend no more than $150,000 on advertising.



The Alberta Federation of Labour, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, and political-action organizations like Shaping Alberta’s Future are three examples of groups registered as third-party political advertisers with Elections Alberta.

Unregistered groups

Public Facebook groups with thousands of members can spread suspicious news articles to non-members through sharing.

While registered third parties will have their spending monitored by the province, Ryan raises the issues of groups who may not be receiving or spending any money at all, but still exerting great influence.



“If you aren’t receiving any money you can still have a [Facebook] group and post away,” says Ryan.



“A huge group right now is the Yellow Vest movement online, over 100,000 people are following it. That could influence a provincial election.”



Yellow Vests Canada identifies itself as a group that supports the building of pipelines and opposes carbon taxes, globalists and ‘treason’ committed by Canadian politicians. The group’s Facebook page is filled with posts by members sharing from sources such as Debate Post which makes unsubstantiated claims, often about immigration or Prime Minister Trudeau.



Ryan encourages voters to be critical of posts they see online and attempt to verify what they see with trusted media outlets and official government sources, like Elections Alberta.



“If it’s not the mainstream media reporting or circulating information to you, I would say consumers beware of that information.”

Renee Merrifield Wasylyk and I meet on a brisk Saturday afternoon. She’s at home, so it’s not the power-suit-clad executive with that signature red lipstick who greets me; it’s a relaxed, makeup free, softer version of Renee who pours two glasses of VQA and invites me to her kitchen table.

This is home base for a busy, blended family of eight: Renee, her fiance Carlos, the five (mostly grown) children between them that come and go, and the adorable hound, Winston.

I let Renee know my intention is not to write an article about her political aspirations, but as we talk and the conversation flows freely, I realize her passion for being a voice and bringing people together at the family, business and political levels is truly who she is at her core. We can’t “not” talk about it.

“Honestly, I love it. I don’t love politicking, politics or shenanigans, but I love democracy,” she says, leaning forward in her chair. “I love the conversation, contrary ideas that have to be shared in order to figure out the consensus.”

Renee is seeking the Conservative nomination in the federal riding of Kelowna-Lake Country. She doesn’t see herself as a politician; she prefers the word conduit.

“I am simply someone who can get people to the table. I’m not the one doing anything other than putting the pieces together.”

Renee has been putting pieces together and asking the big questions since she was a child.

“At eight years old I asked my dad why there were no female presidents and he told me, ‘honey, you can be the first female president of the United States of America.’” She chuckles at the memory, adding that this could never be the case as a Canadian citizen; however, the seed was planted.

“If I look back, that was one of the two moments in my life that told me it’s okay to be a change-maker.”

The other inspiration came from a Rabbi professor at Concordia University. (Renee holds a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies and a Master of Theology)

“He said, ‘Renee, God is so big, He is not afraid of your questions, but also don’t be afraid when He asks you to change the world.’”

Renee has been enacting change, most notably on the Kelowna development scene, since she started Troika Developments in 1998. Based on her degrees and first career job as a Celebrative Arts Ministry Associate at Trinity Baptist Church, development wasn’t the obvious choice. It became a necessary choice as Renee faced the reality of financially supporting a young and growing family.

“I started working for a developer. I negotiated a land assembly. Then I started my own consultation business. It was the school of hard knocks, just learning on the go.”

After just two and a half years of consulting on land assemblies, acquisitions, permits and contracts for other developers, Renee was ready to launch Troika — and she most definitely made waves.

“When I launched, I had three projects. A 56-unit townhome development, a 44-unit apartment block and a mixed-use commercial site that I launched all at once,” she says, shaking her head. “I would never do it like that again, but it really put me on the map. Other developers where like, ‘Who is she? Who does she think she is?’”

Renee says “she” is simply someone who listened to people who knew more than her; someone who accepted help when it was offered and someone who still lives by those principles today.

“I remember being overwhelmed by the kindness. If I was doing it wrong, they’d say, ‘Renee, you should do it this way.’ My network became my teachers and I still look at it that way.”

With 21 years in business under her belt and many business accolades, including Entrepreneur of the Year – Pacific Region, Most Influential Business Woman of the Year – BC, and two appearances on Canada’s list of the Top 100 Most Powerful Woman, Renee is ready to step into a new role.

“When [Conservative Party Leader] Andrew Scheer came and asked me to run, that to me was an invitation to the table. So now I have an invitation to be able to affect change and that’s a pretty powerful invitation. I will also get to bring my community to a greater standing on the national stage. Who wouldn’t want to do that?”

As of press time, no date for the Conservative nomination has been set, but Renee is actively talking to the people in her community as if she’s already representing them and loving every minute of it.

“Should I win the nomination, and you don’t do this because you think you’re going to lose” she adds, “I want to make sure the right people are part of the conversation. I’m meeting all these farmers, for example. My mind is blown — they have incredible stories and incredible knowledge. They should be at the table telling their story and allowing me to make it easier to build our economy with their businesses.”

Renee’s family supports her decision to pursue the nomination. She smiles from ear to ear when I bring up her children. I wonder aloud what someone who expects so much of herself might expect from her kids.

“I have high expectations for them, but I’m not proud of them when they achieve something. I’m proud of them when they work hard, when they put in effort. I’m proud of them because of what they give to what they care about.”

When it comes to pride, Renee’s fiance, Carlos, is brimming with it. The importance of that support is not lost on her.

“That is sometimes a difficult thing for a man to be, but when you find the man who is happy to be your champion, cheerleader, lover and friend — you hold on to him tightly and you will do the same for him.”

Carlos appears as if on cue. Our time is almost up as Renee has another function to attend. As I swallow the last of my wine and feel grateful that I am going home to enjoy a quiet night “in,” Renee seems just as enthusiastic about her night “out.” An opportunity to meet more people, to listen as they share their stories and — as that cherished Rabbi professor told her all those years ago — to accept a role that may one day “change the world.”",Troikia’s Renee Merrifield Wasylyk Considers A Move To The Political Arena,Abbotsford News,https://www.abbynews.com/life/troikias-renee-merrifield-wasylyk-considers-a-move-to-the-political-arena/

The all-consuming, breathless political drama over the SNC Lavalin scandal has rocked the Liberal government to its foundations. The grinding courtroom fight in the breach-of-trust case case against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, the military's former second-in-command, is somewhat less flashy, but still high-profile.

What links them — and, to a lesser degree, the extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou — is the fear that politics can trump prosecutorial independence.

Former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould put a finger on the issue in her clandestine recording of a telephone conversation with the country's top bureaucrat, Michael Wernick. The recording was released to the Commons justice committee and the media Friday.

The two were discussing the possibility of a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC Lavalin — which faces corruption charges, including fraud and bribery — and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's insistence that such an option be considered.

""Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean?"" Wilson-Raybould asked Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council, in the Dec. 19, 2018 conversation.

""This is not about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.""

Wernick responded: ""Well, I don't think (Trudeau) sees it as that.""

In what could be construed as an attempt to protect the prime minister, Wilson-Raybould later insisted that someone should explain the implications to Trudeau more clearly.

Wilson-Raybould warned about the potential knock-on effect in cases like Norman's, although she suggested the government's conduct in Norman's case has been above reproach.

'The cases are not dissimilar'

""We can stand up in the House of Commons on [the case of Vice-Admiral Mark] Norman on — totally appropriately on Norman — on extradition, and we can talk about the rule of law,"" she said in the recorded conversation.

""The cases are not dissimilar. The principle, or the integrity, of how we act and respond to the tools we have available and what we should and shouldn't do, again ... I just don't know.""

Norman's defence team has tried to paint the prosecution of the former navy commander, who is accused of leaking cabinet secrets, in political terms.

Norman's lawyer, Toronto attorney Marie Henein, at first accused former cabinet minister Scott Brison of interfering in the $668 million shipbuilding deal at the heart of the criminal case.

In a dramatic recent turn, Norman's lawyers alleged that the Privy Council Office, the department that supports the Prime Minister's Office, was attempting to direct the prosecution — a claim that by itself is more serious than Wilson-Raybould's claim that she felt ""pressure"" over the SNC Lavalin matter.

Henein has subpoenaed emails, text messages and meeting notes belonging to Trudeau and his senior advisers, including Wernick and Wilson-Raybould, in order to make that case.

Those documents have just started to land in the hands of Norman's defence — but some have arrived in redacted form.

Wilson-Raybould has not commented substantively on the Norman case. Henein, reacting to the SNC Lavalin scandal, recently made a point of telling the court she wanted to know what conversations the former justice minister had regarding the trial, and whether she still has notes related to it.

How SNC-Lavalin could play into Norman's defence

Rory Fowler, a retired lieutenant-colonel and former military lawyer now in private practice, said Wilson-Raybould's taped remarks have to be parsed within their context — that she knew she was being recorded.

""Part of the challenge is that the interpretation of what she's saying and the relevance of what she's saying is skewed by the fact that she knows she's recording it and the clerk of the Privy Council does not,"" Fowler said.

The former justice minister may have argued that giving SNC Lavalin what it wanted would have created the perception of political interference in the Norman case — but Fowler said he fully expects the vice-admiral's lawyer to take that remark and turn its on its head.

Henein ""has already done a very good job, on arguably limited information, to draw the suggestion that there was political motivation behind the prosecution,"" Fowler said.

""She doesn't have a smoking gun yet.""

It will take documents, and perhaps the testimony of witnesses, to establish whether there was political interference in Norman's case, he added.",The spectre of political interference linking SNC-Lavalin to the Norman trial,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/snc-lavalin-mark-norman-1.5078179

A recording made by Wilson-Raybould of a 17-minute Dec. 19 call between herself and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick was released today, along with 43 pages of emails, texts and a written statement from Wilson-Raybould herself which were tabled to the Commons justice committee.

Wernick — who was not aware he was being recorded — told the minister there was ""rising anxiety"" over the fate of a major employer.

""He's quite determined, quite firm,"" Wernick said of the prime minister's position on getting a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for the Quebec-based engineering company. ""But he wants to know why the DPA route, which Parliament provided for, isn't being used. And I think he's going to find a way to get it done, one way or another.""

Listen to the call:

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould recorded a conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick as she faced pressure over SNC-Lavalin file. 17:25

In her written statement, Wilson-Raybould explains why she recorded the call.

She said she normally has a staff member present to take careful notes, but on this occasion she was alone in her Vancouver condo.

""I was anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an an inappropriate conversation,"" she wrote.

""So while I typed out notes during the phone call, I took the extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step of making an audio recording of the conversation without so advising the Clerk. This is something that I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.""

Why she resigned

In her statement, Wilson-Raybould also sheds new light on why she resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

Conservatives have suggested she was fired from the justice portfolio and moved to Veterans Affairs for refusing to budge on the SNC-Lavalin matter.

But Wilson-Raybould said that while she initially thought she'd been shunted to Veterans over the SNC-Lavalin affair, she ultimately decided that was not the reason.

""After much reflection, I decided to take the prime minister at his word, that this was not the case, and accepted a post I was honoured to have as the Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence,"" she wrote.

Wilson-Raybould went on to say that a subsequent series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver, and a Feb. 11 news conference, led to her resignation:

""The prime minister stated publicly, when issues about the propriety of the government's conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose, that my ongoing presence in cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day, and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.""

That news conference came just days after the explosive Feb. 7 Globe and Mail story which first reported the allegations of inappropriate political pressure on Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

When Trudeau was asked at that press conference about inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould, he said she ""confirmed"" a conversation she had with him in the fall where he said any decision on the matter was hers alone. He said he was limited in terms of what more he could say because of cabinet confidentiality.

""In our system of government, of course, her presence in cabinet should actually speak for itself,"" he said at the time.

While Wilson-Raybould and former cabinet minister Jane Philpott have suggested there is much more to tell in the story, today Wilson-Raybould said she has now divulged all her relevant information.

""I do not believe I have anything further to offer a formal process regarding this specific matter, though of course if compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process I would do so,"" she said.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said this is more evidence the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign.

""Justin Trudeau also told Canadians what he knew to be false,"" he said. ""He knew that his attorney general had serious concerns about his plan to get SNC-Lavalin off of serious criminal charges. But he looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him. This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation.""

When Wernick testified before the committee for a second time on March 6, he said he did not have ""independent recollection"" of what he said during a Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould.

'I did not wear a wire': Wernick

""I did not record the conversation. I did not wear a wire. I did not take notes and that is not my recollection of how the conversation flowed,"" he testified.

During his testimony on March 6, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick said he did not record his conversations. 0:28

Wernick resigned as Privy Council clerk, the country's top civil servant, on Mar. 18, saying there was ""no path"" for him to have a ""relationship of mutual trust and respect"" with opposition party leaders.

Wernick's first appearance in front of the justice committee was widely criticized by Opposition MPs and pundits as partisan for the way he defended the behaviour of various government officials.

He is set to officially leave his post on April 19.

During the recorded call released today, Wilson-Raybould repeatedly stated that she thought the conversation with Wernick was inappropriate and that she wanted to protect the prime minister and the integrity of the government. In his testimony before the justice committee, Wernick said that Wilson-Raybould could have raised her concerns about inappropriate pressure, but did not.

Trudeau still 'wishes' Wilson-Raybould had come to him: PMO

Trudeau's spokesman, Cameron Ahmad, issued a statement Friday saying that the Prime Minister's Office was unaware of the full contents of the audio recording and now acknowledge that Trudeau ""should have spoken directly with the former justice minister and attorney general about this matter — and he wishes that she had come to him.""

Ahmad said there has clearly been an erosion of trust ""over the past few months"" between Wilson-Raybould, Wernick and the PMO and that steps are being taken to improve cabinet relations.

""All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the prime minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country,"" Ahmad said.

In an interview with CBC Radio's The House to air Saturday, Conservative deputy leader Lisa Raitt said Wernick sounded uncomfortable, likely because he was doing something inappropriate in delivering the prime minister's message.

""He didn't give her comfort. He didn't say, 'That's okay Jody.' He landed it with, 'Well I guess we've got nothing else to talk about,'"" she told host Chris Hall.

""So he is complicit in it. He threatened her job and he threatened her position. There's no question about it. And he did it on the behest of the prime minister. He may have sounded uncomfortable doing it, but he still did it.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the fresh evidence is so compelling that a public inquiry must be called to get to the bottom of the affair.

""The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement. What we see in this submission is a lawyer acting in her client's best interests to protect him from his own recklessness,"" he said in a statement. ""The former attorney general repeatedly made clear to the prime minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference, and they ignored her.""

Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould submitted written material to the Commons justice committee this week for its study of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The material, released by the committee Friday, included a recording of her conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick. (Canadian Press photos)

As attorney-general, Wilson-Raybould was acting as the government's lawyer and was bound by solicitor-client privilege. In Canada, it is not illegal for a person to record a conversation with another person without their knowledge — but it would be unusual for a solicitor to knowingly record conversations with a client without informing them first.

Many law societies, including the B.C. Law Society and the Law Society of Ontario, forbid lawyers from recording conversations with clients without their knowledge under code of conduct rules.

Wilson Raybould was called to the Ontario bar in June 2016 under a section of the Barristers Act which entitles a minister of justice and attorney general of Canada or solicitor general of Canada to be called to the bar.

Trudeau's waiver on cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege allows Wilson-Raybould to speak freely about events up to her departure as justice minister and attorney general. It does not cover the period when she remained in cabinet after being moved to Veterans Affairs.

Pressure, veiled threats

She testified on Feb. 27 that she faced intense, inappropriate pressure and veiled threats for refusing to overturn a decision by the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to deny the Quebec-based construction and engineering company a DPA, and instead proceed with criminal charges.

SNC-Lavalin faces bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya, and could be barred from bidding on federal contracts for ten years if convicted.

Liberal MPs on the justice committee used their majority to close down the hearing without recalling Wilson-Raybould to testify a second time. That prompted the Conservatives to trigger a 31-hour voting marathon in the House of Commons last week in protest.

Liberals also used their majority on the Commons ethics committee to block an inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The NDP is pushing for an independent public inquiry, while the Conservatives have requested an RCMP investigation and Trudeau's resignation.

Mind you, the federal budget was a rather forgettable dud, all things considered. However, it’s hard to see what the Liberals could have jammed into the budget that would have prevented Friday from being the unmitigated disaster that it was for them. If we are indeed turning pages on the SNC-Lavalin affair, it’s because the story has become quite the page-turner.

For those who want “turn the page” to mean the end of the story, though, that was always wishful thinking. Friday put that notion to rest once and for all.

We knew that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould had submitted materials to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights after the Liberal majority on the committee had decided against calling her back as a witness. It was obvious from her initial testimony that she had ample notes on what had occurred on this file, but I’m not sure any of us were expecting to hear a phone conversation between Wilson-Raybould and clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick.

READ MORE: Trudeau now has a lower approval rating than Trump, with Tories way ahead, according to Ipsos poll

The phone conversation is devastating to the Liberal narrative around this scandal and vindicates virtually everything Wilson-Raybould laid out in her testimony.

It is immediately clear from the outset of the conversation that the prime minister had a preferred outcome on the matter — specifically, that the company be provided the option of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA); that the attorney general was being pressured to adopt that same view and intervene accordingly; that the attorney general had, in fact, made her decision; that the attorney general was very uncomfortable with and upset about the undue and inappropriate pressure she was under; and that her ability to continue as attorney general may be in jeopardy if she refused to alter her approach.

WATCH: Trudeau says Liberal caucus is ‘strong and united’

Of course, the Liberals have tried to suggest the exact opposite. We’ve been told that the prime minister did not expect a certain outcome, that Wilson-Raybould did not make it clear that she had reached a decision, that Wilson-Raybould had not voiced any concern about inappropriate pressure, and that Wilson-Raybould was not demoted over this issue. Those denials fly in the face of everything we heard on that recording.

The clerk, who’ll be stepping down as of April 19, makes it very clear very early on that the prime minister is “very firm” and in a “pretty firm frame of mind” on this matter and wants to know why a DPA isn’t being used. Wernick states that he is “worried” about the prime minister and attorney general being at “loggerheads.”

For her part, Wilson-Raybould makes it clear that she views those “worries” as a sign that she could be removed as attorney general (fears that would be confirmed just a few weeks later), a view that Wernick does nothing to dissuade her from. These certainly come across as very thinly-veiled threats, contradicting Wernick’s own testimony in which he flatly denied there were any threats, implied or otherwise.

The lies and the coverup may prove to be more damaging than the central allegation at the heart of this story. But taken together, it’s most troublesome.

Perhaps the Liberals could have opted for the “of course we pressured her and ultimately demoted her because we wanted to save 9,000 jobs at SNC-Lavalin” defence right from the outset, but that would have essentially confirmed the entire story. Let’s not forget, the prime minister initially insisted that the entire story was false. As it turns out, insisting the story was false was, in fact, false.

Of course, all of the spin about jobs ignores the very serious nature of the charges the company is facing and the fact that economic considerations — for example, job losses — are not to be a consideration in assessing the very legal question of how to proceed.

The OECD recently took the extraordinary step of warning the government of Canada of its international commitments under the Anti-Bribery Convention and the importance of political and economic issues not coming to bear in foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions. The director of the public prosecution service understood that. The former attorney general understood that. It is most unfortunate that so many others in government did not.

I don’t know how the Liberals plan on spinning all of this, but it’s now abundantly clear that there is “much more to this story,” as former cabinet minister Jane Philpott recently suggested. It’s also abundantly clear that any call to “turn the page” on this matter is self-serving partisan nonsense.

A meaningful investigation into this matter is urgently needed.

This ...","OTTAWA – Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was cautioned about a potential “collision” with the prime minister over the SNC-Lavalin file by outgoing Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, a newly-released audio recording reveals. This caution came a month before she was shuffled out of her role, and nearly two months before the scandal began unfolding publicly.

According to an audio recording of a conversation that the pair had, submitted to the House Justice Committee by Wilson-Raybould, Wernick said he was worried what might happen if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould remained at “loggerheads” about whether or not to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to the Quebec engineering firm.

In the audio, Wilson-Raybould can be heard issuing repeated and stern warnings that senior officials pressuring her over the SNC-Lavalin case would “look like nothing but political interference” if the Quebec construction and engineering company were granted deferred prosecution. By the time of her recorded conversation with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould says she had already endured months of intense lobbying from such officials.

She said in the audio that she was absolutely confident in her decision -- to back the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision not to grant the agreement and to continue pursuing the criminal charges -- and in response, Wernick said he was “worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

In a statement late Friday, Trudeau’s office said that he was “not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” and that the PMO was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

The PMO statement reiterates that Trudeau wishes she would have gone to him directly about the matter, reinforcing his message that there “was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months” between all key actors in this affair.

“I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,” Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario said in a statement, according to The Canadian Press. According to his lawyer, Wernick was not aware the call had been recorded until it was released on Friday.

“She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar,” CP quotes him as saying.

The 17-minute audio file was provided to all members of the House Justice Committee on Friday, as part of the new and supplementary evidence related to the SNC-Lavalin scandal that she handed over days ago.

The 43-pages of additional material also includes a 21-page written statement, as well as screen shots of text messages and copies of emails that she referenced during her initial testimony, adding more fodder to the continuously developing controversy that’s dominated political headlines for the last two months.

The secret recording is of a Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick that both parties have previously testified to. In the recording Wilson-Raybould can be heard saying that she was trying to protect Trudeau by issuing these cautions about prosecutorial independence.

She said the way the case was being handled “screams of” political interference and that while she agrees jobs are important, the issue is how it would look if federal prosecutors dropped the criminal charges of fraud and corruption, in exchange for a remediation agreement.

Throughout the scandal -- which touched off on Feb. 7 when The Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to interfere in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin -- the federal Liberals have cited the 9,000 jobs at stake as their main motivator for any actions in this case.

Should SNC-Lavalin be found guilty, they could face a 10-year ban on applying for federal contracts, leading to the company having to move out of Canada.

“I feel that I am giving him my best advice. And if he doesn’t accept that advice then it’s his prerogative to do what he wants. But I’m trying to protect the prime minister from political interference, perceived or otherwise,” she said.

Wernick -- who was not made aware during the recording that he was being taped -- can also be heard saying that he “respects” where Wilson-Raybould was coming from, but that Trudeau’s view was that “he’s not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He’s asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal, Wernick said.

“You’re not just being attorney general, you’re the minister of justice and a cabinet [minister] – and, you have context within which you exercise your roles and your responsibilities. Like, I’m not seeing anything inappropriate here,” Wernick can be heard saying.

Chair of the committee, Anthony Housefather, has said that ""no redactions have been made"" to Wilson-Raybould’s submission by the committee, though there are portions of the submission that appear to have been redacted by Wilson-Raybould before it was submitted.

Wilson-Raybould, who is still a member of the Liberal caucus, provided this evidence to further bolster the testimony she gave to the committee on Feb. 27, and to respond to contradicting stories that others have offered since her appearance.

RECORDING OF CALL WITH WERNICK

During her initial testimony on this phone call, Wilson-Raybould said she was alone and took the call from home. She said that Wernick wanted to communicate where Trudeau was at regarding the file, and spoke about the company potentially moving its headquarters.

She quoted him saying “I think he is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another....So he is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.”

When asked about this call during his follow up testimony, Wernick said that it was not his recollection of that call. “I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” Wernick said.

“I never raised partisan considerations at any time. I reminded her repeatedly that she was the final decision-maker. I did not attempt to influence her decision. I was giving her relevant context about public interest considerations for a decision that was hers to take. I never suggested consequences for her,” Wernick testified.

The audio call largely confirmed Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, but also backed up Wernick’s assertion that he did not make any direct partisan considerations, like Quebec votes, which Wilson-Raybould has alleged she was consistently reminded of while the file was on her desk. Though he did cite a “rising anxiety” following job losses in Oshawa and tough times in Calgary.

In the recording you can hear her taking a deep breath before the conversation begins.

“I actually feel really uncomfortable having this conversation because it’s wrong,” Wilson-Raybould says on the tape.

“Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? This is not just about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like, breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence,” Wilson-Raybould asks Wernick about Trudeau.

“Well I don’t think he sees it as that,” Wernick said, offering that it was a case of people talking past eachother.

“Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael,” she replied.

The conversation ended with Wilson-Raybould saying that she was “waiting for the other shoe to drop,” and that ""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just stuck doing the best job that I can.""

After she got off the call, the new evidence shows that she texted her then-chief of staff Jessica Prince that “the s**** is going to hit the fan.”

In her written submission Wilson-Raybould said she recorded the conversation because she “I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She said she had never done this before, and has not done so since, recognizing that her recording of this conversation would otherwise be inappropriate

Law societies in Canada prohibit lawyers from knowingly recording conversations with clients without their knowledge, including the Law Society of Ontario, which Wilson-Raybould belongs to. In a statement the Society told CTV News that it “does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

“I did this simply to ensure that my notes were accurate and given the ongoing pressure and attempts to interfere in this case, the nature of conversations that had occurred… and my strong suspicion that this matter would continue to escalate in even more inappropriate ways,” she wrote.

Her unprecedented decision to then make the recording public as part of her submission was done, she says, to allow Canadians to decide for themselves whether Wernick’s comments amount to the “veiled threats” that she alleges, and which he denies.

Wernick will soon be retiring from his job as Canada’s top public servant, a decision he says is because there ""is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties,"" after both the Conservatives and New Democrats have called for his resignation given his role in the still unfolding controversy.

COPIES OF TEXTS, EMAILS

In her initial hours-long committee appearance she offered an in-depth account of approximately 20 exchanges --10 phone calls and 10 meetings -- specifically on the SNC-Lavalin case. She also worked through a chronology of communications, ranging from in-person meetings and phone calls, to text messages and emails, from 11 senior staffers from the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and the finance minister's office.

Throughout her testimony, she cautioned there were limitations in her ability to speak broadly about the case because of the specifics of the waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had issued.

What she has handed over to the committee stays within the lines of what is permitted in the waiver, which includes any relevant information related to the case against SNC-Lavalin over her years-long tenure as attorney general.

Contained within the new documents are transcripts as well as screen shots of conversations she or Prince had. These include email exchanges with members of Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office who the documents describe as being involved in the “mucking around” on the case.

In one it details a phone call Prince had with Morneau’s deputy chief of staff Justin To, in which he allegedly said that Wilson-Raybould had “a philosophical problem” with the entire promise of a deferred prosecution agreement, which remains a yet-to-be-used tool that this government passed through an omnibus budget bill last year.

“She hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To is quoted as saying to Prince, who said that was incorrect.

It also includes the conversation between Wilson-Raybould and Prince about a meeting Prince was asked to have with Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford and then-principal adviser Gerald Butts.

In the instance of the meeting between Trudeau’s top two staffers and Prince, the text messages back up Wilson-Raybould’s telling of the interactions, and contradicts Butts saying during his March 6 committee appearance that “there was no urgency to attend that meeting.”

The meeting request was labeled “URGENT” the documents show.

Though the texts do not offer any evidence to dispute Butts’ saying that the recounting of the exchange with Prince was taken out of context and that he had a ""very different recollection of that meeting.""

MORE DETAILS ON RESIGNATION

Wilson-Raybould’s submission also shed new light on the series of events that led to her ultimately resigning from her role as veterans’ affairs minister, which she was shuffled into in January.

She had previously told the committee that she believed she was shuffled out of her job because of her refusal to change her mind about the case, but in the new statement Wilson-Raybould said she took Trudeau at his word when he insisted that wasn’t the case.

Though, at the time she says she made the decision to resign if her replacement decided to issue a directive to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin matter, “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular.”

A deferred prosecution agreement has not been pursued by current Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, though the government has made signals that they aren’t ruling it out.

She also confirmed that she was offered the Indigenous services job, as Butts had testified. She said she was shocked they’d offer it to her since she says she made it clear from the moment the Liberals started assembling a transition team, that she’d never be able to fill that role.

Wilson-Raybould also said that she had a series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver after the initial story broke, and in the days before she ended up resigning from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“The prime minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in Cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” Wilson-Raybould says in her statement.

OPPOSITION RESPONSE

In the opening remarks of the new documents, Wilson-Raybould says her view is that the real issues at the heart of the SNC-Lavalin scandal are not about “how things are ‘experienced’” or considerations like caucus dynamics, political ambitions, or poll numbers. Rather she says it is about prosecutorial independence, the rule of law, and Canada’s democratic institutions.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses” in Canadian institutions, and that she looks forward to a future where “we truly do politics differently,” seeming to lean on a phrase Trudeau regularly touted during the 2015 campaign.

The opposition wanted to invite Wilson-Raybould back to testify again -- something she was open to -- but Liberal MPs on the House Justice Committee shut down the study, saying that they’d heard all they needed to.

Wilson-Raybould also offered that while she has nothing further to add to the formal process, if she was asked or compelled to participate in a future investigation or parliamentary process, she would.

In a statement reacting to the new information, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called it “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.” He called the entire affair “corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the evidence was “so compelling and well-documented” that an independent public inquiry is needed.

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement… The former Attorney General repeatedly made clear to the Prime Minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference – and they ignored her,” Singh said in a statement.

Since her testimony, Trudeau has faced calls to resign, the House of Commons agenda has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, and several other high-profile officials have resigned amid insistence that nothing improper occurred.

The PMO’s statement claims that “all facts are on the table now,” and that the Liberal government is focused on “moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

All eyes are set to be on Parliament Hill when MPs return on Monday, particularly when Liberal MPs convene for their weekly caucus meeting on Wednesday. There, it is likely that the developments that have occurred on this file over the last few days will come up, as some of her colleagues are expected to get up and call for her removal.

SNC-Lavalin lead estimator Paul Lemay says Nalcor Energy project team members were always around him at the project office on Torbay Road in St. John’s.

He said they approved the appointment of every member of his team. They checked in every morning to ask what he would be working on. They hovered, he says.

“We had Nalcor on our back almost every day,” he said, while on the stand at the Muskrat Falls Inquiry on Friday. “I think it was overdoing it a little bit.”

But while he wasn’t a fan of the management approach, Lemay spent much of Friday also testifying about how his 11-person team’s estimate was not interfered with by the project owner.

There was some dancing around it, but he was finally asked point blank if Nalcor Energy ever attempted to change or influence his numbers, before they were formally documented and filed in 2011.

“Never,” he said. He later reiterated: “They never did that.”

The relationship between SNC-Lavalin and Nalcor Energy changed in 2012. SNC-Lavalin had been contracted for engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) on the project but, as the inquiry has heard from other witnesses, clashes between SNC and Nalcor personnel and disappointment over parts of the early estimate were part of a decision to change to an “integrated management” team.

Lemay supported previous testimony that SNC personnel were moved from more private offices out into the “bull pen” of cubicles at Torbay Road. He reported to Nalcor’s Jason Kean and Mark Turpin as of early 2012, and says they were all talking more at that point about the estimate numbers and overall costs.

There were puts and takes to what SNC-Lavalin filed in 2011.

“I was not responsible anymore,” Lemay said.

SNC-Lavalin was not tasked with estimating costs for the Strait of Belle Isle subsea cable crossing, or risk and contingencies. That was always Nalcor Energy’s responsibility in developing a total project cost estimate.

The $6.2-billion capital cost announced to the public at the end of 2012 was a combination of SNC-Lavalin’s submission at the end of 2011 for the bulk of the project’s capital budget, plus edits in 2012 and the other estimating work Nalcor was responsible for.

Lemay testified there was no SNC-Lavalin “basis of estimate” finalized after the mid-December 2011 submission. The $6.2 billion trumpeted at sanctioning was a Nalcor estimate.

While on the stand, Lemay did say the SNC-Lavalin estimate in 2011 used labour rates that were provided by Nalcor Energy, which were arrived at before project trades agreements were settled.

“If the final union agreement matched that number, I don’t know sir,” he said, again referring to his change in status in 2012 and the difference he saw between what SNC-Lavalin contributed in 2011 to what came thereafter.

On labour, he said the estimate he signed off on did factor in the fact the Hebron offshore oil platform construction was ongoing in Newfoundland and that could affect the availability of top people for Muskrat Falls work, particularly early on.

Commission associate counsel Michael Collins asked many questions about benchmarking for the figures Lemay used in the 2011 filing, diving deep in the example of concrete work, challenging reasonableness of the benchmarking there, productivity concerns and Lemay’s understanding of the project he was costing.

Lemay’s lawyer, Sheilagh Murphy, noted the back and forth was all based on a very small sampling of a few pages, from a basis of estimate covering roughly 54 binders-worth of documents.

Lemay transferred back to Montreal from St. John’s in January 2014 and continued work on the Muskrat Falls project until December 2018. He continues to attribute the end of his work on the project at least in part to his participation in the inquiry, although he acknowledged he has no evidence to that effect.

MONTREAL — Quebec's pension fund manager could play an outsize role in whether SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. eventually pulls up stakes for the United States.

The engineering and construction giant told federal prosecutors that its ""Plan B"" in the event of criminal prosecution on corruption charges is to move its headquarters south of the border and shed more than 60 per cent of its 8,700 Canadian jobs, internal documents reveal.

Quebec's Caisse de depot et placement holds a roughly 20 per cent stake in SNC-Lavalin, making it far and away the biggest shareholder. The pension fund also has a $1.5-billion loan agreement with SNC-Lavalin stipulating that the firm must remain rooted in Montreal until at least 2024, though refinancing may be an option.

The roughly $1.18 billion in company shares held by the Caisse — which has a mandate to grow Quebec business — gives the pension fund extra clout at the boardroom table, said Altacorp Capital analyst Chris Murray said. The loan, while partially paid off, adds leverage to a pension fund whose investing pedigree carries respect.

""A 20 per cent shareholder has some pretty significant influence,"" Murray said.

The Caisse also aims to grow its investments, making a move to the U.S. potentially more attractive as conflicting mandates collide, said Karl Moore, an associate professor at McGill University's business school.

""SNC being one of our larger firms, it would absolutely fall within [its] mandate and the Caisse would not want them to move. On the other hand, as good business people, they might see that as the best course.

""They absolutely would have a pipeline to [CEO] Neil Bruce,"" Moore added.

Last month Caisse chief executive Michael Sabia said the pension fund would ""be a rock'"" for SNC-Lavalin and ready to boost its stake in the company, barring any technical barriers.

The Caisse declined to comment for this story.

Internal SNC-Lavalin documents — part of a PowerPoint presentation for prosecutors last September and obtained by The Canadian Press — state that criminal prosecution ""will likely have very negative consequences for Canadian employees, shareholders, pensioners, customers"" and other groups.

Earlier in the week, the firm walked back a statement by its chief executive, who said he never cited the protection of 9,000 Canadian jobs as a reason the construction giant should be granted a remediation agreement.

Opinions vary on the impact of an exit by the 108-year-old company.

SNC-Lavalin is working on the five biggest infrastructure projects in the country, according to trade magazine ReNew Canada. Those contracts alone amount to $52.8 billion, and include projects for Bruce Power and the Darlington nuclear plant in Ontario as well as the Site C dam in B.C.

""It will be sad, very sad, because we will lose decision centres, we will lose key jobs and all of the impacts on the accounting firms and law firms,"" said Michel Nadeau, a former Caisse executive.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould recorded a Dec. 19, 2018, conversation with Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, in which he told her Mr. Trudeau was in “that kind of mood” and wanted her to shelve the prosecution of the Montreal-based engineering and construction giant.

“He is in a pretty firm frame of mind about this, so I am a bit worried,” Mr. Wernick said. “I am worried about a collision then, because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago, and this is really important to him.""

Ms. Wilson-Raybould replied that she was trying to protect Mr. Trudeau from charges of political interference, especially after the independent director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, had decided to go ahead with the fraud and bribery prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

“We are treading on dangerous ground here – and I am going to issue my stern warning – because I cannot act in a manner and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent,” she says. “This is the about the integrity of the government. … This is going to look like political interference by the Prime Minister.”

Jody Wilson-Raybould’s decision to record phone call with Michael Wernick raises ethical questions

In a statement late on Friday, the Prime Minister’s Office said Mr. Trudeau was not briefed on the Dec. 19 conversation.

However, it said, Mr. Trudeau takes responsibility for the “erosion of trust” with his former minister and now is the time the turn the page on the political controversy.

“All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the Prime Minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country,” the statement said.

“The Prime Minister took responsibility for the situation and announced several next steps, including external expert opinions on a number of things as they relate to the set of issues raised over the past few weeks.""

Ms. Wilson-Raybould acknowledged in the recorded conversation with the top bureaucrat that her tenure as justice minister and attorney-general was jeopardized by standing up to the Prime Minister and refusing to help SNC-Lavalin.

“I am waiting for the … other shoe to drop, so I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister … gets things that he wants. I am just stuck doing the best job that I can,” she told the clerk as the conversation wrapped up. In January – only weeks after this phone call – she was demoted to Veterans Affairs in a move that she has said she believed stemmed from her decision to reject Mr. Trudeau’s demands to order a negotiated settlement for SNC-Lavalin.

During the 17½ minute telephone conversation, Ms. Wilson-Raybould reminded Mr. Wernick that interfering in the SNC-Lavalin case would send the wrong message in the separate breach-of-trust prosecution of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman and the extradition case of Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. executive Meng Wanzhou. In both cases, the Liberals have denied any political interference was involved.

“We can stand up in the House of Commons on Norman … [or] on extradition and we can talk about the rule of law,” she said. “The cases are not dissimilar – the principle or the integrity of how we act.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she recorded the conversation because she was at home in Vancouver and did not have a staff member on hand to take notes. Transcripts of the audio recording were among 44 pages, including e-mails and text messages, she submitted to the House of Commons justice committee on Friday.

The Liberal-dominated justice committee shut down further hearings in the SNC-Lavalin affair last week. On Tuesday, Liberal MPs on the ethics committee used their majority to defeat an opposition bid to hear testimony from Ms. Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, who resigned over how the Prime Minister has handled the controversy.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said in a letter to the committee with her submission that she believes she is still prevented from speaking about the time period after her demotion in early January and subsequent resignation from cabinet, and would require the Prime Minister to waive cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege – which he has refused to do.

“If compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process, I would do so,” she said.

In the recorded conversation, Ms. Wilson-Raybould revealed the Prime Minister’s Office had months earlier been given a copy of Ms. Roussel’s detailed legal reasons for rejecting the idea of a negotiating a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The reasons have never been released publicly and the PMO had never acknowledged it knew why Ms. Roussel pressed ahead with the prosecution in early September.

During the December, 2018, phone call, when Mr. Wernick said he was unaware the PMO had that confidential information, Ms. Wilson-Raybould was adamant it had been sent, saying “we have documented evidence in terms of e-mails, et cetera, where that has been provided, so they do have it.”

SNC-Lavalin is facing charges of bribery and fraud connected to construction contracts in Libya. If convicted, it could be barred from receiving Canadian government contracts for up to 10 years.

Mr. Trudeau and top advisers, including Mr. Wernick, pushed Ms. Wilson-Raybould to override federal prosecutors, saying a conviction for SNC-Lavalin could result in the loss of 9,000 jobs and the relocation of the company’s Montreal headquarters outside of Canada.

“This goes far beyond saving jobs – this is about integrity of the Prime Minister and interference,” Ms. Wilson-Raybould told the Privy Council Clerk.

In Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s submission, she also said Mr. Trudeau’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, tried to use an erroneous story from the Mulroney era to persuade her office to accept direction from the PMO on SNC-Lavalin.

Copies of text messages between the former minister and her then-chief of staff, Jessica Prince, recount how Mr. Butts, who was one of the most senior officials in the PMO, offered what he represented as historical precedent for a prime minister to direct an attorney-general on a legal matter.

Mr. Butts was talking about the wrongful murder conviction of David Milgaard, which was overturned after Kim Campbell, who was justice minister and attorney-general, decided to review it.

“Gerry told some story about how Mulroney met with David Milgaard’s mom, walked into the cab[inet] room and told Kim Campbell she had to fix it. She gave him all these [attorney-general] reasons why she couldn’t interfere but then she ultimately did what Mulroney wanted,” Ms. Prince recounted to Ms. Wilson-Raybould in text messages. “By Gerry’s telling, it was because Mulroney told her that she had to find a solution.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said in her submission she later met with Ms. Campbell, who rejected Mr. Butts’s version.

“She categorically denied what Mr. Butts had said and was quite offended and outraged by the comments. She adamantly denied the characterization not only of her as the attorney-general, but of her former boss, prime minister Mulroney,” Ms. Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee in her submission on Friday.

Story continues below advertisement

Ms. Campbell told Ms. Wilson-Raybould that Mr. Mulroney “was much too good a lawyer to intervene improperly in the matter” and “he never breathed a word about the Milgaard case to his attorney-general, nor did anyone in his office ever attempt to influence her handling of the case.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould also said more in her submission about the pressure she has said her office faced from Ben Chin, chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

She recounted that Mr. Chin warned Ms. Prince about raising complaints with ministers regarding him. This came after Ms. Wilson-Raybould had expressed concern to Mr. Morneau about how Mr. Chin and Elder Marques, one of the Prime Minister’s senior advisers, repeatedly pressed her office to shelve the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

Mr. Chin did not like this, she recalled.

“Your boss spoke to Bill [Morneau] yesterday and said that me and Elder were mucking around on this file,” Mr. Chin told Ms. Prince. “Be careful when using my name, Jess,” he said, according to Ms. Wilson-Raybould.

The B.C. MP testified before the justice committee on Feb. 27 that when she was attorney-general, she had faced “constant and sustained” pressure from the Prime Minister and other top aides to override the prosecutor’s decision.

Story continues below advertisement

The issue has dominated Parliament since The Globe and Mail reported on Feb. 7 that the Prime Minister’s Office pressed the then-attorney-general to negotiate a settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

In the fallout, Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott resigned from cabinet, and Mr. Butts stepped down. On March 18, Mr. Wernick announced he was retiring as Clerk of the Privy Council, saying he had lost the “trust and respect” of the opposition parties over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the new material from Ms. Wilson-Raybould offers “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.”

He said the new material demonstrates how loudly Ms. Wilson-Raybould expressed her concern about political interference to senior levels of government.

Mr. Trudeau has repeatedly said if Ms. Wilson-Raybould was worried about political interference, she should have raised it with him. The audio tape shows that she raised it with his top officials, who would have reported it to him, Mr. Scheer said.

“Ms. Wilson-Raybould repeatedly told the Prime Minister and his top officials that their actions were ‘entirely inappropriate’ and amounted to ‘political interference.’ Despite her objections, the Clerk of the Privy Council pressured her and made it clear that her job was on the line,” Mr. Scheer said.

“Justin Trudeau also told Canadians what he knew to be false. He knew that his attorney-general had serious concerns about his plan to get SNC-Lavalin off of serious criminal charges. But he looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him. “

NDP justice critic Tracey Ramsey said the recorded conversation demonstrates “the campaign of political interference” by the Prime Minister and those working for him.

“In 17 minutes, 17 times Mr. Wernick attempts to change her mind. And she could not have been clearer in rebutting him; she could not have been clearer in telling him she felt this was wrong and she identifies it as pressure,” she said.

The NDP has called for a public inquiry and the Conservatives have asked the RCMP to investigate for possible obstruction of justice.

Liberal MP John McKay said he did not believe Ms. Wilson-Raybould made the case for political interference and called for her removal from the Liberal caucus.

“The honourable thing would have been to resign. I don’t think it’s a terribly honourable thing to record a conversation when the other person doesn’t know the conversations being recorded,"" he said. He also said he can’t see how Ms. Philpott can remain in caucus.

A recording made by Wilson-Raybould of a 17-minute Dec. 19 call between herself and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick was released today, along with 43 pages of emails, texts and a written statement from Wilson-Raybould herself which were tabled to the Commons justice committee.

Wernick — who was not aware he was being recorded — told the minister there was ""rising anxiety"" over the fate of a major employer.

""He's quite determined, quite firm,"" Wernick said of the prime minister's position on getting a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for the Quebec-based engineering company. ""But he wants to know why the DPA route, which Parliament provided for, isn't being used. And I think he's going to find a way to get it done, one way or another.""

Listen to the call:

In her written statement, Wilson-Raybould explains why she recorded the call.

She said she normally has a staff member present to take careful notes, but on this occasion she was alone in her Vancouver condo.

""I was anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an an inappropriate conversation,"" she wrote.

""So while I typed out notes during the phone call, I took the extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step of making an audio recording of the conversation without so advising the Clerk. This is something that I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.""

Why she resigned

In her statement, Wilson-Raybould also sheds new light on why she resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

Conservatives have suggested she was fired from the justice portfolio and moved to Veterans Affairs for refusing to budge on the SNC-Lavalin matter.

But Wilson-Raybould said that while she initially thought she'd been shunted to Veterans over the SNC-Lavalin affair, she ultimately decided that was not the reason.

""After much reflection, I decided to take the prime minister at his word, that this was not the case, and accepted a post I was honoured to have as the Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence,"" she wrote.

Wilson-Raybould went on to say that a subsequent series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver, and a Feb. 11 news conference, led to her resignation:

""The prime minister stated publicly, when issues about the propriety of the government's conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose, that my ongoing presence in cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day, and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.""

That news conference came just days after the explosive Feb. 7 Globe and Mail story which first reported the allegations of inappropriate political pressure on Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

When Trudeau was asked at that press conference about inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould, he said she ""confirmed"" a conversation she had with him in the fall where he said any decision on the matter was hers alone. He said he was limited in terms of what more he could say because of cabinet confidentiality.

""In our system of government, of course, her presence in cabinet should actually speak for itself,"" he said at the time.

While Wilson-Raybould and former cabinet minister Jane Philpott have suggested there is much more to tell in the story, today Wilson-Raybould said she has now divulged all her relevant information.

""I do not believe I have anything further to offer a formal process regarding this specific matter, though of course if compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process I would do so,"" she said.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said this is more evidence the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign.

""Justin Trudeau also told Canadians what he knew to be false,"" he said. ""He knew that his attorney general had serious concerns about his plan to get SNC-Lavalin off of serious criminal charges. But he looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him. This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation.""

OTTAWA – Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s new and supplementary evidence, including a written statement and an audio recording, have been made public.

The documents were provided to the House Justice Committee that had been studying the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal, before Liberal MPs shut it down.

This additional material is meant to elaborate on Wilson-Raybould’s Feb. 27 testimony. It was during this hours-long appearance that she detailed what she considered to be months of high-level political interference in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to have her instruct federal prosecutors to drop the criminal prosecution of the Quebec construction giant.

Here are some highlights from the conversation.

‘I FEEL REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE’

Jody Wilson-Raybould: “I am surprised that you and I are having this conversation, but I’m just saying I feel really uncomfortable about the appropriateness of this conversation.”

Wernick: “OK, I understand that but I mean, I think [Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s] view is that he’s not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He’s asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal.”

‘HE’S IN A VERY FIRM MOOD’

Jody Wilson-Raybould: “I know I have a tool under the prosecution act that I can use. I do not believe it is appropriate to use it in this case.”

Michael Wernick: “OK. Alright. That’s clear. Well, he’s in a very firm mood about this, so, um—“

JWR: “Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? This is not just about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like, breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

Wernick: “Well I don’t think he sees it as that—“

JWR: “Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael.”

‘YOU’RE NOT JUST BEING ATTORNEY GENERAL’

Wernick: “OK, I respect where you’re coming from—“

JWR: “You know what, I hope that you do, because I don’t think anybody respects this. The conversation that Gerry and Katie had with my chief of staff, and like, she wrote down what they said, like, saying that they don’t want to have anything, or hear any more about the legalities but want to talk about jobs. Entirely inappropriate.”

Wernick: “OK, well I mean, I wasn’t—“

JWR: “Well I have it. I have it all. It’s just—“

Wernick: “OK, but I mean you’re not just being attorney general, you’re the minister of justice and a cabinet [minister] – and, you have context within which you exercise your roles and your responsibilities. Like, I’m not seeing anything inappropriate here. But, um, I mean, you’re right. And the PM—I mean – people are talking past each other. I think the way he sees it and the advice he’s getting is that you still have things that you could do that are not interference and they’re still very much lawful. So--”

JWR: “And it’s not that they’re not lawful. The perception, and what will happen, is it will be deemed political interference from day one when people were talking about why are we entering into or putting a DPA regime in place. Everybody knows it was because of SNC, whether that’s true or not, that’s what people think—“

Wernick: “It’s a tool that’s used in lots of other countries, though.”

JWR: “Fair.”

Wernick: “—for these kinds of purposes. And especially if there’s been a change of ownership or management in the company that’s being prosecuted. It is a public policy tool.”

‘I’M WORRIED ABOUT A COLLISION’

Wernick: “Alright. Um, well, I don’t – I’m going to have to report back before he leaves. He’s in a pretty firm frame of mind on this though, so I’m a bit worried.”

JWR: “A bit worried about what?”

Wernick: “Well, (incompresensible) for the prime minister, for him and his attorney general to be at loggerheads. “

JWR: “I feel that I am giving him my best advice. And if he doesn’t accept that advice then it’s his prerogative to do what he wants. But I’m trying to protect the prime minister from political interference, perceived or otherwise.”

Wernick: “I understand that. But I mean he doesn’t have the power to do what he wants. All the tools are in your hands. So.”

(Long pause)

JWR: (Laughs) OK, so then, I mean, I’m having like, thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here, Michael. Like, to be honest with you. And this is not a great place for me to be in. I don’t relish being in this place. But I am confident of is that I have given the prime minister my advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

Wernick: “OK. Um, alright, but I mean (sighs) I’m worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.

The federal government announced Friday that Ian Shugart will take over as clerk of the Privy Council on April 19, which also marks the last day of Wernick’s nearly 38-year career in the public service.

Opposition parties called for Wernick’s resignation after he vehemently rejected allegations that he and other senior government officials improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Wernick’s combative testimony to the House of Commons justice committee was denounced as partisan and unbecoming of a senior bureaucrat who is supposed to be impartial.

In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on March 18, Wernick said he would retire before this fall’s federal election campaign kicks off, but didn’t provide a departure date.

He noted at the time that the clerk of the Privy Council is supposed to be “an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference” occurs during the campaign as part of a new federal watchdog panel.

The clerk is also supposed to be ready to help whichever party is elected to form government, he said, adding that he did not believe he could fulfill either role.

Shugart is a long-serving member of the federal public service. Over the last decade, he has been deputy minister at Environment Canada, Employment and Social Development Canada, and since 2016, Global Affairs Canada.

Wernick has been clerk of the Privy Council since 2016, shortly after the Trudeau Liberals assumed office. Government insiders have previously said he wanted to retire as clerk a year ago, but was persuaded to stay on.

Wilson-Raybould accused Wernick of making “veiled threats” that she’d lose her job as justice minister and attorney general if she didn’t halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya.

She said Trudeau and others inappropriately pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Montreal engineering giant, which would force the company to pay stiff penalties while avoiding the risk of criminal conviction that could threaten its financial viability.

Wernick has denied the accusation and maintained that all concerned acted with the highest standards of integrity.

He has also maintained everything he did was within the boundaries of acceptable behaviour for his job of aiding the prime minister and cabinet as a non-partisan public servant.

An audio recording and transcript of the Dec. 19 call with Michael Wernick, the country's top public servant, was released as part of additional written testimony Wilson-Raybould submitted to the House of Commons Justice committee, which last week shut down its examination of her allegation that she was relentlessly, improperly pressured to intervene in the case.

The 17-minute recording backs up Wilson-Raybould's version of the words spoken during the conversation, about which she told the committee on Feb. 26 during nearly four hours of oral testimony. But it doesn't resolve the question of whether the Privy Council clerk's words constituted ""veiled threats,"" as she has alleged.

Wernick's tone throughout is calm and respectful, while Wilson-Raybould becomes increasingly agitated as she tries to impress on him her belief that intervening in the case would be perceived as political interference in the justice system.

""I am 100 per cent confident I'm doing nothing inappropriate,"" Wilson-Raybould can be heard telling Wernick.

""This is gonna look like nothing but political interference by the prime minister, by you, by everyone that has been involved in this, politically pressuring me to do this.""

This is something I have never done before this phone call and have not done since. Jody Wilson-Raybould

In her written submission, the former minister acknowledges the ""extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step'' of recording the conversation. But she says she was at home alone in Vancouver at the time and was ""anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.''

""This is something I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.""

Wernick declined to comment directly but his lawyer, Frank Addario, said recording the call was ""inappropriate.""

""A lot of the tape is her making a speech for a different audience, since she could have just told him she did not want to discuss it further. I don't know any lawyer who records conversations with work colleagues or clients. I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,"" Addario said in an email.

""She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar.""

Watch: Jody Wilson-Raybould says she faced 'veiled threats'

The code of conduct for the Law Society of Ontario, of which Wilson-Raybould is an honorary member, prohibits a lawyer from recording a client without the client's permission. As justice minister and attorney general at the time, Wilson-Raybould was the government's chief lawyer. A spokesman for the law society said Friday that it ""does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

The Canadian Bar Association code of conduct prohibits a lawyer from recording anyone without permission.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January shuffle as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

In the recording, Wilson-Raybould repeatedly tells Wernick that the director of public prosecutions had decided to pursue a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its work in Libya and that she would not use her power to step in to override that decision and insist upon a remediation agreement. Essentially akin to a plea bargain, such an agreement would mean the company would have faced stiff financial penalties while averting a possible criminal conviction.

During the call, she acknowledges she has the legal right to intervene but argues it would be unprecedented and viewed as political interference.

""This goes far beyond saving jobs. This is about the integrity of the prime minister and interference. There is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference, if I was to step in,"" she says.

""I would be a mockery. And that is not the problem. The bigger problem is what it would look like down the road for the government.""

At another point, Wilson-Raybould says she's trying to ""protect the prime minister from political interference"" and if he doesn't accept her advice ""then it is his prerogative to do what he wants."" She tells Wernick several times she feels ""uncomfortable"" just having the conversation with him.

""I actually feel uncomfortable having this conversation. It's wrong.""

It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads. Michael Wernick

Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau ""wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate toolbox'' to head off the possibility of SNC-Lavalin leaving the country and putting thousands of Canadians out of work. He says Trudeau is ""quite determined, quite firm'' about this and adds: ""I think he's going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kind of mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.

""It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads,"" he says later. ""I am worried about a collision, then, because he is pretty firm about this.""

He tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau is ""not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He is asking you to use all the tools you lawfully have at your disposal.""

Towards the end of the call, Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick she's ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here"" — a reference to former U.S. President Richard Nixon's attorney general resigning rather than follow the president's order to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. She also says she's waiting for ""the other shoe to drop.""

""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants.""

Canadian Press Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick leaves after testifying before a justice committee on the SNC Lavalin affair on March 6, 2019.

Wernick's lawyer said nothing said by the clerk constitutes a veiled threat.

""He was asking for information that only she could give. The clerk said this (remediation agreement) is a legitimate tool and why are we not exploring it here and he asked repeatedly for an explanation to pass on to the prime minister and she refused to give it. She didn't shut the call down,"" said Addario.

Addario said Wernick did not know the call had been recorded until it was released Friday, although he appeared to anticipate it during his second appearance at the justice committee on March 6. In response to questions about his recollections about the conversation, Wernick snapped: ""I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes.""

In a statement late Friday, the Prime Minister's Office said Wernick did not brief Trudeau about his Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould and he was unaware of its full contents until the recording was released.

Addario said the day after the conversation, ""everyone went on holidays."" By the time they returned at beginning of January, ""the first burning issue"" was Scott Brison's retirement and the consequent cabinet shuffle.

""The SNC issue never made it back to the top of the discussion list. The clerk never discussed SNC again with the PM or PMO until someone leaked the story to The Globe and Mail in early February.""

The PMO statement reiterated Trudeau's previous admission that ""he should have spoken directly"" with Wilson-Raybould about the matter and that ""he wishes she had come to him"" with her concerns about improper pressure. He again attributed the controversy to an ""erosion of trust"" between her office and his, and tried to close the door on the fiasco, which has engulfed his government for two months, cost him two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and Wernick, who officially retires on April 19 after concluding he's lost the confidence of opposition parties following his combative testimony at committee.

""All the facts are on the table now and everyone involved has shared their perspective,"" the statement said, adding it's time to ""move forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians.""

If they had any sense of decency, they would resign before it would even get there. Alexandra Mendes, Liberal MP

However, Liberal backbenchers appear to be in a less forgiving mood.

Montreal MP Alexandra Mendes called Wilson-Raybould's secret recording ""horrendous"" and called for her and Jane Philpott — who resigned from cabinet earlier this month saying she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC affair — to be booted out of caucus.

""If they had any sense of decency, they would resign before it would even get there,"" Mendes said in an interview, questioning why anyone would want to stay ""where they're clearly not wanted.""

Liberal MPs have been growing increasingly upset with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott's seeming desire to keep fanning the flames of the controversy and have been quietly discussing among themselves this week — a break week for Parliament — how to deal with the pair. The expectation now is that caucus members will insist on expelling them at their next meeting on Wednesday, or earlier if an emergency meeting is called. Precisely how to go about that is being debated since votes are not normally taken in caucus.

The documents released Friday also include transcripts of text messages and notes on phone calls Wilson-Raybould or her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, had with various senior government staffers.

One of them is a phone call between Prince and Justin To, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's deputy chief of staff, in which he says that there is a sense that Wilson-Raybould ""has a philosophical problem"" with the concept of remediation agreements, a new tool for dealing with cases of corporate corruption that went into effect last September.

""That she hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To allegedly told Prince, who told him that wasn't true.

'... undeniable elements of misogyny'

In her submission, Wilson-Raybould also complains that the controversy over her allegations has included ""undeniable elements of misogyny, much of it aimed at myself.""

And while she says, ""I do not believe I have anything further to offer a formal process regarding this specific matter,"" she say she would comply ""if compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's latest revelations are ""so compelling and well documented"" that they prove the need for an independent public inquiry into the whole affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said they represent ""concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution.''

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Five things we learned from a written and audio submission made by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to the House of Commons justice committee Friday.

On the cabinet shuffle

Trudeau's former principal secretary Gerald Butts told the justice committee Wilson-Raybould was shuffled because they needed someone to fill in Indigenous Affairs and she refused. He said a minister has to serve at the pleasure of the prime minister and a refusal to be moved couldn't stand.

Wilson-Raybould says she told Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, she couldn't understand the rationale for being part of the January cabinet shuffle, and that she had told them many times in the past that she would never take on a job of ""delivering services to Indians"" under the Indian Act and was shocked that she was then offered the Indigenous Services ministry.

Butts told the justice committee in March he didn't know her position on that when the offer was made but acknowledged he should have known.

Wilson-Raybould also denies she ever referred to being attorney general as her ""dream job"" and instead said she thinks it was Butts who said it. Butts told the committee she called it her dream job when she was told she was being shuffled.

She said she took Trudeau at his word that the shuffle was not related to the SNC-Lavalin matter and agreed to take the job of veterans affairs minister, but said she made a decision to ""immediately resign if the new Attorney General"" issued a directive about the SNC-Lavalin case because it would confirm her suspicions she was moved for not intervening.

On her resignation from cabinet

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12, but told the justice committee in her live testimony that she couldn't discuss the conversations she had with Trudeau on the reasons.

In her written submission, she is more clear about why she resigned, pointing to a comment Trudeau made to the media on Feb. 11.

""The Prime Minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government's conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in Cabinet spoke for itself,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

""I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.""

Some Liberals felt Wilson-Raybould didn't like remediation agreements in general

Finance Minister Bill Morneau's deputy chief of staff, Justin To, in a phone call with Wilson-Raybould's chief of staff, Jessica Prince complained that Wilson-Raybould was not intervening in the SNC-Lavalin case because she ""has a philosophical problem"" with remediation agreements and ""wouldn't even use it if we could."" He calls it ironic that Wilson-Raybould is in favour of restorative justice in some sense but not for SNC-Lavalin.

Prince tells him ""that is absolutely not true.""

To apologized in a follow-up email and then Prince laid out for him all the things Wilson-Raybould had done in favour of remediation agreements.

Disagreement with her deputy minister

Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of justice, told the justice committee that Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, had asked her office for a briefing on the consequences, including job losses, if SNC-Lavalin did not get a remediation agreement, but that once that document was prepared, Wilson-Raybould ordered her not to give it to Wernick or anyone else in the Privy Council Office.

Wilson-Raybould denies that she ever knew about the memo or that she ordered Drouin not to hand it over to Wernick. She also says given that she had told Wernick she had made her decision she was not sure why he would have asked for such an opinion anyway.

Former prime minister Kim Campbell

Prince alleges that in a conversation with Butts, he pointed to a case involving former prime minister Brian Mulroney and the case of David Milgaard, who was wrongfully convicted for murder in 1970, and exonerated more than two decades later. Butts allegedly told Prince that Kim Campbell, who was then the attorney general, was asked by Mulroney to review the case after Mulroney met with Milgaard's mother. Campbell, who would replace Mulroney as prime minister in 1993, is reported to have told Mulroney she couldn't because it would interfere in an independent process.

Wilson-Raybould says she fact-checked the story with Campbell in Vancouver the next day over coffee, adding the former Tory prime minister had a ""vivid memory of the case.""

""She categorically denied what Mr. Butts had said and was quite offended and outraged by the comments. She adamantly denied the characterization not only of her as the Attorney General, but also of her former boss, Prime Minister Mulroney,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

Mulroney was ""too good a lawyer to intervene improperly in the matter,"" Wilson-Raybould recounted Campbell telling her.",Five things in Wilson-Raybould's written evidence on the SNC-Lavalin affair,CTV Toronto News,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/five-things-in-wilson-raybould-s-written-evidence-on-the-snc-lavalin-affair-1.4358461
420,World,2019-03-30T00:50:00.0000000Z,"After all the distractions and red herrings, after all the character assassination and speculation about motives, after all the attempts to blur distinctions that are crystal clear or to twist words to mean their opposite, after all the desperate attempts ...","After all the distractions and red herrings, after all the character assassination and speculation about motives, after all the attempts to blur distinctions that are crystal clear or to twist words to mean their opposite, after all the desperate attempts to keep her from testifying, after all the lies, Jody Wilson-Raybould has brought things crashing back to reality.

Her brief to the Commons justice committee — the committee that had refused to allow her right of reply, after her earlier testimony had been challenged by government witnesses — is a stinging rebuke, not only to her critics within the government, but to the many partisans and media commentators who have allowed themselves to lose sight of the central issue in the SNC-Lavalin affair: the attempts, involving officials from the prime minister on down, to interfere in a criminal prosecution for political reasons, in violation of the independence of both the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions.

The headlines will be about the former attorney general’s recording of a telephone conversation last Dec. 19 between her and the then clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick. The tape backs up in minute detail her previous accusations that the clerk — like the prime minister, like his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, his chief of staff, Katie Telford, and a half a dozen other senior government officials — improperly pressured her to reverse her decision not to intervene with prosecutors in the case.

In particular, it makes hash of his denials that he made “veiled threats” that she would be removed from her job if she did not instruct the director of public prosecutions to drop charges of corruption and fraud against the company in favour of a so-called “remediation agreement.” The language is not even all that veiled:

“I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another … he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that… he is in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so… I am a bit worried… It is not a good idea for the Prime Minister and his Attorney General to be at loggerheads.”

Neither can he claim to have been unaware she felt pressured to decide things the prime minister’s way, and that this amounted to “political interference.” She makes clear at multiple points in the conversation: that it and previous conversations with the prime minister and “many other people” were “entirely inappropriate,” that she was “uncomfortable having this conversation,” that she was “issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue” against interfering with decisions by the DPP, that “we are treading on dangerous ground,” that “there is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference.”

Her brief also provides new details of a meeting the previous day between her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, and Butts and Telford, though alas without the benefit of tape recordings: just Prince’s contemporaneous account, relayed to her, first via text message, later by phone. Not only are there the lines quoted previously (Butts: “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference”; Telford: “We don’t want to debate legalities any more.”), but further evidence of Butts’s dismissive attitude towards the independence of the DPP. Prince reports:

“They clearly do not care about the (Public Prosecution Service of Canada.) Gerry kept talking about how it was created by Harper. I was like ‘sure but it is what we have and we have to respect the statute.’ No scruples”

And there are further troubling allegations about the proposed involvement of external counsel — the name of former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Beverley McLachlin, keeps coming up — to “advise” the former attorney general on her “options”. To hear Butts’s testimony, though officials kept pressing Wilson-Raybould to seek this “advice”, it had no predetermined agenda. Wilson-Raybould’s brief suggests otherwise:

“My COS asked what if the opinion comes saying, ‘She can review it, but she shouldn’t’ or simply, ‘She can’t review it’ end of story? Mr. Butts stated, ‘It wouldn’t say that.’”

But all of this is mere detail. What is at stake in this affair remains, as Wilson-Raybould reminds the committee, nothing less than “the core principle of prosecutorial independence — a principle that at times appears to have been obscured by layers of commentary, hyperbole, and spin.” It is not, she says, “about how things are ‘experienced’, caucus dynamics, political ambitions, poll numbers, ‘erosion of trust’ or the role of social media.”

Worse yet are the facile rationalizations for interfering the prime minister’s officials have offered — among them, that “prosecutorial decisions are never final” (that’s true, as a prerogative of prosecutors, not as a pretext for endless importuning of them by political staff) or that the attorney general is entitled to seek advice (to seek it, not to have it imposed upon her), or that there were “new facts or evidence” that somehow justified their actions (there was none, Wilson-Raybould says).

There is no “middle ground” on prosecutorial independence, no room for argument on the right of the attorney general to make decisions on criminal prosecutions, free of pressure from other government officials: it is settled constitutional law, absolute and inviolable. It doesn’t matter what good reasons the prime minister might think he has.

Nor is the AG obliged to keep him apprised of her decisions in such matters (though she did). It’s quite literally none of his business.",Andrew Coyne: Wilson-Raybould recording brings SNC-Lavalin affair crashing back to reality,O Canada,https://o.canada.com/opinion/andrew-coyne-wilson-raybould-recording-brings-snc-lavalin-affair-crashing-back-to-reality/wcm/27b9818b-98e9-4a18-a135-fe9c99bb51f9

On Thursday, the Montreal-based engineering company announced an official restructuring of its business, and made three leadership changes adding to earlier turnover in its ranks.

The company framed the changes as an attempt to “de-risk” its business by consolidating certain business segments. It follows several damaging mishaps, including the loss of a $350-million contract in Chile earlier this month, and a cloud that moved over its oil and gas business particularly in Saudi Arabia, both of which led to major writedowns and earnings revisions.

“This new organizational structure will position us for further improving project delivery, driving sustainable growth and more consistent cash flow generation,” Neil Bruce, chief executive of SNC, said in a press release.

The company has twice slashed its profit forecasts this year and last month it reported a $1.6-billion loss for the fourth quarter. That prompted Standard & Poor’s Ratings agency to downgrade its credit from BBB to BBB minus, the lowest investment grade rating for its bonds to still be eligible for bank investment.

Part of its losses flowed from a dispute with the Chilean-run copper producer Codelco.

In January, Bruce said he was “deeply disappointed” in his mining team for cost overruns on the project, and the company’s chief financial officer said it would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Earlier this week, SNC confimed it had been fired from a $350-million contract to build acid plants for Codelco, and walked back claims that it hoped to resolve that dispute on an accelerated time frame.

That project was an engineering, procurement and construction contract, in which SNC agreed to design and build the project at a set price. Such contracts are higher risk as the company is responsible for cost overruns.

As part of the restructuring, SNC announced a new “project oversight” position to “foresee and fix project-related issues in a timely fashion,” that will report directly to Bruce.

He has stressed to investors that there won’t be any future debacles similar to what happened with Codelco on its outstanding EPC contracts.

“We have gone through 20 of our top contracts,” Bruce said during the last earnings call in February. “In terms of the work we do in this arena … we’ve done all the checks again to make sure that what we approved is what we signed and that they are on track and we don’t have anything of any similar nature whatsoever.”

""This new organizational structure will position us for further improving project delivery, driving sustainable growth and more consistent cash flow generation."" - SNC CEO Neil Bruce

Per its restructuring on Thursday, the company is focusing on four core segments including nuclear, infrastructure, resources and lastly, engineering, design and project management, or EDPM.

It will also have a technology business, which includes clean power and cybersecurity, and its capital business, meaning six discrete units down from nine.

SNC also announced new people to lead its EDPM, capital and resources segments — the last of which combines the old mining with the oil and gas segment.

This follows the appointment of a new chief operating officer Ian Edwards in January, a replacement named to succeed him as head of infrastructure, and the planned exit of its former head of the oil and gas business unit this summer.

Meanwhile, in Ottawa, the company has faced heightened scrutiny after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould testified earlier this month that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration pressured her to reach a settlement with SNC on longstanding criminal charges that it bribed Libyan government officials.

The entire situation has lead to growing speculation about whether SNC may seek to break up some of its business, and sell certain units. Market reaction to the latest news was tepid, with the price barely moving from around $34.

The city said Friday afternoon it reached financial close with TransitNEXT, a wholly owned subsidiary of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin, to extend the north-south Trillium Line to Riverside South as part of the second stage of Ottawa’s LRT.

The fixed contract for the southern extension is priced at $663 million, though the city says that the full value of the deal, including maintenance and rehabilitation on the existing Trillium Line track, is $1.6 billion. SNC-Lavalin will pay $136 million in upfront capital contributions.

Before the city was able to sign on the dotted line, it had to finalize funding agreements from both the federal and provincial governments. While the federal commitments had long been public, it wasn’t until last Friday that Ontario Premier Doug Ford officially announced the province would contribute $1.2 billion towards the transit project. A memo from the city states both funding deals were signed earlier this week.

Though council approved the $4.7-billion worth of contracts for LRT’s second stage at a March 6 meeting, councillors have continued to petition for further transparency in the procurement process.

Capital Coun. Shawn Menard gave notice earlier this week that he’d like to have the auditor general investigate the decision-making process on stage two in light of allegations that SNC-Lavalin’s bid did not meet the minimum technical score for the project.

Phase two will see the Trillium Line extend 16 kilometres past its current terminus, Greenboro Station, to Limebank Road in Riverside South, with an additional eight stations and a link to the Ottawa International Airport.

Work on the southern extension is expected to begin in the coming weeks, with construction wrapping up by 2022. The city is expected to reach financial close by the end of April on an agreement with the consortium of Nebraska’s Kiewit and France’s Vinci to extend the LRT to Moodie Drive in the west and Orléans in the east.",City closes stage 2 LRT deal with SNC-Lavalin subsidiary amid ongoing scrutiny,Ottawa Business Journal,https://obj.ca/article/city-closes-stage-2-lrt-deal-snc-lavalin-subsidiary-amid-ongoing-scrutiny

There is a cover-up going on in Parliament and the Prime Minister is going to great lengths to stop the truth from coming out. On top of that, Liberal operatives have now leaked confidential information on the selection of a Supreme Court Justice to cast doubt on former Jody Wilson-Raybould’s judgment. This level of potential political interference from the Prime Minister’s Office damages our democratic institutions and their ludicrous behavior, as Paul Wells recently said in a Macleans article, “is the very stuff of a police state.”

article continues below

I am also extremely disappointed with the five Liberal MPs on the Justice Committee who shut down the investigation into the alleged political interference with the former Attorney General. Due to her extraordinary testimony, it is unfathomable why the Prime Minister won’t permit her to answer direct questions regarding meetings and interactions after he removed her as the Minister of Justice, which she herself acknowledged are relevant to the matter at hand.

It boggles the mind why the Prime Minister is refusing to waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence as it only drags this scandal on even longer. It has been going on for weeks, overshadowing his budget and ripping apart the Liberal caucus.

It begs the question, if he thinks it’s better to take the political heat for this, is he really worried what his two former Ministers want to say?

Every day we learn information about how the Liberals inappropriately pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould. Now Jane Philpott, who resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet, revealed there is still more evidence that must be released.

I firmly believe not getting to the truth would be a grave injustice to the rule of law and to the democratic principles that we were elected to uphold. In a recent speech to Parliament, I urged my colleagues to check their political allegiances at the door and vote in favor of our motion to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak. While almost every Liberal MP voted it down, there were a few who refused to be whipped against the motion.

Those in high office are not beyond reproach. Members of Parliament are not elected to protect the Prime Minister, nor should their political survival – or even our own political futures – trump the independence of an Attorney General.

It is time for Liberal MPs to rise to the occasion and put aside their political fidelities. I will continue to implore them to join us in calling for the Prime Minister to waive full solicitor-client privilege and all Cabinet confidences and let Jody Wilson-Raybould finish her testimony. Canadians deserve the truth.

“The PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can, within a legitimate toolbox, to try to head that off. He’s quite determined, quite firm, but he wants to know why the DPA [deferred prosecution agreement] route, which Parliament provided for, isn’t being used. And I think he’s going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that,” Mr. Wernick is heard telling Ms. Wilson-Raybould during the first few minutes of their phone call.

The purpose of the call, as Mr. Wernick characterized it, was “to pass on” information on the prime minister’s concerns that SNC-Lavalin could move its headquarters or be sold. “It seems to be real, and not a bluff. There’s another rising anxiety, as you can imagine, about a signature firm and job loss and all that coming after the Oshawa thing,” Mr. Wernick says, referring to recent layoffs at General Motors in Oshawa.

It was included along with a handful of documents the House Justice Committee released today, days ahead of the House’s return from its weeklong hiatus. The Prime Minister’s Office announced Friday that Mr. Wernick’s successor, Ian Shugart, will assume the post on April 19.

In the 17-minute phone call with Mr. Wernick, Ms. Wilson-Raybould is heard raising concerns about intervening in the SNC-Lavalin case, saying that their conversation is inappropriate and amounts to political interference, as well as other conversations she’s had calling on her to consider a DPA.

Mr. Wernick had raised the possibility of asking someone like former chief justice Beverley McLachlin to weigh in on the case, if she felt “uncomfortable” about intervening.

“What I am trying to do is to protect him [the prime minister],” she said in response. “I am just issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue that decisions that are made by the independent prosecutor are their decisions.”

Her 43-page submission to the committee includes text messages between her and her then-chief of staff, Jessica Prince. In one text exchange, on Dec. 18, Ms. Prince tells Ms. Wilson-Raybould that then-principal secretary Gerald Butts allegedly said, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” Mr. Butts, who resigned over the issue, claiming responsibility for a “breakdown in trust” between himself and the former AG, has repeatedly denied there was inappropriate interference.

During her four-hour testimony before the Justice Committee on Feb. 27, Ms. Wilson-Raybould (Vancouver Granville, B.C.) said she spoke with Mr. Wernick on Dec. 19, during which he allegedly said that the prime minister is “determined” to find a way to get a deferred prosecution agreement for the embattled company and that he and his AG can’t be at “loggerheads” over this issue. Ms. Wilson-Raybould has expressed concern that she was shuffled out of her role as AG and moved to Veterans Affairs for her refusal to grant the company a DPA.

In responding to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s account of that call, during his second appearance, Mr. Wernick said he had no “independent recollection” that there was inappropriate interference, saying he did not “wear a wire” during his conversations with the ex-minister.

The publication of the documents and recording will likely re-energize opposition parties’ push for the government to allow the ex-minister to fully air her side of the story and potentially add to calls from some Liberal MPs for her to be expelled from caucus.

The affair has roiled the Trudeau government for more than a month, and has overshadowed the release of its pre-election budget. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced a “consistent and sustained” effort involving political staffers and bureaucrats, including Mr. Butts, and Ben Chin, chief of staff to the finance minister, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec engineering giant facing fraud and corruption charges, to protect 9,000 jobs.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) has repeatedly denied there was ever any inappropriate pressure, saying that he takes responsibility for the erosion of trust between his Mr. Butts and his former AG.

The release of the former attorney general’s submission to the Justice Committee comes after days of leaks on the judicial appointment process for the Supreme Court, something that’s supposed to be confidential, which Ms. Wilson-Raybould has said need to be investigated and the PMO has denied came from it.

Mr. Trudeau and his ministers have been touring the country for the past few days to sell the budget to key voting blocs, including young Canadians and seniors. Throughout his engagements, Mr. Trudeau has faced questions over whether his office orchestrated the leaks that alleged he questioned Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s judgment over her recommendation for a Supreme Court chief justice. Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s political motivations have also been an object of speculation of late, with some pundits raising questions about her end-game and concerns about the ethics of releasing an audio recording.

Questions have also been mounting over whether Ms. Wilson-Raybould and ex-Treasury Board president Jane Philpott (Markham-Stouffville, Ont.), who resigned over the government’s handling of the affair, will remain in caucus.

Despite her resignation from cabinet, Ms. Wilson-Raybould has repeatedly indicated that she intends to run under the Liberal banner in October’s election. Ms. Philpott, for her part, has said she supports the party’s policies and intends to remain a Liberal. Speaking to reporters in Maple Ridge, B.C., on Monday, Mr. Trudeau appeared to signal that the two would remain in the party, saying, “I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward.”

Even before the release of the documents and audio recording, several MPs were clamouring for both ex-ministers to be booted from caucus, according to a CBC report. The publication of the documents and audio file could add to those calls.

Liberals on the Justice Committee twice blocked opposition parties’ push to recall Ms. Wilson-Raybould to respond to the testimonies given by Mr. Wernick and Mr. Butts, which conflicted with her own. In an interview with CBC, Liberal MP Francis Drouin (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Ont.), who was subbing in for his colleagues on the committee, said he had “heard enough,” noting that the option is open for Ms. Wilson-Raybould to submit more information, expanding on her testimony.

Opposition parties earlier this week attempted to use the Ethics Committee as a forum to continue the Justice Committee’s probe, but the motion was voted down. The Justice Committee, meanwhile, is meeting in private next week to discuss committee business and its new focus on a study on online hate.

Wilson-Raybould explained in her submission (on page 12) why she decided to record her call with Wernick:

“While this recording was made simply as a personal aide memoire because I had no staff present to make notes, I am releasing the recording now given the Clerk’s repeated assertions that he made no threats to me veiled or otherwise, or that he had no recollection of the specifics of the call, or otherwise called into my question my previous testimony. The recording allows the members of the Committee and the public to decide for themselves.”

Here is a transcript of the call, as it appears in Wilson-Raybould’s submission to the justice committee:

Clerk [Wernick]: Hello.

JWR: Hello Michael, it is Jody.

C: Hi, sorry about the phone tag.

JWR: That’s ok.

C: Um…l am not calling you about litigation directive . I am calling about the other important one—the Deferred Prosecution thing/ SNC and so one—I wanted to pass on where the PM is at… so our intelligence from various sources is that company is getting to serious point now… the board has asked consulting firms for options for the board for their next which could be selling out to somebody else, moving…you know, various things.

JWR: yep.

C: So it seems to be real and not a bluff. Um, there is another rising anxiety as you can imagine about a signature firm and job loss and all that co ming after the Oshawa thing and what is going on in Calgary and what not . So the PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within legitimate toolbox to try to head that off. So he is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. And I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.

JWR : ok

C: So, um, I don’t know if he is going to call you directly – he might – um and he is willing – I think he is thinking about getting somebody else to give him some advice…you know he does not want to do anything outside the box of what is legal or proper – um…but his understanding is – you know – the DPA tool is there and you have options that we talked about before to ask for reason from the DPP or even take over the prosecution. He just wants to understand more at this point of why the DPA route is not taken up on this route. So he is thinking on bringing someone in like Bev Mclachlin to give him advice on this or to give you advice on this if you want to feel more uncomfort able you are not doing anything inappropriate or outside the frame of…

JWR: I am 100 percent confident that I am doing nothing inappropriate.

C: Ya, no but would not be if you decided to use some of these tools under the law…cause I think he feels that the government has to have done everything that I can before we lose 9,000 jobs…and a signature Canadian firm.

JWR: Right so – um – I again am confident in where I am at on my views on SNC and the DPA haven’t changed – this is a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence that Michael – I have to say including this conversation and previous conversations that I have had with Prime Minister and many other people around it – it is entirely inappropriate and it is political interference . And l…the Prime Minister obviously can talk to whomever he wants – but what I am trying to do is to protect him . I could have a conversation with Beverley Mclachlin…l can call her right now…um…l am just – um – issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue that decision s that are made by the independent prosecutor are their decisions. We gave her, and them, the tools – the additional tools- I made it very clear at the cabinet table and other places that these tools are at the discretion of the prosecutor – and everybody agreed to that and that there was no guarantee that there would be a DPA in t his or any other case . So we are treading on dangerous ground here – and I am going to issue my stern warning – um – because I can not act in a manner and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent, I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. All of this screams of t hat . So I am actually un comfortable having this conversation but I am happy to talk to you. I will cal l Beverley Mclachlin…l cannot even imagine her fee ling in any way, sh ape or form comfortable interfering with the independent prosecutor.

C: Ok but I think that is where people are talking past each other. I mean I think t he view that h e has for med – I share – I am not the lawyer in any of these conversations – and Elder and others is – um – it is not interference – the statute specifically has these other provisions i n it that all ow you to ask questions of the OPP and that is provided for and that is not interference …

JWR : But I would have to issue a Directive, I would have to Gazette this…

C: Yes.

JWR : the Prosecutor – the director – whom I know and understand after having several conversations wit h her about another directive on HIV that I issued – she is a by the book person. If this is gazette – this will be – and I hear you on the jobs and wanting to save jobs – I mean we all want to do that – this goes far beyond saving jobs – this is about the integrity of the Prime Minister and interference – there is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference – if I was to step in. It does not matter how I would look in doing that – I would be a mockery – and that is not t he problem – the bigger problem is what it would look like d ow n the road for the government. It is not about jobs – and I know that jobs are import ant so I do not want any body to misinterpret t hat I don’t care ab out those jobs – this is about the integrity of the government and recognizing that there is t he ability to issue a directive under the act…um …it is still irrespective of the ability that I have to do that – 1. it has never been done before but 2. t hi s is going to look like nothing but political interference by the Prime Minister, by you, by everybody else that has been involved in this politically pressuring me to do this.

C: Well…um…

JWR : I actually really feel uncomfortable havin g this conversation because it is wrong and I hear the Prime Minister obviously can call me…like I said to you I will have a conversation…I am going to call Beverley Mclachlin and have a conversation with her about his.

C: Well…of course it has not been done before because parliament only created the instrument barely a year ago…

JWR: No no no…this instrument was… you mean the directive – the directive on a specific prosecution has never occurred… And this happened… cause Harper brought this law in as you probably know 10 years ago. The Directive – or the DPA has n ever been it just entered the Criminal Code back in September so I understand that this is the first case. The prosecutor sent me what is called a Sect ion 13 – you told me that you hadn’t seen it before – but I read it and I have reread it – and the Prime Minister’s Office has a copy of it. She explains in it why she is not doing it in this case – we have to, I have to be – unless it is something outrageous – com fortable with the decision – recognizing it is the first one likely and obviously I am confident wasn’t entered into lightly – made the decision not to enter into a DPA with respect to this case. And she explained why.

C: So when did she convey that to you?

JWR: She issued the Section 13 back in September when I was down in Australia for that…five eyes – and then all this transpired…I mean I have a timeline of every single conversation and everything that everybody has said to me on this so…um… So like…anyway…again – I am surprised that you and I are having this conversation but I am just say ing that I re ll y feel uncomfortable about the appropriateness of this conversation.

C: Ok I understand that – but I mean I think his view is that his is not asking you to do anything inappropriate or interfere . He is asking you to use al l the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal…um.

JWR: I know I have a tool under the prosecution Act that I can use. I do not believe it is appropriate to use tool in this case.

C: ok alright … that is clear – um – well his is in a very firm mood about this so um….

JWR: Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean – this is not about saving jobs – this is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions – this is like breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.

C: Well I don’t think he sees it as that…

JWR: No one is explaining that to him Michael. Like this is… we can stand up in the House of Commons on Norman on – tyotally appropriately on Norman – on extradition and we can talk about the rule of law – um… The cases are not dissimilar – the principle or the integrity of how we act and respond to the tools we have available and what we should and shouldn’t do – again …I just. l don’t know…

C: Ok, then I am – I respect where you are coming from… l just think…

JWR: You know what – I hope that you do because I do not think any body respect s this. The conversation that Gerry and Katie had with my Chief of Staff and I have it – like she wrote down what was said – saying that they do not want to hear anymore about the legalities – but want to talk about jobs is entirely in appropriate.

C: Ok well I was not

JWR: Ok I have it…l have it all.

C: Ok but you are not just the Attorney General, you are the Minist er of Justice in a cabinet and … context in which you exercise your roles and responsibilities … I am not seeing anything inappropriate here but…um… I mean … you are right … and the PM … people are talking past each other…l think the way he sees it and the advice he is getting is that you still have things you can do that are not interference and are still very much lawful…

JWR: It is not that they are not lawful. ..the perception and what will happen is that it will be deemed political interference from day one when people were talking about why we are entering into a DPA or putting in a DPA regime in place … Everybody knows that it was because of SNC whether that is true or not that is what people will think.

C: It is a tool used in lots of other countries though…

JWR: Fair

C: …for these kind s of purposes and especially if there has been a change of ownership or management of the company that is being prosecuted … it is a public policy tool.

JWR: Fair, but in our MCs all the way up and in the law that we changed we gave the Director of Public Prosecutions the discretion to enter into the DPAs and the judge to oversee the regime . There is no guarantee in any particular case – this one or the ones that will come – that they will enter into the DPAs or think it is appropriate to do so. And that is what we consciously made the decision on when we decided as a cabinet to enter into this process and I amending the law.

C: Is there anybody that can talk to Kathleen then about the context around this or to get her to explain why she is … or I guess the company has talked to her directly …

JWR: The company has… but Michael there was a preliminary inquiry- I am still try ing to get an update on what happened at the Pl. Like the suggestion that I made ages ago which Gerry talked to you about in Montreal was … nobody from the company ever contacted me or sent me a letter expressing concern – had that happened I would have done what I believed to have been appropriate was to forward that letter on to the DPP.

C: I think they have made direct representations to the prosecutor though…and they tried to make the public interest argument and so on and so on. But they gave the impression that they are not being listened to so…

JWR: ya…

C: Alright…um…well I am going to have to report back before he leaves…he is in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so…l am a bit worried…

JWR: Bit worried about what?

C: Well…it is not a good idea for the Prime Minister and his Attorney General to be at loggerheads.

JWR: Well I feel that I am giving him my best advice and if he does not accept that advice then it is his prerogative to do what he wants… But I am trying to protect the Prime Minister from political interference or perceived political interference or otherwise.

C: Alright, I understand that… but he does not have the power to do what he wants… all the tools are in your hands so…

JWR: … Ok so then…so I am having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here Michael to be honest with you and this is not a great place for me to be in – I do not relish this place – but what I am confident of is that I have given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.

C: Ok…alright but…I am worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this…I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him… Ok…um…there is not much more we can cover for now them… um…I understand where you are coming from … Um…The section 13 response from Kathleen…you are saying Elder has that or had a version of that?

JWR: The Prime Minister’s Office has had it since September since I have had it.

C: Since September …ok that is import ant . That is new to me so … ok. Alright…um…

JWR: They will tell you that they have not received a copy of it … Elder and Mathieu said it to me when they came to my office…um…but we have documented evidence in terms of emails etcetera where that has been provided…so they do have it …maybe they have misplaced it. I can send it back over to them but I know that Jessica asked the other day when she was over at the PMO office…

C: And what did they tell her…that they didn’t have it or that they never seen it…?

JWR: I have to ask and I will tell you exactly what they said. I will have to ask her.

C: My advice is that Jessica should send it to Elder then just to make it ‘tripley’ sure they have it. JWR: Ok, I will get her to do that right now.

C: Alright thanks for calling me.

JWR : Than s.

C: Thanks for calling back so quickly .

JWR: No problem.

C: OK, he is still around tomorrow so… (inaudible)

JWR: I am waiting for big…the other shoe to drop…so I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister has and gets things that he wants… l am just stuck doing the best job that I can…

C: Ok alright.

Trump threatens to close Mexican border

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to close the border with Mexico next week. That is unless Mexico does something to end illegal immigration immediately.

This isn’t the first time Trump has threatened to shut the border down, but it is the first time he’s given a time frame. In response Mexico’s foreign secretary said they’re a great neighbour that doesn’t act on the basis of threats.



Brexit options shrinking after third defeat

The UK’s withdrawal from the EU is up in the air after British lawmakers rejected the government’s Brexit deal for a third time today.

That gives the nation the prospect of just up and leaving the EU without a deal on April 12th, or delaying the exit even longer. Experts have warned that a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster on a number of fronts, especially economically.","Wilson-Raybould has recording of SNC-Lavalin conversation, Trump threatens border shutdown",My Prince George Now,https://www.myprincegeorgenow.com/97848/wilson-raybould-has-recording-of-snc-lavalin-conversation-trump-threatens-border-shutdown/
