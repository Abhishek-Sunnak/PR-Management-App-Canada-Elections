Jagmeet Singh faces the biggest test of his NDP leadership in a by-election on Monday as he vies for a seat in the House of Commons.

The Burnaby South vote in the Vancouver region is one of three by-elections taking place on Monday, with others north of Toronto and in Montreal. The votes come just six months before campaigning is likely to officially begin for the general federal election.

Much is at stake for Mr. Singh, who was elected leader of the NDP in the fall of 2017 on a decisive first-ballot victory. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he loses Burnaby South. Mr. Singh at the time insisted he would lead the NDP this fall regardless of the by-election result. The 40-year-old has struggled at times as party leader: He has been criticized for low poll numbers and poor fundraising.

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s orange wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said on Sunday that a victory in the by-election would be essential to unite the NDP.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh has poured considerable personal energy into the riding, through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past on a federal and provincial level. The B.C. NDP dominated Burnaby when John Horgan was elected in 2017, and on Saturday the Premier on Twitter called on voters to get to the polls to back Mr. Singh.

The Burnaby South contest has been turbulent. The Liberals’ first candidate, Karen Wang, stepped down after a social media post on the social messaging app WeChat that zeroed in on Mr. Singh’s ethnicity and highlighted that she was only candidate of Chinese ethnicity. A recent all-candidates’ debate became heated on issues of race and immigration.

Richard T. Lee is the new Liberal candidate. Jay Shin is running for the Conservatives. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson represents the upstart People’s Party of Canada. The Greens chose not to run a candidate against Mr. Singh.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism last fall for delaying a by-election call after the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart vacated the Burnaby South seat in September to become the mayor of Vancouver.

Mr. Singh said voters are “very disappointed” in Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government.

“It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Political scientist Richard Johnston at the University of British Columbia said the SNC-Lavalin case could be a “gift” for Mr. Singh, because it could turn some potential Liberal voters to the NDP.

David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said it is unclear whether Mr. Singh should stay on as leader of the NDP if he lost.

“There’s this assumption that if he lost the by-election, he couldn’t show his face in the general election. I don’t think Canadians would really care,” Mr. Moscrop said. “The NDP caucus might see things differently.”

In 2015, the NDP barely won Burnaby South, as the Liberals had a strong showing in the province when Mr. Trudeau swept to power. Mr. Stewart, who had won a close race in Burnaby-Douglas in 2011, won 35.1 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South, ahead of the Liberals’ 33.9 per cent. The margin was 547 votes. The Conservatives had 27.1 per cent of the vote.

The Burnaby-South riding is an amalgam of two older ridings, the southern half of Burnaby-Douglas – where the NDP had a long, but narrow, hold on power federally – and the western half of Burnaby-New Westminster – where the NDP had a long, and mostly dominant, hold on power federally.

Germany's Alternative For Germany (AfD) party (previously) are an insurgent neofascist movement with ties to senior mainstream politicians and the country's super-wealthy would-be oligarchs; the party put on a hard push in the the 2018 Bavarian elections and their meme warfare was full of familiar voter-suppression tactics, from garden-variety disinformation to exhortations to stay home on election day.

Also prominent in the group's messaging: hashtags and tropes from the US far-right conspiracy theory Qanon (previously), an incoherent toxic stew of antisemitism, murder accusations, numerology, Islamophobia, and other pathologies of the moment.

The connection between Qanon and AfD comes from an unreleased report from the London School of Economics-affiliated Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which bills itself as an ""anti-extremist think tank""; some details of the study have been reported in the German and US press.

The researchers traced the inclusion of Qanon-affiliated hashtags in AfD social media, including German translations and adaptations of popular Qanon tags (e.g. #linksliegenlassen, #MerkelMussWeg); as with the US-based Qanon activists, the German Qanon phenomenon was driven by small numbers of incredibly prolific social media users -- not bots (Erin Gallagher's research found that Qanon tweeters posting 500+ messages/day were often ""older retired people with a lot of free time"").

There's evidence that US-based Qanon activists forged alliances with German neofascists; some popular fascist hashtags (""#ChemnitzIstDerAnfang"") originated with US Qanon accounts.

Qanon is becoming a kind of ideological signifier among far-right groups: members of the far-right who have adopted the yellow vest for street demonstrations in Canada and the UK have been spotted decorating the vests with Qanon memes and carrying Qanon-boosting signs. Qanon networks have also been used to boost the virality of racist videos.

I think far-right extremism is the intersection of garden-variety bigotry/xenophobia with economic precarity and a breakdown of the epistemological consensus about what constitutes a reliable indicator that something is true.

Xenophobia and bigotry are always around, but they surge when people feel afraid for their overall economic circumstances, and that surge has been supercharged by decades of both scientific denialism (well-funded campaigns to sow doubt about the motives of climate scientists, doctors who warn of the link between smoking and cancer, etc) and corruption -- for example, anti-vax builds on the assertion that experts have corrupt motives and that regulators are so captured that they let them get away with murder. The thing is, regulators really are that captured.

I can't say for sure that a more equitable economic system -- which would cut off the resources used by corporate influences to distort policy, and by ideological entrepreneurs to push expensive, profitable scientific denial -- would neutralize the far-right, but I think it's worth a try.

The crossover between QAnon and far-right German movements like the Chemnitz riots makes sense. Both movements are aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-refugee. And both make vague gestures toward a right-wing revolution. “At the time I got the impression that some people thought Chemnitz was going to be ‘Germany's great awakening,’” Gallagher said, referencing QAnon’s promise of a “great awakening” in America. It’s a trend she’s previously observed, as America’s alt-right moved on to trolling on behalf of their counterparts in Europe after Trump’s victory in 2016. “I've noticed crossover of US alt-right networks with European alt-right for a long time,” she said. “How QAnon fits into all that is a great question, but the international alt-right coordinated swarms—QAnon related or not—do not surprise me.”

3,Empty,2019-02-25T12:00:00Z,The nation’s eyes are on B.C. for Monday’s byelections across Canada,"Ballots will be cast in Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Quebec’s Outremont ridings, but no race is being watched more closely than the one in Burnaby South, B.C., where New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh is vying for his first seat in Parliament.

BURNABY, B.C.—A trio of federal byelections on Monday will offer more than just an early glimpse of voters’ dispositions, potentially shaking up the political landscape months before Canadians head to the polls en masse.

“There’s already rumblings that if he loses, it will be difficult for him to stay on as leader — and (it) would probably further undermine the NDP’s electoral prospects going into the federal election after an already underwhelming year.”

“Singh needs to win to consolidate his power as the leader of the party,” explained political scientist David Moscrop, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa.

Burnaby South is a key test of both Singh’s hold on his left-leaning party and the popularity of Maxime Bernier’s new far-right populist party, focused on immigration and carbon taxes.

Burnaby South is historically a diverse, working-class riding. Its median income falls 18 per cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. It was previously an NDP stronghold.

“I think he will win,” said Moscrop. “But he doesn’t have federal experience as MP … Forget forming government: He needs to show he can hold the government accountable, with only months left until the election.”

So it may be Singh’s to lose.

And with Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada running its first big candidate in Burnaby South — former radio host Laura Lynn Tyler Thompson — the election has seen tense all-candidates debates devolve into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism.

“If she can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” Moscrop argued. “This is the perfect time for his party to do well. It’s getting outsized media attention, and they can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate.

“Plus, there’s enough disaffection, not to mention xenophobia, today that could express itself as support.”

Here’s what’s at stake in Burnaby South, what voters are saying their top issues are and why this byelection is being so scrutinized across the country.

Who is running?

Singh, a former Ontario provincial politician and lawyer, is facing off against three rival party hopefuls.

One of those rivals, Thompson of the People’s Party of Canada, has generated considerable controversy by tapping into public anxieties around immigration and refugees.

Also running is another former provincial politician, Richard Lee, with the Liberals. Jay Shin is carrying the flag for the federal Conservative party, mounting concerns over the Liberals’ more than three years in office, expressing particular opposition to certain taxes and drug policies.

There are also two independent candidates running.

What is at stake nationally?

It’s seen as a high-stakes byelection beyond the borders of B.C.’s Lower Mainland mainly because experts say it’s a key test of Singh’s hold on the leadership of his party — which he’s headed since 2017 despite not yet holding a seat in Parliament. Facing the Liberals in Ottawa is seen as essential to his party’s chances, and some have speculated he could face an internal coup if he fails his first ballot-box test.

It also remains to be seen whether Bernier’s right-wing populist party, the People’s Party of Canada, has the kind of broad appeal he claims. Burnaby South is the first chance to test that support in a largely working-class city.

Another dynamic is how well the Liberal brand performs, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general to stop prosecuting Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee and faced cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C.

“Byelections are pretty silly tests of public mood,” Moscrop cautioned, “because they don’t really mimic the conditions of a general election.

“They’re a really strange one-off, or in this case, three. People try to read a lot into them but shouldn’t.”

What is the tone on the campaign trail?

Unusually bitter and divisive for a local riding byelection. Three all-candidates debates in a row have descended into audience members shouting accusations of racism, fascism and extremism against each other and candidates onstage.

The spark has been any conversation about immigration, refugees and people illegally crossing the border into Canada. The subjects have stoked anger at recent Yellow Vests rallies and from the People’s Party of Canada, which alleges all three rival parties are soft on screening people entering the country. The People’s party wants a tighter cap on immigration numbers and more prevention of irregular asylum-seekers.

That’s led to accusations of racism and xenophobia — but some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public safety risk. Meanwhile, the Liberal and NDP candidates have countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group of people.

The People’s party candidate has accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drugs.

The original Liberal candidate in Burnaby South was forced to resign by the party after the Star unearthed online posts in Chinese pointing out that Singh is South Asian.

What do locals say?

Despite Singh’s future hanging in the balance, when the Star hit the suburban city’s streets to find out what regular voters think, locals appeared more focused on anything but the NDP leader’s prospects in Ottawa.

By far, the most commonly cited issue in this byelection was affordable housing, followed by taxes, jobs, the environment and immigration.

Who are Burnaby’s voters?

Burnaby’s demographics are increasingly young and not white, the 2016 census found. Its average age is three years below B.C.’s average, and 69 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority, more than triple Canada’s rate. (The Greater Toronto Area, by comparison, was 51 per cent visible minorities.)

Burnaby South is home to a sizable Chinese-Canadian community, followed in number by Caucasians, South Asians and Filipinos.

In fact, 54 per cent of Burnaby South residents say they are immigrants, according to the 2016 census, compared to the Canada-wide figure of 14 per cent. (Immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area make up 46 per cent of the population.)

It’s also a historically working-class riding, with the median income at just $28,183 per year, 18 per cent less than the national average. Burnaby South’s poverty rates are significantly higher than the national average, with 22 per cent of residents being defined by Statistics Canada as low income, compared to 16 per cent nationally.

How can eligible voters cast their ballots?

Polls are open to any eligible Burnaby South resident from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday. Since not all Burnaby residents are eligible — the city contains multiple federal ridings — you can find out if you can vote, and where, on Elections Canada’s website.

“I thought hard about what life was going to be like as a private citizen, and I think what I’ve always loved is policy — whether it’s foreign policy or domestic policy, I’ve always loved it, and I always want to have a voice,” Haley told the Washington Post.

Stand for America, a social welfare group that cannot endorse candidates or make political donations, vows to help every American accomplish the “American dream” and claims Americans’ success is “being threatened by socialist schemes of higher taxes, burdensome job-destroying regulations, government-run health care, and unsecure borders.” The group also says numerous rogue regimes internationally are jeopardizing U.S. national security.

""As U.S. Ambassador to the UN, I was able to see firsthand the challenges we face around the globe. Iranian-backed radical Islamic terrorism threatens the lives of innocent Americans,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “Communist China is spreading its influence throughout the world and engaging in unfair and illegal trade practices. North Korea still has nuclear weapons that can hit us. Russia meddles in our elections and invades its neighbors with no regard for their sovereignty. In our own backyard, socialist dictators in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua oppress their own people and support narco-trafficking that invades America.”

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and daughter of immigrants, said her life story is evidence the American dream is still alive, due to “hard work, determination, and the incredible support of the people of South Carolina.”

""My story is proof positive that the American dream is alive and well,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “America’s greatness comes from our freedom and our values and they must be protected for future generations.”

""Even though I have entered private life, I will never stop standing up for America’s freedom and values,” Haley said. “We all have a part to play in keeping our country safe, strong, and prosperous.""

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia. The majority of the organization's member states are backing Guaido.

Singh addressed his supporters, saying “My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” and promising to take the issues of Burnaby residents to Ottawa.

Singh said many Canadians are falling behind, despite working hard, and they are starting to become fearful for themselves and their children.

He said some people will use that fear to “point at your neighbours, the people you live with, the people you work with.”

Singh said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was trying to protect his “friends at SNC-Lavalin” and subsidizing big oil. He said Canadians are drowning in debt, as he attacked corporations, saying the Liberals and Conservatives are not helping Canadians.

“Times up,” Singh said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The results

Singh has 38.7 per cent of 20,346 votes counted, enough to be declared the winner.

There are 76,204 registered voters in the riding. 181 of 196 polls have been counted so far, representing 92 per cent of the vote.

Singh was up against Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson.

In the 2015 federal election, the NDP won with 35 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals taking 33.9 per cent, the Conservatives 27.1 per cent, Greens 2.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent for the Libertarian party.

Lee has 26 per cent of the votes counted so far. The right-wing vote appears to be split, with Shin so far holding 22.7 per cent of the vote and Thompson with 10.9 per cent. Thompson is the first candidate seeking a seat for former Conversative Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

“Singh, Singh, Singh!”

Postmedia News reporter Matt Robinson said Singh supporters broke out into spontaneous chants of “Singh, Singh, Singh”, prior to Singh taking the podium at the election night party at the Metrotown Hilton.

Vancouver-Kingsway MP Don Davies has earlier taken the mic with an optimistic: “Welcome to the victory party.”

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said with voters giving Singh the seat, “they’re saying they want a fighter. They’re saying they want someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Jenny Kwan, a former and longtime MLA and now MP in Singh’s party, said “it’s a very exciting night. It’s one we’ve been waiting for for a long time. I know that Jag is so looking forward to going to Ottawa.

“We need a voice in the House of Commons that is on the side of the people and we haven’t had that with the Liberals and not with the Conservatives.”

Second place for Lee

Postmedia reporter Dan Fumano was with supporters of Liberal candidate Lee at the Delta Hotel.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South an the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person” and “I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia.

“His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The Greens did not run a candidate in this byelection in order to improve the chances of an NDP win.

Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart last October, when he was voted in as Vancouver’s mayor.

Quick things to know

• In the 2015 election, the New Democrats beat the Liberals in this riding by just over 500 votes.

• Lee announced he would be running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post.

• Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, was the first candidate to seek a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC. She has been vocal against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) education in B.C.’s education curriculum.

• Green party Leader Elizabeth May had said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.

European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.

Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.

That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.

Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.

“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.

An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.

Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.

Colombian president Iván Duque has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.

There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.

“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.

“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”

Before the meeting of the Lima group of Latin American powers and Canada, Pence told Guaidó, attending as Venezuela’s interim president: “We are 100% with you.”

Following President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration for a disputed second term in January, the speaker of the opposition-dominated parliament, Juan Guaidó declared himself ""interim president"" of the country.

Guaidó was immediately recognised by the US, Canada and a group of Latin American conservative governments, who called upon the Venezuelan military to rise up against Maduro. The UK, France, Spain, Germany and other European countries also recognised Guaidó after Maduro rejected their demand for fresh elections. Paredes, who presented his credentials to President Hage Geingob at State House last week, said the situation is normal, while accusing external forces for attempting to cause political instability in Venezuela.

""If you visit the main cities in Venezuela, you can see people going to work, the kids going to school. Unfortunately, foreign forces are trying to create instability in the country,"" he told New Era and NBC in an interview.

""One of the topics I discussed with President Hage Geingob, who is also the Chairperson of Sadc [Southern African Development Community] was to thank him on behalf of the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the people of Venezuela for his brave and strong support,"" Paredes said.

Last month, Namibia added her voice to growing international concern over the situation in Venezuela, calling on the international community to allow the Venezuelans to resolve their internal issues in an amicable and peaceful manner.

Namibia's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah at the time said the international community should allow the people of Venezuela to resolve their internal issues within the confines of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

""Namibia has been following with great concern the political developments in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The concern is that the political developments are arising from the unwarranted interference in the domestic affairs of Venezuela by foreign powers,"" Nandi-Ndaitwah said.

Paredes noted that Namibia's support is well received by the democratic institutions in Venezuela as it supports the truth, adding Maduro last year was elected with more than 67 percent of the voters in a process where more than a million people participated in the elections.

He said the African Union (AU) also send a delegation who validated the results. Hence, he said the position of the African countries was very important for the true democratic processes and respect of the international law and the United Nations charter. Since Guaidó's declaration, US President Donald Trump's administration has imposed new sanctions on Maduro's government, seized billions-worth of Venezuelan oil-related assets on US soil, and started making barely veiled threats of military intervention.

Paredes admitted that the country is experiencing hyperinflation due to economic blockade and sanctions imposed by unilateral position of the government of the United States.

According to him, the Venezuela economy has lost more than U$30 billion in the last few years. ""So please tell me which country in the world can resist an impact on their economy with such criminal blockade against our financial institutions and oil industry. That is why we are seeing the challenges in our economy. Despite, this situation, our government never stopped providing assistance to the poor people through social programmes in education, health, housing and in other sectors to stabilise our country,"" he noted.

Because of challenges emanating from the hyperinflation, more than three million Venezuelans are said to have fled the country, causing consternation across the continent.

On Saturday, clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns, as government allegedly blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil.

Government troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who attempted to collect and transport the supplies.

9,Empty,2019-02-25T19:44:00Z,"Eric Farnsworth Security, Americas The citizens of Caracas face unpleasant choices. Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitari…","Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitarian assistance, leading to increasing speculation about what comes next. Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.

What can be anticipated, however, is that there will be further intensified pressure on the regime, which will squeeze it like the large anacondas that inhabit Venezuelan waters. In addition to efforts to entice regime officials, including the military, to shift their loyalty from Maduro to Guaido, the United States, in coordination with other nations, looks to amplify asset seizure and forfeiture. Collectively, they aim to deny new and cancel existing visas for regime officials and their families, thus forcing departures from the United States, Europe, and Latin American nations that host them, and increase humanitarian assistance. All of these activities will further the goal of turning Maduro into an international pariah, and, it is hoped, create conditions that will ultimately see him turfed from office.

The key is to keep the Maduro regime on the defensive. There are no guarantees, and nobody can say when the dam will ultimately break—or if it will break. Meanwhile, Venezuelans face an unpleasant choice between protesting and exposing themselves to the excesses of the regime, hunkering down, or joining the millions of Venezuelans who have already left their nation behind. It is a tragedy lain squarely at the feet of Chavismo.

10,Empty,2019-02-25T13:44:59Z,Thomas Mulcair's win in Outremont in a 2007 byelection was only the second time the NDP had won a seat in Quebec. Outremont's polls are open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.,"Liberal Rachel Bendayan has won the federal riding of Outremont in Quebec after taking 40 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of polls reporting.

""I will honour your vote by working very hard,"" she said Monday night at Liberal party headquarters in Montreal's Outremont.

She stressed that the Liberals would continue to fight climate change and promote a national housing strategy.

Mélanie Joly, the minister of official languages and La Francophonie, said that despite losing to the NDP in 2015, Bendayan was always a strong candidate who continued working in the riding in the years since.

""We hope this is the end of the Orange Wave in Quebec,"" Joly said Monday night.

The NDP, which had held the riding since 2007, trailed in second place with less than 30 per cent of the votes.

Outremont was one of three ridings where federal byelections took place Monday on a crucial day for Canada's major political parties.

Voter turnout was low, as is typical for a byelection. Less than 20 per cent of the 70,400 registered voters in Outremont cast a ballot.

Political insiders had bet that the Liberals would retake the riding — a welcome boost for the governing party's morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

""Tonight, the people of Outremont and thousands of Canadians voting in these byelections have offered a strong vote of confidence in Justin Trudeau's positive plan to strengthen the middle class,"" said Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Outremont resident, Claudette Dumas Bergen, says the weather was holding her back but she adds “my civic duty came to me and I said I have to go because it’s important!” <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Outremont?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Outremont</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCMontreal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCMontreal</a> <a href=""https://t.co/H6ds1wsZZ4"">pic.twitter.com/H6ds1wsZZ4</a> —@mia_anhoury

Analysts said the Outremont race was a crucial test for the NDP.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Thomas Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection: the Liberals had lost the riding only once, to the Progressive Conservatives in 1988, since 1935.

The so-called Orange Wave followed in 2011 and boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history.

While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

These are the candidates who ran in Outremont and how much of the vote they took by the time 95 per cent of ballots had been counted:

40 per cent: Rachel Bendayan — Liberal Party of Canada.

29 per cent: Julia Sánchez — New Democratic Party.

13 per cent: Daniel Green — Green Party of Canada.

11 per cent: Michel Duchesne — Bloc Québécois.

The base isn’t stupid, and if they stay home on election day because you’ve disavowed them in the general election campaign then you aren’t going to pick up enough “moderate” voters to make a difference. That so-called strategy has looked more an more bleak for several years. Now the alleged moderates have not only decreased in number but they actually don’t represent any view on the American political landscape. These two graphs are from the Pew Research Center’s report Political Polarization in the American Public.

CREDIT: http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/

Because our “first past the post” system crushes third parties like the bugs that they are, this polarization hasn’t been felt in American politics. But the same thing is happening in Europe and Australia/Oceania where parliamentary systems and you can see the effect.

Writing at the Washington Post, Harry Olsen has an intriguing piece on how centrist, “third way” politics are foundering basically everywhere after this philosophy had been declared victorious a couple of decades ago. The article is titled Don’t fool yourself. The political center won’t recover anytime soon and I don’t think the phenomenon is as surprising as some.

…Globally, the prevailing trend is rising support for anti-immigrant, nationalist populist parties — not a resurgence of the center. That trend is easy to see almost anywhere you look. Estonia holds national elections in a week, and polls show the big winner is likely to be the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, which is set to more than double its share of the vote, becoming the third-largest party in the country. Spain’s Socialist president, Pedro Sánchez, recently called for a snap election after his government failed to pass a budget, but again, polls show an anti-immigrant, nationalist party called Vox will likely gain the most. Vox has skyrocketed in support from less than 1 percent in 2016 to an average of around 11 percent in recent polls. A three-party, center-right coalition including Vox shocked the country by winning the state elections last December in the longtime Socialist bastion of Andalusia. It now looks like that coalition will govern Spain, too. …Italy’s Lega is led by the notorious anti-immigrant and social conservative Matteo Salvini, who has garnered international attention with his opposition to admitting refugees from Muslim Northern Africa. Lega’s support has doubled within a year, from 17 percent in last March’s election to more than 35 percent today, easily making the brash populist the most popular political figure in Italy. …That’s the coalition that currently governs New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, known for her environmental policies and deft use of social media, governs in coalition with the anti-immigrant and nationalist New Zealand First party. Their coalition agreement is opaque on the matter, but annual net migration has declined nearly 30 percent since the coalition took power in 2017. …Quebec elected a center-right government for the first time in decades last year, partially on its promise to reduce immigration to the province by 20 percent. A new political party, the People’s Party of Canada, formed last year with a platform of free-market economic reforms and reducing immigration. It is already receiving more than 2 percent in the polls, and could easily gain more support ahead of this fall’s national election.

What Olsen paints as anti-immigrant is, I think, much more a natural resurgence of nationalism that has been tamped down…tribalism, dontcha know…by would-be elites married to a populism abetted by the breaking of the information monopoly that has large numbers of people looking at the policies promoted by those elites and asking “WTF??” because a blind man could see they do nothing to benefit current or future generations of their nation. Immigration is a lightning rod for this effect because in so many Western nations, the elites either have or have no problem with opening the flood gates to no-skills/low-skills immigrants who either survive on the dole (paid for by the citizen taxpayer) or compete for low-end jobs with disadvantaged citizens and who, either by their own desire or the benighted policies of the host nation, show no desire to assimilate or even pretend to assimilate.

Those bemoaning the loss of a “center” are actually crying over the demise of Failure Theater and the log-rolling and deal-making that benefited only a relatively small number of people to the detriment of most everyone else. They are complaining that the rule by elites is coming to an end now that everywhere people are seeing that what was marketed as “bipartisanship” was actually just a self-serving scam.

This is “how you got Trump” in a nutshell.

As Texas Democrat and populist Jim Hightower was noted for saying, there’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos. The 2016 GOP primary demonstrated that in spades. The closer you were to being a “moderate” the sooner you looked like dead armadillo (Scott Walker, Jeb Bush). The closer your views were to those of the average voter the better your chance of survival. Ted Cruz understood that when he ran this commercial in 2016 highlighting the fact that illegal immigration was only supported by people whose jobs were not put at risk by it:

It will be shocking if the same dynamic doesn’t play out in the Democrat primary for 2020.

Fifty years ago, both US parties commanded a broad consensus opinion on the American Experiment. That consensus has unraveled. The two major parties now have very differing ideas about what the nation should look like and how our economic system should operate. The challenge in 2020 will be to appeal to those common values remaining with sufficient strength to bring along people who might not agree with large parts of your platform. It implies that rather than trying to appeal to moderates, the successful candidate will lock down and motivate their base and build enough common ground with some “moderate” elements to create a winning coalition. Will that common ground be reducing illegal immigration, as it is in Europe? Will it be restricting abortion and limiting the ability of the federal government to meddle in our lives? Or will it be guaranteed free day care, a $15/hour minimum wage and a stipend for those who, according to the Green New Deal, are “unwilling to work?” I really don’t know. Regardless, the unalloyed good here is that both sides are coming to see “moderates” as the feckless and uncertain allies that they are.

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.

Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked aid from reaching the crisis-hit country during the weekend.

The United States also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking that body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored to the OPEC member. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA's assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro's ""henchmen"" to Guaido's government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming.

""In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks,"" Pence said. ""We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.""

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the ""massacre"" of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider ""all options"" in ousting Maduro.

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hopes Maduro and those supported by his ""corruption and his brutality"" will leave Venezuela peacefully.

""We make clear to them that we will support the interim president's call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,"" Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region's other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president.

""We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere, and our message today very much was intended to say - to Mexico, to Uruguay, to nations across the eastern Caribbean - that they need to come off the sidelines, they need to take a stand for freedom. Stand with us and with the people of Venezuela,"" said Pence.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela's energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup against Venezuela.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro's government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as ""trochas"" generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as ""trocheros.""

""We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,"" said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. ""We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.""

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Lacava goes by the nickname ""Dracula"" in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos.

The proposed rule to do away with H4 work permits (which came into effect in Barack Obama's second term) was sent to the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review last week. Headlines like ""Game over for H4EAD"" are floating around as families are torn between decisions about work and life in the US and the endless skewering.

""The squeeze is real and it's very effective from the administration's point of view. H1B extensions are getting very hard. Our families are getting hit. Spouses are upset that they may be denied working rights and to top to all, recruiters are going cold when they hear the word H1B. It's coming at us from all sides and frankly, we can't take it any more"", an ex-H1B worker who has moved to Canada barely a month ago, told Firstpost, in a phone conversation.

The H4 EAD is a work permit for spouses of H1B workers who have been approved for green cards and are yet to get those in hand. The Trump administration first announced its intent to scrap the H4 EAD in early 2017. The pushback against these work permits predates the Trump era and takes the form of a lawsuit launched against the program within days of its announcement by the Barack Obama government in 2015.

Charts extrapolating how quickly or slowly the H4 revocation could happen speak to the many pressures working on legal immigrant spouses over a prolonged period of many years now of which the last 2 years have been the most fraught.

""Let’s do everything collectively in our power to prevent the revocation of H-4 EAD"", says Cyrus Mehta, a high name recognition immigration attorney based in New York.

In government filings, the proposed changes are listed as “economically significant” and with “international impact”. At least 45% of all pending rule changes are in the “proposed rule” stage. You can see the high level overview here. If OMB moves at top speed and wraps up comments period within 30 days, we are looking at Spring 2019 when the comments review may begin. On the same sliding scale, a slower pace could push it all out by a few months. Either way, a constant gnawing remains for H1B families.

Once OMB reviews the proposed rule, it will be published in the Federal Register and opened for comments - the typical rubric for rule changes. Those who are following this can check for DHS pending rules and look for 1615-AC15. The same link also summarises the 'official' DHS lens on the issue.

Framed against the backdrop of the wider political scene in the country, the brief history of the H4 EAD in the Trump era fits neatly within the US president’s all-base, all-the-time strategy. But, like anything else, the White House’s chief occupant is the final wild card in this game and could always (in theory) step off the gas at any time. The motivations to soften the blow could come from multiple flanks and are emergent in nature, not all of which are overt at this moment.

At this time, the biggest of the #MAGA themed decisions - Trump's emergency declaration - is also on thin ice. Nearly two dozen former Republican members of Congress are urging GOP lawmakers to reject President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Whichever way that goes, it's an anthem for shifting sands and chaos well into the 2020 campaign season and all the way till the November 2020 elections.

Anirban Das, who came to the US on an F1 student visa to study for an Engineering Master's degree and has been a leading advocate for skilled immigrants here, explains how the numbers stack up, in a tweet: “As per USCIS stats, 100k #H4EAD are issued, out of which 30k were renewals. Which means only 70K are original applicants. USCIS has no idea how many are ACTUALLY working. US labor force is approx. 155 million. And they want to pull out 70k people from the workforce?”

This is how DHS explains the upside for citizens: “DHS anticipates that there would be two primary impacts that DHS can estimate and quantify: the cost-savings accruing to forgone future filings by certain H-4 dependent spouses, and labor turnover costs that employers of H-4 workers could incur when their employees’ EADs are terminated. Some U.S. workers would benefit from this proposed rule by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold, as the proposed rule would no longer allow H-4 workers to enter the labor market early.”

Das, quoted above, refutes that idea as a “lump of labor” theory. ""USCIS claims #H4EAD takes away American jobs. If an #H4EAD takes a job, it means a corresponding job loss for a citizen. This is ""lump of labor"" fallacy. No. of jobs in US economy are not set in stone. Studies show when more people join workforce, more jobs are created"".

Prominent US politicians have been at the forefront of the pushback; now even more so. Kamala Harris, the Indian American running for 2020 has called the effort “outrageous”. She tweeted that it “will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers. I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal & will continue to fight this.”

Officials are silent on the fine print. What wasn’t clear earlier remains that way. We don’t know whether the proposed rule change will have retrospective effect or not. If say, an H1B spouse has an H4 EAD that is stamped till 2021 and the rule changes this year, does it mean the H4EAD holder must stop work for pay immediately? The lion’s share of H4 EADs are held by Indians, mostly women. A small percentage of H4 visa holders are men.

The closest we have come to an official/ bureaucratic view on this are USCIS chief Francis Cissna's quotes to Bloomberg Law. Cissna said there are “very good reasons why you might want to have H-1B spouses be able to work,” and that many of those spouses are “very highly skilled.” “If the spouse can’t work, that might prevent that person from wanting to come over or stay,” but that’s something Congress should fix, he told reporter Laura D Francis.

“The reason why we’re proposing rescinding it is not because we don’t desire these people to have employment authorization...It’s because, amongst other reasons, it doesn’t appear to have been the intent of Congress to grant them work authorization,” Cissna said, in the same Bloomberg interview.

The replies on this Twitter thread below give us a good sense of how many directions the H4 or even the H1B debate can take when it goes beyond the legal framework and instead becomes a flashpoint between a dominant group and a new subculture that gains currency in an economy, like the H1B has come to be understood over three decades of its presence in the US.

The citizens of Caracas face unpleasant choices.

What’s Next for Venezuela?

Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitarian assistance, leading to increasing speculation about what comes next. Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.",What’s Next for Venezuela?,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/next-venezuela-144400468.html

Recent reports from Microsoft revealed that the attackers are focusing specifically on electoral integrity, public policy and democracy groups.

AccountGuard cybersecurity service will enter 12 new European markets including Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania. Estonia, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Spain and Portugal.

As compared to the past, now users are more aware of the domestic and international electoral malfeasance and cyber attacks that are targeting users all over the world.

The tech giant has included around 14 countries from Europe along with the US and Canada in the Defending Democracy Program as of February 20th.

AccountGuard’s main features

The tool offers a handful of important features such as training and briefings on the latest trends, detection of threats across various email addresses and accounts.

Furthermore, large enterprise and government customers can enjoy early access to the latest security features offered by Microsoft. Few of them are enabling two-factor authentication, implementing access controls and installing updates.

AccountGuard has gained huge popularity in a short span of time, following its release last year. It is available to the users in Canada, the U.S., UK, and Ireland. Office 365 users can use it free of cost.

Microsoft also revealed that the service would be available to other European countries in the next few months.

In case you want to be secure while surfing the internet, you will need to get a full-dedicated tool to secure your network. Install now Cyberghost VPN and secure yourself. It protects your PC from attacks while browsing, masks your IP address and blocks all unwanted access.

Attackers made their first move

As we all know, the 2017 French Presidential Elections were reportedly influenced by cyber attacks. Moreover, European leaders are currently fearing that history is about to repeat itself. They might manipulate video and audio recording using ‘deep fake’ techniques.

The content is manipulated in a way that makes someone says something that he/she has never said or done before.

It seems like hackers have already made their first move as they tried to access 104 accounts that belong to users from different democratic institutions. These users are mainly located in France, Belgium, Serbia, Germany, Romania, and Poland.

As a matter of fact, Microsoft is aiming to protect customers and secure their systems by notifying the organizations regarding recent attempts.

The attackers followed the same technique that was used last year during U.S. mid-terms. They spoofed legitimate looking email addresses and created malicious URLs in order to get access to employee credentials and inject malware.

However, it is just a matter of time to see the history repeat itself. Do you see that prediction turning in to reality?

Violence erupted at the Venezuela-Colombia border over the delivery of humanitarian aid to Venezuela, killing four people and injuring 24 on Feb. 22.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that his “days are numbered,” and Trump officials reiterated that the U.S. is considering all options, including military action, to address Venezuela’s crisis.

Almost 80 percent of Venezuelans disapprove of Maduro, who was reinaugurated for a second six-year term in January after an election widely seen as fraudulent. Since taking power in 2013, he has led Venezuela into a deep economic crisis.

In late January, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared Maduro a “usurper” and swore himself in as the country’s rightful president. More than 50 countries – including the United States, Europe and most of Latin America – want to replace Maduro’s regime with a Guaidó-led government.

Despite near global condemnation of Maduro, any U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be controversial. The United States’ long history of interfering in Latin American politics suggests that its military operations generally usher in dictatorship and civil war – not democracy.

The Cuban-US Cold War

Cuba, the focus of my history research, is a prime example of this pattern.

U.S.-Cuban relations have never recovered from President William McKinley’s intervention in Cuba’s war for independence over a century ago.

Before waging what in the U.S. is known as the Spanish-American War in 1898, McKinley promised that “the people of the island of Cuba” would be “free and independent” from Spain and that his government had no “intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over said Island.”

In the end, however, Cuba’s independence from Spain meant domination by the United States.

For 60 years after the Spanish-American War, the White House made repeated military and diplomatic interventions in Cuba, supporting politicians who protected U.S. economic interests in sugar, utilities, banks or tourism and who backed American foreign policy in the Caribbean.

By 1952, when the U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista overthrew President Carlos Prío Socarrás, Cuba’s government had effectively become protectors of American businesses, according to my research. Batista had a warm relationship with both Washington, D.C. and the American organized crime groups that used to control Havana’s tourist industry.

A communist revolution led by Fidel Castro overthrew Batista’s military junta in 1959. Castro decried the “imperialist government of the United States” for turning Cuba into an “American colony.”

The Kennedy administration’s trade embargo against Cuba and the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion – in which the U.S. military trained Cuban dissidents in an attempt to unseat Castro – only pushed Cuba further into the orbit of Soviet Russia.

For the past six decades, the U.S. and Cuba have remained locked in a Cold War, with a brief thaw under President Barack Obama.

Anti-communist coups

Fearing that communism would spread across the hemisphere, the U.S. government repeatedly interfered in the politics of Latin American nations during the Cold War.

In 1954 the CIA worked with elements of the Guatemalan military to overthrow elected President Jacobo Árbenz, whom U.S. policymakers considered dangerously left-wing. Decades of dictatorship and civil war followed, killing an estimated 200,000 people.

A peace agreement in 1996 restored democracy, but Guatemala has yet to recover economically, politically or psychologically from the bloodshed.

Then there is Chile’s U.S.-supported coup d'etat. In 1973, the U.S. government covertly assisted right-wing elements of the Chilean military in overthrowing the socialist president Salvador Allende.

General Augusto Pinochet took power with the quiet financial and political support of the United States. His dictatorship, which lasted until 1990, killed tens of thousands of Chileans.

The Dominican Republic and Panama

U.S. intervention in Latin America did not start or end with the Cold War.

During World War I, the United States was concerned that Germany could use the Dominican Republic as a base of military operations. So American troops occupied the Caribbean island from 1916 to 1924.

Though the American-led administration improved the finances and infrastructure of the Dominican Republic, it also created the national guard that helped to propel Gen. Rafael Trujillo into power. His 30-year reign was savage.

President George H. W. Bush’s 1989 invasion of Panama is the rare exception when U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs actually created stability.

Most Panamanians appear to have supported the 1989 U.S. military operation to remove the corrupt and brutal military strongman Manuel Noriega.

In the years since, Panama has enjoyed comparatively peaceful elections and transfers of power.

Anti-Americanism in Latin America

On balance, though, U.S. military operations in Latin America have rarely brought democracy.

But they have created strong anti-American sentiment in the region, which leftist leaders from Fidel Castro to Hugo Chávez have adeptly harnessed to vilify their political opponents as mere U.S. puppets.

Support for the U.S. government is lower now than it has been in decades. Just 35 percent of Argentines, 39 percent of Chileans and 45 percent of Venezuelans view the U.S. favorably, according to the Pew Research Center.

President Maduro, too, has used anti-imperialist rhetoric. He denounces U.S. sanctions and other efforts to isolate his regime as a “gringo plot.”

A safer way to restore democracy

This history explains why a U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be viewed with skepticism. Though Maduro is unpopular, 65 percent of Venezuelans oppose any foreign military operation to remove Maduro, according to recent polling.

Rather than plan yet another coup d'etat, I believe U.S. efforts in Venezuela should support the work of the Lima Group, a coalition of 12 Latin American countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil, plus Canada.

The Lima Group has ruled out military force in Venezuela. Its pressure campaign to force him out peacefully has included diplomatically isolating his regime and asking Venezuela’s soldiers to pledge loyalty to Guaidó.

A negotiated settlement leading to Maduro’s voluntary departure from office is their ultimate goal.

Regional diplomacy is much slower than foreign intervention. But it avoids further bloodshed and reduces the role of anti-Americanism in Venezuela’s crisis.

It may also open a new chapter in the history of U.S.-Latin American relations – one in which the U.S. takes its lead from the region, and not the other way around.",Venezuela crisis: Trump threats to Maduro evoke bloody history of US intervention in Latin America,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/venezuela-crisis-trump-threats-to-maduro-evoke-bloody-history-of-us-intervention-in-latin-america-111169

“Natural born citizens are naturally citizens because they have only ONE nationality and cannot possibly be anything else.” Not exactly. It is REAL easy to understand. A “natural born citizen” means... Born in the country by TWO citizen parentS. Article II, Section 1, Clause 5: No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. Article XII (the last sentence) “But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.” SIMPLE.

""Softwood lumber wasn't something that was being discussed a lot,"" Higgs told reporters when he landed at the Fredericton airport on Monday after three days in the U.S. capital.

The winter meeting of the governors takes place with hundreds of guests, including leaders from business, non-profits and governments around the world.

Before Higgs left for the meeting, he said he would be willing to give way on the province's forestry policy to help ease some of the punishing tariffs on softwood lumber coming from New Brunswick.

New Brunswick was the only Atlantic province not exempt from softwood lumber tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

Support closer to home

While softwood lumber tariffs were not high on the radar of most people at the Washington meeting, the New England governors were more receptive to the province's plight, Higgs said.

He singled out Janet Mills, the Democratic governor of Maine, who assumed office after last year's mid-term elections.

""She recognizes the sensitivities on both sides of the border,"" said Higgs.

This is what else Premier Blaine Higgs had to say to reporters after his return from Washington on Monday. 0:59

He said the lumber industry in Maine and New Brunswick are heavily integrated and there's a lot of trade between them.

National focus needed

Higgs said he felt the issue has now been raised but he wished Canadians at the Washington meetings had come up with a more national focus for the issue.

""I think B.C. has the large portion of the business, and so it's getting more of a focus and we're being drug into it,"" said Higgs.

In Washington, Higgs planned to meet with David Wilkins, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada and now a lobbyist being paid $40,000 a month by the province to lobby the Trump administration on softwood lumber tariffs.

Higgs said he would decide after meeting with Wilkins whether the province would keep him on, but after returning didn't commit to Wilkins one way or the other.

""[Wilkins] was very helpful, he gave me good information,"" Higgs said.

""He offered obviously to continue his assistance in that regard. I said 'We'll talk more about that.'""",Higgs's softwood lumber pitch falls on indifferent ears in U.S.,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/higgs-returns-from-washington-1.5032579

Vice presi…","The US has announced new sanctions on Caracas and insisted that all options were on the table to oust Nicolas Maduro, as a Republican senator tweeted images showing the death throes of Muammar Gaddafi in an apparent threat to the Venezuelan leader.

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.





Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.",US announces new Venezuela sanctions as Rubio shares 'snuff movie' pictures of Colonel Gaddafi in threat to Maduro,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-announces-venezuela-sanctions-rubio-204529328.html

When future historians write the Internet’s history, Spring 2018 will mark the turning point when regulators stopped giving a fuck about the Internet’s potential as a dynamic, open & innovative platform #FOSTA #GDPR #CCPA 😢😢😢 — Eric Goldman (@ericgoldman) June 29, 2018



If you can’t read it:

When future historians write the Internet’s history, Spring 2018 will mark the turning point when regulators stopped giving a fuck about the Internet’s potential as a dynamic, open & innovative platform #FOSTA #GDPR #CCPA 😢😢😢

This broad dynamic in Internet law didn’t make my top 10 list explicitly (though FOSTA, GDPR and CCPA all rank highly), but it’s a sign of 2018’s historical significance.

#10: Politicians blocking constituents on social media. Politicians love the unfiltered broadcast capability of social media, but some of them hate getting unfiltered constituent feedback. So politicians keep blocking their constituents on social media, and courts keep declaring the blocks unconstitutional. If your job is to represent constituents that you don’t actually want to hear from, find a new line of work.

#9: Competitive keyword lawsuits are stupid…and possibly illegal. Each year I want to declare this topic dead, only to find it keeps cropping up again. Perhaps 2018 will drive the final nail in the coffin due to the FTC’s determination that 1-800 Contacts engaged in anti-competitive practices by systematically restricting its competitors’ ability to bid on its trademarks. Lawsuits over competitive keyword advertising have always been a bad business decision. Now, they are also legally ill-advised.

#8: Internet taxes. In the South Dakota v. Wayfair case, the Supreme Court opened up the door to states taxing online sales by non-residents. If Congress doesn’t intervene, expect a taxation tsunami.

#7: Failure of the lawsuits claiming that social media services support terrorism. Social media providers are not liable for the fact that terrorists use their tools. Nine different courts have confirmed that.

#6: EU Copyright Directive. The EU Copyright Directive has had more dramatic twists than a soap opera. You know the cliche: the good-looking but perpetually self-destructive character who consistently makes poor choices that prompts the audience to scream at the screen, “NOOOO…don’t do it!”

It’s a slight overstatement to say that the EU Copyright Directive’s mandatory filter and link tax would be the death of the Internet. More accurately, the directive would likely only cause the death of the European Internet. The mandatory filter requirement would likely eliminate most user-generated content in Europe. In its place, Europe will actualize the dystopian counterfactual vision of the Internet from the 1990s, when many people expected the Internet to replicate the 1990s cable system, with a few large content owners broadcasting paywalled content to passive viewers. The Internet has evolved into something greater than that, but can it stay that way? Has Europe already planted enough regulatory seeds that the European Internet will inevitably devolve in a cable-style collection of a few large walled gardens, even if the EU Copyright Directive is defeated?

#5: USMCA and Internet Immunity. Section 230 has always been an idiosyncratic American thing, a natural extension of our idiosyncratic First Amendment. So it was remarkable that NAFTA 2.0, the USMCA, embraced Section 230 and exported its pro-free speech policy to Mexico and Canada. Though we’re years away (at best) from Canada or Mexico actually doing anything different, it’s a small glimmer of hope that a user-powered Internet might survive a little longer, even if only in the North American region.

#4: GDPR. The passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act implicitly burnished the GDPR’s reputation as a privacy regulation. As bad as the GDPR is—and it’s bad—the GDPR sometimes looks attractive when compared to the even-more-terrible CCPA. But let’s not over-romanticize the GDPR. It is unquestionably an innovation-killer. It raises significant entry barriers and imposes significant ongoing compliance costs. It ossifies the business environment and privileges existing incumbents over stifled start-ups. I expect we’ll see a steady stream of empirical studies confirming that dynamic. The GDPR has also accelerated the splinternet phenomenon, as businesses outside the EU “opt out” of the GPDR by blocking EU-based users, creating geographically divergent Internets–and realities.

#3: FOSTA. FOSTA is heart-breaking policy because it doesn’t appear to benefit anyone. In ways that were entirely predictable—and predicted—to Congress in advance, FOSTA appears to hurt, rather than help, sex trafficking victims and commercial sex workers, and it shrunk the Internet and undermined free speech. A truly sad outcome for everyone.

#2: California Consumer Privacy Act. The CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in the US, but it was produced by a terrible process that resulted in a predictably terrible law that will hurt the California economy and much more. It never ceases to amaze me how many California privacy lawyers really hate the law—even though they should be the law’s natural allies because they already survived GDPR compliance, plus the CCPA will benefit them financially. The CCPA won’t be fixed because the legislature doesn’t have the capacity or appetite to give it the necessary attention, and some privacy advocates have embraced the law despite its many flaws. Instead, the only remaining way to “fix” the CCPA is with a preemptive federal law, which shouldn’t give you much optimism given Congress’ dysfunction.

#1: Perceived online service bias against “conservatives.” In a “normal” year, the GDPR, FOSTA, and CCPA all would have been strong contenders for #1 on this list. But they were upstaged this year by an even more pernicious regulatory dynamic. Many conservatives believe that Internet services are “biased” against them, and they are fighting back vigorously on multiple fronts, including the courts, legislatures, and Trump’s Twitter timeline. Lawsuits in this genre include Mezey v. Twitter, Dehen v. Doe, Prager U v. Google, Brittain v. Twitter, and Kimbrell v. Twitter. Legislation in this genre include Arkansas Bill HB1028 and a federal bill from Rep. Gohmert, plus numerous confidence-undermining legislative hearings. The perceptions of anti-conservative bias are usually based on a combination of cherry-picked anecdotes and paranoia, so they are dangerously afactual. Furthermore, the Internet services are routinely asked to make sometimes-fine distinctions between “legitimate” “conservative” views that add to the discourse from “illegitimate” discriminatory hate speech that corrode the entire community and should be squelched. Yet, the pity-me persecution complex has the capacity to destroy the Internet. Internet services are already overreacting by treading more cautiously with respect to content that conservatives might support. It’s also accelerating support for legally requiring “neutrality” or “must carry” obligations, which would take away the Internet services’ ability to manage the crazies and thereby destroy the Internet. The Internet needs curation and filtration, but those efforts inevitably lead to accusations of “bias” by someone. We can’t let those accusations win.

Honorable mentions

* The Trump Administration’s terrible information security practices. Hillary Clinton’s alleged bad infosec practices were a signature and likely dispositive issue of the 2016 presidential elections. Yet, Trump and his affiliates have consistently appalling infosec practices, including the use of insecure email servers and insecure cellphones. It’s almost like Hillary was subjected to a double standard.

* End of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality has had nearly as many dramatic twists as the EU Copyright Directive. I’m not sure what the future holds, but I do know that telcos will act like monopolistic pigs if given the chance.

* Daniel v. Armslist. A goofy Wisconsin appellate ruling indicated that Section 230 only applied to defamation cases. The case is now pending before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. I hope they get it right.

* Spanski v TV Polska. One way of reading this case is that online publishers must use geoblocking if they want to avoid copyright liability in foreign countries. Another splinternets case.

* Fox v TVEyes. Copyright owners can shut down online archives if they don’t like being subject to critical scrutiny. A good example of how courts may underappreciate the value and complexity of content aggregation.

* ABS v. CBS. Remastering songs doesn’t reset copyright protection.

* Eichenwald v. Rivello. Perhaps the most interesting case of the year. Can software code sent over the Internet cause a battery? Maybe.

* Music Modernization Act. Most of it was inside baseball, but the law contains an interesting if limited attempt to statutorily accommodate orphan works.

* Goldman v. Breitbart. If this case stands, in-line linking may be doomed.

* Hassell v. Bird. A good Section 230 result rendered inscrutable by Justice Kruger’s swing-vote opinion.

Nine candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new federal Member of Parliament for the riding and all eyes will be on the PPC to see how many votes they take away from the Conservatives, and whether it would be enough to tip the riding toward the Liberals or NDP.

Van Loan, a member of the Conservative Party, announced his retirement in September after 14 years as the representative of the riding — long considered a Tory stronghold.

Scot Davidson, the new Conservative Party candidate, said he's feeling confident.

""This is really a referendum on the Liberal government,"" said Davidson, a local entrepreneur from the town of Georgina.

Today, byelections will be held in ridings across the country including York–Simcoe in Ontario, Outremont in Quebec and Burnaby South in B.C. (CBC)

The York-Simcoe riding was one of three federal byelections called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Jan. 9.

Davidson has positioned himself as a businessman looking to apply his skills in helping industries grow, with a keen interest in supporting agriculture.

""Let's face it, this riding being so close to Toronto is a place where farmers themselves want to expand and look at even food processing. It's something that I can bring to the table and help facilitate,"" Davidson said.

He says he's not worried about being new to politics but rather sees it as an asset, insisting that he has ""young legs, I'm ready to run.""

Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka went head-to-head against Van Loan in the last federal election but fell short.

This time, the mother of two says she's back and has a better chance than ever.

""We increased the Liberal voter turnout by 400 per cent,"" she told CBC News, referring to the last federal election.

""When I asked the family whether I should take this on again because it's a big ask of the entire family, the boys said to me, 'You totally should, because this time you're going to win.'""

Shaun Tanaka is hopeful the headway she made in 2015's federal election will result in a Liberal upset this time around. (CBC)

Tanaka said she isn't worried about the SNC Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the prime minister.

""I am really focused on York-Simcoe, because that's where I'm running. And I'm not hearing it at the doors,"" she said.

""What I'm hearing at the doors [is] that it's hard to raise a family. I'm hearing at the doors that they are concerned about the health of Lake Simcoe,"" said Tanaka, adding that ""I want to be that voice in Ottawa.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she can be the voice of the local working class who are struggling. (Jessa McLean)

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she's the voice of the working class.

""We have a lot of precariously employed people,"" she said. ""Our job market is, either you're commuting [to the city] for a half decent paying job or you're staying here and earning very little.""

She's a community organizer in the region and a champion of the ""$15 and Fairness"" campaign to push the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

""Our housing rates have gone up the most in terms of Ontario,"" she said.

""Rentals are up 56 per cent while our wages are only up 11 per cent.""

People's Party of Canada debut

This byelection is also the PPC's debut at the polls, and an out-of-towner — ex-Toronto prosecutor Robert Geurts — is its candidate.

""The project right now is to get the word out. We are a national party,"" he said.

Robert Geurts of the People's Party of Canada says a lot of this campaign has to do with spreading the word of the new party's existence. (CBC News)

Ex-conservative MP Maxime Bernier founded the party after losing the federal Conservative leadership nod to Andrew Scheer.

""Scot Davidson has no plan really to change anything. He's going to stick to Mr. Scheer's plan,"" said Geurts, explaining their focus on courting millennial voters.

""That generation is so bright, and so exciting. [They] haven't been corrupted yet,"" he said.

""That's where I think Bernier has sort of said, 'Listen, our platform is unfinished because there's some really exciting things we can do if we don't burden ourselves with the old baggage of before.""'

Monday's byelection comes three months after municipal elections and six months before the federal election in October.

WASHINGTONIn the yearbook photo of the 1981 graduating class at Westmount High School near Montreal, the left hand of a beaming Kamala Harris is resting on the right shoulder of Hugh Kwok.

When Kwok was asked in December for his thoughts on his old pals potential run, he answered a reporters question with a question.

Shes running for president of what? he asked in a tone that suggested he thought the answer might be the local Rotary Club.

Informed that it was the presidency of the United States, his voice rose. No way. Oh my goodness. I cant believe it, he said. Then he decided he was supportive of this idea.

We could use a good president, he said. She was a sweet, kind person. Very happy, very social. Im just very excited for her, if thats what she wants to do with her life..

This is at least the fourth consecutive presidential election in which a major candidate has had family ties to Canada. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who lost the Republican primary to Donald Trump in 2016, was born in Calgary. Former president Barack Obama has a brother-in-law from Burlington.

Eyal Dattel, a human resources director in Vancouver, said he recalls his drama classmate as always a truly nice person and now sees her as an ideal candidate for a progressive future. (snip...)

In my opinion, shed be a great president, because shes fair, he said.

John Dila, a Harris classmate who is now a Harris constituent as a businessman on the California startup scene, said the Westmount students of the day regularly discussed politics.

(Snip...)Dila, who praised Harris at length, said he thinks she understands policy issues better than American colleagues who have had narrower life experiences.

To: Pete from Shawnee Mission

It’s okay, they catch them upstream from the sewage outflow and the current is strong. Just don’t order fish the next time you’re in Sorel, Trois-Rivieres etc. So more generally, I had a quick look at her bio, she spent her high school years in Canada after her parents divorced, and returned to the USA for university. To be honest, it probably wouldn’t make any difference, most of the Democratic politicians educated at big city U.S. high schools were probably exposed to ritual lib-left views on American politics, whereas in Montreal, Kamala Harris would have been exposed to almost no views on American politics, such courses as she might have taken would have concentrated mostly on Canadian politics and history. Our kids in Canada are not taught very much about America at all, they might know the basic facts about the division of powers and large-scale U.S. history but I only got into that sort of reading in university, those were subjects never really mentioned in high school. So what I’m saying is, she won’t be any weaker than the field as a result, it’s probably a net positive to have avoided the liberal spin of American high school teachers. She doesn’t sound like the worst candidate either, I would prefer her to Bernie or Beto if there had to be one who won. However, I suppose the more important question is, who would be easiest for Trump to beat? There again, would prefer Bernie or Beto. As to the high school being diverse, hmm, maybe they put all the “students of color” on one page? Montreal in the 1980s was not as multicultural as it is nowadays, a lot of Haitians moved there after the 2010 disaster, but it is a largely francophone city with European immigrant groups like Greeks and Italians more than what you might expect to find in Toronto or Vancouver which have large Asian communities (meaning Chinese and Indo, mostly). Westmount is a ritzy inside-the-city enclave (a separate municipality from Montreal) which is also the original home of Pierre Trudeau. Kamala Harris’s mother went there to work at some medical research place associated with the university and big hospitals. Montreal is a leading health research centre. I doubt that much of the outside-Westmount Canadian culture rubbed off on them, it tends to be one of those places where people believe the sun shines from their derrieres and all should bow down and worship. For evidence, take our current glorious leader up here.

His position on the Collegium of the University of St. Michael’s College was one vehicle through which Rosica exerted a deep influence on Catholic public life in Canada.

Rosica has been one of the church’s key communicator to the country at large, especially on papal affairs like elections and visits, and recently helped the Vatican communicate to media at its summit on youth protection. He is also founding CEO of the religious television channel Salt and Light.

Neither the Vatican Dicastery for Communications nor Salt and Light have replied to invitations to comment on his admission to the National Post that he presented other people’s words as his own in various newspapers and publications, including the Salt and Light website and the Post itself.

He admitted this kind of behaviour is dishonest, and said in an interview that it was wrong, but in the absence of a fuller public explanation, he has been criticized on Twitter for appearing to blame interns and other subordinates who helped with his writing.

In a written statement to the Post last week, he said: “If there was an error on my part, it is that I have often relied on others who have generously helped me in my preparation of various texts and I did not do the necessary checking into sources, etc. I regret that. It was never willfully done.”

He said he failed to thoroughly review his writings and cite sources because of “urgent media requests.”

Rev. Donald McLeod, chair of the Collegium, said Rosica made “significant contributions” to the school, which has an undergraduate program and a graduate theology faculty.

“Over the weekend, I received and have respectfully accepted his resignation from the Collegium,” he said.

We embrace our brother despite this failing for which he has taken full responsibility

In a statement, Kevin Storey, Superior General of the Basilian Fathers, which founded the school, said: “Plagiarism of any kind is wrong. When it is committed knowingly it rises to the level of a moral offense. As a community of Catholic educators we condemn it, without qualification.”

“At the same time, we embrace our brother despite this failing for which he has taken full responsibility. With him, we apologize to those who have been offended by the misuse of their literary gifts,” he said.

The Jesuits of Canada also announced Monday they had withdrawn an invitation for Rosica ro receive their Magis Award at an upcoming gala.

“Plagiarism is a grave offense against intellectual honesty and the community of scholarship,” the congregation said in a statement.

America Shouldn't Invade Venezuela

Venezuela has been in crisis for years. Now President Donald Trump has made Venezuela’s problems America’s problems.

Two decades ago Hugo Chávez successfully challenged a collectivist, kleptocratic political system which enriched the country’s elite. But he created a quasi-dictatorship staffed by Cuban security agents and wrecked the economy by imposing real socialism and handing control to corrupt apparatchiks. Chávez even destroyed the state petroleum company by turning it into a lucrative source of patronage.

The situation deteriorated further under Chávez’s successor, President Nicolás Maduro. Today both food and medicine are increasingly difficult to find. Even Venezuela’s poor, who propelled Chávez into power, have given up on his bungling, charisma-challenged successor.

Last year President Trump threatened to invade Venezuela. He backed down, but recently launched a vigorous campaign for regime change through diplomatic and economic pressure. America’s great hope is in opposition leader Juan Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, who declared himself to be Venezuela’s legitimate president. If Guaidó’s campaign fails, war remains “an option,” declared the president.

That might be a bluff, intended to intimidate Maduro and his supporters. However, if President Trump is serious, the consequences could be disastrous for both Venezuela and the United States.

The former is a tragedy on multiple levels. Like many Latin American political systems, it long enshrined great economic injustice. In 1992 Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chávez staged a coup. Despite some popular support it failed and he was imprisoned. But he was soon pardoned and in 1998 was elected president, serving until his death in 2013.

His “Bolivarian Revolution” was authoritarian and socialist, with predictable results. Mass nationalization, uncontrolled spending, and political interference ensured long-term economic disaster. For a time oil revenue funded social programs, sustaining popular support. He also shared his regime’s largesse overseas—providing subsidized petroleum shipments to Cuba’s Castro dictatorship, for instance. However, oil revenue declined as his maladministration hobbled PDVSA, the state-run energy company, and petroleum prices dropped.

Vice President Maduro replaced Chávez, but the Maduro lacked any hint of charisma or competence. The economy was cut by half over his six years in power and is expected to shrink another quarter this year alone. The latest annual inflation estimate—the regime stopped releasing economic statistics—is an incredible 1.7 million percent. Nine out of ten people fall below the poverty line. Stores are empty. Every day 80,000 people cross into Colombia seeking provisions. An expectant mother turned border street vendor explained: “in Venezuela there is nothing.” Yet President Maduro rejected offers of humanitarian aid, insisting that there is no crisis and “we are not beggars.” So far some three million people, a tenth of the population, have fled, and more are leaving every day.

Four out of five Venezuelans, including even many “Chavistas” and working-class supporters of Chávez’s “Bolivarian Revolution,” want him gone. Maduro maintains control through increasing repression and electoral manipulation. His last lines of defense are his core allies (who in recent years have looted the economy to the tune of $350 billion), his puppets in the National Assembly, and a thousand-plus Cuban operatives, long embedded in his government.

Maduro should go. Actually, straight to jail. But the Trump administration-led campaign seems designed to fail.

Even successful regime change won’t necessarily turn out well. By one count, Washington pursued sixty-eight attempts at regime change in different countries since 1945. Most failed, and even successful operations often yielded dubious results.

But getting rid of Maduro won’t be easy. Washington lacks credibility as a disinterested actor dedicated to the good of the Venezuelan people. Alas, Americans well-earned their reputation for “Yankee imperialism” through more than a century of military intervention in Latin America. Skeptics of Washington’s purported humanitarian intentions point to Venezuela’s 301 billion barrel oil reserves as a rich prize for American companies. Even many critics of Maduro do not back the U.S. campaign to oust the incumbent regime: a poll last month found 78 percent of Venezuelans opposed international intervention.

Threats of war have intensified regional skepticism. James Stavridis, the former North Atlantic Treaty Organization Supreme Allied Commander, said, “everywhere I went as a four-star Admiral in [Latin America] while commanding U.S Southern Command, I would be reminded of America’s history of intervention.” Even Brazil and Colombia were “deeply suspicious” of the creation of the Fourth Fleet in 2008, which was seen not as a tool for use in such tasks as drug interdiction and humanitarian relief, but as “a return to gunboat diplomacy and a prelude to military action in Venezuela.”

By taking the lead, the Trump administration has become an issue. Rallying people against outside pressure is a time-honored international tactic, especially by populist Latin American regimes. Some Venezuelans will choose local thugs over foreign meddlers. Moreover, Washington’s high-profile effort has encouraged Russia and China to rally to Maduro’s side. Their support will be limited but could help the regime survive.

Indeed, the administration will undermine attempts to employ the rule of international law in other cases. The U.S. claim that it is justified in breaking international rules, argued Representative Ro Khanna (D-Cal.), “is the same argument that led to U.S. blunders in Iraq, Honduras, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. Again and again, there is no respect for the United Nations Charter that makes it illegal under international law to seek regime change.”

Washington hopes to starve the Venezuelan people. The Trump administration sanctioned PDVSA to dry up oil revenues keeping the government and country afloat. (Petroleum sales provide more than 95 percent of Venezuela’s export earnings.) The Trump administration also turned Venezuelan state property over to the nascent Guaidó “government.”

Unfortunately, tougher economic controls are unlikely to force the regime to yield. Reducing the Maduro regime’s money will hurt it, but probably not enough to cripple it. Sanctions also will reduce funds available for the Venezuelan public, since the government controls most trade. However, Maduro and his allies will take care of themselves first. Complained Jose Bodas, an anti-Maduro union leader: “The rich will not stop getting richer, it’s the workers who will shoulder the cost of these measures.”

Starving the already suffering, whose vigorous opposition so far has failed to budge the regime, in hopes of fomenting a more effective uprising is a dubious strategy on both practical and moral grounds. Luis Vicente Leon, who heads the political consulting firm Datanalisis, said: “If this strategy isn’t successful quickly, the effect on the people will be devastating.” Unsurprisingly, eight of ten Venezuelans oppose U.S. sanctions.

Washington hopes that Maduro’s backers will end his reign, but their survival is tied to his. Most importantly, the military leadership, which Chávez transformed after the short-lived coup against him in 2002, has prospered along with the regime. Even if the Chavista elite decided to send Maduro packing, there is no reason to believe it would hand the keys to the kingdom to Guaidó or organize free elections.

Regime fractures might lead to civil war, with multiple contending factions. The outcome is impossible to predict. Although Guaidó unexpectedly unified the highly fractious opposition, he leans toward the socialist end of the economic spectrum. Some groups on the right complain that his Popular Will party is a member of the Socialist International. A bloody collapse might satisfy the Trump administration but could intensify the suffering of the Venezuelan population.

If the administration fails to oust Maduro through diplomacy and sanctions, it will suffer a major public relations embarrassment. Warned Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and former Obama administration official Ben Rhodes: “Chest-thumping declarations that melt away over time weaken American power and credibility.” But Washington has no apparent alternative if the Maduro regime doesn’t fold. Worried Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue: “My concern is whether they’ve boxed themselves in.” An impasse would encourage the president to act militarily.

Yet nothing justifies war. Vice President Mike Pence recently declared that “For the sake of our vital interests, and for the sake of the Venezuelan people, America will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.” However, what vital American interest can he identify? There is none.

Admiral Craig Faller, head of the United State Southern Command, announced that “We are prepared to protect U.S. lives and protect the diplomatic facility in Venezuela.” However, Washington is keeping American diplomats on station as an explicit provocation. The Maduro government ordered U.S. personnel home, but the administration refused to comply. Washington may hope for an incident to justify military action. There also has been talk of using American military forces to move humanitarian aid into Venezuela, daring the Maduro government to block the effort. This would constitute the foreign policy equivalent of entrapment, enticing Caracas to take a step providing a casus belli.

Moreover, Fernando Cutz, who formerly served on the staff of the National Security Council, argued: “I don’t think you can underestimate the threat of a failed state very close to our borders.” Venezuela’s crisis certainly is bad for the country’s South American neighbors. However, the United States would hardly notice. Would millions of refugees swim the Caribbean and overrun Florida? Would al-Qaeda set up shop in anarchic Caracas? War-happy American officials routinely claim “vital interests” where none exist.

The Venezuelan people are suffering, but so are the peoples of Eritrea, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, Egypt, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, and many more nations. Ironically, Washington supports, aids, and comforts the oppressor in several of these cases. In others, the Trump administration simply ignores friends acting badly. Nothing occurring in Venezuela justifies America embarking upon another war of choice.

Fear that the administration is inclined toward war caused Senate Democrats to insist that any resolution backing Guaidó include explicit disapproval of U.S. military action. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) refused the accept the measure with such a prohibition. “The U.S. always reserves the right on use force and protect its own national security interest and the interest of its personnel. So anything that would run counter to that would be problematic.” But he is being disingenuous since he routinely treats military action as a first resort.

Venezuela’s Guaidó suggested that he might come to welcome, even “authorize,” U.S. military action, though that “is not the form we hope for and believe in.” He also suggested that all options are on the table, the standard mantra of American officials who threaten war, and later argued that if the Maduro government blocked delivery of outside aid, that military intervention would be warranted under the UN “responsibility to protect” doctrine. However, as Representative Ro Khanna (D-Ca.) responded: “Mr. Guaidó, you can proclaim yourself leader of Venezuela but you don’t get to authorize U.S. military interventions. Only the U.S. Congress can do that. We will not.” And it should not.

Initiating another war of choice simply because the United States could do so would further unbalance American foreign policy. These days policymakers find it difficult to resist the temptation to use America’s overwhelming military power even though consequences are routinely ill. War should be a genuine last resort.

Secretary of State and later President John Quincy Adams appeared to foresee our world when he warned Americans not to go “abroad, in search of monsters to destroy” lest they risk their nation’s soul. The U.S. “might become the dictatress of the world” and “be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.” Which would be too high a price to pay.

The president appears to believe that an invasion would be easy, last year arguing that “It’s a regime that frankly could be toppled very quickly by the military, if the military decides to do that.” But believing the next war to be a cakewalk is a far too common mistake made by overly-optimistic political leaders. Most wars turn out far different and more costly than expected. For instance, in 1812 House Speaker Henry Clay declared that conquering Canada would be “a mere matter of marching.” More than two centuries later, of course, America’s northern neighbor remains free.

The only recent Latin American precedent was the 1989 invasion of Panama. However, circumstances were significantly different: a much smaller nation, ruled by a dictator with little popular backing, containing the U.S.-constructed canal long controlled by Washington. American troops already were stationed there, and the local government had killed several U.S. civilians.

The Maduro regime obviously would lose any conflict. Its armed services have suffered from years of economic crisis. Chávez purged potentially dissident officers in order to coup-proof the military, meaning trustworthiness trumped competence. Moreover, the army became a source of patronage and bulges with useless generals.

Nevertheless, there are capable units—special forces, airborne, and counter-insurgency, for instance. Admiral Faller told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Venezuelan military, though a “degraded force,” nevertheless “remains loyal to Maduro—and that makes it dangerous.” Moreover, the civil militia has an official membership of 1.6 million. Just last month 86 percent of Venezuelans said they opposed foreign military action. Invaders might not find themselves hailed as liberators even by those hoping for an end to Maduro’s misrule.

Urban resistance could prove difficult to quell, especially by soldiers dispersed into guerrilla units. Resistance also could turn into a civil war, further inflaming social divisions which would make fixing Venezuela even tougher. Having broken Venezuela with an invasion, America would feel great pressure to occupy and rebuild it.

Through this process, the Chavistas might shift blame for their misrule onto their new occupiers. Washington would own the results of its war. American support would undermine the new government’s legitimacy. And ousting Maduro would not resolve the underlying political conflicts which triggered Chávez’s rise. Overall, the costs of exercising the military option are obvious; the benefits less so.

Unfortunately, as time passes Washington appears to have another potential foreign policy debacle in the making. Guaidó’s announcement led to expectations of a speedy denouement: sanctions would crush the regime, military elites would defect and defenestrate Maduro, Chavista elites would accept the offer of amnesty and depart, and a new regime would emerge, fulfilling American objectives. Increasingly a peaceful U.S. victory appears unlikely.

Alas, no one, it seems, has an alternative approach. Reported Bloomberg: “U.S. policymakers and those around Guaidó—as well as leaders in Brazil and Colombia—are eying one another and worrying about failure. Officials in each camp have said privately they assumed the others had a more developed strategy.”

Evidently not. The situation would have the makings of comedy sitcom if the stakes weren’t so high. So now what?

Washington should lower its expectations and step back, leaving regime transformation to Venezuelans and their neighbors. Most important, President Trump should keep the troops at home. Simón Bolívar, the heroic revolutionary who liberated Venezuela from Spain, long ago intoned: “when tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right.” But in this case, that right should be exercised by Venezuelans, not Americans.

The United States also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking that body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The US Treasury Department's sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as US Vice President Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored to the oil-rich nation. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA's assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro's ""henchmen"" to Guaido's government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming.

""In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks,"" Pence said. ""We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.""

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the ""massacre"" of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as US-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider ""all options"" in ousting Maduro.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region's other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president.

Washington wants the 15-member UN Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela's energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup against the OPEC member.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro's government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as ""trochas"" generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as ""trocheros.""

""We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,"" said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. ""We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.""

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the US Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Lacava goes by the nickname ""Dracula"" in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos.

The Security Council returned today to the political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela for the second time in as many months, with speakers debating whether to press for free and fair elections under international supervision or to encourage the Government of President Nicolás Maduro to open dialogue with the opposition, free of external interference.

Nearly 40 Member States participated in today’s meeting, including Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela’s Minister of the People’s Power for Foreign Affairs, who accused the United States of using humanitarian assistance as a cover for aggression. He also called upon the Council to adopt a resolution rejecting the use of force, or the threat of such use, against his country.

Briefing members at the outset of the meeting, Rosemary DiCarlo, Under‑Secretary‑General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, described “an alarming escalation of tensions” since she last briefed the Council on 26 January (see Press Release SC/13680). Citing last weekend’s violence on Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Brazil, and the scale of the unfolding humanitarian crisis, she reiterated the Secretary-General’s appeal for calm and restraint.

“Much more remains to be done to address the extremely urgent needs of the Venezuelan people,” she said, emphasizing that the United Nations stands ready to expand its efforts, in accordance with humanitarian principles and working with Venezuelan institutions to help those in need. The Secretary-General is prepared to exercise his good offices if the parties so wish. “Venezuelan actors across the political spectrum have the responsibility to put the interests of the Venezuelan people at the centre of their actions at this most critical time,” she stressed.

In the ensuing debate, Elliott Abrams, Special Representative for Venezuela of the United States — whose delegation requested the meeting — said President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela is dancing as people are dying. While claiming that the delivery of aid is a cover for political intervention, his regime is using violence, including by armed gangs, against the Venezuelan people, he added. The United States and many other countries support democracy and call for humanitarian assistance for Venezuelans, he noted, emphasizing that free, fair elections and Mr. Guaidó’s safe and swift return are the answer to the tyranny. “The people of Venezuela need our solidarity and help,” he said. “Let us resolve to give them that help.”

By contrast, the Russian Federation’s representative said the Council should not be focusing on the situation “in” Venezuela, but rather the situation “around” it. What occurred on the Colombian border on 23 February was not an attempt to deliver aid, but to breach the frontier of an independent State, he said, stressing: “If the United States wanted to deliver aid, it would do so through an international aid agency.” Proposing a way forward, he said Venezuela’s people must resolve their own problems through solutions based on respect for national sovereignty. He recalled that, following a recent Security Council statement expressing concern about demonstrations in Haiti, Council members pledged to work with that country’s Government to address pressing issues. Perhaps the United States and other Council members would support a similar text for Venezuela, he suggested.

Foreign Minister Arreaza of Venezuela said it is fitting for the Council to address the international aggression faced by his country’s people. Without a doubt, such aggression threatens regional and international peace and stability, he added, noting also that it also violates the Charter of the United Nations. He went on to criticize Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo’s briefing as biased, insisting that his country’s security forces used no deadly force during last weekend’s border incidents. “The coup failed”, and now is the time to return to sanity and to respect international law and Venezuela’s Constitution, he asserted. The Government is now waiting to sit down with the opposition to decide Venezuela’s future without interference from anyone, most of all the United States, he said, expressing hope that the White House will give Mr. Guaidó its approval to begin talks.

Peru’s delegate cited the Lima Group Declaration, saying it reflects the Latin America and Caribbean region’s awareness of the crisis. Noting that the situation, exacerbated by massive migration, is affecting the region’s stability, he emphasized that Venezuelans themselves must carry out a transition to democracy without using force. Peru calls for the holding of free and fair elections under international monitoring mechanisms, he added.

Cuba’s representative said the United States is fabricating pretexts for military aggression against Venezuela. Emphasizing the importance of acknowledging the country’s national elections of May 2018, he said the Governments trying to deliver humanitarian aid are the same ones exerting pressure for regime change. Reaffirming Cuba’s support for President Maduro, she stressed that peace and security in Latin America must be defended and upheld.

Colombia’s representative, citing this week’s meeting of the Lima Group as a good example of multilateral action, emphasized the impact of Venezuela’s situation on his own country. There is urgent need to provide humanitarian assistance to the country’s people, he said, adding that the dictatorship there has ceased to think about its own population.

Bolivia’s delegate urged the Council to pay close attention to the assertion by the United States that “all options are on the table”. Such a policy has proven tragic for many countries in the region, he said, recalling the invasions of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama and Haiti. It also awakens memories of the Iran-Contra affair, the Monroe Doctrine and the decision by the United States to post photos of Muammar al-Qadhafi’s assassination on Twitter, he added.

Nicaragua’s representative said he was appalled by the threats issued by some members, emphasizing that aggression and hostility must end. People must be able to choose their own future, he added, stressing: “We have opted for peace and not war.” Nicaragua welcomes international efforts to defend and uphold international law. Underlining his country’s support for President Maduro, he declared: “We must know how to choose a life with respect and uphold the nobility of our soul.”

Mexico’s representative said any humanitarian concern must be addressed through neutral international organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or agencies of the United Nations.

Also speaking today were representatives of France, Dominican Republic, Belgium, Poland, South Africa, Kuwait, Germany, Indonesia, Côte d’Ivoire, China, United Kingdom, Equatorial Guinea, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, Suriname (on behalf of several members of the Caribbean Community), Paraguay, Uruguay, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Canada, Belize, Ecuador, Antigua and Barbuda, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica and Dominica.

The meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 7:58 p.m.

Briefing

ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, noted “an alarming escalation of tensions” in Venezuela since her last briefing to the Council a month ago. The United States and other countries stockpiled food and medical supplies on that country’s borders with Colombia and Brazil, while the Russian Federation and China delivered supplies to Venezuela in coordination with the latter’s Government, she said. Violence broke out when Venezuelan security forces blocked efforts led by Juan Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, to bring food and medicine into the country and two trucks attempting to cross the border were set on fire, she added. Colombian immigration authorities said at least 285 people were injured on their side of the frontier, whereas Brazilian indigenous groups supporting the Venezuelan opposition on the border met resistance when attempting to deliver aid. Between 22 and 23 February, four deaths were confirmed near the Brazilian border and 64 people were injured, most of them by gunshots, she said, citing the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which also received reports pointing to the involvement of pro-Government armed elements in violent attacks against protesters.

She went on to recall the Secretary-General’s statement of 23 February, in which he expressed shock and sadness at the violence and loss of life while reiterating his appeal that lethal force not be used under any circumstances. For its part, OHCHR condemned the violent scenes on the two borders, as well as the excessive use of force by Venezuela’s security forces, she said, urging the Government to rein in proxy groups and arrest those using force against protesters. Emphasizing the Secretary-General’s concern at the humanitarian situation, she said it is difficult to assess the situation in the absence of official data. However, available information depicts a grim reality, with the economy deteriorating, many people dying of preventable causes and others leaving the country. Citing civil society groups, she said maternal mortality rates have increased by more than 50 per cent since 2017. Approximately 80 per cent of hospitals lack required medicine and 30 to 40 per cent of medical personnel have left Venezuela, in addition to an estimated 3.4 million other people, she said.

The United Nations system is working with relevant State institutions and other entities to address those challenges, she continued. Since 2018, the Organization has been implementing a scaled-up effort focused on saving lives, economic recovery, preventing conflict and protecting human rights. Emphasizing that delivery of assistance is guided by General Assembly resolution 46/182 as well as the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, she said it must be free of political objectives and delivered on the basis of need. “Much more remains to be done to address the extremely urgent needs of the Venezuelan people,” she said, adding that the United Nations stands ready to expand its efforts, in accordance with humanitarian principles and working with Venezuelan institutions to help those in need. The Secretary-General is ready to exercise his good offices if the parties wish him to do so, she stated, adding: “Venezuelan actors across the political spectrum have the responsibility to put the interests of the Venezuelan people at the centre of their actions at this most critical time.”

Statements

ELLIOT ABRAMS, Special Representative for Venezuela of the United States , said that today’s meeting is the result of President Maduro’s decision to prevent humanitarian assistance from entering Venezuela, which led to four people dying and more than 80 others being injured. Indeed, Maduro is dancing while people are suffering and dying, he said, adding that, while claiming that aid delivery is a cover for political intervention, his regime is using violence, including by armed gangs, and betraying the Venezuelan people. As he continues to politicize aid, any further time he spends in power will be to oppress the people at a time when televised reports show children picking through garbage, he said, describing the situation as a grim reflection of the sad plight of millions of Venezuelans. The United States, alongside many other countries, supports democracy and calls for humanitarian assistance for the Venezuelan people, he said, emphasizing that free, fair elections and Mr. Guaidó’s safe and swift return are the answer to the tyranny. Calling upon the Security Council to play its role in meeting the growing needs of Venezuelans, he also asked all Member States to help them address the current humanitarian situation. “The people of Venezuela need our solidarity and help,” he stressed. “Let us resolve to give them that help.”

GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA ( Peru ) recalled the Lima Group’s recent declaration reflecting regional awareness of the crisis in Venezuela, noting that the current situation, exacerbated by massive migration, is affecting stability in the region. Peru, host to 700,000 Venezuelan migrants, remains committed to demonstrating its solidarity with them, he said, pointing out that more than 80 per cent of those remaining in Venezuela are experiencing food insecurity and lack of basic services while facing arbitrary detention and indiscriminate violence by armed groups in the Maduro regime’s service. The transition to democracy must be carried out by Venezuelans themselves, without the use of force, he emphasized, calling for free and fair elections to be held under international monitoring mechanisms. The current regime’s lack of commitment to a peaceful solution is clear, he said, calling for an end to the oppression of Venezuelans. Meanwhile, it is necessary to maintain ties with the Maduro regime with a view to holding elections and finding a peaceful solution to the crisis, he emphasized.

FRANÇOIS DELATTRE ( France ) noted that after the Maduro regime’s forces killed and injured unarmed citizens at the border, hundreds of Venezuelan soldiers chose to defect rather than attack their own people. The political and humanitarian crisis is no accident, but a result of the regime’s multiple violations of international law, he said, emphasizing that, as a result, President Maduro has no legitimacy and Mr. Guaidó should organize new presidential elections. He called upon the regime to demonstrate humanity and facilitate access for United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations with the aim of relieving the people’s suffering. “Each minute that we lose costs lives,” he said, stressing: “Venezuela is currently on the edge of an abyss.” He added: “Our responsibility is to give Venezuelans a voice and help them restore democracy.”

JOSÉ SINGER WEISINGER ( Dominican Republic ) said holding free and fair elections in a climate of respect for human rights and international support is the only way forward, emphasizing the need to foster trust in order to arrive at that goal. Noting that other countries in the region are hosting millions of Venezuelans fleeing the instability, he cautioned that accommodating such large numbers could, in fact, destabilize the host countries. He went on to cite reports of foreign planes using bases in the region, noting that the Cuban and Venezuelan authorities said aircraft are landing in Santo Domingo. Reiterating his delegation’s position that military interventions will not resolve the crisis, he described such reports as false and expressed hope that those leading this “disinformation campaign” will issue corrections. Expressing regret over the recent border clashes and the spiralling negative rhetoric, he expressed Peru’s wish that Venezuelans will take an active part in shaping their own future.

MAC PECSTEEN DE BUYTSWERVE ( Belgium ) said the situation constitutes a threat to the region, and to prevent it from worsening, all actors must work towards a peaceful solution while avoiding violence at all costs. He called upon the parties to exercise restraint, provide humanitarian access and organize elections, while encouraging all actors to do everything possible to reduce tensions, including by ensuring press freedoms. He also called upon all actors to facilitate aid deliveries, stressing that it is unacceptable for irregular armed groups to intimidate civilians mobilizing to distribute assistance. He urged swift action to organize elections, pointing out the political origins of the current crisis while emphasizing that the solution must also political, with Venezuelans deciding their own future.

JOANNA WRONECKA ( Poland ) condemned the indiscriminate and excessive use of force by Venezuelan security forces and pro-Maduro armed groups against unarmed protesters. Warning that violence can spiral out of control and further complicate the multidimensional conflict, she emphasized: “Because of the political origin of this conflict, we strongly believe that the solution to it can only be political as well.” Reiterating Poland’s recognition of National Assembly President Guadió as the only legitimate power in Venezuela, she said the oppressive Maduro regime created the unprecedented migration and humanitarian crises that have had such tremendous consequences on neighbouring Latin American countries. “No matter how eloquently and passionately representatives of Maduro will deny it, the humanitarian catastrophe in Venezuela is real and its citizens are in dire need of urgent humanitarian aid,” she stressed.

JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA ( South Africa ) said the Council is divided on the internal affairs of a fellow Member State, with some even threatening to use force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Venezuela. This is inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations. Africa has suffered a great deal as external forces used undemocratic tools of regime change to solve problems on the continent. “Let the people of Venezuela decide their future,” he said. South Africa draws from its experience in using dialogue to overcome a repressive and insidious racist regime, and believes that internal, inclusive discussion remains the only viable and sustainable path to ending the political crisis in Venezuela. The Council should base its efforts on Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, where parties are encouraged to first seek a solution through a peaceful means of their choice.

MANSOUR AYYAD SH. A. ALOTAIBI ( Kuwait ) said those responsible for deplorable acts must be held to account, emphasizing that stakeholders must uphold international law and human rights while respecting the will of Venezuela’s people. Expressing concern about the humanitarian situation, he congratulated those countries hosting Venezuelans who have fled their country, urging all stakeholders to help those in need without discrimination or politicization. Calling for restraint and the prevention of further bloodshed, he urged the Secretary-General to use his good offices to bring about a political solution so as to avert instability in the region.

CHRISTOPH HEUSGEN ( Germany ) said that political factors led to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela and therefore the solution can only be a political one, rejecting the use of force or any measures that could put the stability of the country and the region at risk. Calling for the restoration of the democratic process and constitutional order of Venezuela through free, transparent and credible presidential elections, he said it is high time to let the country’s people freely choose their leaders and the future path of their nation. Warning against the politicization of the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Venezuelans in need, he said a response to humanitarian needs does not constitute an interference with the country’s internal affairs. With 3.4 million people seeking shelter in neighboring countries, the situation affects the region. Human rights are not an internal affair, but a “common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations”.

MUHSIN SYIHAB ( Indonesia ) said that his country supports the Montevideo Mechanism, which seeks to preserve peace in Venezuela based on the principle of non-interference and peaceful resolution of conflicts. He urged the delivery of all humanitarian aid for the people of Venezuela through a proper channel by the United Nations in close coordination with the Government. Too often, the Council has failed in its mandate because of narrowly motivated interests that have been allowed to prevail over those of the most vulnerable. The failure of this organ has severely impaired its credibility in the eyes of the international community. His delegation hopes that Venezuela will be able to peacefully overcome this crisis.

GBOLIÉ DÉSIRÉ WULFRAN IPO ( C ôte d’Ivoire ), noting with regret the unfortunate events on the Colombian and Brazilian borders, emphasized that humanitarian assistance, regardless of the source, must reach those who need it. Calling upon all sides to demonstrate restraint and seek a political solution through dialogue, he said what is happening in Venezuela is essentially a political and institutional issue, stressing that it there can be no military solution. He urged negotiations with a view to generating consensus-based solutions to the root causes of the crisis, underlining the need for regional actors to support all peaceful initiatives likely to ease tensions.

VASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) emphasized that the meeting’s focus should not be the situation “in” Venezuela, but the situation “around” Venezuela, since the United States has taken steps into the region, incited opposition leaders to withdraw from the previous Venezuelan elections and recognized, within minutes, the naming of Juan Guaidó as interim President. These and other similar acts trample the law and constitutional rights, he said, adding that it is clear to all that no judge or court of law will sign on to this “mockery”. Meanwhile, the United States imposed sanctions that have caused grave economic losses for Venezuela and is now conducting an operation to transfer unknown materials into that country while using civilians as human shields, he said. Video images of the events of 23 February show people moving from Colombian territory in an aggressive manner, he noted, describing the scenario as anything but the delivery of humanitarian aid. Instead, it was an attempted breach of an independent State’s borders, he said, stressing that, in fact, one country wishes to build a barrier to keep people from crossing its border. “Let us call a spade a spade,” he said, adding: “This is not humanitarian aid.” He stressed: “If the United States wanted to deliver aid, it would do so through an international aid agency.”

He went on to state that the Venezuelan authorities are willing to arrange proper aid deliveries, adding that the actions of the United States and its allies can be defined as “force feeding”, which is actually a defined form of torture. In effect, the United States is trying to force-feed an entire country, he said, demanding an end to violations of relevant United Nations resolutions and the unfreezing of accounts, including those belonging to the Venezuelan people. Those supporting the United States are complicit in violating the United Nations Charter, he emphasized, calling upon all States in the region to firmly voice support for the Charter. A solution to Venezuela’s problems is for the Venezuelan people themselves, he said, stressing that solutions to the tumult in the country should unfold in a manner that respects its national sovereignty. Instead of discussing national dialogue, Mr. Guaidó wants to keep the military ready, he pointed out, adding that Washington’s approach is one of intervention. Following the recent Security Council decision expressing concern about demonstrations in Haiti, members pledged to work with that country’s Government to address pressing issues, he recalled, asking whether his counterpart with the delegation of the United States and other Council members would support a similar text for Venezuela.

MA ZHAOXU ( China ) called upon the parties to seek a political settlement through dialogue and consultations. All countries must abide by the basic principles of international law and international relations, which oppose foreign interference, military intervention and the use of humanitarian assistance to destabilize situations for political reasons, he emphasized. Instead, solutions should be centred on actions to benefit Venezuelans by addressing relevant issues and finding negotiated ways to move forward.

STEPHEN HICKEY ( United Kingdom ), in response to the Russian Federation’s representative, said most Council members would not have used live fire to attack civilians, nor arrested and detained political opponents. Condemning the violence on Venezuela’s borders, he emphasized that only a democratic solution will resolve the crisis, noting also the importance of countries in the region playing their role. Only through free and fair elections can there be an end to the current humanitarian crisis, he stressed. He called upon the Council to send a clear message that Venezuela must hold elections.

ANATOLIO NDONG MBA ( Equatorial Guinea ), Council President for February, spoke in his national capacity, saying that today’s meeting offers an opportunity to reflect on finding a political solution negotiated among Venezuelans with mediation by a neutral party, such as the United Nations. Emphasizing that almost the entire international community opposes a military solution, he said that in as much as the issue at hand is a national one, politicians in Venezuela must sit down and discuss a way forward. It is incumbent upon the constitutional Government to pave the way towards inclusive dialogue and the restoration of peace, and since dialogue with national actors is the sole option for resolving the crisis, the Secretary-General should get involved in facilitating such discussions. The fact that the Council has twice debated the issue in the last month demonstrates the need for the United Nations to indeed play a role, he stressed.

Mr. ABRAMS ( United States ), taking the floor a second time in response to his Russian Federation counterpart, expressed surprise to hear cold war rhetoric when efforts are under way in Hanoi to resolve some problems from that era. The attempt by the United States to provide assistance was carried out at the request of Venezuela’s legitimate interim Government, he said, asking how much aid from the Russian Federation reached those in need. That country is “no doubt” worried about recovering its loans from Venezuela, but that will only happen if the economy can grow again, he said. He also rejected, “from start to finish”, accusations of military intervention by a country occupying parts of Georgia and Ukraine.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) also took the floor a second time, noting that for some reason, the representative of the United States is under the impression that Moscow is only concerned about its money. Did it not occur to him that the Russian Federation perhaps has other interests? Emphasizing that his country does not tolerate egregious and arrogant trampling of international law and interference in other countries, he went on to ask whether the United States is ready to support a Council press statement, as proposed by the Russian Federation, in which the word “Venezuela” replaces “Haiti”.

JORGE ARREAZA, Minister of the People’s Power for Foreign Affairs of Venezuela , expressed appreciation for the opportunity to speak the truth about the situation in the face of colonial arrogance thought to have disappeared from the Council. The Venezuelan people remain subject to international aggression and it is fitting for the Council to discuss that, he said, emphasizing that, without a doubt, it is a threat to regional and international peace and security as well as a violation of the United Nations Charter. The Under-Secretary-General’s briefing was biased and sought to disseminate information from a single source, he added, noting that it was not in line with what was discussed earlier with the Secretary-General.

Recalling that the United States has been leading aggression against Venezuela for many years, he said last weekend’s border incidents constituted a well-organized attempt to violate his country’s sacred sovereignty. However, the security forces contained the incidents with tear gas and other methods, but no deadly force, he said, adding that people armed with Molotov cocktails set fire to humanitarian trucks later found to be carrying not just food and medicine, but also barricades, nails, chicken wire and other materials for use by the Venezuelan opposition. The President of the United States, its Vice-President, its Secretary of State and others constitute a “chain of command” for intervention in Venezuela, he said, adding that he has lost count of the number of Twitter messages containing gangster-like language aimed at the Venezuelan people and their revolutionary forces. “The coup failed” and now is the time to return to sanity and to respect international law and Venezuela’s constitution, he stressed.

The Government is now waiting to sit down with the opposition to decide Venezuela’s future without interference from anyone, most of all the United States, he continued, expressing hope that the White House will give Mr. Guaidó and the opposition approval to enter into dialogue. Stressing that the Council does not exist to wage war or to create the conditions for others to wage war, he called for saving Venezuela “because the threat of the scourge of war is here today”. Echoing the proposal by the Russian Federation’s representative, he said the Council must adopt a resolution that rejects the use of force, or the threat to use force, against his country. Venezuelans are today going to school and to the beach, with Carnival just around the corner, he said. While conceding the effects of inflation, he stressed that there is light at the end of the tunnel and the economy is improving. Condemning “lies and propaganda”, he said foreign policy is being used to win votes in Florida for President Trump and to secure Venezuelan oil for companies of the United States.

SACHA SERGIO LLORENTTY SOLÍZ ( Bolivia ), emphasizing that Latin America and the Caribbean were a region of peace committed to resolving differences peacefully, described the recent attempt to deliver humanitarian aid as a Trojan horse intended to achieve its political objective — regime change in Venezuela. Despite that country’s massive social media campaign describing the operation as an attempt to provide “humanitarian assistance”, neither the Red Cross nor the United Nations allowed themselves to be used in such a way, he noted. The Security Council must pay close attention to the declaration by the United States that “all options are on the table”, he said, expressing regret at the tragic consequences that policy has had for many countries of the region, including the invasions of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama and Haiti. “All options on the table” also brings back memories of the Iran-contra affair, the Monroe Doctrine and the decision by the United States to post on Twitter photos of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi’s assassination and the devastation wrought upon his country, he said, wondering also why humanitarian aid was not discussed at that time and whether peace, democracy and freedom now exist in Libya. Emphasizing the Security Council’s grave responsibility to avoid the repetition of that situation in Latin America — since the invasion of Venezuela is really about oil, as in the cases of Iraq and Libya — he welcomed the declarations of the Montevideo Mechanism and the Lima Group, stressing that humanitarian assistance must be depoliticized and a constructive national dialogue in Venezuela supported.

JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ ( Mexico ) called upon all actors to exercise restraint, avoid excessive use of force and respect the human rights of the Venezuelan people. While the delivery of humanitarian aid is critical, any humanitarian concern must be addressed through neutral international organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or United Nations agencies, he said. Negotiating a solution is the way forward, as per the Montevideo Mechanism signed by 16 countries in the region, he said, noting that it supports inclusive dialogue to resolve differences. Similar effective diplomatic mechanisms should be established to affect a peaceful solution in Venezuela, he stressed.

ANA SILVIA RODRÍGUEZ ABASCAL ( Cuba ), referring to recent incidents, said the United States continues to fabricate pretences for military aggression against Venezuela. This invasion must be denounced. Countries of the region have just stated that a military intervention is not a solution to the crisis. However, the United States continues to keep “all options on the table”. It is important to acknowledge the elections held in Venezuela in May 2018. Governments that are attempting to deliver humanitarian aid are the same ones that are exerting pressure on Venezuela for regime change. Cuba reaffirms its constant support for Mr. Maduro, the legitimate constitutional president. Peace and security in Latin America must be defended and upheld. Given that the situation is urgent, all parties must do their utmost to engage in dialogue. The legitimacy of a Government remains with the people, not external actors. She urged the United Nations and particularly the Security Council to oppose military intervention in Venezuela. The Council must defend peace, she stressed.

MILENKO E. SKOKNIC TAPIA ( Chile ) said that over the past few days, the world has witnessed a crisis in Venezuela. Humanitarian assistance must reach people in need. Chile condemned the violence perpetrated by Government armed forces against unarmed civilians who were “only trying to access humanitarian assistance”. Venezuela’s people are facing an unjustified political and economic crisis. Chile expresses its condolences to the families of those civilians who have died and urges the need to hold elections. Chile, as part of the Lima Group, backs a political, diplomatic and peaceful settlement to the crisis. Chile is not prepared to support actions contrary to international law. Dialogue is the only way to ensure a solution to this protracted conflict.

GUILLERMO FERNANDEZ DE SOTO VALDERRAMA ( Colombia ) stressed his country’s essential belief in multilateralism, praising the meeting of the Lima Group as a good example of the relevance of multilateral action. The Group endorsed the interim President, given the need to restore freedom in Venezuela and massive human rights violations there. The situation is transcending national borders and affecting Colombia. Due to the lack of food and medicine, 3.4 million people left Venezuela and 3.7 million of the country’s people remain malnourished. There is an urgent need to provide them with humanitarian assistance. The dictatorship there ceased to think about its own people. Colombia can provide details of what happened lately regarding attacks on humanitarian convoys consisting of four trucks. Tear gas was used by Venezuela’s armed forces. The trucks were ordered to return and the bridge was closed. The Lima Group concurred on the need to deliver humanitarian assistance, achieve a democratic transition and reconstruct the country’s institutions and economy.

MARTÍN GARCÍA MORITÁN ( Argentina ) said the crisis in Venezuela requires urgent international action, stressing the important role of the Council in preventing the situation from deteriorating further. The dictatorship prevented humanitarian assistance. His delegation condemns repressive actions and violence against civilians. These could constitute a crime against humanity. The Lima Group concluded unanimously that Mr. Maduro staying in power constitutes a threat to peace and security in the region. The United Nations cannot remain idle. He called attention to a resolution — sponsored by Argentina and other nations and adopted in the Human Rights Council — urging Venezuela to accept humanitarian aid and promote human rights. He appealed for the restoration of rule of law and protection of human rights in Venezuela.

FREDERICO SALOMÃO DUQUE ESTRADA MEYER ( Brazil ) said the events of 23 February were a “wake-up call” and that the regime’s actions to block humanitarian aid are brutally cruel. “We are all keenly aware that the brutal and illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro has taken a regrettable detour from any vision of a free and prosperous future for its people,” he added. It was only fitting that the President of the democratically-elected National Assembly, the only legitimate power standing in Venezuela, swore himself in as interim President of the country. He condemned the regime’s criminal use of violence and military force against the provision of humanitarian assistance and reiterated the appeal to the Armed Forces of Venezuela to adhere to the legitimate authority of President Guaidó. The Lima Group conveyed to the International Criminal Court its support to a request submitted in September 2018 that it examine the humanitarian catastrophe committed by the Maduro regime. Brazil called on the international community to join efforts for the democratic transition in Venezuela, demanding that the regime’s violence against its own people be stopped.

JAIME HERMIDA CASTILLO ( Nicaragua ) said he was appalled by the threats by some States that seek to separate people. All must respect the will of the people and do away with actions that lead to suffering, he said, emphasizing that aggression and hostility must end. Practices that destroy economies and expose people to misery must be denounced and condemned, he said, pointing out that they subject millions of human beings to poverty. People must be able to choose their own future, he said, stressing: “We have opted for peace and not war.” Nicaragua welcomes international efforts to defend and uphold international law. “We must know how to choose a life with respect and uphold the nobility of our soul,” he added, emphasizing his delegation’s support for President Maduro.

OMAR CASTAÑEDA SOLARES ( Guatemala ) said tens of thousands of Venezuela’s people are facing tenuous circumstances and humanitarian aid is badly needed. To end the current situation, a free, transparent election must take place as soon as possible, with a presence of international observers. The fact that Mr. Maduro remains in power represents a threat to the region. Calling upon the United Nations to act within the provisions of the Charter, he said the transition towards democracy must be carried out by Venezuelans themselves. Condemning any military solutions, he said Guatemala will continue to strive to achieve peace and security for all the people of Venezuela.

KITTY SWEEB ( Suriname ), speaking on behalf of some members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), said those countries “do not choose one side or the other”, but, instead, they support the principles of territorial inviolability, human rights, international law and the sanctity of national sovereignty, among others. Emphasizing that economic strangulation and military intervention are contrary to those principles, he said emphasized that such policies will only exacerbate the suffering of Venezuelans. She called for a pathway to peace forged “not by threats, but by dialogue, not by escalating the tensions, but by cooling them down”. Expressing support for the Montevideo Mechanism, she noted that four individuals internationally recognized for their competence and experience have been chosen to lead that process and urged all parties, both inside and outside Venezuela, to give it “the time and space it needs to work”.

Speaking in her national capacity , she said that reports of humanitarian aid aggressively being carried out on Venezuela’s borders while stability and tranquillity remain inside the country are particularly alarming because such actions undermine the principles of independence and impartiality. Suriname remains strongly committed to international law and therefore denounces all acts of aggression. She also rejected the politicization of humanitarian aid offered without the consent of the legitimate Government of Venezuela. She reiterated that the Montevideo Mechanism is the only way to reach a peaceful and lasting solution to the internal conflict in Venezuela, underlining that Latin America and the Caribbean must remain a zone of peace.

JULIO CÉSAR ARRIOLA RAMÍREZ ( Paraguay ) noted that 30 days have passed since the Council last met on Venezuela, asking why the 15‑member organ must meet again today. It is because the Maduro regime is causing a humanitarian crisis and poses a threat to peace and security in the region. On 23 February, criminal acts were committed by Mr. Maduro. His regime denied access to humanitarian convoys. Paraguay condemns ruthless oppression by Mr. Maduro, he said, calling on the International Criminal Court to consider looking into crimes against humanity. Paraguay was the first country to break with the regime there and lend its full support to the National Assembly elected in 2015 and the interim President. It also resolutely supports the National Recovery Plan adopted by the National Assembly. The institutional, economic and social reconstruction of Venezuela should be led by its people, who are the agents of their own liberation.

LUIS BERMUDEZ ( Uruguay ) expressed concern about the escalating tensions in Venezuela, calling on the regime to exercise caution and restraint to avoid the situation from deteriorating further. Efforts are under way to bring the parties together. The Montevideo Mechanism and the International Contact Group contribute to this peaceful process. These two formats explore possible ways to a peaceful solution. No other solution is possible. He called for fair, transparent and credible elections with reliable international oversight. Holding such elections is the best safeguard to avoid a bloodbath. Uruguay continues to be guided by full respect for international law, he said, calling for dialogue and engagement. On 25 February, at the Human Rights Council, Uruguay’s Foreign Minister stated that his country does not seek heightened tensions, urging dialogue and negotiations.

GARETH BYNOE ( Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ) said that his country, as a small, peace-loving nation with a tiny population, open borders and no standing army, owes its continued peaceful existence to the robust and universally accepted body of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. Dialogue based on mutual respect and adherence to international law is the only path to peace. The United States has demonstrated commendable restraint, patience, global leadership and belief in diplomacy over the years, including in their current pursuit of dialogue with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, he said, stressing that the same constructive approach should be exhibited with Venezuela to safeguard Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace and ensure the well-being of all Venezuelans.

MARC-ANDRÉ BLANCHARD ( Canada ) said that the Maduro regime continues to hinder access for much-needed humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations in Venezuela. “Let there be no doubt: Venezuela is under the control of a dictatorship that would see its people starve rather than cede one iota of power,” he said. The Lima Group, including Canada and now with the full participation of Venezuela’s interim Government, met on 25 February in Bogota, where they affirmed that the continuance of Mr. Maduro and his illegitimate regime represent a threat to peace and security. The presidential elections in May 2018 were clearly fraudulent. “It is clear that Maduro’s regime has no authority to govern Venezuela,” he said. Calling on Member States that are in communication with the Maduro regime to urge an end to violence, he pledged that Canada will stand with the people of Venezuela in their peaceful struggle for democracy and human rights.

LOIS MICHELE YOUNG ( Belize ) urged the Security Council to dissuade any actions that would lead to military conflagration in Venezuela. While the humanitarian plight of the Venezuela’s people has gained worldwide visibility, there are concerns that such good intentions may be a mask for nefarious political intentions. Humanitarian aid, when requested and welcomed, should be channelled through the United Nations. “The situation in Venezuela is, in plain view, unwell,” she added, stressing that dialogue is the only way to a peaceful resolution. Dialogue leading to compromise and accommodation of political plurality must take place between the Government and the opposition. Above all, it must be done entirely unaccompanied by the threat or use of force.

LUIS GALLEGOS CHIRIBOGA ( Ecuador ), condemning the recent violence against peaceful civilians, said the situation in Venezuela requires an immediate political solution to the crisis. Security forces should not block the delivery of aid and efforts must be made to hold free and fair elections, he emphasized, noting that only a legitimate democracy can guarantee a stable future, economic recovery and social order, with the international community’s support. Hosting more than 240,000 Venezuelan refugees, Ecuador will hold, on 8 and 9 April, a regional conference on the mass migration of more than 3 million Venezuelans, he said, adding that the event represents an opportunity to work towards resolving the region’s largest humanitarian problem. Reiterating that there is no military solution, he emphasized that the solution rests on dialogue.

GLENTIS THOMAS ( Antigua and Barbuda ) appealed to all parties in Venezuela to remain calm and stay focused on the Montevideo Mechanism being facilitated by Mexico, Uruguay and CARICOM. Citing decades of interference into the domestic affairs of States in the region “that has left the region broken”, he warned that “we cannot and must not return to those days”. Where there is a need for humanitarian assistance, the United Nations should always facilitate aid distribution and support, free from political influence and preconditions. Stressing that Member States are bound not to interfere in the affairs of other nations, he warned that any process other than diplomacy — including military intervention — will undermine the legitimacy of the United Nations and destabilize the region. Any unilateral declaration of support for one side over the other in Venezuela amounts to a blatant interference in that country’s affairs.

RUBEN ARMANDO ESCALANTE HASBUN ( El Salvador ) expressed deep concern about the situation in Venezuela and reiterated that the responsibility to resolve the crisis lies with the Government. A solution must be found by the people of Venezuela themselves. El Salvador fully respects international law, including the Charter of the United Nations and its principles of non-use of force and non-interference. A political solution is the only viable solution to the situation in Venezuela, he said, expressing his country’s unwavering support to that end.

MARY ELIZABETH FLORES FLAKE ( Honduras ), associating herself with the Lima Declaration adopted by various countries on 25 February, expressed support for Juan Guaidó’s efforts to bring humanitarian assistance to all Venezuelans in need. Recalling that the decision by the Organization of American States (OAS) not to recognize the legitimacy of President Nicolas Maduro’s new term of office in January, she said the latter continues to usurp executive power and to undermine the rule of law. “Blocking, burning and depriving Venezuelans of humanitarian aid, food and medicine […] will be accounted for in the list of crimes against humanity” upon investigation by the International Criminal Court, she added.

ISBETH LISBETH QUIEL MURCIA ( Panama ) strongly condemned the use of force against Venezuela’s people and the blocking of aid deliveries. Noting that her country joined more than 50 others in recognizing Mr. Guaidó as interim President, she said the current illegitimate regime must allow a peaceful transition through a democratic process that leads to holding fair elections. As a member of the Lima Group, Panama supports a call for action, at the highest levels, to prevent the political, economic and humanitarian crisis from turning into a geopolitical conflict. The overarching purpose of the current international consensus is that Venezuela can recover within a peaceful, non-violent solution, she said, expressing hope that dialogue will swiftly prevail.

RODRIGO ALBERTO CARAZO ZELEDÓN ( Costa Rica ) said the welfare of Venezuela’s people must be at the centre of a solution to the crisis, with diplomacy and dialogue being fundamental tools to reaching this goal. Rejecting any course of action involving violence, force or military intervention of Venezuela, Costa Rica also rejects the excessive force used by the Maduro regime on 23 February, as well as actions that led to deprivation and the violation of rights of that country’s people. On the issue of the urgent need for humanitarian aid in Venezuela, he called on relevant United Nations agencies to act. The solution to the crisis must be peaceful, democratic and defined by Venezuela’s people, with free, fair and transparent elections in line with international standards. As the 2018 elections failed to meet inclusive standards for it to be considered legitimate, Costa Rica recognized Mr. Guaidó as interim President.

LOREEN RUTH BANNIS-ROBERTS ( Dominica ), associating herself with CARICOM, expressed strong support for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of every sovereign State. To peacefully and sustainably resolve the situation in Venezuela, there must be meaningful dialogue and diplomacy among all parties, geared towards reaffirming the rights of the people to peace and democracy. Every effort should be made to build peace, promote reconciliation and find an amicable and lasting resolution to the situation. Endorsing the Montevideo Mechanism, she said this approach will foster such a resolution.

Taking the floor for a second time, Mr. ARREAZA ( Venezuela ) reiterated that President Maduro has been working with the United Nations for several years. He personally sat down with Secretary-General António Guterres and agreed on a mechanism for accepting humanitarian assistance through the Organization. Venezuela also agreed with the European Union on this mechanism. Secondly, the war against Venezuela must stop, he said, referring to the economic blockade imposed by the United States. These sanctions undermine the economy and makes it difficult for Venezuela to seek funds from international financial institutions. The measures cost Venezuela billions of dollars. The United States has not ruled out the use of force. That country must rule out war as an option. Otherwise, it cannot be a member of the United Nations. He expressed appreciation for all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean for speaking out against the threat of use of force despite different political positions. The region is a zone of peace.

Mr. MEZA-CUADRA ( Peru ), also taking the floor for a second time, said Latin American countries have largely aligned against the use of force and a core element mentioned is the exodus of Venezuela’s people, the most serious humanitarian situation in the region. Yet, there is not a single sign of concern for the 3.4 million Venezuelans who have fled, including the 700,000 in Peru. For its part, the Lima Group proposed political and diplomatic means to re-establish democracy in Venezuela.

Mr. ARREAZA ( Venezuela ) said it is painful to consider the situation in his country, which also hosts migrants from countries in the region. The Government of Venezuela has contacted countries to confirm information on Venezuelan migrants, as the notion of 3.4 million migrants is unrealistic, he said, inviting those present from countries in the region to engage with Venezuela.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) said that during the meeting, a delegation has managed to kill the proposed draft on Venezuela, which is a blatant example of double standards.

LESLIE ORDEMAN ( United States ) said the draft in question, similar to a Council resolution on the situation in Haiti, should have included information that referred to Mr. Maduro’s actions.","Venezuelans Must Resolve Crisis Themselves, Security Council Delegates Agree while Differing over Legitimacy of Contending Parties",Un.org,https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13719.doc.htm
35,Empty,2019-02-25T21:35:58Z,The Trump administration’s most dangerous collision with facts has been its effort to paralyze U.S. efforts to join nations of the world in confronting climate change.,"Many have become immune or anesthetized to the daily assault on truth that is the Trump presidency, an alternative reality where North Korea has denuclearized and Russia might not have attacked our elections in 2016. It would be laughable were it not dangerous. Presidents are supposed to hold consensus together, not invent fictions to fray it. But the administration’s most dangerous collision with facts has been its effort to paralyze U.S. efforts to join nations of the world in confronting climate change. The White House plans to convene “experts” to “determine” whether climate change is a national security threat. We know what the outcome will be: President Donald Trump’s council of doubters and deniers will convene to undo a 26-year-old factual consensus that climate change is a national security threat multiplier.

Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says Donald Trump has convened a ‘kangaroo court’ to deal with climate change. ( FABRICE COFFRINI / AFP/GETTY IMAGES file photo )

As we careen toward irreversible environmental tipping points, we have no time to waste debating alternative facts only to invest years more re-establishing trust in the real ones. No panel 10 years from now can put the ice sheets back together or hold back rising tides. Begin with the kind of facts that John Adams called “stubborn things.” In 1991, President George H.W. Bush’s administration assessed in its National Security Strategy that threats such as climate change, which “respect no international boundaries,” were “already contributing to political conflict.” Each of Bush’s successors included climate change in their National Security Strategies. Even after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush’s administration made room in the 2002 National Security Strategy to warn of “dangerous human interference with the global climate.” Were four consecutive administrations wrong? No. The factual basis of climate change’s threat originated not with politicians, but with the national security community, including the intelligence community. Eleven retired military leaders comprising the military advisory board at CNA, a naval think tank in Arlington, described climate change in 2007 as “a threat multiplier for instability.” Seven years later, another 16 retired flag officers representing all branches of the military implored Americans to understand the severity of “a salient national security concern” because “time and tide wait for no one.”

Instead of convening a kangaroo court, the president might want to talk with the adults he once trusted enough to fill his top national security positions. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats has reported that climate change would increase “the risk of social unrest, migration, and interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Jordan.” Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told the Armed Services Committee last year: “Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.” Read more: Trump and Kim heap praise before summit Pence tells Canada, allies to give frozen Maduro assets to Venezuelan opposition Trump says he’ll nominate Kelly Craft as UN Ambassador

These officials weren’t making back-of-the-envelope projections or envisioning some distant, dystopian future. Climate change is already impacting national security. The land which houses Naval Station Norfolk, the biggest naval installation in the world,is literally sinking. In fact, sea levels on the East Coast are rising twice as fast as the global average, thanks to uneven ocean temperatures and geology. Consider what further sea level rise could mean for this base or for the U.S. navy fleet, 20 per cent of which is home-ported nearby. Increased risk of wildfires can even prevent troops from training with live ammunition. Wilful denial won’t change the fact that our military readiness will be degraded when the permafrost our Alaskan bases are built on begins to thaw out.

And it doesn’t end with military impacts. While climate change didn’t lead to the rise of the terrorist group Boko Haram in Nigeria, the country’s severe drought and the government’s inability to cope with it helped create the volatility that militants exploited to seize villages, butcher teachers and kidnap hundreds of innocent girls. The prospect of a more arid climate throughout the Middle East and parts of Asia will increasingly strain the most essential resource of all: fresh water. We’ve already seen tensions rise around the basins of the Nile, Central Asia’s Indus River and the Mekong in Southeast Asia. Areas facing unrest, instability and weak governance are breeding grounds for violent extremism. Climate change will only exacerbate mass migration in places already enduring economic, political and social stress. There are, of course, some people cheering the president’s apparent attempt to erase climate change from U.S. national security considerations, and they live in Beijing and Moscow. Russia and China have for years been mapping the resource competition, military implications and geostrategic challenges that climate change will present in an ever-changing, climate-impacted Arctic. What a gift to them if we stop making our own assessments because we have our heads buried in the sand while their eyes are on the tundra. We can spend the next two years debating whether two plus two equals five. But it would mean someday a young American in uniform will likely be put in harm’s way because truth lost out to talking heads. Debate how to address the climate national security threat, not whether it’s real. Mr. President, listen to our military leaders and disband your climate denial panel.

The move would affect the Shiite group's political wing.","The United Kingdom is set to ban Shiite Islamist groups Hezbollah, Ansarul Islam and Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam Muslimeen (JNIM), the UK's Home Office said in a statement on Monday.

The measure, which need parliamentary approval, is set to go into effect on Friday. If approved, being a member of — or inviting support for — the three organizations will be a criminal offense carrying a 10-year prison sentence, the Home Office said.

The UK previously distinguished the Lebanese Shia group’s military and political branches.

Hezbollah was founded in the early 1980s with the support of Iran, and spent much of its early existence fighting the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. London proscribed Hezbollah's external security unit and its military wing in 2001 and 2008 respectively.

Hezbollah made electoral gains in Lebanon last year and now has three ministers in government.

""Hezbollah is continuing in its attempts to destabilize the fragile situation in the Middle East — and we are no longer able to distinguish between their already banned military wing and the political party,"" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said as part of the statement. ""Because of this, I have taken the decision to proscribe the group in its entirety,"" he added.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Rise of Hezbollah Hezbollah, or Party of God, was conceived by Muslim clerics in the 1980s in response to the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in 1982. The Shiite group has a political and military wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization National support against Israel Hezbollah emerged in the 1980s as an amalgamation of Shiite militias and played a major role in the Lebanese civil war. It used guerrilla warfare to drive Israeli forces out of South Lebanon — Israel withdrew in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought another war in 2006. Its defense of Lebanon against Israel had won it cross-sectarian support and acceptance in Lebanese society.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Backed by Iran Since its creation, Hezbollah has received military, financial and political support from Iran and Syria. Today, Hezbollah's military wing is more powerful than Lebanon's own army and has become a major regional paramilitary force.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Political apparatus Hezbollah turned its focus to politics following the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. It represents a large section of the Lebanese Shiite population and is allied with other sectarian groups, including Christians. Their political development has mostly come under Hassan Nasrallah (pictured), who became the group's leader in 1992.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Armed wing Unlike other parties in Lebanon's multi-sided 1975-1990 civil war, Hezbollah did not disband its armed wing. Some Lebanese political groups, such as Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future Movement, want Hezbollah to put down its arms. Hezbollah argues its militant wing is necessary to defend against Israel and other external threats.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Terror group? A number of countries and bodies, including the United States, Israel, Canada and the Arab League, consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, Australia and the European Union differentiate between its legitimate political activities and its militant wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Hezbollah enters Syria's civil war Hezbollah has been one of the main backers of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. Its entrance into the war helped save Assad, one of its chief patrons; secured weapons supply routes from Syria and formed a buffer zone around Lebanon against Sunni militant groups it feared would take over Syria. As a result it has won considerable support from Shiite communities in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Sectarianism Lebanon has long been at the center of regional power struggles, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, Hezbollah's military and political ascendancy, as well as its intervention in Syria, have also helped stoke Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions in Lebanon and across the region.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Renewed conflict with Israel? Iran and Hezbollah have increased their political and military strength through the war in Syria. Israel views this as a threat and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on Iran/Hezbollah targets in Syria. Israel has vowed to not let Iran and Hezbollah create a permanent presence in Syria. There is growing concern of another war between Hezbollah and Israel that could draw in Iran. Author: Chase Winter



Joining a group

The UK is now one of 11 countries and entities that have classified Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization — a list which includes The Arab League, Canada, France, Israel and the United States. Three others — Australia, New Zealand and the European Union — have only added Hezbollah's military wing to their terror lists.

The US has been calling for more pressure on Hezbollah as part of its sanctions against Iran, which it describes as the world's largest sponsor of terrorism. The US Ambassador in Lebanon last month suggested Hezbollah was fighting in at least three countries: Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Israel, a lifelong enemy of Hezbollah, applauded the UK move and urged the EU to do the same: ""All who truly wish to combat terror must reject the fake distinction between 'military' & 'political' wings,"" Gilad Erdan, Israel's security minister, said in a tweet.

37,Empty,2019-02-25T19:25:53Z,US also to urge UN Security Council to call for ‘credible’ elections in crisis-hit country,"The United States hit Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked aid from reaching the crisis-hit country during the weekend.

Washington also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking the body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The US treasury department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled president Nicolás Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the US.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogotá as US vice president Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaidó met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Mr Pence said the US would stand by Mr Guaidó until freedom was restored to the oil-rich nation. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Mr Maduro’s “henchmen” to Mr Guaidó’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming. “In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Mr Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

Mr Guaidó, sitting next to Mr Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as US-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Mr Guaidó, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Mr Maduro.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the US is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian deputy foreign minister Hugo de Zela Martínez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Border closure

Mr Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Mr Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful president.

Washington wants the 15-member UN Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and backs Mr Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Mr Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup against the Opec member.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Mr Maduro’s government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighboring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros”.

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia (34), walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay [to cross], so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don't know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the US Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of the state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Mr Lacava goes by the nickname “Dracula” in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos. – Reuters",Venezuela hit with new US sanctions after aid clashes,The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/venezuela-hit-with-new-us-sanctions-after-aid-clashes-1.3806044

Pence was speaking at a meeting with the regional leaders in the Lima Group — a 14-nation coalition of mostly conservative Latin American nations and Canada that has joined together to pressure Maduro.

“We are with you 100 percent,” Pence said ahead of the start of the meeting. “I was to assure you, President Guaido, the tragic events of this past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States to stand with you … We will keep standing until your libertad is restored.”

Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself interim head of state and triggered a power struggle in the South American country, was also in attendance. He asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend and urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

POMPEO URGES VENEZUELAN SECURITY FORCES TO LET HUMANITARIAN AID INTO THE COUNTRY: 'DO THE RIGHT THING'

Meanwhile, the Trump administration slapped financial sanctions against Maduro allies.

The Treasury Department announced Monday measures against four governors: Omar Prieto of Zulia, Ramon Carrizales of Apure, Jorge Garcia Carneiro of Vargas and Rafael Lacava of Carabobo state.

“The United States will not stand idly while the people of Venezuela are denied basic necessities and made to suffer needlessly. These actions have consequences,” the department said in a statement. “We reaffirm our call on Venezuelan officials and security forces to allow urgently needed food and medicine to enter and be distributed throughout the country.”

Violent clashes broke out over the weekend across the Colombia-Venezuela border – at least four protesters died while more than 300 were injured as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Trucks were met with tear gas and rubber bullets and at least two went up in flames, which the opposition blamed on security forces and the Venezuelan government on “drugged-up protesters.”

UN CONDEMNS VENEZUELA VIOLENCE, 'APPEALS FOR CALM'

For weeks, the U.S. and regional allies had been amassing emergency food and medical kits on Venezuela's borders in anticipation of carrying out a ""humanitarian avalanche"" by land and sea to undermine Maduro's rule.

The embattled Maduro has denied a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and claimed that aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup attempt against the OPEC member.

Pence announced Monday that the U.S. would be sending another $56 million to neighbors of Venezuela to help them cope with migrants fleeing the nation’s deepening crisis.

The U.S. has already provided more than $139 million in aid to help Venezuela, Pence announced.

As Colombia’s foreign minister warned about “credible threats to the life” of Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido, the Trump administration also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro’s “henchmen” to Guaido’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming against the OPEC member.

“In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

While the day presented a united regional front against Maduro, who is widely accused of coming to power through fraudulent elections, there was no clear sign that the latest measures would succeed in pushing him toward the exit.

‘CREDIBLE THREATS’

On a day that began with Guaido urging “all options” to be considered to remove Maduro, the threat of military intervention seemed if anything weaker after the meeting.

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

Guaido himself could be in danger from the Maduro regime, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said, speaking on behalf of the Lima Group.

“There’s information about serious and credible threats to the life and integrity of Juan Guaido and his family, as well as to his wife’s family. From Bogotá, we want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,”

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

In a joint statement at the close of the meeting, the Lima Group said Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

But the Lima Group said it “reiterates the conviction that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law,” the statement said.

CALL FOR AMNESTY

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hoped Maduro and those supported by his “corruption and his brutality” will leave Venezuela peacefully.

“We make clear to them that we will support the interim president’s call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,” Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president.

“We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere,” Pence said.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro blocked a convoy of trucks with food and medicines during the weekend. Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup.

At least 167 members of Maduro’s armed forces have deserted since Saturday and more are expected to flee across the border to Colombia.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro’s government last week. Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has suffered years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros.”

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

The Lima Group said it would ask the International Criminal Court to consider “the serious humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of Nicolas Maduro’s regime against the civilian population, and the denial of access to international assistance.”",Venezuela hit with new U.S. sanctions after aid clashes,Reuters,https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1QE28F
42,Empty,2019-02-25T11:00:45Z,Venezuela's political crisis is getting worse. Here's what you need to know.,"The crisis in Venezuela escalated even further over the weekend, as members of the opposition clashed with soldiers, police and government loyalists at the country’s borders with Colombia and Brazil. As the nation’s humanitarian, economic and political crises worsen, here are some answers to questions you may have while tracking events.

Why are two men claiming to be president of Venezuela?

Nicolás Maduro came to power in March 2013 after the death of former leader Hugo Chávez. Although Maduro pledged to carry on Chávez’s popular socialist policies, Venezuela soon entered into a recession, and his popularity tanked.

In response, Maduro began to consolidate power. He arrested and intimidated rivals, took power away from the opposition-controlled National Assembly and established a constituent assembly stacked with allies to rewrite the country’s constitution. In May, Maduro won a new six-year term as president, but the international community largely viewed the election as a sham.

After Maduro’s inauguration in January, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself the interim president of Venezuela. Guaidó, a 35-year-old electrical engineer and head of the National Assembly, argues that Maduro’s reelection was fraudulent. Therefore, because of his position, Guaidó says he is the legitimate president under the country’s constitution.

Guaidó has called for free and fair elections when Maduro steps down, and numerous countries now recognize him as Venezuela's rightful leader.

What is President Trump saying?

President Trump has been watching Venezuela since his first week in office. The Washington Post reported at the time that Trump “surprised his national security team by calling for a briefing on the oil-rich country veering toward economic collapse.”

After Guaidó's declaration last month, Trump swiftly backed the opposition leader, recognizing him as the country’s president and pledging “to use the full weight of United States economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy.”

Other members of the administration have weighed in forcefully. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Maduro a “sick tyrant” for keeping aid from Venezuelan civilians, and national security adviser John Bolton called Maduro a “dictator” clinging to an “illegitimate claim to power.”

What is Trump actually doing?

Along with his recognition of Guaidó, Trump has hit Venezuela with sanctions targeting its oil exports. He has called on members of the country’s military to defect, warning them about the consequences of remaining loyal to Maduro. “If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out,” he said in Florida earlier this month. “You will lose everything.”

Trump has also said he won’t “rule out a military option,” although some in Congress have already said they oppose U.S. military intervention in Venezuela.

Pompeo has appointed Elliott Abrams as U.S. special representative for Venezuela. Abrams has a controversial foreign policy record in Latin America. My colleague Ishaan Tharoor writes that “as a prominent State Department official in the Reagan administration, Abrams led the American coverup of a hideous massacre in the Salvadoran village of El Mozote.”

What are other countries saying about the crisis?

More than 60 countries have recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president. They include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Israel and the majority of Western Europe. They are all calling for an end to the chaos and trying to provide support for Venezuelans in the form of humanitarian aid.

Who still supports Maduro?

Dozens of countries are also standing behind Maduro, including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Russia. Maduro has said Russian President Vladimir Putin is providing the country with aid and financial assistance.

Russia has a particularly large stake in the survival of Maduro’s regime, not only financially but politically. As my colleague Anton Troianovski writes: “Maduro is a key ally of Russia in Venezuela, giving Moscow a geopolitical foothold a three-hour flight from Miami. Russia has extended billions of dollars in loans to Venezuela and in December dispatched nuclear-capable bombers to the country in a show of force.”

Why is Venzuela’s economic situation so bad?

Because of its massive oil wealth, Venezuela used to be Latin America’s richest country per capita. Under Chávez’s vision for the nation as a socialist paradise, industries were nationalized, and government handouts increased. But after Chávez’s death and a global collapse of oil prices, that vision no longer worked. Cash dried up, and the corruption-ravaged oil industry produced less and less. Runaway inflation set in.

In 2017, The Post’s Anthony Faiola wrote that “Venezuela hasn’t released official inflation data since 2015. But last month, according to the Caracas-based statistical firm Ecoanalítica, the country slipped into hyperinflation — and hit an annualized rate of nearly 2,000 percent.

“The cash-strapped government is now teetering on default, printing reams of bills to keep the economy afloat. That fuels inflation. …

“The nearly worthless bolívar means that imports — which are generally purchased in dollars — are prohibitively expensive and that Venezuelan businesses can’t afford to buy foreign-made inputs, slowing their production.”

As inflation soared, food and medicine became scarce, and basic services broke down. Millions of Venezuelans have now fled the country in search of jobs and sustenance.

What happened this weekend?

Maduro has been blocking most aid from coming into Venezuela, saying that offers by outside groups to bring in assistance are just veiled attempts at foreign invasion.

Nevertheless, the opposition sent thousands of volunteers to the Colombian and Brazilian borders to defy Maduro’s orders and bring in aid supplies. They hoped that the military wouldn’t use force against unarmed civilians carting in humanitarian goods — and that many soldiers might defect.

They were wrong. As The Post reported from the scene, anti-Maduro crowds faced tear gas fired by Venezuelan units on the Colombian border.

“In all, 285 people were injured and 37 hospitalized on the Colombian side of the border, according to Colombia’s foreign minister,” The Post reported. “At least four were killed on the Venezuela-Brazil border after clashing with pro-government militias.”

And although dozens of members of the Venezuelan military switched sides, events showed that Maduro is maintaining the support and strength of his security forces.

What will happen next?

Guaidó is asking for more help. This weekend, he secretly crossed the border into Colombia despite having been banned from leaving Venezuela by the country’s supreme court. Guaidó met with Vice President Pence as well as Latin American leaders in Bogotá on Monday. There, Pence announced new U.S. sanctions against Maduro loyalists, calling on other nations to do the same.

Amid Saturday's clashes, he seemed to hint that he is open to a military intervention. “Today’s events force me to make a decision: to pose to the international community in a formal way that we must have all options open to achieve the liberation of this country that is fighting and will continue to fight,” Guaidó tweeted on Saturday.

On Monday, my colleagues reported that Pence acknowledged Guaidó “sought assurances that the United States could use force if necessary, but the vice president did not set a red line for that decision or hint at what he would recommend to Trump.”

Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank, told The Post that “Guaidó’s insistence that ‘all options are on the table’ echoes President Trump’s words, first uttered in August 2017 and widely interpreted as serious consideration of military action.”

But even in the United States, which has taken a strong stance against Maduro, a military intervention has little support. Invading Venezuela could help Maduro “portray himself globally as a leftist martyr persecuted by the Trump administration,” my colleagues write.

Mayor Bill de Blasio is soldiering on in his exploration of a possible 2020 presidential run. He went to Iowa this past weekend to spread his message, naysayers be damned.

De Blasio seems unfazed by ledes like this one, from CNN’s Jeff Zeleny on the ground in Iowa: “New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed a crowd here on Sunday that could have easily fit into a subway car back home, with room to spare for the people he met a night earlier on his first stop of the year in Iowa … ‘I’m certainly not ruling out a run for the presidency,’ de Blasio said after a young man finally raised the question about his White House ambitions. ‘Right now, it is a decision I have not made.’ That decision is precisely what led the mayor to speak at a union hall where 42 chairs were filled and about 10 other people were standing — more than 1,100 miles away from his own City Hall on Sunday afternoon. It followed a visit to Sioux City on Saturday night, where a couple dozen Democrats braved a blizzard to meet him at a downtown bar.”

He is similarly undeterred by the fact that he “had not assembled the typical machinery of consultants and on-the-ground personnel needed for a presidential campaign,” the New York Times’s Jeffrey Mays reports. “No one thought he would be mayor when he first started running, he said.”

He was also unafraid of a little Iowa blizzard and the indignities of microwaved cuisine. The Post reports that de Blasio “ignored the dangerous weather and insisted on heading south to Des Moines with his security detail,” despite a snowstorm. “Hizzoner made it less than halfway before calling it quits in Onawa, Iowa — estimated population 2,849 — to bed down in a Super 8 Motel, sources said. And instead of enjoying some of the Hawkeye State’s award-winning barbecue or succulent steaks, he had to make do with a microwaved burrito.”

A majority of New Yorkers don’t think he should run for president, public polling shows, but he’s got at least one big booster: a New York City woman who thinks he’s definitely going to be the president.

As Gothamist reports, “WNYC’s Gwynne Hogan was on scene for the momentous occasion. Apparently de Blasio was in the process of crossing Canal Street when he heard the message of support from a woman selling fruit on the sidewalk behind him: ‘He was like ‘HUH!’ and then he comes back across the street, and the woman says ‘I think one day you’re going to be president,’ and he’s like: ‘Is somebody getting this? Is ANYBODY getting this?!’ The mayor was then quickly swarmed by staffers, who recorded the message of support on their phones. ‘It was a commotion,’ said Hogan.”

“But mostly, the reaction in New York City to news that Mr. de Blasio was planning to spend time with voters on the campaign trail has been something like a collective groan,” the New York Times Editorial Board’s Mara Gay wrote this weekend, noting that ""one former de Blasio staffer sent me a text with a string of four emojis meant to evoke the experience of laughing so hard that you cry.”

“SEN. MICHAEL GIANARIS’ NOMINATION TO THE STATE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES CONTROL BOARD just went the way of Amazon’s Queens headquarters. Senate majority leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, in a Saturday letter to Gov. Cuomo, announced she was withdrawing her nomination of Gianaris, one of the prime movers behind the scuttling of Amazon’s Long Island City plan. The governor — who just one day earlier called the abrupt abandonment of the Amazon project the ‘greatest tragedy’ in his lengthy political career — greeted her declaration with a touch of sarcasm.

Congestion pricing – a toll on drivers into Manhattan's Central Business District below 60th St. — would raise critical funding for public transit while also reducing the traffic and air pollution that plagues midtown and lower Manhattan.” Daily News

REAL ESTATE

TWO STATE LAWMAKERS WANT TO END A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS LANDLORDS OF REGULATED APARTMENTS to raise rents after making improvements to their buildings and apartments. Sen. Mike Gianaris and Assemblyman Brian Barnwell, both Queens Democrats, have introduced legislation to eliminate the major capital improvement program that allows landlords to raise rents to help offset the cost of upgrades. Elected officials and tenant advocates say property owners routinely abuse the program to push units out of rent-stabilization or falsely inflate repair costs in some cases so they can increase rents above rent-regulation guidelines. The improvements can lead to rent increases of as much as 6 percent a year and can continue indefinitely, they say. POLITICO's Janaki Chadha .

THE FIRST ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THE 2020 STATE LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS HAVE EMERGED, AND THEY’RE TARGETING SENATE DEMOCRATS OVER THEIR ROLE in Amazon’s decision to withdraw from its planned Queens headquarters. The Senate Republican Campaign Committee has purchased 19 Facebook ads targeting eight Democrats since Friday, according to the social media site’s transparency portal. “25,000 lost jobs. $27 Billion in lost tax revenue,” says a typical version of the ads, this one targeting Sen. John Brooks of Long Island. “A massive economic boost for us New Yorkers and John Brooks and the Senate Democrats screwed it up. He cost us jobs, it should cost him his.” POLITICO's Bill Mahoney .

The plot was geared toward getting around city regulations that are intended to keep blocks of apartments from being turned into makeshift hotels that avoid lodging taxes and oversight. The crackdown on the empire last month was a milestone in the escalating battle between Airbnb and New York City — the company’s largest market in the country.” The New York Times' Luis Ferré-Sadurní .

According to Thompson, the populist party has mobilized the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote.","BURNABY—When Ivan Pak went to Maxime Bernier’s first rally in Vancouver last November, he says he was “inspired” by the new party leader’s clear platform and policy commitments. That’s the kind of leader Canada needs, he told Star Vancouver.

Bernier announced the “death of political correctness” via a Tweet last fall to his then 65,000 followers and launched the People’s Party of Canada, which has been gaining rapid traction. Widely viewed as aiming further right of the Conservative party, the PPC has been criticized for being anti-immigrant and espousing anti-globalist values and rhetoric. But Pak, a first-generation immigrant from China, dispels those critiques as myths. “Some people accuse the PPC of being a white people’s party of Canada, but for myself ... I learned to speak English here. I’ve been here 22 years,” he said on Thursday, holding up PPC signs waiting for Bernier to make his first appearance in Burnaby South since Monday’s byelection was called in the riding.

“PPC welcomes people like me to be part of their party as long as we share the same Canadian values.” But experts say core Canadian values are now divided and there’s very little common ground. Michael Valpy is a senior fellow in public policy at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and a former Globe and Mail journalist who has been tracking the rise of ordered populism in Canada — or what economists refer to as “drawbridge-up” thinking.

Nathaniel Allen, who supports the People's Party of Canada, drove from Mission, B.C., to attend a campaign event in Burnaby on Thursday. Allen, a former member of the BC Liberals, says he was disillusioned with politics for years until Maxime Bernier's party came along. ( Jesse Winter / Star Vancouver )

Its proponents are often hostile toward immigration, deeply pessimistic about their economic future, mostly male and mainly white, he said. At Bernier’s event on Thursday in Burnaby South, this demographic was also present. Nathaniel Allen, 30, told the Star he was a BC Liberal — the provincial party widely known to embrace conservative policies — 12 years ago until he lost interest. It wasn’t until the PPC came along that he found himself civically engaged.

“It just felt like the most pragmatic decision I could make,” he explained. Read more:

How Canadian populism is playing out in the Burnaby South byelection Burnaby South People’s Party of Canada candidate alleges Conservative Party is ‘smearing’ her Liberal candidate’s WeChat post draws criticism for singling out race of byelection opponent Jagmeet Singh A Star investigation found that far-right supporters have called on their members to infiltrate the PPC, whether the party is willing or not. As the extreme right has done elsewhere, they hope to move on a new party, bit by bit, to bring the political extreme toward the mainstream. Meanwhile, the yellow vest faction — which started as a labour movement in France but has expanded in Canada beyond economic concerns, delving into anti-globalism, nationalism, anti-government sentiment and xenophobia — looks like it’s here to stay. Bernier was there to greet the United We Roll convoy when it arrived in Ottawa last Tuesday. The former federal Conservative cabinet minister, standing beside a man in a yellow vest, told the crowd he was there to promote Canadian unity. Canadians are increasingly opposed to more immigration — and it remains to be seen how that will play out in October’s federal election, Valpy said. Anti-immigrant sentiments often depend on the makeup of neighbourhoods, he added, pointing to the suburban area surrounding Toronto, known as the 905 because of its area code, which is “quite strongly” anti-immigrant despite not being a white majority community. That’s because if communities are homogenous — for instance, predominantly white, brown or Asian — anti-immigrant views can emerge. However, Valpy said, if neighbourhoods are mixed, anti-immigrant views are unlikely. “Ethnic attachment is declining and has declined quite rapidly,” he explained in an interview, citing data from Ottawa-based pollster EKOS Research Associates. “It’s no longer important to us that all our friends are all white, or we live in a brown community.” Valpy said unless there is some shift in inequality or people’s sense that progress is lost, ordered populism is here for the long haul. According to Ivan Pak and the PPC, the principles guiding Canadian values are freedom, personal responsibility, respect and fairness. Pak was a vocal opponent of the provincial education inclusion program for sexual identity and gender fluidity. He ran unsuccessfully on that platform for school trustee in Richmond in last fall’s municipal election. As president of the PPC Richmond Centre EDA, he isn’t eligible to vote in Monday’s byelection. The PPC has promised to lower taxes, abolish corporate welfare and stop supply management. On Thursday, Bernier also said he would privatize Canada Post and abolish the CRTC. The party has formed electoral district associations in all of Canada’s 338 ridings and Bernier has said he will run a full slate of candidates in October’s general election.

Pak said he was no longer keen on the Conservatives because the party has a “lack of leadership ability” (referring to its leader, Andrew Scheer) and “no clean platform.” He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “When you ask a question in the House of Commons, he never answers it. Is the question period just a joke? It looks like drama,” he said. “Our country is in debt and that debt has to be paid somehow. It will be my children and grandchildren suffering.” Pak was one of many other Chinese-Canadians greeting Bernier when he visited his Burnaby South byelection candidate — and one of his first picks under the new PPC banner — Laura-Lynn Thompson. She is a former Christian radio host, anti-abortion activist and a vocal opponent of B.C.’s student education plan on sexual orientation and gender fluidity, with ties to several community churches. Thompson told the Star last week she’s been able to mobilize the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote — and those ties may explain why. During each byelection debate, Thompson directly appealed to prevalent anxieties in the riding about public safety as she repeatedly brought up the case of Marrisa Shen, a 13-year-old girl killed in a Burnaby South park in July 2017. A Syrian refugee has been charged with murder in her death.

Meanwhile, several PPC supporters at the event on Thursday told the Star they were “sick” of identity politics at play in Canada. Sherolinnah Eang said she became a full-fledged PPC supporter after hearing the messaging about “family values and free speech.” “This is the first time I’ve come out for something like this, and I’ve lived in Canada for 45 years,” she said. Burnaby has four distinct town “centres,” a long working-class history and a population density triple that of the region. Its demographics are increasingly young and non-white, according to the 2016 census, and the average age is several years below B.C.’s average, while 64 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority. On Thursday, Bernier argued diversity is not Canada’s strength — it’s unity. Asked how that message would land in such an ethnically diverse riding, he responded: “Yes, but they are Canadians first.” The response prompted cheers from PPC supporters, with several shouting: “I’m an immigrant.” Thompson, who uttered “Canadians first” at every byelection debate, will face off against federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — vying for his first seat in the House of Commons — Liberal Richard Lee, Conservative Jay Shin and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood on Monday in Burnaby South. Byelections will also be held that day in York—Simcoe, Ont. and in Outremont, Que. David Moscrop, author of the new book Too Dumb for Democracy? Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones, and a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Ottawa’s communications department, told the Star that while feelings of anti-globalism and xenophobia have always existed, they haven’t always had an electoral home. Moscrop said this is the perfect time for the PPC to do well because it can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate. And there’s enough disaffection, which could express itself as support for the right-wing party. “This party didn’t even exist 15 minutes ago, so if (Laura-Lynn Thompson) can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more likely PPC voters than would self-report ... because sometimes people won’t admit something to a pollster. But behind the privacy of the voting screen? Many may mark an X for that candidate.” Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food, culture and policy.

The NDP leader is running for a seat in the House of Commons in Burnaby South, one of three federal ridings holding byelections today.

Many New Democrats believe it’s a do-or-die contest – that Singh cannot lead his party in this fall’s general election if he can’t get himself a seat in Parliament.

READ MORE: Burnaby South byelection 2019 cheat sheet: A last-minute voter’s guide

Singh is hoping a victory tonight will give him much-needed visibility in the Commons in the run-up to the national vote in October, and put to rest grumbling within the NDP about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

But Singh’s problems go well beyond his lack of visibility on the main stage of federal politics. The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters – particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which has infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

READ MORE: What’s at stake for federal parties in Outremont byelection on Monday

While many NDP eyes will be glued to Burnaby South tonight, an arguably better gauge of the party’s election-year viability will be going on in Outremont – the Montreal riding vacated last summer by Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the so-called orange wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

The betting among political insiders is that the Liberals will retake Outremont, which would be a welcome boost for the governing party’s morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy – and a particularly bitter loss for the NDP. The symbolism of losing their erstwhile beachhead would only reinforce polls suggesting New Democrats are in danger of being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

But the blow would be softened, at least, if Singh is able to capture Burnaby South.

READ MORE: Liberal turmoil a ‘gift’ for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, expert says

It’s no sure thing. The B.C. riding is not a natural home for Singh, who formerly represented Brampton in the Ontario legislature. Nor is it a safe NDP riding: New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, who resigned to become mayor of Vancouver, took the riding in 2015 with just over 600 votes more than his Liberal opponent, with the Conservative candidate not far behind.

While the byelection is thought to be a three-way race, being a party leader should give Singh an edge. The fact that the Green party has chosen not to run a candidate should also help.

Moreover, the Liberals did themselves no favours by dumping their original candidate amid controversy over her suggestion that Singh being of “Indian descent” could help her win. The current Liberal contender, Richard T. Lee, could face headwinds of a different kind, created by the ongoing furor over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – who represents a nearby Vancouver riding – to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

WATCH: Unpacking the politics of the SNC-Lavalin affair

The third byelection is being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. He won with a healthy 50 per cent of the votes in 2015, and the Tories are expected to easily hang on tonight.

All three contests will give the Conservatives a glimpse of what, if any damage, they might sustain from the advent of the breakaway People’s Party of Canada, formed by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier. The byelections mark the first time Bernier’s fledgling party will actually be put to an electoral test.",NDP’s Jagmeet Singh fights for a seat during federal byelections - Global News,Globalnews.ca,https://globalnews.ca/news/4995759/ndp-jagmeet-singh-federal-byelections/

They also discussed efforts to end the Syrian conflict.","Syrian President Bashar Assad has visited Iran, his closest regional ally, for the first time since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, state media reported Monday.



Assad met with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, as well as other top officials in Tehran. It was a rare foreign trip for Assad, who has visited Russia twice since the outbreak of the conflict eight years ago.

Read more: Syria conflict — What do the US, Russia, Turkey and Iran want?

Khamenei praised Assad for strengthening the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah against US and Western plans for the region.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran sees helping Syria's government and nation as support for the resistance movement and is deeply proud of doing it,"" Khamenei said.

""The creation of the buffer that the Americans are seeking to create in Syria is an example of these dangerous conspiracies which must be strongly denounced and resisted,"" Khamenei added.

Syrian state TV reported that Assad ""thanked the Islamic Republic's leadership and people for what they have given to Syria during the war."" The presidency said ""both sides expressed their satisfaction with the strategic levels reached between the two countries in all fields.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on 'I feel nothing' On February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran from exile in France. When a reporter asked him how he felt upon his return to Iran, Khomeini replied: ""Nothing — I feel nothing."" Some analysts interpreted his remarks as the Shiite leader's idea about embarking on a ""divine mission"" where emotions hardly mattered.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The Shah ran out of time Two months before Khomeini's return to Iran, an estimated six to nine million people took to the streets in the country's major cities. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, compared to the violent September 8, 1978, protests. The Shah regime, headed by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, had realized that its time in power was over and that they could not stop Khomeini's return.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Even women rooted for Khomeini The revolutionary mood was so intense in Tehran that even many women celebrated Khomeini's return, ignoring the fact that Khomeini had slammed Shah's measures for women's emancipation in exile. In 1963, the Shah of Iran granted women the right to vote.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on A spectacle of exuberance In 1971, the Shah and his wife Farah Diba (seen in the picture) staged a lavish spectacle on the ancient site of Persepolis to mark the ""2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarchy."" Many heads of state attended the event. Khomeini, in his message from exile, condemned the monarchy as ""cruel, evil and un-Islamic.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Exile and death Under pressure from the Islamic Revolution, the Shah (left) had left Iran on January 16, 1979. After spending time in several countries, he succumbed to cancer on July 27, 1980 in Cairo, Egypt.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Consolidating power In the beginning, women's rights were not a major issue for the Islamic revolutionaries. They only imposed hardline Islam after consolidating their victory.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Soldiers join the revolution Upon Khomeini's return to Iran in 1979, the military did not confront the protesters. On February 11, the army declared itself neutral. Despite that, the revolutionaries executed several generals in February and April.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on New government Soon after his return, Khomeini declared the monarchy, the previous government and parliament illegal, and said he would appoint a government ""because of the fact that this nation believes in me."" According to Iran experts, it was not self-deception but reality.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The liberal face of the revolution Mehdi Bazargan, a scholar and pro-democracy activist, had campaigned against the Pahlavi dynasty, for which he had been incarcerated for several years. Khomeini appointed him as his first prime minister, although Bazargan was critical of him as well. Bazargan had called Khomeini a ""turbaned Shah"" after a meeting with the Ayatollah in Paris. He remained in office for only nine months.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Occupation of the US Embassy In November 1979, radical Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took the embassy staff hostage. The students were fearful of Shah's return to power with US help. Khomeini took advantage of the situation. He dismissed his opponents as ""US allies.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Ali Khamenei – guardian of the revolution In 1989, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was elected by the expert council to succeed Khomeini. Khamenei, to this date, has the ultimate power over all state institutions. Although the 79-year-old does not have the same charisma as his predecessor, he represents the policies of Iranian hardliners who refuse to reform the system and continue to persecute dissidents.

Assad takes victory lap

Assad has retaken major cities and largely defeated rebels seeking to oust him with the support of Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

The regime now controls most of the population and about two-thirds of the country, excluding a jihadi-controlled enclave in Idlib, Turkish zones in the north and a part of the country controlled by US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces. Assad has vowed to bring all territory under the state's sovereignty.

Sitting in the room during Assad's meeting with Khamenei was General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force — the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which has provided the Syrian regime with military and financial support.

During their meeting, Rouhani assured Assad that ""Tehran will be alongside Damascus in the stabilization, return of refugees and internal political process.""

The two presidents also discussed efforts by Russia, Iran and Turkey to end the Syrian conflict.

Iranian-backed Shiite militias have carved out a major role in Syria's security apparatus, and Tehran and Damascus have in recent months signed a string of economic deals that are likely to further increase Iran's long-term presence in the country.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Rise of Hezbollah Hezbollah, or Party of God, was conceived by Muslim clerics in the 1980s in response to the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in 1982. The Shiite group has a political and military wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization National support against Israel Hezbollah emerged in the 1980s as an amalgamation of Shiite militias and played a major role in the Lebanese civil war. It used guerrilla warfare to drive Israeli forces out of South Lebanon — Israel withdrew in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought another war in 2006. Its defense of Lebanon against Israel had won it cross-sectarian support and acceptance in Lebanese society.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Backed by Iran Since its creation, Hezbollah has received military, financial and political support from Iran and Syria. Today, Hezbollah's military wing is more powerful than Lebanon's own army and has become a major regional paramilitary force.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Political apparatus Hezbollah turned its focus to politics following the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. It represents a large section of the Lebanese Shiite population and is allied with other sectarian groups, including Christians. Their political development has mostly come under Hassan Nasrallah (pictured), who became the group's leader in 1992.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Armed wing Unlike other parties in Lebanon's multi-sided 1975-1990 civil war, Hezbollah did not disband its armed wing. Some Lebanese political groups, such as Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future Movement, want Hezbollah to put down its arms. Hezbollah argues its militant wing is necessary to defend against Israel and other external threats.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Terror group? A number of countries and bodies, including the United States, Israel, Canada and the Arab League, consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, Australia and the European Union differentiate between its legitimate political activities and its militant wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Hezbollah enters Syria's civil war Hezbollah has been one of the main backers of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. Its entrance into the war helped save Assad, one of its chief patrons; secured weapons supply routes from Syria and formed a buffer zone around Lebanon against Sunni militant groups it feared would take over Syria. As a result it has won considerable support from Shiite communities in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Sectarianism Lebanon has long been at the center of regional power struggles, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, Hezbollah's military and political ascendancy, as well as its intervention in Syria, have also helped stoke Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions in Lebanon and across the region.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Renewed conflict with Israel? Iran and Hezbollah have increased their political and military strength through the war in Syria. Israel views this as a threat and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on Iran/Hezbollah targets in Syria. Israel has vowed to not let Iran and Hezbollah create a permanent presence in Syria. There is growing concern of another war between Hezbollah and Israel that could draw in Iran. Author: Chase Winter

Tensions with Israel, US

Iran's growing influence in Syria has increased the prospect of a conflict with Israel, which has carried out dozens of attacks on Iranian forces, Shiite militia and Hezbollah.

US President Donald Trump announced in December that all American forces would leave Syria, but US officials recently said between 200-400 troops would remain in the country to support US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and prevent a resurgence of the ""Islamic State."" The US also has a base at al-Tanf, near the Iraqi border, where troops are expected to stay.

The decision to maintain a US troop presence is intended to prevent clashes between US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces and NATO ally Turkey. It is also viewed as an attempt to stop the Assad regime and Iran-backed militia from widening their grip over more of Syria's territory.

The SNC-Lavalin matter already sounded like puff pastry when it first appeared and now it is a crumb, a particle. The allegation was that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his staff were concerned less about legal niceties than about huge job losses should SNC-Lavalin be prosecuted over dodgy money in Libya — is there any other kind? — and perhaps lose 10 years of federal contracts. Out of concern for the public good, they may have mentioned this to the justice minister/attorney-general, who can decide, if she chooses, to defer corporate prosecutions. This whole matter is down to whether they talked to her forcefully or gently. Did they hint or did they hammer? Who knows? More importantly, who cares?

“I worry about my country right now, I’m deeply concerned about my country right now and its politics and where it’s headed. I worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election and we’re working hard on that. I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence, when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’ in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassination. I’m worried that someone is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign.” I too have worried about Trudeau’s town halls being a danger to him. I’d worry about Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s if he had any. Scheer always looks like a man who has just put eyedrops in and is in that blinking transitory state. Pleasant enough, he is easily led into traps laid by the extreme far-right. Why else would he have appeared with the racist yellow vests on Parliament Hill? Wernick, who has served under many prime ministers, abhorred yellow-vest-style remarks by a Saskatchewan senator that would “incite people to drive trucks over people, after what happened in Toronto last summer” simply because they were Liberal. “I worry about the trolling from the vomitorium of social media entering the open media arena,” he said. We do too. Wernick said he most worries about Canadians “losing faith in the institutions of governance in this country” and doubting that Canada is still, as Chrystia Freeland has put it, a rule-of-law country. He then crisply explained the SNC-Lavalin matter. The rule of law is safe, he concluded. The discussions were appropriate and ethical. There is no two-tiered justice. Deferred prosecution agreements can be rationally applied. In other words, there is no there there. I agree. The SNC-Lavalin matter was a media creation in an election year, possibly done inadvertently to gin things up. It became a sly collective patchwork of insinuation.

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The struggling head of Canada's left-leaning New Democrats, an opposition party that competes with the Liberals of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will try to win a parliamentary seat on Monday amid speculation he could be ousted if he loses.

Jagmeet Singh, a practicing Sikh, made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau's chances become.

Singh is contesting a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia. Results should become available at around 11 p.m. Eastern (0400 GMT Tuesday).

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

In unusually frank remarks, Mulcair said last month that ""it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Singh to stick around"" if he lost on Monday.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau's office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

Singh and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer are both calling for a public inquiry into the matter. Wilson-Raybould is due to testify to the House of Commons justice committee on Tuesday.

Both Craft and her husband are major supporters of President Donald Trump.

The pick gives the former Republican commentator Max Boot major concerns that the Trump administration will once again become a laughingstock on the world stage.

Writing in the Washington Post, Boot points out that historically that position was filled by the major statesmen of their time — major historical figures including Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson. He notes that the President’s first pick, Nikki Haley, was a continuation of that legacy. “She was a former governor who has been talked about as a possible presidential contender, and she acquitted herself admirably at the United Nations,” Boot writes.

Her initial replacement, Heather Nauert, did not have an equally relevant resume. Nauert had previously worked at Fox News.

Craft is even more problematic, argues Boot.

“Kelly Knight Craft was chosen to be U.S. ambassador to Canada, and now to the United Nations, because she and her third husband, the billionaire coal baron Joe Craft, are mega MAGA-donors,” he writes.

“According to The Post, they gave ‘about $1.5 million to GOP candidates in 2016, including $270,800 to Trump’s campaign committee or his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee.'”

He observes that Craft appears to be politically connected to the Trumps and the Republican leadership. She previously served as ambassador to Canada.

“Perhaps just as important from this president’s perspective, they are also ‘repeat, high-paying customers at Trump’s hotel in Washington.’ Craft’s other recommendation is that, as a Kentucky native, she is a supporter of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and is said to be friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.”

“If confirmed, Craft will arrive at the United Nations as a laughingstock — just like her boss,” writes Boot, who left the Republican Party due to their embrace of President Donald Trump.

Clement made his first post to Instagram Wednesday since he resigned as a Conservative MP in November.

Wednesday’s post includes a picture of him standing in the new House of Commons with a statement thanking his followers for getting him through the “dark valley” after the scandal broke.

In November Clement admitted he shared explicit images online with someone he believed to be a consenting female adult but who then turned around and demanded he pay 50,000 euros to prevent the images from going public.

He initially claimed it was a one-time lapse in judgement but when it became clear it wasn’t, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked him to resign from the party caucus.

Clement now sits as an independent and says he is getting back to his duties as the MP for Parry Sound-Muskoka.

“I had a severe personal crisis and it manifested itself in the irrational behaviour that became apparent and for which I take full responsibility,” Clement says on Instagram.

He also says he was “getting the counselling I needed and working on my family life” during his time away from office.

Earlier this year, two men in the Ivory Coast were arrested and charged with trying to blackmail Clement.

The RCMP is continuing to work with the Ivory Coast’s cyber crimes unit.

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The Greatest Constitutional Crisis Since the Civil War

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse becausein fired FBI Director James Comeys formulationa higher duty than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Orin fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabes wordsthe threat was too great. Nevermind that the nature of the threat was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offendersand Offenses

The extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureaus ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as an insurance policy against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming presidents reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trumps supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public Attention

The special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the high crimes and misdemeanors required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the presidents enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his higher duty, lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

And now we have Andrew McCabes proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the Polls

This entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsels inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the elections result.

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

55,Empty,2019-02-25T19:00:57Z,Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination must come out against the filibuster.,"It would take decades before senators realized that without such a motion, there was no way for a simple majority to forcibly end debate, what we now call “cloture.” It was possible for a single member to block anything he opposed, and it took unanimous consent to stop him.

The filibuster was born. But the small size of the Senate and informal rules around deliberation meant it wasn’t used in earnest until the late 19th century, as American politics became more polarized around party and ideology, and informal rules around speaking and debate could not accommodate the increased pace of activity in the chamber.

The modern filibuster began to take shape in 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson used war demands to pressure the Senate into adopting cloture and a supermajority threshold for ending debate (at the time, it required two-thirds of the Senate ). But even with reform, the filibuster remained a powerful tool for “tedious delays” and “contemptible compromises of the public good.”

In the 20th century, recalcitrant senators used the filibuster to block or delay anti-lynching laws, bans on poll taxes, bans on literacy tests, and other civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was nearly killed by a filibuster. In recent decades, routine use of the filibuster has made it difficult for presidents to pursue their agendas and for Congress to pass major legislation. In turn, it has obscured democratic accountability and made voters feel less efficacious — when voting majorities to power isn’t enough to change the way things are, it’s fair to wonder if electoral politics is worth the trouble.

We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won’t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies — to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care — will go entirely through the Democratic Party.

As it stands, Democrats would be lucky to win a Senate majority in 2020, much less the supermajority needed to end a filibuster. For the party to have any hope at actually implementing its agenda, the filibuster needs to be either reformed or eliminated. And the first step toward that is litigating the issue in public to help voters see the cost of preserving this rule, which could put pressure on other senators if a movement forms to end it.

The Senate was built to govern, not to spend its time in endless deliberation, and the legislative filibuster makes that difficult, if not impossible. It does so in ways that typically disadvantage progressives and reformers, and which will cripple the next Democratic administration, as it nearly did the previous one. Any potential political danger — Republicans could easily attack an anti-filibuster push as the first step toward taking away our cars, cows and airplanes — is outweighed by the power that comes with being able to credibly connect the election outcome to a particular policy. Give me the votes, and I’ll give you this plan.

If Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand or any of the other Democratic candidates are actually serious about their policy agendas, the only choice they have is to abandon their attachment to this arcane procedure and lead their party to a firm consensus against a rule that was never supposed to exist.

(CNN) On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history. President Donald Trump has invoked national emergency power to secure federal funds for a wall that Congress refused to pay for. He has done so based on an alleged crisis at the border that almost no reputable expert agrees is real.

""The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates,"" proclaimed 58 prominent ex-national security officials who oppose what the President is trying to do. They made this assertion -- to be entered into the Congressional Record -- in a 13-page joint statement issued Monday.

Even some Republican loyalists understand that if President Trump takes this step to finance a border wall, future presidents in both parties will have sufficient justification to enact policy to tackle their goals, including initiatives on climate change, without congressional support.

Congress has the power to stop President Trump if it wants to; it doesn't need the courts to step in. If the House and Senate vote for a resolution revoking this use of emergency power, with sufficient votes to override an expected presidential veto, Trump has to back down. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , Congress gave itself the power to restrain the president.

But President Trump is tweeting out warnings to his fellow Republicans. ""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" he tweeted Monday morning. In a follow up , he asked: ""Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?""

The good news for President Trump is that the odds are on his side. Most Republicans won't go along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Although a handful of Republicans have indicated they opposed the emergency declaration, most have not. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass legislation reversing Trump's emergency order, but it is not even likely that the resolution will make its way through the Senate, where the Republicans hold power.

This vote is the latest in a series of critical moments since January 2017 in which congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be the foundation of the Trump presidency rather than passive bystanders. Republicans have made active decisions that strengthened the President's hand or allowed him to use his authority in unprecedented fashion because it seemed to serve their political interest.

When Republicans did not censure President Trump after his stunning failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the party showed that it had the President's back . When the party ended his controversial first year by voting in favor of Trump's massive corporate tax cut, it handed him a crucial legislative victory at a key point in his presidency -- one that greatly improved his standing with the Republican electorate.

When then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes released a memo making pointed accusations about the motives of the FBI, he and the Republicans on his committee joined in on the President's ongoing assault on law enforcement institutions -- an apparent attempt to discredit the investigations into his campaign and presidency.

Most recently, the Republicans allowed President Trump to shut down the federal government for the longest period in American history , even though the Senate had reached an agreement over the budget, so that the administration could score political points with the base. Government workers went without pay so that the party could start setting up for the 2020 campaign.

In announcing the deal to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the President turning to emergency power -- only days after expressing his staunch opposition to such a move.

This week's vote might be the most important of all these enabling moments. If the Republicans don't vote to stand between Trump and this aggressive use of presidential power, they are giving consent to the President to unilaterally siphon money from programs that Congress has funded into a program that Congress refused to support.

Republicans are increasingly erasing any daylight between themselves and President Trump, and it may be about to happen again. This is his party, and more importantly, this practice has been an active decision by Republican elected officials.

When Trump's presidency is over, Republicans will spend many years reckoning with the decisions they have made. Their voting record, their silence and their statements of support will all be in the history books and they will continue to redefine the party of Lincoln and Reagan, which has become the party of Trump, for decades to come.",The big test GOP is facing on Trump's 'national emergency',CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/25/opinions/national-emergency-vote-zelizer/index.html

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to run for president.

Buffett made the comments on Monday morning in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box.

Both men are among the richest people in the world.

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to announce a 2020 presidential bid.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say, 'I'm for him,' and I think he would be a very good president,"" he said in an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick.

""He and I disagree on some things, but I think that he knows how to run things. I think that he's got the right goals for America, he understands people, he understands the market system, and he understands the problems of people that don't fit well into the market system.""

Buffett, who on Saturday released his annual letter to shareholders, told CNBC that he wasn't a Democrat through and through, though over the last three decades he's voted for more Democrats than Republicans.

""I'm not a card-carrying Democratic, but I never have been,"" Buffett said. ""I've voted for a fair number of Republicans, I've given money to Republicans.""

Both Buffett and Bloomberg are among the richest people in the world, according to Forbes. Buffett's net worth, as of Forbes' 2018 ranking, was $84 billion, while Bloomberg's was $50 billion.

While it's long been rumored that Bloomberg would run for the highest US office, he told the Associated Press in early February that he would decide by the end of this month if he would enter the race. He officially registered as a Democrat — again — last October.

Bloomberg has rejected the notion that he likely wouldn't enter the 2020 presidential race if Joe Biden, the former vice president, announced a bid.

""My decision doesn't depend on what other people are going to do,"" Bloomberg told the AP. ""My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference.""

In his interview with CNBC Buffett also voiced his displeasure about Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, announcing he would consider running for president in the upcoming election.

""If he ran as an independent, I think he would take votes away from any Democrat, including Bloomberg, if he were running, so I think it would be a real mistake for him to run,"" Buffett said. ""I think, generally, third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view.""

He added: ""I hope no third-party candidate runs that pulls any significant amount of votes. I mean, there will always be a couple of people that file, but I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

60,Empty,2019-02-25T13:35:03Z,Britain's parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.

With just 32 days until the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU, the options include a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit or no Brexit at all.

May is pursuing a renegotiated deal, but faces a growing threat that she will need to choose to delay Brexit or be forced to do so by British lawmakers.

Below is a summary of what is due to happen next:

“HIGH NOON”- FEB. 27

On Tuesday, May will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Wednesday to debate and vote on the way forward.

Several lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party, including some ministers, have indicated this will be the last chance they give her to find a way through the impasse.

Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Yvette Cooper plans to use that debate to seek lawmakers’ support for legislation that would force the government to decide between leaving without a deal or extending the Article 50 negotiation period if it has not had a deal approved by March 13.

VOTE ON A REVISED DEAL - BY MARCH 12

May has promised to bring back a revised deal to parliament and hold a vote on whether to approve it by March 12.

Before a vote on the exit agreement in January, which May lost heavily, parliament held five days of debate. It is not clear whether there would be another lengthy debate this time.

May is required by law to get parliamentary approval for any exit deal.

EU SUMMIT - MARCH 21-22

EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels. This could be an opportunity for an eleventh-hour deal or it would be the last chance to agree an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period and delay Brexit to avoid no-deal disruption. If the summit goes badly and there is still no deal in sight then May will have to decide whether to delay or go for a no-deal Brexit.

LAST WEEKEND - MARCH 23-24

If a deal is seen as viable at the summit, officials could work through the weekend to nail down the details with a final deal - and a possible extension to June 30 conditional on British parliamentary approval - announced on Sunday, March 24-Monday, March 25.

FINAL WEEK - MARCH 25-29

If a deal could be clinched, then the British parliament could vote on it, possibly on March 26. The European Parliament could ratify the deal that week.

EXIT DAY - MARCH 29?

If May does not get a deal approved by parliament by March 29, Britain faces a disorderly exit or may be forced to seek an extension of Article 50 to give more time to reach an agreement. It is not certain the EU would agree to this.

Some lawmakers, including opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have said it is now “inevitable” that the government will have to seek an extension, as there will not be enough time to pass the legislation for Britain’s exit before March 29.

The leader of Britain’s lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, has said the date might need to be pushed back by a couple of weeks.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS

The bloc will vote to elect a new European Parliament on May 23-26. The new chamber would sit from July 2, a date that is shaping up to be the EU’s limit for any extension of Article 50.

The EU says Britain would have to organize European Parliament elections on its soil if it were to delay Brexit beyond that as otherwise its people would be deprived of their democratic representation while still being in the EU. The bloc fears Britain would not do that.

Some in the EU also fear that, should Britain vote, it would elect a staunchly eurosceptic representation to the European Parliament that is already expected to have a larger contingent of EU critics influencing the bloc’s policies.

The main centre-right group, whose leaders include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could also lose its place as the biggest in the European Parliament; UK Labour seats could help the European Socialists overtake the People’s Party, from which British Conservatives broke away to sit separately.

DELAYED BREXIT - JUNE 30 OR LATER

If a Brexit extension is sought, one date being talked about in Brussels is June 30, the Sunday before the new European Parliament sits at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on July 2. Some argue for an exit before May 23, the day Britain would otherwise be due to hold an EU election.",Factbox: Through the Brexit Looking Glass - What happens next?,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-whatnext-factbox-idUSKCN1QE1P3

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say I'm for him,"" Buffett told Becky Quick in a ""Squawk Box"" Interview from Omaha, Nebraska. ""I think he would be a very good president.""

Buffett said he's never been a card-carrying Democrat, pointing out that he's voted for Democratic candidates and Republican candidates over the years. He said neither party has an edge on virtue.

Without elaborating, Buffett said he and Bloomberg disagree on some things.

However, he added, ""I think that he knows how to run things. I think he's got the right goals for America. He understands people. He understands the market system. And he understands the problems of people"" not in the market.

Bloomberg, 77, is seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Bloomberg ran as an independent during his last successful campaign, when was re-elected mayor for a third term in 2009. He was a Republican in his first two terms. Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from independent to Democrat in October.

In a recent email to CNBC, top Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson hinted at how much his boss would look to invest into his own potential campaign.

""Mike spent more than $100 million in his last mayor's race. Last time I looked, NYC is a fraction of the size of the country as a whole,"" Wolfson said.

For years, Bloomberg had flirted with an independent run for president. But he now believes it would be a mistake. In a January statement, after former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz floated a possible third-party run, Bloomberg said, ""In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That's a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford to run it now.""

In Monday's interview, Buffett said he agrees with Bloomberg that a Schultz third-party would take votes away from any Democrat.

Making no evaluation of Schultz as a potential candidate, Buffett added, ""I think generally [that] third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view, and so they pull more people away that would otherwise go with the second-best with that view.""

""So I hope no third-party candidate runs,"" he added. ""I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

Buffett was interviewed from the floor of the Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart, following Saturday's release of his widely read annual shareholder letter.

Correction: This story was revised to correct when Bloomberg registered as a Democrat. It was last year.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces has slowed down its offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw at least 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist bastion.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped inside less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, said thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali told AFP.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes Monday's arrivals would be the last.

""We want it to be over,"" one of them, 29-year-old Mazloum, told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Potent threat' -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar said the SDF would announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Iraq's President Barham Saleh warned Monday the jihadist threat remains high, despite gains made against IS over the past year.

""We've seen in the past that the mission is yet to be accomplished,"" Saleh said in a Paris speech, evoking the infamous 2003 Iraq claim by former US president George W. Bush.

""You have many, many extremists in many pockets in Syria, causing a potent threat to Syria, Iraq and the Western world,"" he said.

- Secret transfers -

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" said Omar, describing Al-Hol as overwhelmed by the arrivals.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, according to the International Rescue Committee.

The Observatory on Monday said 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq during the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

The Iraqi president said Monday his country's courts would prosecute 13 suspected French jihadists, who were turned over to Iraq after being captured by the SDF.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-162952545.html

Wealthy donors were a big part of how Barack Obama became president. Employees of Goldman Sachs were rivaled only by those of the University of California in powering his record-breaking fundraising totals in 2008. As the insurgent candidate wrestled control of the Democratic Party from the establishment—including frontrunner Hillary Clinton—that year, his inspiring speeches and consistent opposition to the Iraq War were obviously defining elements of a historic candidacy. But so were the eye-popping donations. He broke and then broke again the records for fundraising in a given month, setting the tone for the general election against John McCain with a $66 million haul in August of that year. And while small-dollar donors and the activist base they symbolized were instrumental in his success, Obama also glad-handed at plenty of fancy, exclusive receptions for rich donors both during and after his 2008 victory.

For Democrats hoping to follow in his footsteps, that path toward victory now looks a lot less appealing.

When Bernie Sanders ran for president four years ago, he made a point of largely shunning traditional high-dollar fundraisers, insisting he didn't need or want billionaires' money. It also might have been true that he couldn't get it: The self-declared democratic socialist from Vermont wanted to break up big banks like Goldman, hike taxes on the rich, and dismantle some of the late capitalist infrastructure that he argued was behind soaring income inequality and a broken, for-profit healthcare system. Sanders actually did have the occasional supporter on Wall Street, but with populist anger at Obama's failure to prosecute bankers behind the financial crisis still raging, and the lingering effects of the mortgage crisis and Great Recession still tangible, Sanders could forgo the most lucrative fundraising events and rely on a steady stream of mostly online support from fans. That strategy already seems to be panning out for him this go-around: Sanders raised nearly $6 million in the first 24 hours after announcing his 2020 candidacy last week.

Now Elizabeth Warren is making a point of joining him on the high road. As the New York Times reported Monday, the 2020 contender announced she would skip private, VIP-style fundraisers. She also plans to avoid the ""call time,"" the term for the common practice of politicians working the phones to plead for money from rich people.

""That means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren said in an email to her fans. “It means that wealthy donors won’t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.""

This makes sense given that Warren has for years positioned herself as opponent of the ultra-wealthy and Wall Street.

""Her ceasing VIP fundraisers with mega donors is consistent with the messaging she's been using in campaign, and at this early point in the race, the energy is focused on generating excitement from the base and distinguishing each candidate's campaign from the rest of the pack,"" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the influence watchdog the Center for Responsive Politics.

As Krumholz noted, it's also fair to assume she isn't actually passing on all that much money here; the party's wealthiest donors might be predisposed to back, say, Kamala Harris, or Kirsten Gillibrand, or Cory Booker, or (if and when he gets in) Joe Biden. All of them have been dinged by the left for relatively neoliberal stances on some issues, even if they have also inched leftward and embraced policies like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal to stay abreast of activist orthodoxy. (Gillibrand also declared she wasn't going to take money from corporate PACs, though she'll apparently still take money from individuals connected to the finance industry.)

Which brings us to what this is really about: Warren is sending a message, like the one Sanders has been sending for years now, to the party's most engaged partisans. After all, her move came just a week after the Times reported that a coterie of her rivals, including Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, and Cory Booker, ""auditioned"" before super-wealthy Obama donors, hoping to win their support.

It remains to be seen how much the larger universe of Democratic voters actually cares about who a candidate's donors are. But polling for years now has tended to find large majorities of Americans think the government is too focused on the needs of the rich and not enough on the poor and middle-class, and that money holds too much sway in their democracy.

Warren and Sanders are helping lay down a marker for their competitors, who will have to defend their own practices of holding fundraisers and taking money from industries the Democratic base isn't a fan of. Fundraising has been a consistent issue among those involved in Democratic politics, with a contentious fight over donations from the oil and gas industry unfolding last year in the Democratic National Committee. (The DNC ultimately decided to accept such donations.) In 2008, Obama made a show of skipping out on corporate PAC and lobbyist money, though he obviously wasn't actually missing out on all that much. In 2016, Clinton seemed to be on the side of accepting donations from anyone who would give them, leading to attacks from Trump about her family foundation's work and her paid speeches before audiences of bankers—even as he soaked up dark money donations from self-interested financial titans.

Whether Trump's attacks were fair, this time around the Democratic nominee may be someone who rejects the whole system of donors that Clinton was enmeshed in. If nothing else, the party is set for a real debate—with Warren and Sanders in particular poised to pressure their rivals—about who gets a voice in their government, and how much that voice costs them.

""It's a battle,"" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, VICE contributor, and critic of the party's coziness with entrenched financial power, said in an email when I asked if Warren's move meant Obama donors were losing control of the party. ""To paraphrase Churchill: It isn't the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning.""

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

Hisham al-Hashemi, an Iraqi expert with intimate knowledge of the issue, said the transfer had taken place in coordination with the US-led coalition fighting IS.

- Criticism of international response -

The mass outpouring of men, women and children from the IS foothold has overwhelmed the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp, six hours north of Baghouz.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" Omar said.

The International Rescue Committee said Friday that new arrivas had pushed the camp's population to over 45,000, exacerbating already dire conditions at the crammed facility.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, the IRC said.

A warehouse fire on Friday caused by a gas cylinder explosion ""destroyed 200 family tents"" and five larger ones and injured 16 workers, it said.

65,Empty,2019-02-25T06:42:23Z,Elections are the hinge connecting social dynamics to India's liberal democratic structures.,"The paradox of the coexistence of democracy and mass poverty is deeper in India than in many other societies. Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

First of all, the institutional design of Indian democracy (parliamentary system, asymmetrical federalism, flexible Constitution amendment) is not “demos-constraining” in that it does not put significant obstacles to the democratic popular will. There are not too many veto points that might account for the failure of floor-securing social policies to be legislated and implemented.

Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

Second, the party system is intensely competitive with very high electoral volatility. The first-past-the-post system accentuates the effect of voters’ volatility into dramatic change in seats and government formation. Though the level of volatility has come down in this decade as compared to the previous one, a ruling party in an Indian state has just about a 50% chance of coming back to power. Parties cannot afford to be complacent and overlook issues that might concern a significant proportion of population.

Third, the state capacity in India is higher than most comparable poor countries; it still commands the force to impose its will and is not crippled by absence of resources to meet some of its key projects. All this makes it even more intriguing that the ruling parties/coalitions should not (be able to) muster adequate political will to carry out anti-poverty policies.

Finally, what makes it truly intriguing is that the poor have not opted out of democratic politics in India, at least not from routine participation in electoral politics.

…

Why elections have gained primacy in Indian democracy

Across countries in terms of the impact of the electoral system, the structure of political choices offered by the party system, the social basis of political preferences, agenda-setting and public opinion formation, the invisible role of issues and ideologies, interests and identities are seen to be the keys to making sense of elections.

Yet we simply assume that elections perform the same role everywhere. The end result of this similarity is that the experience of electoral politics in societies like India is interpreted in the light of the narrow historical experience of Western Europe and North America.

Hence the need to understand the distinctiveness of the Indian experience of elections.

One of the first things that strikes any observer of Indian elections is their centrality in India’s political life. Banners, posters, and crowds fill the streets; massive processions and rallies are a norm; the media is full of election news and every street corner is buzzing with political gossip. Though on a steady decline of late, this kind of visibility in Indian elections symbolises the pivotal role elections have come to play in Indian politics.

If tension between pre-existing social form and borrowed legal-political structure provides the basic frame for understanding Indian democracy, the history of Indian politics is an attempt by millions of ordinary people to write their own political agenda in an alien script.

An election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy.

An encounter such as this, if it is to lead to meaningful outcomes, requires bridges or hinges that connect the two different worlds.

The institution of elections came to perform this crucial role in India. It became the hinge that connected the existing social dynamics to the new political structures of liberal democracy, allowing for reciprocal influence. An election is often the site for a fusion of popular beliefs and political practices with high institutions of governance.

Thus an election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy. This is the moment when the legal-constitutional order of liberal democracy makes contact with the messy social and political reality of India. The “formal” sector is highly visible, it leads a legal-constitutional existence, it involves “civil society” groups and NGOs or a certain segment of political parties, it speaks a familiar modern language, mobilises secular identities and is easy to incorporate into a global register of democracy, even if it draws modest energy and participation.

Every political actor is aware of another “informal” sector, often seen as a source of embarrassment. Political organisations and movements that inhibit this sector speak a homespun hybrid language and fall back upon identity-based mobilisation. Though political practices in this sector lead an invisible, often paralegal, existence below the radar, this sector remains the most happening political site in terms of popular mobilisation and energy. The chasm that separates the two worlds and the absence or non-functioning of the other possible bridges has resulted in the unusual salience of the institution of elections.

This unique role is what accounts for the continued dynamism of the electoral process in India, while a number of other imported institutions and processes are floundering.

A festival of collective identity

Elections in India perform many more functions. For a postcolonial country like India, successful elections are still a symbol of a national political community, something of a festival of collective identity. For the poor and the marginalised, who are excluded from the normal functioning of the state, elections are an affirmation of their citizenship and are seen as a sacred ritual of political equality. Notwithstanding a robust media that routinely uses public opinion polls, elections are still the principal site for the dissemination of political ideas and information and also the only reliable method to gauge public opinion on the big issues facing the country.

Elections force political parties to consider ideas, interests, and entities that do not lend themselves to easy aggregation through instrumentalities of the “organised” sector. Thus, elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections are also an occasion for settling, unsettling or resettling local equations of social dominance and the arena of struggles for social identity and dignity. Elections are a site for contestation for social dominance in a locality, leading to assertion by dominant social groups and protests by subaltern groups.

Attempts by clever political entrepreneurs to manufacture a social majority often involve building a local coalition of castes and communities. This often leads to an invention of community boundaries and sometimes the jerrymandering of settled boundaries. In a micro as well as macro setting, elections are an occasion for distribution and redistribution of resources. This is the time for patronage distribution as well as the occasion for the ordinary citizens to collect their “dues” from the political class.

All this accounts for the festival-like character of the Indian elections and the fierceness with which they are contested here. At the same time, this compression of multiple decisions into a single act also results in an under-emphasis on the representational functions of elections.

This is a week replete with challenges for President Donald Trump.

He faces a second summit with North Korea’s leader, a Democratic challenge to his emergency border declaration and public testimony from a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian election meddling, which could be nearing completion.

Mueller: Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer who has said the president directed him to make illegal hush money payments, is set to testify on what he knows about the 2016 campaign. Border: House Democrats have set a vote for tomorrow on a resolution to block Trump’s emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern U.S. Border with Mexico. The measure will force Republicans to take a stand on whether the president exceeded his authority over federal spending. Summit: The president said yesterday he doesn’t expect to lift sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s regime, as he prepares for a summit with the North Korean leader this week on U.S. demands that Pyongyang end its nuclear program.

Another pressing issue has already been punted. Trump said late yesterday that he’ll extend Friday’s deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, citing “substantial progress” in the latest round of trade talks in Washington.

Global Headlines

Venezuela standoff | U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet opposition leader Juan Guaido in Bogota today and plans to announce new actions against Venezuela that may include forms of economic or diplomatic pressure, according to an administration official. Guaido’s efforts to deliver aid convoys to Venezuela from Colombia this weekend were violently quashed by forces loyal to Nicolas Maduro, but nothing has really changed on the ground. The nation is still hungry, scared and wondering what comes next.

Raising the stakes | Theresa May again put off a final parliamentary ballot on her Brexit agreement, this time until March 12, as she seeks concessions from the European Union. But the delay risks further angering ministers who fear the premier’s strategy is pushing the country to the brink of a catastrophic no-deal departure. They’ll have a chance to force her hand on Wednesday, when lawmakers are due to vote on an amendment to delay Brexit to avoid the economic damage of crashing out.

War and peace | Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War during their summit this week in Vietnam, South Korea said. While the move may help fulfill the U.S. leader's pledge to cease “endless wars,” it also risks undercutting arguments for maintaining the American troop presence on the Korean Peninsula.

Taking a hit | Italian Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio’s Five Star Movement suffered another blow in a regional vote, this time on the island of Sardinia, where exit polls showed the party’s support tumbled. That's bad news for the stability of the alliance with the League because of growing pressure on Di Maio to increase his influence and prove Five Star is getting something out of the governing coalition.

New direction | China’s Politburo laid out a broad outline on how the nation’s more than $40 trillion finance sector should transform itself through supply-side reform – and by further opening up the industry. The government's push to control risk appears to be giving way to a desire to support its economy, as signaled by comments President Xi Jinping made at the gathering of China’s 25 most senior leaders.

What to Watch Today

Nigeria’s electoral commission plans to start announcing state-by-state results from the tight presidential race between the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar.

And finally ... Algerians have been protesting against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to seek a fifth term in elections in April. In response to the peaceful rallies – which started Friday and are the biggest in the North African oil producer in years – the new head of the ruling FLN party, Mourad Bouchared, said God had sent the president, now in his 80s and ailing, to look after the country and reform it. Social media pundits saw the humor and the TweetCommeMouad hashtag appeared.

68,Empty,2019-02-25T18:55:53Z,"Sen. Bernie Sanders is running for president again, and this time around he plans to be much more vocal about foreign policy. Matt Duss, Sanders' foreign policy adviser, spoke with INSIDER about the senator's global affairs priorities. Duss also addressed som…","It's been less than a week since Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he's running for president again and he's already dominating headlines about the 2020 race in a broad, diverse field of candidates.

Sanders in 2016 went from being a relatively obscure leftist figure to a household name and one of the most popular politicians in the country. His campaign for the presidency was ultimately unsuccessful, but he left his mark on both the Democratic Party and the country by making ideas previously considered radical in the realm of US politics fairly mainstream.

But as Sanders was frequently criticized in 2016 for having a somewhat jumbled approach to foreign policy. Early on, his campaign website didn't have a foreign policy section, and he stumbled on the topic during presidential debates.

Since 2016, however, Sanders has dedicated a significant amount of his time and energy to global affairs.

He's delivered two major speeches on foreign policy, one at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in October 2018 and another in September 2017 at Westminster College— where Winston Churchill gave his infamous ""Iron Curtain"" speech.

Sanders is also leading the charge on a Senate resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

Matt Duss, 46, has been at Sanders' side as his foreign policy adviser throughout this shift, and he'll be helping the senator craft his approach to global affairs along the campaign trail.

Duss, a staunch progressive who broke into the political world as a blogger, has gained prominence among left-leaning foreign policy wonks and added significant credibility to Sanders on matters of global import.

Read more: Bernie Sanders slams US support for 'despotic' Saudi Arabia in Yemen and bashes Trump over Khashoggi: 'No more! Enough death. Enough killing.'

Sanders' bold approach to domestic politics is reflected in his views on foreign affairs, which at times makes him a fringe figure in Congress. In recent days, for example, he's been criticized by some congressional Democrats for not recognizing Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader and for not referring to Nicolas Maduro as a dictator.

Duss spoke with INSIDER last week, offering an intimate view into how Sanders sees the world and what the senator will be prioritizing along the campaign trail. He also addressed the criticism Sanders has received on the subject of foreign policy, and why he feels much of it is unfounded.

Editor's Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

INSIDER: Sanders faced a fair amount of criticism in 2016 for not having a clear foreign policy vision. How has Sanders evolved since and has he made it more of a priority?

Duss: He certainly has made it more of a priority. There's a great deal of evidence for that, not only in the statements he's made, speeches he's given, but also substantively and legislatively. The Yemen war powers resolution is the most prominent example of [Sanders] being more aggressive on the issue of foreign policy and adding it to the progressive agenda.

Coming out of 2016, we recognized that he had a much bigger platform, a much bigger opportunity to move things in a progressive direction and the importance of making foreign policy part of that, which is why he asked me to join the staff.

INSIDER: There are strong anti-interventionist sentiments on both sides of the aisle right now. Barack Obama was fairly critical of the US in a similar way back in 2008, but faced accusations of being unpatriotic as a result. Could Sanders face similar attacks?

Duss: He certainly will. We're seeing it right now with some of the attacks he's getting even from some Democrats on Venezuela.

But there are shared concerns amongst progressives and conservatives about American militarism, the costs, and many unintended consequences of this kind of interventionism that has guided our approach certainly since 9/11, but even before that.

The Yemen resolution, the fact that [Sanders] introduced it with Republican Mike Lee as an original co-sponsor as well as Democrat Chris Murphy — that's an illustration of this, right? Sen. Sanders and Sen. Lee don't agree on a great deal, but they strongly came together around this idea that not only do we need to take a hard look at some of these interventions we're supporting, but we also need to take a hard look and reassert Congress' constitutional authority over these interventions.

This is where you see a sharp difference between Trump's approach and Sen. Sanders' approach. Trump and a lot of the conservatives who support him see international relations in very zero-sum terms: If someone else is winning the US is losing; the US needs to dominate all these relationships.

Sen. Sanders does not see it in those terms, he sees it in very much a positive-sum way: We can all gain when we are working together, multilaterally. We have shared problems and challenges, so we need shared solutions.

INSIDER: You recently told The Nation what it meant to you when in 2008 you heard Obama say he didn't just want to end the Iraq War, he wanted to end ""the mind-set"" that got the US into the war in the first place. But once he entered the White House, Obama encountered a reality that made it difficult to deliver on his campaign's idealistic foreign policy vision. If elected, could Sanders face a similar reality as president?

Duss: That statement [from Obama] meant a lot to me and a lot of other young progressives that I know for a reason — it really captured something.

But let's remember that when Obama came into office he had a financial crisis. There was a lot going on and Obama had an idealistic idea of turning the ship on a number of things, including foreign policy. I don't ding him too hard for some of the decisions he made, they made a great deal of sense at the time. In retrospect, some of the decisions led to really problematic outcomes now, such as the decision not to investigate fully the use of torture or other things like that.

Any president has to deal with the world as it is when they take office. But what Sen. Sanders recognizes is building that kind of movement around this idea, and starting a much more robust conversation and a real political consensus about what America's role in the world should be.

Now that's challenging, right? Because foreign policy is not something that is very immediate to a lot of Americans for obvious reasons, but grounding it in this discussion about how we treat ourselves, how we treat our own society, what kind of society we want it, how that is reflected in our foreign policy is the way to go about it.

INSIDER: Congress essentially abdicated its war-making authority with the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in 2001 — which has since allowed presidents to wage an expansive, ill-defined, global war on terrorism with few obstacles. Will Sanders call for repealing the AUMF along the campaign trail?

Duss: He will be focusing on that. He has said that Yemen is important in itself because it's a humanitarian crisis. The US shouldn't be supporting the Saudi coalition.

There's the constitutional question of congressional oversight and of reining in these wars, and that relates to the broader set of issues about the 2001 AUMF and the global war on terror. He will be talking about these things.

INSIDER: Does the Yemen resolution have a realistic shot in the Senate? Does Sanders' forceful criticism of Trump jeopardize the fate of the resolution?

Duss: It does have a realistic chance. We have 51 of the 56 who voted with us in December — they're still in office. Plus we have two new members of the Democratic caucus, both of whom have indicated that they will vote with the caucus, which puts us at 53. We only need 51 votes to move through every stage of this process.

The Trump administration will put a lot of pressure on Republicans to peel off this thing. But it's the same resolution that passed two months ago. The humanitarian crisis [in Yemen] has only gotten worse.

INSIDER: Sanders' criticism of Israel, particularly on the debate stage in 2016, is notable for multiple reasons. He's Jewish and less susceptible to accusations of anti-Semitism. But it's politically risky. Does Sanders want to radically alter the US-Israel relationship or is he more concerned with the rights of Palestinians and related humanitarian issues?

Duss: I don't think he wants to radically reorient the relationship. He's been clear he supports Israel's right to exist, he supports the two state solution.

But going back to that debate you mentioned, his point about [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] has been borne out many, many times. We just saw this week with Netanyahu literally forming an alliance with fascists, people who are identified as terrorists.

But the approach [Sanders] would support, and has supported, is one that is consistent with our relationships with other countries, which is to say: we support the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to live in security and dignity. And we have to recognize when policy, for example the settlements or the occupation, undermine those goals. So the US needs to speak clearly about that and when necessary we need to take steps to put pressure to stop those policies. [Sanders is] going to be willing to do that.

INSIDER: Sanders has been accused of being too soft on dictatorial leaders like Fidel and Raul Castro, Daniel Ortega, and more recently Nicolas Maduro. Is any of this criticism fair?

Duss: There are times where he's definitely pushed back on some of the reflexive hawkishness of the establishment. But he's always been consistently for human rights and self-determination.

His statement on Maduro, if you go back to what he initially said, reflects that. He's very clear about Maduro's abuse of his population and the corruption.

But that doesn't mean that we endorse Trump's approach here. It's making sure that the approach is consistent and grounded in a set of principles — human dignity, human security.

INSIDER: Sanders is also facing criticism for not recognizing Juan Guaidó as the legitimate leader in Venezuela, including from Democrats in Congress, as the US and many of its allies take a stand against Maduro. From the senator's perspective, how should the US approach the crisis in Venezuela?

Duss: No one is defending Maduro — the senator certainly is not doing that.

But coming out as Trump has done and sort of putting the US in the lead — just completely recognizing Guaidó as the president— and putting the US four-square behind the opposition, has the potential to create some possible outcomes that the US is not quite prepared for.

There are also other people the US could be talking to. It's unfortunate that the Trump administration did not pursue the opening with Cuba that the Obama administration started, because talking to Cuba right now could actually be really useful.

INSIDER: That's an interesting point because Trump is clearly open to dialogue with North Korea, and has defended the notion of talking to your enemies, even as he went after Obama over reopening dialogue Cuba and Iran. What's Sanders' view on this?

Duss: Sen. Sanders was perhaps the only member of the Democratic office to actually compliment Trump's last summit with Kim Jong Un for that reason. Talking is better than threats.

INSIDER: So, if we ultimately have a President Bernie Sanders, would we also see more dialogue with America's geopolitical adversaries?

Duss: We certainly would. We'd be clear about the values and the outcomes the US favors — self-determination and human rights, respect for people's dignity and their security.

But the fact is the US is extraordinarily powerful and we don't have to fear sitting down with anyone, whether it's the North Koreans, whether it's Iran, whomever.

INSIDER: Trump has a record of praising dubious world leaders and Sanders has referred to the president as an ""authoritarian."" Do you agree with the senator?

Duss: [Trump] is certainly behaving in authoritarian ways. There's some ways in which he is being constrained.

But certainly using the bully pulpit, the huge megaphone that he has on Twitter and elsewhere, to attack the press, to attack progressives, to attack all kinds of people — these have consequences.

We've seen violence against the media. We saw this guy who was just arrested planning this huge attack.

Leaders in other countries take notice of what the president of the US says. In talking to activists in other countries, there is no question in their mind that they feel that their oppression and [their leader's] use of these tools to control, oppress, and persecute their own people is being affirmed by the president of the US. That's a huge problem.

INSIDER: If you had to summarize Sanders' worldview as succinctly as possible, what would you say?

Duss: He sees the US as a kind of global facilitator by virtue of our enormous economic, diplomatic power. The US has the ability to bring parties, states, and people around tables to address common challenges that really no other country has.

That doesn't mean that the US needs to run to the head of every parade or be in charge of everything — certainly not. But the US does have a role to play in facilitating multilateral cooperation, conversation, and innovation.",Q&A WITH MATT DUSS: Bernie Sanders' foreign policy adviser breaks down the senator's progressive global agenda for 2020,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-duss-bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-adviser-2019-2

The Senate on Monday rejected a bill making it a felony for a doctor to harm or neglect an infant who survives an “attempted abortion,” part of a Republican effort to squeeze Democrats ahead of the 2020 campaign.

The vote split mainly along party lines, 53-44. Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin of West Virginia crossed the aisle to vote for it; no Republicans broke ranks. Sixty votes are required for the bill to advance.

Story Continued Below

“Evidently the far left is no longer convinced that all babies are created equal,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

Ahead of the vote, the bill’s Republican sponsors and outside anti-abortion groups lobbying for its passage made it clear that the intent of Monday’s vote was to undermine the growing pool of Senate Democrats running for president.

In a speech just before the vote, bill author Sen. Ben Sasse quoted campaign stump speeches by Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and independent Bernie Sanders vowing to look out for society’s “voiceless and vulnerable” and accused them of hypocrisy for opposing his bill’s regulations for the care of newborns.

""Was that all just clap track for the campaign trail and for soundbites? Or do people mean the stuff that they say around here?"" he said of his colleagues with White House aspirations.

Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group closely allied with Hill Republicans and the Trump administration, said Monday that it was “watching this vote closely to see whether leading Democratic candidates for president in 2020 will go on the record for or against infanticide.”

""This bill is important in itself but it‘s also important as a setup for the coming election, where there will be a stark contrast between the president of the United States and any one of the Democratic nominees,"" SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in an interview. She stood just outside the Senate chamber lobbying senators as they entered to cast their votes.

Sanders, Harris, Warren, Booker and Gillibrand all voted against the measure. Sherrod Brown, another Democratic senator exploring a White House bid, complained to POLITICO that the vote was held in bad faith.

""This is pure Mitch McConnell. It's all aimed at keeping his base in line, while the president grows increasingly unpopular,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""We're not doing infrastructure, we're not doing health care. We're not doing anything that matters to help our country. It's just votes on abortion and other kinds of divisive votes he's going to bring.""

Democrats and reproductive rights advocates blasted the bill, saying it's already a felony to harm or neglect an infant and that the “medically irresponsible” bill would restricts doctors from making case-by-case decisions about what is best for infants and mothers.

""This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed — because that is not up for debate and it is already the law,"" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). ""This bill is government interference in women’s health care, in families’ lives, and in medicine on steroids.""

The bill was previously introduced in the House by now-Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Sasse first tried to force a vote on it earlier this month, capitalizing on a wave of outrage among conservatives after New York loosened its restrictions on third-trimester abortions and embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gave an interview defending similar efforts in his state.

Democrats led by Murray objected to that fast-track procedure and blocked a floor vote, prompting Republicans to vow to try again.

Susan B. Anthony list said earlier this month that even though the Senate lacks the votes to pass abortion restrictions, it should continue to hold votes to put pressure on Democrats and divide the caucus. The move is part of a larger strategy designed to maintain current abortion restrictions while revving up the GOP’s conservative base ahead of 2020 and courting independents who may be turned off by Democrats' position on abortion rights.

""We're seeing a gradual movement to hammer a wedge right into the middle of the Democratic Party, and at some point soon here, they're just going to have to cry mercy,"" Dannenfelser said.","Senate defeats anti-abortion bill, as GOP tries to jam Dems",Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/senate-defeats-anti-abortion-bill-1185531
70,Empty,2019-02-25T06:00:03Z,Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse spoke to Salon about the virtues of the Green New Deal... and why it isn't radical at all.,"Is Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a progressive Democrat from Rhode Island, ready to join the long and growing list of U.S. senators who are running for president in 2020? I asked him this, and his answer was emphatic: ""No."" The assistant who set up the interview told me the same thing in advance: Despite a surname that practically begs for headlines, Whitehouse isn't running. (At least not this time.)

This isn't to say Whitehouse plans on staying quiet. He has emerged as a leading Senate champion of the Green New Deal, — the ambitious package of environmental and economic reforms recently popularized by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. In one document posted on Ocasio-Cortez's website (and later taken down), the Green New Deal was defined by a set of goals: achieving ""net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,"" moving America to 100 percent ""clean and renewable energy"" and realizing Franklin D. Roosevelt's vision of an Economic Bill of Rights by guaranteeing good-paying jobs, health care, education and housing for all, along with economic security for those unable to work.

Not every Democrat supports all those goals, by a long shot. As Whitehouse made clear in our conversation, the Green New Deal is in an early developmental stage and its exact policy content is likely to evolve considerably. But for many progressives, the Green New Deal establishes a positive agenda that can helps the Democratic Party emerge as something more than a catch-basin for everyone who opposes Donald Trump.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell apparently believes that forcing an early vote on the Green New Deal may damage Democrats politically, and some Democratic presidential candidates have been notably reluctant to embrace it. Whitehouse believes it's time for his party to seize the moment ... and change the world in the process.

He plans on being there when this legislation is enacted -- but not as the person who signs it.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and context.

Republicans have been reacting with -- I think ""terror"" would be an accurate word -- to the concept of a Green New Deal. Sen. Tom Cotton said the media's coverage of it has been Stalin-like. A deleted summary from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's website was entered into the congressional record. Rep. Liz Cheney has attacking it. Why are they so scared of this/

Well, I think it is significant to watch the Republican heads explode over it and to hear the invective and falsehood that are thrown at it. It reminds me a little bit about when Democrats were trying to set up Medicare years ago, and Republicans who were fighting Medicare insisted it was socialized medicine. This is a little bit the 2019 replay of that same Republican playbook. I do think that the Green New Deal brings new energy to the climate debate.

Advertisement:

What [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is up to is to try to use the fact that we're still at an early stage in negotiating a climate bill amongst ourselves to try to foment division. When in fact, we have a very strong common Democratic purpose to work together to get a very significant climate bill passed.

What are your specific thoughts on the Green New Deal, in terms of your own individual interpretation of what it means and what should be included?

The Green New Deal at this point is only a resolution that hasn't even approached legislative language. Hearings have not yet been held. In the Senate alone, there are carbon-price bills on the Democrats side, ""Keep It in the Ground"" bills on the Democratic side -- a variety of smaller bills for different economic sectors that address climate change and the general prospect of a Green New Deal.

Our job as legislators is to walk through those various pieces of legislation, and pull something together that keep the 1.5-degree [increase] climate threshold that is most likely to actually get passed, and that maximizes all the collateral benefits for society in passing it as a significant climate bill.

Advertisement:

From what I've read, both on Ocasio-Cortez's website, and in just in general from the progressive commentators, this is about more than just addressing climate change. It's about radically overhauling how ordinary people live, providing a stronger social safety net for people who are in poverty, increasing the standard of living, guaranteeing benefits. It's really trying to realize Franklin Roosevelt's vision as embodied in the Economic Bill of Right from 1944. Is it really possible to accomplish that, in addition to accomplishing the environmental reforms necessitated by climate change?

Well, first of all, let me just back off a little bit on your last comment. I don't think what we're proposing to address climate change is radical. I think what's really radical is the Republican notion that climate change is a hoax, that it shouldn't be addressed, and that they are conveniently ignorant about the science and the facts. That, to me, is an extraordinarily radical proposition, and it may even be a worse than radical proposition once we understand the extent of fossil-fuel funding in the Republican Party.

I'm not going to accept being painted into the radical corner when we try to solve this problem, when I think the radical action here is the way that the Republican Party is misbehaving.

Advertisement:

For what it's worth, I don't perceive fighting climate change as being a radical solution. But I believe it's important to try to, one might say, play devil's advocate in terms of acknowledging the arguments that will inevitably be made …

The socialized medicine argument about Medicare. We've seen this game before. We usually power our way through it. To the first part of your question, I would say that the Green New Deal has been expressed in an array of policy recommendations that have an extraordinarily worthy purpose, which is to offset the increasing income inequality in the country, and the increasing share of the country's political power and economic power which is controlled by a smaller and smaller number of extraordinarily wealthy people and families and corporations.

All of that, I think, makes a lot sense. Even Franklin Roosevelt didn't get his New Deal passed in one bill. It was more a statement of purpose. What we have to do, the same way Franklin Roosevelt had to do it, is work together with Congress to pass section-by-section laws that will solve the climate problem before it gets out of hand. After doing that, rebalance what the traditional balance of power has been in American politics and in the American economy. Arrest and reverse the slide in both of those areas of power and money to those that already have the most of it.

There's a reason the Tea Party were serious, and that voters supported Trump, and that voters came out to support Bernie [Sanders] and other authentic — recent in Trump's case — authentic, new and disruptive points of view. That’s because, I think people in America can see and feel and breathe that something is amiss in this country, but they don't have power in Congress any longer. They don't have a fair share of the country's wealth and revenues any longer, and those things are demonstrable and factual.

They're absolutely right to be furious about it, and we need to address that concern. To some extent, the way forward on the climate problem helps address that concern. That’s a very significant plus, not just for liberal politics, and certainly not for ""socialism,"" but for the way America has always worked. It's just -- we're in a Gilded Age.

Reid, who has repeatedly slammed the president, renewed hostilities and even managed to spin his dislike of Trump into some unexpected praise for a former political adversary.

“In hindsight, I wish every day for a George Bush again,” Reid told CNN’s Dana Bash.

""There's no question in my mind that George Bush would be Babe Ruth in this league that he's in with Donald Trump in the league. Donald Trump wouldn't make the team,"" Reid said.

Reid famously sparred with President Bush during his administration calling him a “loser” and a “liar”, making his admission even more cutting toward the current President.

Reid, who is fighting pancreatic cancer and left office in 2017, was asked by Bash if ‘there was anything he thought the President was doing right?’

“I just have trouble accepting him as a person,” Reid replied. “So frankly, I don’t see anything he is doing right.”

Not one to take an insult lying down, President Trump quickly shot back on Twitter.

“Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!” Trump tweeted.

Reid also gave some advice to Democratic presidential candidates who are seeking to take on President Trump in 2020.

Radical ideas are not unusual in the early stages of a US presidential election campaign, but many of the Democratic candidates for 2020 are advocating unrealistic policies. Just because a new idea seems more exciting does not make it better than an established, more practical one.

CAMBRIDGE – America’s Democratic Party is moving to the left, we are told. It is not yet clear whether this applies to the median American voter, or the median member of Congress who was elected last November. But it is clear that many of the candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are experimenting with “bold new ideas.” They seem to receive a disproportionate amount of attention for doing so. If interpreted literally, many of these policy proposals are not entirely practical, either economically or politically.

Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next

Fortunately, few of the current or prospective Democratic candidates have yet committed irrevocably to extreme policies. Any of them could still build a campaign on solid practical proposals to address inequality and other pressing problems, without sacrificing economic growth or fiscal sustainability.

Such ideas are perhaps most likely to come from moderates such as former Vice President Joe Biden, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, former US Representative Beto O’Rourke, or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Other prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, share this emphasis on the doable. They made important progress with practical policies in areas such as health insurance, financial regulation, and progressive taxation, although Republicans often blocked or reversed these advances.

There is no reason why other new faces in the presidential field, such as US Senator Amy Klobuchar, cannot follow in the sensible Democratic tradition of Obama and Pelosi. The same applies to fellow senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, who are often seen as being on the left of the party.

But for now, the bolder, less practical Democratic ideas are getting the airtime. Five in particular stand out, and there exist more practical alternatives to each of them.

First is the proposal for a marginal income-tax rate of 70% on the super-rich. There are more efficient and enforceable ways to improve income distribution in the US. For starters, the carried-interest loophole could be abolished, the Earned Income Tax Credit could be expanded, and the payroll tax could be made more progressive. Further suggestions include restoring the inheritance tax on all estates worth more than, say, $10 million, and eliminating the “step-up” of estates’ valuation that allows generations to pass on capital gains without ever paying tax on them. Other substantial Republican tax cuts for the rich could be reversed, too.

Another idea is that the government pays for universal four-year college education. But this would be expensive, and not the best way to help the children of families that have been left behind by US economic growth. Universal, quality pre-school might be a more effective way of working toward equality of educational opportunity.

To be sure, it makes sense to expand student grants for higher education and increase support for public institutions. This should cover two-year programs and vocational training as well as four-year degrees. But the most urgent higher-education policy priority is pushing back against the scams perpetrated by some for-profit colleges. The worst of these leave vulnerable students – veterans have been frequent targets – with high taxpayer-funded debts, low graduation rates, and poor post-graduation employment prospects.

A third idea is universal health-care coverage through “Medicare for All.” If this meant adding a public option for those who can’t get private health insurance, it would be a worthy initiative. But US Senator Bernie Sanders – not a Democrat, but running for the party’s nomination – has been clear that he favors the elimination of private health insurance. Most Americans do not respond positively when they realize that “Medicare for All” would force the many who are currently happy with their employer-paid plans to give them up, and saddle taxpayers with an enormous fiscal burden.

A more practical Democratic health-care policy would be to resume the expansion of coverage rates that the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) achieved. This means, as a first step, reversing the damage that Republicans have done to it.

Fourth, several candidates support a government-led “Green New Deal” that would radically change US energy use. True, when the US unemployment rate exceeded 8% between 2009 and 2012, the country could have used a larger and longer increase in government spending on environmental projects than Obama was able to get past Congress. But, with unemployment currently around 4%, now is not a good time to be expanding the budget deficit.

If the Green New Deal were interpreted as simply a rallying cry to mobilize support for strong action on climate change, it would be a welcome development. But the impracticality of so many of the Green New Deal’s components is worrisome, such as its goal of expanding renewable energy to 100% of electric power, not to mention some of the package’s extraneous parts. The efficient way to achieve climate-change goals is not via a truly massive expansion of government, but rather by using the price mechanism, meaning either a carbon tax or tradable emission permits.

Finally, Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (who is not seeking the presidency) recently proposed preventing firms from buying back their shares. It is true that corporations have spent more of their big gains from the December 2017 tax cut on share buybacks and dividends than on investment or workers. But the proper remedy is to broaden the corporate tax base. Banning buybacks would just divert firms’ extra profits into Treasury bills or other companies’ shares.

Radical proposals are not unusual in the early stages of a presidential election campaign. But just because a new idea seems more exciting does not make it better than an older, more practical one. The Democratic contenders for 2020 would be wise to remember this as they chase their presidential dreams.",Should Bold Ideas Drown Out Old Ideas?,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/presidential-election-2020-democrats-radical-proposals-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-02

Dionne: History will notice which Republicans distance themselves from Trump Salt Lake Tribune California Republican Party elects first woman, Latina to be its leader Los Angeles Times California's hurting Republicans pick insider to lead party ABC News …","Washington • In 1964, Nelson Rockefeller, then the governor of New York, rose before the Republican National Convention to condemn “extremists” who had “no plan and no program to keep the peace and bring freedom to the world.”

Amidst the boos and catcalls from right-wingers on the floor, Rockefeller denounced those who ""spread distrust,"" ""engender suspicion"" and ""encourage disunity.""

“There is no place in this Republican Party,” declared this stalwart of GOP progressivism, “for such hawkers of hate, such purveyors of prejudice, such fabricators of fear.”

You wonder what Rocky would make of a President Trump and the movement he has nurtured. And you sure wish someone like Rockefeller were around today to call his party back to reason and tolerance.

The events of recent days ought to try the consciences of Republicans who know that extremism and hatred are wrong. Many in the party acknowledge — usually in private — that the president they have continued to back has rooted his political appeal in vicious attacks against his opponents and a free press. He has invented crises for the purpose of stoking dread and horror. And he targeted minority groups (immigrants especially) to harvest political support.

In the meantime, the party as a whole has abandoned the embrace of civil rights and voting rights that had been, from the Lincoln era to Rockefeller's time, the GOP's calling card. Mimicking the segregationist Democrats of the past, Republicans have of late used the unfounded specter of voter fraud to justify voter ID laws and other measures squarely aimed at impeding access to the ballot box by African-Americans and the young.

So there was a delicious irony to last week's unanimous ruling by the North Carolina Board of Elections that it was a Republican candidate for Congress, Mark Harris, who found himself accused of massive voter fraud. As a result, the board threw out the district's 2018 election results and called a new election.

In 2017 Trump named a presidential commission that scoured the country for instances of in-person voter fraud that might justify the party's voter suppression efforts. It was such a bust that the commission itself had to be disbanded just eight months later.

Impeding voting rights needs to be called what it is: an act of extremism. It is radically anti-democratic to keep your opponents from voting. Where are the Republicans who will speak out loudly and clearly against what their party has done in so many states that they controlled?

An even more startling development was news that police in Maryland had arrested Christopher P. Hasson, a lieutenant in the Coast Guard and a self-identified white nationalist. The authorities said he stockpiled weapons and drew up a list of liberal politicians and commentators whom he hoped to kill. His catalog of targets included, among others, the House and Senate Democratic leaders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (whom he called ""Sen blumen jew""), and MSNBC commentators Joe Scarborough, Ari Melber and Chris Hayes.

Even if many Republicans have no problem these days labeling nearly all Democrats ""socialists"" based on the self-descriptions of a few in the party's ranks, it's obvious that no one should call out the entire GOP for the plotting of a fanatical would-be assassin.

One can, however, ask all responsible Republicans to deplore right-wing fanaticism and to take the threat of homegrown white nationalist terrorism as seriously as they do terrorism inspired from abroad. It is entirely fair to imagine that the GOP (and, especially, the president) would have a lot more to say if Hasson had been, say, a Muslim.

And it is important to examine the public statements of the president himself, his efforts to divide the country, and his constant demonizing of all those who oppose him.

Let's go back to Rockefeller's words: Day after day, Trump truly is a hawker of hate, a purveyor of prejudice, and a fabricator of fear. Prejudice and fear are at the heart of his invocation of national emergency powers to build his wall, an abuse of authority that ought to horrify all who proudly call themselves ""constitutional conservatives.""

The good news is that Republicans will soon have an opportunity to tell us who they are. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called a vote this week on a measure rejecting Trump's emergency declaration. The House is virtually certain to pass it. The Senate, by law, will be required to take it up.

It's not too much to say that history will notice how many Republicans choose to separate themselves from Trump's extremism.

On Saturday night, Harris was on the other side of town at the United Steelworkers hall, keynoting the Iowa Democratic Party Black Caucus. Klobuchar, as she always does, built her speech up to a quote from Walter Mondale, talking about Jimmy Carter’s presidency: “We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace.” Harris, as is her custom, progressed to a paraphrase of Coretta Scott King: “The fight for justice and the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation.”

Afterward, I asked Klobuchar what she thought being a senator from Minnesota, compared with being a senator from California, would mean to Iowa.

“It means that for me, going south for the winter is going to Iowa. It’s easier to get here,” she said. “It’s important to have a lot of people running, but I am a candidate from the heartland, and it’s an important part of our path to success in the general election.”

Graeme Wood: The two Amy Klobuchars

Was she arguing that senators from the coasts—not just Harris, but Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kirsten Gillibrand—wouldn’t be able to win?

“Senators from the coast have won in the heartland in the past. So I don’t think it’s that. It’s that my No. 1 request was to be on the Agriculture Committee. I served on that committee for 12 years. I’ve played a major role in getting the farm bill passed,” she said. “I know these issues here.”

Klobuchar likes talking about herself as an underdog, and structurally that’s how she started a campaign that many people thought she wasn’t actually going to go through with. She’s short on campaign staff, here and nationally, and arrived with just one person on her payroll and a handful of others who’d come in as volunteers. She had a surge of online fundraising after she announced, but aides have acknowledged in conversations with others that money is going to be a scramble and that her best hope is to scrape by enough to make it through Iowa, and then count on an explosion of interest if she wins to carry her over.

And so she lays it on thick, talking about the two states’ main agricultural exports, or how they both put a premium on butter-carving contests. On the list of ways the states are similar that she read from on Thursday evening: “You have the world-famous matchstick museum, and we have the only museum in the world devoted to Spam—or, as we call it, the ‘Guggen-ham.’”

But her main argument is that the country needs a pragmatic president, and that starts with making a pragmatic argument for why she should be the nominee.

“We need to win. So here’s my deal: I have won every single congressional district in the state of Minnesota, including Michele Bachmann’s, three times,” Klobuchar said, referring to the former congresswoman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate who helped popularize Tea Party politics in the run-up to a campaign that got much more attention than actual votes. With Democrats nationally nervous that Minnesota is in danger of slipping away—in a shocker, it had the smallest margin of any state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and Trump’s campaign has been public about Minnesota being at the top of its 2020 target list—Klobuchar leaned in.",The Opposite Reasons Klobuchar and Harris Both Need Iowa,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/klobuchar-harris-need-win-iowa-caucuses-2020/583558/

The outcome of Sunday’s contest sets the stage for coalition talks or possibly new elections, just as the country has recovered from a political and economic crisis following a $1 billion banking scandal in 2014 and 2015.

Adding to the uncertainty, opposition leaders threatened street protests after raising suspicions of vote-buying.

The opposition Socialists, who favor closer ties to Moscow, emerged as the largest party with 35 out of 101 seats on a revised estimate, with recounts possible in some constituencies.

The ruling Democratic Party, which wants closer integration with the EU, came second with 30 seats while an opposition bloc called ACUM, campaigning to fight corruption, was third with 26 seats.

Democratic leader Vladimir Plahotniuc said his party was “ready for negotiations on forming a majority and approving a new government”, adding, “I hope that such negotiations take place as soon as possible”.

Corruption scandals and worries over the health of democracy in Moldova, which is squeezed between Ukraine and EU member Romania and is one of Europe’s poorest countries, have tarnished the country’s image and weakened the appeal of the pro-Western political class.

The Socialist Party said its lawyers were studying reported election violations and declared it may not recognize the results.

ACUM leader Maia Sandu said her bloc did not recognize the elections as free and democratic.

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the elections were “generally well-run” but “tainted by allegations of pressure on public employees, strong indications of vote buying and the misuse of state resources”.

President Igor Dodon, formerly head of the Socialist Party, said it would become clear only in the coming weeks whether the election was above board. He raised the prospect of calling a new election in June if the vote was declared illegitimate or no party managed to form a coalition.

Dodon on Saturday had called the campaign “one of the dirtiest in our entire history”.

Plahotniuc, an oil-to-hotels tycoon, could repeat a feat he achieved at a previous election in 2014, of cobbling together a coalition despite not winning a majority.

He may woo a smaller party led by Ilan Shor, who just two years ago was convicted of fraud and money-laundering for his part in a scam to pilfer $1 billion out of three banks, the equivalent of an eighth of Moldova’s national output in what Moldovans call the “theft of the century”.

Shor denied wrongdoing and said he was made a scapegoat. After time spent under house arrest, he became mayor of the central town of Orhei while his appeal was heard.

His party won 7 seats on Sunday.

POISONED POLITICS

The election campaign was dogged by controversy.

In the past few days, ACUM’s leaders said they were being poisoned on the orders of the authorities, which the Democratic Party swiftly dismissed as a “strange accusation”.

Russia announced an investigation into Plahotniuc, accusing him of involvement in organized crime, prompting Plahotniuc’s party to accuse Moscow of election meddling.

The Democratic Party had already been accused of trying to bend the electoral system in its favor by introducing changes in 2017 on how votes are cast.

Florida Republicans hope the outspoken push by President Donald Trump …","Sen. Marco Rubio waves as he walks across the Simón Bolívar International Bridge on the Colombia-Venezuela border on Feb. 17. (Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images)

The crisis in Venezuela is sending tremors through Florida’s political landscape, emboldening Republicans and throwing Democrats on the defensive in the nation’s largest swing state.

Florida Republicans hope the outspoken push by President Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro will help the GOP strengthen its bonds with the state’s Hispanic voters, paying dividends in the 2020 election and beyond.

Opposition to the socialist regime in Caracas, which is closely aligned with communist Cuba, has been a shared cause of the state’s large and traditionally pro-Republican Cuban American and Venezuelan immigrant communities.

“It’s a huge moment for the Republican Party,” said Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist and GOP donor with ties to Trump and Rubio. “It will be like Donald Trump can [be] to Venezuelan American voters the way Ronald Reagan was to Cuban American voters.”

Adding to the tension is growing concern among Democrats that Trump and his allies, seizing on the party’s leftward shift, will move to portray his potential 2020 challengers as socialists and point to Venezuela’s collapse as a symbol of what’s wrong with the views they espouse.

Florida Democrats are disavowing the recent refusal by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist, to label Maduro a dictator and call for him to go, though Sanders has criticized him.

“They are clearly ignorant comments, and someone who’s running for president of the United States should be better briefed and knowledgeable about this crisis in Venezuela and how it impacts the Florida political landscape,” said Christian Ulvert, a Florida Democratic strategist who is of Nicaraguan descent and whose husband’s family has roots in Venezuela.

A Sanders aide said the candidate strongly supports self-determination for Venezuelans, but that to suggest the possibility of military intervention, as Trump has done, is irresponsible.

The emerging dynamic comes at the start of a closely watched two-year stretch for each party in Florida, as both see the state as an important front in the battle for control of the Oval Office. Democrats are hoping to make a comeback after their nominees for the White House, the U.S. Senate and the Florida governorship lost in the last two elections, despite initially appearing to have good odds.

Democrats for years have hoped Florida will move into their orbit, especially with the rise of a new generation of Cuban Americans that is less conservative and less driven by animus toward Cuba’s communist government.

President Barack Obama captured Florida in 2008 and 2012, and Trump’s anti-immigrant posture has alienated many Hispanic voters.

However, the state remains conservative in many ways, particularly its rural stretches and the Florida panhandle, and recent Democratic candidates, including former senator Bill Nelson and gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum, were unable to prevail.

Now it’s Republicans who are hoping they can shift the state more firmly into their camp, powered by the GOP’s anti-Maduro push.

Still, the outcome of Trump’s Venezuela strategy remains to be seen and risks political blowback should the crisis continue to escalate. That could compound widespread concerns in Florida’s Latino communities about Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and hard-line border policies.

Trump traveled to Miami on Feb. 18 to deliver a speech urging Venezuelan military officers to abandon Maduro and pledge support for opposition leader Juan Guaidó. He also forcefully criticized socialism, invoked two countries with large exile communities in South Florida and seemed to draw a direct line between his foreign policy and his domestic political message.

“As the United States stands up for democracy in Venezuela, we reaffirm the solidarity with the long-suffering people of Cuba and Nicaragua and people everywhere living under socialist and communist regimes,” he said. “And to those who would try to impose socialism on the United States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country.”

In recent weeks, Trump has intensified his critique of socialism, seeking to portray the Democrats running against him as far-left extremists who have embraced policies he casts as outside the mainstream.

Republicans believe those arguments could be effective, especially in some parts of South Florida, where an older generation of Cuban Americans whose relatives fled the communist regime — or who did so themselves — are deeply skeptical of left-wing governance.

At the moment, Cuban Americans are paying close attention to the situation unfolding in Venezuela, according to a local official, including how the Trump administration responds.

“Many Cubans here predicted what would happen in Venezuela,” said Carlos A. Gimenez, the Cuban-born mayor of Miami-Dade County. Gimenez, a Republican, said he was pleased to see Washington Republicans “putting down socialism” and argued that the administration’s strategy on Venezuela would help the GOP in Florida.

At the forefront of that strategy is Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants and a sharp Trump critic when they were rivals in the 2016 presidential race. Since then, the two have cultivated a more positive relationship, rooted heavily in collaborating on foreign policy in Latin America.

Rubio recently traveled to Colombia, visiting an area near the border with Venezuela. The senator also has been tweeting real-time updates about the volatile situation on the ground.

On Saturday, he posted a steady stream of messages, including information about aid trucks and the presence of the Venezuelan National Guard. “Very tense moments as civilians take to the street on #Venezuela side of border & peaceful aid workers have started up the trucks at border crossing,” he said in one tweet.

Among Democrats in Florida, there has been a lot of focus on a recent interview Sanders gave to Univision, a Spanish-language television network.

“Is Nicolás Maduro a dictator, senator, for you? And should he go?” anchor Jorge Ramos asked him.

Sanders replied, “I think clearly he has been very, very abusive.”

But he also signaled a desire to avoid repeating the U.S. approach used in the past, such as in the 1980s, when liberals strongly opposed Washington’s aggressive intervention in Latin American affairs.

As to whether Maduro should go, he continued, “That is a decision of the Venezuelan people. So I think, Jorge, there has got to be a free and fair election. But what must not happen is that the United States must not use military force and intervene.”

Sanders was asked whether he considered Guaidó to be the legitimate president, and he replied that he did not. Trump — as well as Democratic leaders and many Western countries — have recognized Guaidó as the interim president.

Some prominent Florida Democrats distanced themselves from Sanders’s comments.

“I’ll make it clear, @SenSanders does not reflect the majority of the Democratic Party and our support for Venezuela’s interim president @jguaido and the Venezuelan people. Maduro is a dictator and must go,” Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) tweeted on Thursday.

While Sanders is critical of Maduro, his foreign policy aide Matt Duss said Sanders forcefully opposes the option of U.S. military intervention, something the president has suggested is a possibility.

“Bernie strongly supports the right of democratic self-determination, for the Venezuelan people and those across the world,” Duss said in a statement. “The Trump administration even floating the possibility of military intervention is extremely dangerous and irresponsible, and we should be absolutely opposed to it.”

Ulvert recalled Democratic candidates in the 2018 campaign facing attacks from Republicans who sought to cast them as socialists, and he fears a repeat in 2020. “My worry level is growing every month,” he said.

Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Florida by just 1.2 percentage points in 2016. In 2018, both the governor’s race and the U.S. Senate race went to recounts.

Florida has always been a politically complex state, with major cities from Miami to Tampa to Orlando to Jacksonville. Influential voting blocs range from Latin American immigrants to Jewish retirees to dairy farmers, and tourism and the environment are among the state’s diverse concerns.

While Democrats still hold the advantage in winning Hispanic voters statewide, some party leaders worry they need to do more to counter GOP strategies there.

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who served as governor for eight years before his election to Congress in November, ran Spanish-language TV ads and emphasized his outreach to Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

Scott narrowly defeated Nelson, whose campaign drew complaints from within the Democratic Party, including that he was not aggressive enough in courting Hispanic voters.

Gillum, a former Tallahassee mayor, generated enthusiasm among Democrats when he won the primary in an upset, but he lost to Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was strongly supported by Trump.

Democrats insist Florida has not slipped from their grasp — especially if they can run well-prepared campaigns that provide more face time in Latino communities.

Democrats gained two U.S. House seats in South Florida, they note, even though Nelson and Gillum lost in 2018.

(China Dialogue) – The weeks after the Democratic Party won back control of the House of Representatives saw the longest government shutdown in US history, as President Trump unsuccessfully demanded money to pay for a wall on the Mexican border. Now that the shutdown is over, Democrats have started setting the agenda, and climate change is right at the top.

After delivering a storming victory in the midterm elections the new Speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, was probably not expecting to be greeted with protests. But that’s what immediately faced her. Hordes of young activists sat outside her office demanding action on climate change. Newly elected members from the left-wing of the party, led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, increased the pressure, demanding that the party pursue a more radical agenda in line with the scale of the climate challenge and America’s responsibility to address it.

On February 7 they got their way. Ocasio-Cortez tabled a resolution calling for a Green New Deal, which, at the time of writing, has more than 60 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives and is backed by most Democrat presidential candidates, including Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.

Back on the table

Climate change has been off the table under Republican control of the House for the past eight years, so this has been a dramatic and unexpected change. Democrats are still a long way from being able to make laws – Republicans control the Senate and Donald Trump is still president – so the resolution is seen by many as symbolic, an opportunity for Democrats to make clear what they stand for. And the Green New Deal is an admirably clear articulation of a new climate agenda.

Those framing the Green New Deal take seriously the stark warnings set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the recent National Climate Assessment. The resolution calls for a 10-year national mobilisation “on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal” with the aim of getting to net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. Renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure and clean public transport are at the heart of the plan.

The Deal has brought climate change to the front of voters’ minds

The resolution avoids some of the more heated debates among activists and experts. There is no specific mention of nuclear energy, for example, only the aim to “meet 100% of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.”

Public awareness of the Green New Deal is low. Before its launch, only 17% of Americans had heard of it. But support for its contents, at this early stage, is surprisingly high: 81% of polled voters said they support the proposal.

Radical versus incremental

The resolution has sparked a fierce debate within the Democratic Party. Should the party be proposing such clear, radical ideas, in line with the scale of the problems the country faces? Or should it adopt a more incremental approach? And are big, simple ideas necessary to win elections? The Democrats have traditionally been cautious in their approach to climate, favouring incremental reforms, ideally with the backing of business. This approach has failed, been stymied or overturned by Republicans every time.

The Green New Deal is considerably more radical than the “Cap and Trade” bill which was passed by the House of Representatives before dying in the Senate in 2009, or President Obama’s subsequent Clean Power Plan. Both of these schemes had more modest targets, with significantly less government spending.

Ernie Moniz, energy secretary under former president Obama, who favours a more conciliatory approach, said, “It’s just impracticable… If we start putting out impracticable targets we may lose a lot of key constituencies that we need to bring along”.

The green dream?

Other critics of the plan point to different social policies it includes. Providing all members of society “with high-quality health care, affordable, safe and adequate housing, economic security” are laudable goals, but how will they be paid for? For her part, Speaker of the House Pelosi described it, somewhat dismissively, as the “green dream or whatever”.

Republicans have also sought to discredit the deal, deliberately mischaracterising its contents. President Trump sarcastically tweeted: “I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called ‘Carbon Footprint’ to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military – even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!”

While in the Senate, Republicans moved to force an immediate vote on the issue, with the aim of forcing more moderate Democrats to either vote for it, or oppose parts of their own voter base, weakening their chances of winning subsequent elections. A small minority of Republicans see this as an opportunity to advance their own, moderate climate proposals, including a small carbon tax.

Wherever it leads, it’s clear that the Green New Deal has brought climate change to the front of the minds of voters and politicians. Fierce public fights within and between political parties will now continue into the presidential campaign. In less than two months in office, Ocasio-Cortez has completely upended climate politics in the United States.

Bernie Sanders is still the subject of grousing by former members of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign staff, and not only for his use of private planes. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Elections Ex-Clinton staffers slam Sanders over private jet flights The Vermont senator’s 2016 travel as a Clinton surrogate became ‘a running joke in the office.’

In his campaign launch video last week, Bernie Sanders singled out the fossil fuel industry for criticism, listing it among the special interests he planned to take on. But in the final months of the 2016 campaign, Sanders repeatedly requested and received the use of a carbon-spewing private jet for himself and his traveling staff when he served as a surrogate campaigner for Hillary Clinton.

In the two years following the presidential election, Sanders continued his frequent private jet travel, spending at least $342,000 on the flights.

Story Continued Below

Increased scrutiny of his travel practices, which are at odds with his positions on wealth inequality and climate change, are among the challenges Sanders will face as he makes his second White House run.

But he also faces another hurdle: hard feelings that remain to this day after the contentious 2016 Democratic primary. Many in the party continue to believe the Vermont senator played a role in contributing to Clinton’s defeat in November because of his criticisms of her prior to the general election, and his refusal to concede earlier when it appeared he had little mathematical chance of securing the party nomination.

And they are eager to point out Sanders’ flaws and examples of what they perceive to be examples of hypocrisy now that the one-time underdog rates as one of the front-runners in the crowded Democratic field.

“I’m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,” said Zac Petkanas, who was the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign.

In 2016, after Sanders endorsed Clinton and agreed to campaign on her behalf, the Sanders campaign’s preferred mode of travel quickly emerged as a point of tension, according to six former Clinton campaign staffers and another source familiar with the travel.

Those who had worked on his primary campaign made it known that the only logistical way Sanders could adhere to the event schedules requested by the Clinton campaign was by flying private. The Clinton campaign, however, viewed the private jet flights as a needless extravagance and wanted the senator to mostly fly commercial.

The senator ended up flying private on three separate multi-day trips in the last two months of the campaign.

Sanders’ flights — usually on a Gulfstream plane — cost the Clinton-Kaine campaign at least $100,000 in total, according to three people familiar with the cost of the air travel.

“We would try to fight it as much as possible because of cost and availability of planes, but they would request [a jet] every time,” one of those sources said. “We would always try to push for commercial. ... At the campaign, you’re constantly trying to save like 25 cents.”

Prior to working out the logistics of Sanders’ travel, “our working assumption was that 90 percent of the time it would be commercial,” said another person familiar with the matter. “If he was trying to hop from city to city in a particular state and [commercial] didn’t work, we were open to” chartering a plane.

But that idea did not go over well with the Sanders camp, according to this person.

“At that time, getting him on board — no pun intended —and his followers engaged for her, was a big priority,” said one former Clinton staffer, who explained that campaign leadership, including campaign manager Robby Mook, decided it was something Sanders wouldn’t budge on, so the campaign approved the requests to keep peace with the senator.

“We needed all hands on deck, including Bernie, and we were grateful for his support and the generous amount of time he gave the campaign,” Mook told POLITICO when asked for comment.

Sanders spokesperson Arianna Jones said it was physically impossible to get to all of the event locations in such a short period of time without chartered flights, especially since the senator was traveling to many smaller markets with limited commercial air travel options.

“That’s why chartered flights were used: to make sure Sen. Sanders could get to as many locations as quickly as possible in the effort to help the Democratic ticket defeat Donald Trump,” she said. “Sen. Sanders campaigned so aggressively for Secretary Clinton, at such a grueling pace, it became a story unto itself, setting the model for how a former opponent can support a nominee in a general election.”

In the final three months before Election Day 2016, Sanders held 39 rallies in 13 states on behalf of Clinton’s campaign, according to Jones, including 17 events in 11 states in the last week alone. When he went to New Hampshire, which borders Sanders’ home state of Vermont, he did not use a private jet to get there.

Rania Batrice, who served as Sanders’ deputy campaign manager at the end of his 2016 campaign, said that Clinton’s campaign would send over a proposed campaigning schedule for Sanders before the two sides talked through logistics and “at no point did I ever say ‘he has to have a private plane for the sake of having a private plane.’”

“The requests for a charter only came after the schedules were put in front of us. If a less rigorous schedule were put in front of us, we wouldn’t have needed a charter and that would have been fine for everyone involved, including Bernie,” she said, later adding: “Bernie worked his ass off on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the campaign.”

Josh Orton, a Sanders aide, said, “The senator was proud to work tirelessly on behalf of Sec. Clinton, and we believe that we must put our past differences aside and unite to defeat Donald Trump.”

To the Clinton staff, however, the issue of the senator and the private jets became so cumbersome that it turned into “a running joke in the office,” said one former Clinton staffer.

The travel details weren’t the only point of tension with Sanders. At his rallies for Clinton, Sanders sometimes only wanted people who had endorsed him in the primaries to speak when he would appear, a request which frustrated the Clinton campaign, according to a former Clinton staffer and another person familiar with the matter.

“Sure you can have your supporters there, but you can’t exclude the congressman who endorsed Hillary Clinton in the city you are going to,” said the former staffer. “You’re campaigning for us. That was always a battle every single time.”

Batrice, who became a full-time DNC consultant for the general election, called that allegation “ridiculous” and said that the Clinton campaign actually blocked several people Sanders wanted from speaking at rallies that he was headlining, but she declined to name them.

Just as many former Clinton supporters and staffers continue to hold a grudge against the Vermont senator, many Sanders supporters still nurse grievances about the way the senator and his campaign were treated by the Clinton campaign and the party establishment, including the Democratic National Committee.

Michael Briggs, Sanders’ 2016 campaign spokesman who often traveled with Sanders on the private flights, said Clinton and her staff were “total ingrates” in light of the efforts the Vermont senator put in to try to help elect her in the general election.

“You can see why she’s one of the most disliked politicians in America. She’s not nice. Her people are not nice,” he said. “[Sanders] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.”

“It doesn’t make me feel good to feel this way but they’re some of the biggest assholes in American politics,” he added.

Private jet travel on the campaign trail is not uncommon — either for candidates like Clinton or a top surrogate tasked with stumping for them. Often it is the most efficient mode of transportation, particularly when events are in locations where commercial air travel options are limited.

One veteran Democratic operative who oversaw surrogates for past presidential campaigns said providing private planes is standard practice for the most important surrogate of a presidential campaign in the general election.

In addition to Sanders, the Clinton campaign footed the private plane bill on occasion for several top celebrities, among them Beyonce, Jay Z and Katy Perry. But as a rule, when political surrogates made requests for private jets, the campaign’s answer was no — except when it came to Sanders, said one former Clinton staffer.

The Clinton campaign itself spent a total of $15.9 million on jet charter company Executive Flightways in the 2016 campaign, according to a review of FEC records. That money was used to ferry Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, Sanders, major celebrities, and Clinton’s traveling press corps.

The revelation of Sanders’ penchant for private jet travel, both in 2016 and in the subsequent years, could surface as an issue for him since he often demands the U.S. do its part to fight global climate change — to which CO2 emissions from aviation is a contributor.

“Climate change is not only real, it is already doing irreparable harm all over this planet, including the United States of America,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation” last November. “What Congress has got to do is take Trump on, take the fossil fuel industry on, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, to energy efficiency and sustainable energies like solar and wind.”

But last year, when Sanders faced reelection but faced only token opposition, his Senate campaign committee spent $342,000 on Apollo Jets, a private jet service. That money was used primarily to pay for a nine-day, nine-state tour to support Democratic candidates across the country.

Sanders held 18 “large public events in those days,” said Jones. “A review of airline flight schedules shows that this tour itinerary simply could not have been completed with commercial flights — it required a charter.”

She noted that the tour was the only time last year when Sanders flew on a private jet and also said the campaign purchased carbon offsets to zero out the emissions produced on the trip. Cars were also used on the ground whenever possible to get him to his events. She said that Sanders also flew commercial last year to hold more than 45 major rallies and events in 18 different states.

But the previous year, in April 2017, Sanders went on another far-reaching trip where private air travel was a significant component. According to a former DNC official and another person familiar with the details, Sanders’ camp requested a private jet for the “Come Together and Fight Back” unity tour with DNC chairman Tom Perez and other DNC officers — which included stops in Maine, Kentucky, Florida, Texas, Nebraska, Utah, Arizona and Nevada. The DNC paid Apollo Jets $157,000 that month, according to FEC records.

The next month, Sanders’ political committee transferred $100,000 to the DNC to share some, but not all, of the costs of the entire tour, which encompassed both the plane rides and other costs associated with the trips.

Asked whether Sanders will fly private for his 2020 campaign, Sanders spokesperson Jones said he “will be flying commercial whenever possible. The campaign will consider the use of charter flights based on a variety of factors, including security requirements, logistics, and media interest in traveling with the senator.”

Scott Bland and Alex Thompson contributed to this report.

81,Empty,2019-02-25T00:43:00Z,Is Trump especially vulnerable to primary challenge? Washington Examiner Former senior national security officials to rebuke Trump's national emergency declaration CNN Sen. Graham makes predictions on what will happen with the resolution to block Trump's emer…,"It's become a common talking point for ""Never Trump"" Republicans seeking to defeat President Trump in the 2020 GOP primaries: Polls have found that a substantial number, maybe 40 percent, of Republican voters say they would be open to a primary challenge to the president. Those surveys, the ""Never Trumpers"" argue, show that Trump is particularly weak and vulnerable to a serious primary challenge.

The problem is that it is common for voters to say they are open to a primary challenge to the president of their own party. It happened to former President Barack Obama in 2010-2011, before Obama went on to win re-election. It also happened to Bill Clinton in 1994-1995, before Clinton went on to win re-election. It did not happen to George W. Bush in 2002-2003, but that was because of strong Republican support for a wartime president.

In other words, today's poll results about President Trump are not at all unusual.

Talk about a primary challenge to Obama intensified around the 2010 midterms, when Democrats lost 63 seats in the House in an election Obama conceded was a ""shellacking."" The idea that Obama might face a challenge had been around since his divisive 2008 primary battle with Hillary Clinton. Democratic strategist Ed Kilgore wrote in the New Republic that by 2010 those tensions had ""gotten worse with the rise of the 'angry left,' which thinks Obama has been too eager to compromise with Wall Street and Republicans, and considers itself the representative of the Democratic base.""

With midterm campaigning looking bad for Democrats, polls indicated voter openness to an Obama challenge. In a September 2010 Gallup survey, 37 percent of Democrats said they would support a Hillary Clinton primary challenge to Obama, while 52 percent said they would support Obama, and 10 percent were undecided.

In late October 2010, an Associated Press poll found that 47 percent of Democrats said Obama ""should be challenged"" in a party primary. That included 29 percent of Democrats who said they originally supported Obama in the 2008 primary battle.

In late November 2010, after the midterm loss, a Marist poll asked, ""Do you want another Democrat to challenge Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2012 primaries?"" Forty-one percent of Democrats said yes, 45 percent when Democratic-leaning independents were included.

That same month, November, a Pew poll found that 38 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners would like to see an Obama challenge.

In January 2011, an AP-GfK poll found that 44 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they would ""like to see Barack Obama face a serious challenge in the 2012 presidential primaries from another Democratic candidate.""

The specter of a primary challenge was much discussed among Democrats in those months, with prominent commentators anxious to knock it down and defend the president. ""One thing we know is, if you have a primary challenge, it is almost lethal to the incumbent,"" MSNBC's Chris Matthews said in December 2010.

By August 2011, Pew reported that the percentage of Democrats who wanted to see Obama challenged had fallen a bit, from 38 percent to 32 percent. But that lower number was still one-third of the Democratic electorate. Despite that, Obama avoided a primary challenge and went on to win re-election.

Things looked even worse for President Bill Clinton. After losing 54 House and eight Senate seats in the 1994 midterm elections, many Democrats were open to a primary challenge. In a December 1994 Times-Mirror poll, 66 percent of Democrats said they ""would like to see"" a primary challenge. By anybody's reckoning, 66 percent is a big number.

Potential opponents smelled opportunity. ""I think that people are going to look at the president in the next six to eight months, and they are going to make an assessment as to whether they believe that he can do the job,"" New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley, a possible Clinton challenger, said in January 1995.

Clinton recognized the threat. ""From the time [Clinton aide Harold Ickes] arrived at the White House at the beginning of [1994, he] was primarily concerned with avoiding a primary challenge,"" the Washington Post reported in December 1995. ""Mr. Clinton, through prodigious fund raising and behind-the-scenes courting of the party base, had escaped a primary challenge,"" the paper reported in November 1996, after Clinton won re-election.

The president between Clinton and Obama, George W. Bush, did not face a primary challenge because of the special circumstances of his first term — the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq. Although many Democrats came to oppose the war by the 2004 election, Republicans were solidly with the president after the Iraq invasion in March 2003. Asked in a 2013 oral history project whether the Bush team worried about a primary challenge, campaign manager Ken Mehlman said, ""We didn't think, if you looked at where the country was, and particularly where the right side of the electorate was in 2002 — I did not think that was a real risk.""

Fast forward to today, after Republicans lost 41 House seats in the midterm elections. It is simply not surprising that some Republican voters would express an openness to see the president of their party, in this case Donald Trump, face a primary challenge. That's what voters do. On one hand, that reflects a measure of dissatisfaction with the president. On the other, it could be a peculiarity of polling; many people do not want to tell pollsters that their minds are closed so long before an election.

""At this early point in any campaign, people are not going to shut their minds,"" Republican pollster David Winston to me recently. ""They just don't do that. There's a huge difference between people saying they're thinking through things and how they behave. My guess is those polls are probably true, but that's because the electorate is trying to be thoughtful.""

It could be that, unlike Clinton, Bush, and Obama, Trump does end up facing a primary challenge. Such a challenge could be quite damaging, given that Presidents Ford, Carter, and Bush I all faced challenges and went on to lose the general election. Trump's 2016 margin of victory in some key states -- Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania -- was quite narrow, so a challenge need not be all that powerful to do significant harm.

But most of all, the primary talk serves to emphasize that polls often don't mean much. Back in 2010, in reporting the number of Democrats who were open to an Obama challenge, the Associated Press added this caution: ""Recent history shows presidents' early polling numbers mean little about their re-election prospects. At this stage two years before their re-elections, Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan had approval ratings that were lower than Obama's now, according to the Gallup Poll; both men won a second term. The ratings for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter were better than Obama's; both lost.""",Is Trump especially vulnerable to primary challenge? - Washington Examiner,Washingtonexaminer.com,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/is-trump-especially-vulnerable-to-primary-challenge
82,Empty,2019-02-25T19:48:07Z,The NRA and its Republican cheerleaders in Washington are no longer able to stop the Democrat-controlled House from pushing a gun safety agenda.,"At long last, after decades spent standing by as America devolved into a place where catastrophic gun violence could spontaneously erupt at any time, one of the legislative branch's two chambers is set to do something about it. This week, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives expects to pass a bipartisan bill that would require federal background checks on all firearms sales, including gun-show and other private-party transactions; it will also vote on a proposal to increase the number of allotted days for FBI background checks of prospective purchasers (something that might have prevented Dylann Roof from buying the gun he used to kill nine people at Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015).

Most Republicans in Congress still oppose both bills, because to them, any perceived incursion on a centuries-old constitutional provision designed to protect colonial-era militias against state-sanctioned dissolution amounts to modern-day apostasy. North Carolina congressman and perennial NRA water-carrier Richard Hudson has introduced his nationwide concealed-carry reciprocity bill as an amendment to the background-checks bill; if it were to pass, this would be roughly the equivalent of proposing to extinguish a fire by alternating between water and kerosene.

For the first time since 2011, however, it doesn't really matter what party leadership wants, thanks to a strong Democratic majority and a handful of Republicans who are willing to defect from conservative orthodoxy. The gun lobby's vise grip on the GOP agenda no longer prevents serious consideration of a common-sense policy for which more than 90 percent of Americans have expressed their support.

Neither measure will make it through the Republican-held Senate, where Mitch McConnell has completed his post-midterm-elections shift from ""straining to pass wildly unpopular legislation and confirm right-wing ideologues to the bench while turning a blind eye to the president's corruption and criminality"" back to ""cynical Obama-era obstructionism, but as willfully ignorant as ever."" Even so, House speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to champion this cause is an encouraging sign that this Congress does not intend to be as circumspect about addressing gun violence as its predecessors. Every bill McConnell blocks becomes another element of the Democratic pitch in 2020, because the party can point to it as evidence of exactly what it intends to do if voters entrust it with the Senate and the White House. It is difficult to pass anything of substance in a divided government; it is, however, a fine opportunity to make the case for why the next government shouldn't be a divided one.

In theory, this dynamic is as true for Republicans as it is for Democrats. In practice, it could be disastrous for the NRA and its cheerleaders in Washington, because the types of policies they oppose become more popular by the day: Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, progressive taxation schemes, and so on. As the unchecked gun-violence epidemic continues to claim American lives, the issue has become a top priority for fed-up voters who see it, as former congresswoman Gabby Giffords put it, as a ""devastating moral failure."" Even firearms-enthusiast types, with increasing frequency, are recognizing the folly of treating the Second Amendment as a suicide pact; a poll conducted after Parkland, for example, found that 97 percent of respondents in gun-owning households now favor universal background checks, too.

The NRA has spent millions of dollars on its efforts to entangle disinformation with fear-mongering, and its rhetoric will likely become even more extreme as it senses public opinion continue to shift in the other direction. What Nancy Pelosi and company know, though, is that all the scary Dana Loesch videos in the world won't matter if no one who will implement the gun lobby's agenda is in a position of power anymore.",House Democrats Are Finally Standing Up to the NRA.

But with 12 candidates already in the race, Democrats clearly believe that President Donald Trump is extremely vulnerable (his job-approval rating currently hovers around 44%). An early take on the Democratic field is therefore in order.

Attention so far has focused on the senators: Kamala Harris (California), Cory Booker (New Jersey), Kirsten Gillibrand (New York), Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota), and Bernie Sanders (Vermont). Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to join the race; in early polling, he runs first, and Sanders second. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, Senator Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and media sensation Beto O’Rourke may also run.

The current Democratic candidates fall into two camps. Those on the far left (Sanders, Warren, Harris, Booker, and Gillibrand) favor a huge expansion of government along Scandinavian democratic socialist lines. This entails higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and a government-run health-care system. They also support a radical restructuring of American energy under the so-called Green New Deal, which is being backed by new Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others. The initiative calls for retrofitting every building in the US for green efficiency, rapidly phasing out fossil fuels, and replacing much air travel with a national high-speed rail system. Also included is the left’s “social justice” wish list of guaranteed jobs and vacations, and a basic income for those “unable or unwilling to work.”

By contrast, the likely center-left candidates – Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg, and Brown (if they run) – favor more incremental policy proposals, claiming that the country is willing to go only so far and can afford only so much. All will claim they can win the presidency with the support of undecided independents and moderate Republicans.

If history is any guide, candidates who are not incumbent presidents rarely waltz to their party’s nomination. Bill Clinton eventually won the 1992 Democratic nomination after recovering from potentially fatal setbacks early in his campaign. And on the Republican side, John McCain was down and almost out before roaring back to capture the 2008 nomination.

Some of the Democratic candidates for 2020 may also overcome inevitable early stumbles. These include Warren’s controversial DNA test that disproved her Native-American heritage, Booker saying that the world can’t continue eating meat because cow flatulence emits methane, and Harris planning to eliminate employer-provided health insurance, upon which most Americans now rely. One of these three may even record an upset and become president. Or they may secure the nomination, fizzle on the big stage, and fade to an historical footnote, like George McGovern, Walter Mondale, and Michael Dukakis.

There is far less uncertainty among Republicans: barring a lightning strike, Trump will easily be renominated. Former Massachusetts Governor William Weld is a minor distraction, while former Ohio Governor John Kasich also is considering a challenge. Ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz may run as an independent, enraging Democrats who fear he would siphon off votes from their candidate.

The most important factor in the 2020 election will be the state of the economy, which is currently very strong, thanks in part to Trump’s tax reforms and his rollback of stifling Obama-era regulation, although only a fraction of voters give him credit for this. In addition, Trump can appeal to likely Republican voters by pointing to some of his other major first-term accomplishments. These include the start of military rebuilding, the appointment of two conservative Supreme Court justices, and new (albeit risky) approaches to North Korea and China.

The challenge for Trump in 2020 will be to persuade enough voters in the middle to give him another four years, despite their discomfort with some of his behavior. It remains to be seen whether Trump can tone down his tweeting to offend fewer potential voters and, as in his recent State of the Union address, reach for bipartisan compromise on important issues, as he recently did on major legislation to reform the criminal justice system.

Polls show that Democrats most value a candidate who can defeat Trump. Should Trump’s reelection prospects weaken, this could increase the likelihood of a far-left Democratic nominee with a radical agenda. But if Trump’s approval ratings improve, such a nominee could spell electoral disaster for the Democrats.

If the 2020 election is close, the result will hinge on a modest number of contested states, some of which are in the Midwest and are home to working-class voters who feel under assault from national Democrats. The Green New Deal will not go down well with Pennsylvania’s frackers, Ohio’s coal miners, and the region’s electricity consumers. Nor will the left’s cultural agenda.

As of now, the best thing going for the Democratic contenders, absent an economic downturn, is Trump’s behavior, whereas Trump’s best hope is the radical policy agenda of many Democratic candidates. If these trends continue, the 2020 presidential election could be as dramatic and unpredictable as the last one.",The Race to Challenge Trump,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-policies-by-michael-boskin-2019-02

Read Full Article at RT.com","Freshman congresswoman and political lightning rod Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is set to add another, more surprising title to her resume: comic book star.

Ocasio-Cortez will feature as a “butt-kicking” political superhero in a new comic book called ‘Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez And The Freshman Force,’ which is billed as “satire that takes aim at Washington” and that will “spare no one.”

The cover of the first issue “New Party, Who Dis?” – a reference to the jab Ocasio-Cortez made at her congressional colleague Joe Lieberman on Twitter – features the politician wielding a sword and wearing a Superwoman-style outfit in front of Capitol Hill.

Other artwork for the project, published by Devil’s Due, depicts the self-described Democratic Socialist with her smartphone in hand, wearing her signature white suit, hoop earrings and red lipstick.

Ocasio-Cortez – who has not actually endorsed the new venture featuring her likeness – amazed the comic book community recently, quoting Alan Moore’s graphic novel Watchmen in a tweet to her critics: “None of you understand. I’m not locked up in here with YOU. You’re locked up in here with ME.”

While Ocasio-Cortez is seen as somewhat of an outsider even by her own party, it looks like the comic book version of her life will mainly take aim at Republicans – and see the Democratic establishment get off the hook. Describing the comic in more detail, the publisher said it “satirically skewers everyone from President Trump to his near-endless team of morally-compromised Republican cronies.”

It’s not the first time political figures have become comic book heroes. Devil’s Due also turned former president Barack Obama into a comic book star in ‘Barack the Barbarian.’

The first issue of the Ocasio-Cortez-themed comic is set for release on May 15, in case you wanted to mark your calendars.

The California Republican Party has taken a beating in recent years, having not won a statewide election since 2006 and having lost multiple congressional seats in the former Republican stronghold of Orange County during the 2018 midterm elections.

Additionally, Republicans now rank third in voter registration in the state, behind Democrats and Independents. As of the 2018 midterms, only 25 percent of registered California voters were Republicans.

Patterson most recently served as the CEO of California Trailblazers, an organization dedicated to recruiting and training potential Republican candidates.

Advertising

Businesspeople and economists welcomed last week’s decision to abandon an unrealistic dollar peg for the country’s surrogate bond notes and electronic dollars, which were merged into a new currency called the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) dollar.

But they expressed doubts about whether the government has the fiscal and monetary discipline to stick to its commitment to lower the budget deficit and keep inflation in check.

“There is nothing to stop Zimbabwe printing money with this new currency,” said Jee-A van der Linde, an analyst at South Africa-based NKC African Economics. “The government has basically kicked the can down the road in recent years by trying to stimulate the economy through excessive spending.”

Advertising

Zimbabwe’s currency woes have undermined President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s efforts to win back foreign investors who were sidelined under his ousted predecessor, Robert Mugabe.

The last time Zimbabwe had its own currency, a decade ago, Mugabe’s government was able to turn on the printing presses to fund higher salaries for government workers, curry favour with the military and pay political opponents – with disastrous economic consequences.

Residents of the capital, Harare, now wait outside banks for hours to withdraw a maximum of around $30 in surrogate money or collect remittances from relatives abroad. Snaking queues have become the norm at petrol stations because of a shortage of fuel.

Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube last week pledged to contain public spending and reiterated the importance of the independence of the central bank. Yet, investors and Zimbabweans remain concerned that, should Mnangagwa’s government come under political or military pressure, it may revert to the tricks of the past.

Some also fear that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the country’s central bank, will be unwilling to loosen its grip over the currency as its governor, John Mangudya, is thought to oppose the move to abandon the dollar peg.

“It’s quite clear that the minister of finance wants a liberalised currency regime, whereas the governor of the Reserve Bank doesn’t,” said Eddie Cross, a Zimbabwean economist and former opposition lawmaker.

Whether Zimbabwean policymakers can convince their doubters, both in financial markets and on the streets, will be central to the success or failure of the new RTGS dollar.

If Zimbabweans begin to use banks instead of the black market to exchange any U.S. banknotes they have stashed under their mattresses, then the government could start to rebuild its foreign currency reserves by buying those dollars from banks.

That could give it the wherewithal to relaunch the Zimbabwean dollar when the economy has turned a corner.

Zimbabwe ditched its own currency for the U.S. dollar and other currencies in 2009, after hyperinflation reached 500 billion percent the previous year.

But as a chronic hard currency shortage worsened, it introduced a parallel system of bond notes and electronic dollars, nicknamed “zollars.” The substitute currencies were pegged at 1:1 to the U.S. dollar but traded at a discount on the black market.

MAKE OR BREAK

A key test for the RTGS dollar comes on Monday, when many Zimbabwean banks will buy and sell RTGS dollars on the interbank market for the first time. Some large firms will also be able to buy foreign currency from banks, but it is not clear how much or on what terms.

Many Zimbabweans are sceptical that the latest monetary intervention will reverse the crisis.

“The government has changed things over and over again,” said Godfrey Chinani, who is worried that customers will no longer be able to afford the car parts he sells from a cramped shop in downtown Harare.

He wishes Zimbabwe had switched to the rand instead, as he buys his goods mainly from South Africa.

“People get RTGS as salaries, but when you convert it to rand or U.S. dollars it is worth nothing,” he said. “It won’t work.”

The central bank sold U.S. dollars to a handful of banks at around 2.5 RTGS dollars on Friday, an effective devaluation of 60 percent. More than $5 million changed hands on the interbank market, a senior RBZ official told The Standard newspaper.

In the coming weeks, the new currency is expected to weaken towards 3.5 to the dollar, the level at which bond notes have been trading on the black market.

PRICE PRESSURES

Many Zimbabweans fear a return to the hyperinflation era that prevailed during part of Mugabe’s tenure if the RTGS dollar sinks much beyond that point. Inflation already hit a 10-year high of 57 percent in January, and some public servants say the currency devaluation means the government should raise their salaries by several times.

Authorities have pledged to control the currency’s slide as part of a “managed float,” but how they intend to do that remains a mystery.

The central bank said last week it had secured “sufficient lines of credit” to launch the RTGS. Analysts are scratching their heads as to where the money could have come from.

“People are bound to ask what backs this new currency,” said van der Linde. “It’s no wonder people are distrustful.”

Informal currency traders in downtown Harare said they were waiting to see how the new currency trades on Monday before they change their rates.

POLITICAL SOLUTION

Analysts say one way for Mnangagwa to build confidence in his economic reforms would be to try to mend a deep political rift with the country’s main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).

Mnangagwa narrowly defeated MDC leader Nelson Chamisa in an election last year which the opposition says was rigged but which Mnangagwa says he won fairly. A violent security crackdown on post-election protests and on demonstrations last month against a major fuel hike have hardened international attitudes towards Mnangagwa’s government and deterred much-needed investment.

“An economic solution on its own, without being backed by a political solution, won’t take us to sustainable economic development,” said Eldred Masunungure, a politics professor at University of Zimbabwe.

88,Empty,2019-02-25T12:18:46Z,"In spirit, in aim, and in execution, the Democratic Party's arguments have far more in common with Karl Marx than with Adam Smith.","A recent New York Times headline warned readers that “Republicans Already Are Demonizing Democrats as Socialists and Baby Killers.” The article pivots on President Donald Trump’s strategy of portraying Democratic Party leaders as a gaggle of radicalized socialists.

Now, Republicans have correctly accused Democrats of taking a hard-left turn when supporting legalization of third-trimester abortions for virtually any reason until the moment of birth (and sometimes after). And if you can be demonized for supporting such a position—as almost every Democrat presidential hopeful, all of whom oppose the Pass Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, does—it’s only because you have fully earned it.

But judging from the media’s reaction, Democrats are most apprehensive about being portrayed as “socialists,” which one expects isn’t as popular, even theoretically speaking, in suburban areas or Middle America as it is among the blue-check Twitterati and journalists in urban newsrooms.

New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait, one of the few left-of-center pundits willing to occasionally criticize Democrats for their collectivist tendencies, recently penned an article headlined, “Trump Calls the Democratic Party Socialist. He’s Lying,” in which he contends that both the leftward lurch of Democrats and the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders have been overstated for political reasons. A number of Democrat candidates, he says, have already rejected the word “socialist.”

Rebuffing the “s” word doesn’t make you any less socialist than embracing the word “capitalist” makes you a champion of free markets. No, these presidential candidates aren’t latter-day Trotskys, but contemporary Democrats, who have long favored tighter controls and bigger government, are now far more inclined to embrace proto-socialistic policies than they are liberal (in the genuine sense of the word) ones. By any fair reading, their agendas can be described as socialistic.

For starters, nearly every Democrat candidate now frames his or her political case within the context of a class struggle. Every one proposes fixing the scourge of “inequality,” not by loosening regulatory controls or finding ways to create a more meritocratic society, but by confiscating wealth and redistributing it to the alleged victims of capitalism. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s confiscatory “wealth tax,” although ostensibly about funding her pet projects, is sold as a way of instituting state-induced societal fairness.

She’s not alone. These days, the left’s big argument is one giant zero-sum economic fallacy—the idea, for example, that successful Americans are “taking” bigger pieces of the pie than they deserve, to the detriment of society. The argument, the spirit, the aim, and the execution have far more in common with Karl Marx than with Adam Smith.

The fact that Democrats propose using our vast capitalistic success to create this hybrid system doesn’t change the tenor or dogmatic nature of their agenda. Nor does sticking the word “democratic” in front of “socialist” make them any less dangerous. For one thing, socialists who operate in “democratic” nations do so because they have no choice. For another, democratically instituting redistributive policies doesn’t make those policies any less authoritarian, even if they are adopted incrementally.

When President Trump promised in his latest State of the Union that “America will never be a socialist country,” it surprised a lot of Democrats, who didn’t seem to fully comprehend their own ideological position. I’m not sure why. You might have socialistic tendencies, for instance, if you propose a federally run health-care system that bans consumers from purchasing private medical insurance, as leading presidential candidate Kamala Harris has done. This isn’t just another tax increase or new regulation. While you’re not technically suggesting that the Politburo run the means of production, you’re certainly headed in that direction.

You might also be a socialist if you propose a government takeover of the energy sector, which is what every politician who supports the Green New Deal is doing. Even if we stretch the imagination and concede, for the sake of argument, that these Democrats didn’t endorse the car-banning, cow fart-eliminating proposal offered by socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, ridding America of 90 percent of its most affordable, most efficient, and predominant energy sources in 10— or 20, or 40—years would necessitate a giant, coercive government project that would bring unprecedented intrusions into American life.

Nearly every Democratic Party presidential hopeful supports the aims of this plan. Nearly every Democratic politician wants the state to lord over the entire education sector. You’d be hard-pressed to find a single problem in American life, in fact, for which Democrats don’t have a gigantic, state-driven coercive solution.

These are just some of the reasons socialist Sanders has become a force on the left despite attempts to dismiss him. No Democrat running, in fact, has experienced more national success. He may not win the primary, but Sanders’ polls numbers are as good as any other candidate in the race right now. In a more democratic primary contest, Sanders could very easily have faced Trump as a nominee for president in 2016. Moreover, he represents the youngest and most animated faction of the left, which is to say the future.

The thing is, Bernie hasn’t changed in his 40 years in politics. It has been the Democratic Party, whose conception of policy is now almost indistinguishable from his, that has dramatically transformed. The perceptible differences between Sanders and Warren, Harris, Beto O’Rourke, and Kirsten Gillibrand are tactics and timelines, not endgames.

Isn’t it odd that not a single Democratic Party leader has been critical of Sanders’ collectivist ideology? This is a politician who went to the Soviet Union as a 47-year-old man, not as a radicalized 20-something, and praised one of the worst tyrannies in history. Will any 2020 Democrat presidential candidate condemn him for his adulation of Cuban, Venezuelan, and Nicaraguan socialism? Will anyone condemn him for having nicer things to say about nations with gulags, political executions, and mass starvation than he does for the United States?

The fact that we’re still far from a socialist nation doesn’t negate Democrats’ central argument. Polls show their constituents are increasingly comfortable with the word “socialism,” and though sometimes they likely don’t understand what it means, liberals have become increasingly comfortable with ideas associated with the philosophy, as well.

These ideas run counter to the ideals of American individual liberty and economic freedom (and are why liberals increasingly find themselves at odds with the Constitution — just ask Beto O’Rouke). The people normalizing collectivist notions deserve to be treated with the kind of contempt and derision that Trump has thrown their way.

“America was founded on liberty and independence–not government coercion, domination, and control,” Trump said during the Sate of the Union. “We are born free, and we will stay free.” He’s inarguably correct about the first.

While cooking chili and addressing supporters during an Instagram live stream Sunday evening, Ocasio-Cortez took aim at Feinstein's viral rebuttal to a group of kids urging her to support the the freshman congresswoman's environmental resolution.

""The issue has gotten worse. So I don't think that working on an issue for 30 years alone is what qualifies as — as what makes someone qualified to solve an issue,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a clear swipe at Feinstein.

""That said, there are a lot of people that have been doing this work for decades that have proposed ambitious solutions for years and have not been listened to,"" she added. ""So it's not just, 'I've been doing this for 30 years,' so we need to listen to them because frankly people have been failing at the same things for 30 or 40 years.

The 29-year-old Democratic Socialist said ""climate delayers are the new climate deniers"" and politicians who seek to ""fix"" climate change with a carbon tax alone are ""part of the problem,"" arguing a real solution has to match the magnitude of the problem.

Progressives envisioning a Green New Deal have turned away from carbon pricing in favor of government mandates to transition the U.S. to entirely renewable energy.

A group of children confronted Feinstein on Friday morning, demanding she vote for the Green New Deal. However, the senator wasn't having it.

“You know what’s interesting about this group? I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing. You come in here, and you say, ‘It has to be my way or the highway.’ I don’t respond to that. I’ve gotten elected. I just ran. I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality, and I know what I’m doing. Maybe people should listen a little bit,” Feinstein said in a video of the encounter outside the Democrat's San Francisco office shared on social media by the Sunrise Movement, a progressive climate advocacy group.





Feinstein told the group that the resolution was not sustainable because there was no way to pay for it and it would get no support from Republican lawmakers.

Feinstein said hours later she gave the group a draft of her resolution with specifics on how to combat climate change. The senator did not provide those specifics in her statement, but said she planned to reveal the resolution soon. “Unfortunately, it was a brief meeting but I want the children to know they were heard loud and clear. I have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation,"" she said.

The New Green Deal resolution was authored by Ocasio-Cortez and longtime climate advocate Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. It is nonbinding but calls for Congress to take the lead in ridding the nation of fossil fuels in the next few decades, among other dramatic environmental and economic changes.

Ocasio-Cortez is no stranger to facing off against long-established Democrats. She won against Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in June in their primary race. She then beat her Republican opponent, Anthony Pappas, in the general election and represents New York's 14th Congressional District.

Ocasio-Cortez also dismissed detractors of her Green New Deal on Friday, saying at an event in New York City to any critic who has yet to offer their own bold environmental ideas: ""Until you do it, I'm the boss.""

""Like I just introduced the Green New Deal two weeks ago, and it's creating all of this conversation. Why? Because no one else has even tried. Because no one else has even tried,"" she told moderator Reshma Saujani, founder and CEO of Girls Who Code.

""So people are like, 'Oh it's unrealistic. Oh it's vague. Oh it doesn't address this little minute thing,'"" she added. ""And I'm like, 'You try. You do it. Cuz you're not. Cuz you're not. So, until you do it, I'm the boss.' How about that?'""

The comments were met with laughter and cheers.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is fast-tracking the resolution through the Senate, enabling a vote as early as next week, in an effort to force Democrats and several of their presidential candidates to go on record as soon as next week on a plan that has attracted ridicule and split the party.

Patterson's appointment comes as state Democrats are foundering on a series of high-profile issues on the national stage, with the White House suggesting it will sue the state to reclaim billions of federal dollars wasted on the state's constantly delayed -- and eventually abandoned -- high-speed rail project.

""Let's serve notice to the Democrats in California that we are back and we are ready to deliver on the Republican comeback,"" Patterson, who also became the first Latina to ever chair the state GOP, said after winning. ""Then let's dig in and make it happen.""

She added: ""We’re going to take the fight to Democrats. We’re going to fight them in the press, at community gatherings ... and we’re going to beat them in elections.”

Patterson has a lengthy career in Republican politics, and previously directed the organization California Trailblazers, which prepares new candidates to run for office. She previously worked for the administrations of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as the campaign of gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman, among others.

The state, however, has shifted markedly leftward in recent years. California Democrats hold all statewide offices and a veto-proof supermajority in the state legislature, and Republicans have not won statewide office since 2006. The GOP ranks as third party status in voter registration behind Democrats and independents.

The 2018 election pushed the party further toward the brink of extinction in the nation's most populous state, with Democrats flipping seven U.S. House seats once considered GOP strongholds and Republicans holding less than a quarter of state legislative seats.

""We're going to be about one thing: Winning."" — Jessica Patterson

The results stunned Republicans, with then-House Speaker Paul Ryan calling the outcome ""bizarre."" Despite holding substantial leads on Election Day, many Republican candidates in California saw their advantage shrink, and then disappear, as late-arriving Democratic votes were counted in the weeks following the election.

HOW A MINOR CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION LAW MAY HAVE DOOMED REPUBLICANS' CHANCES

Some Republicans blamed a newly legal practice called ""ballot harvesting."" Two years ago, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law AB1921, which legalized the so-called practice of “ballot harvesting.” Previously, only a family member or someone living in the same household was permitted to drop off mail ballots for a voter, but the new allowed anyone – including political operatives – to collect and return them for a voter.

But without substantive evidence of electoral misconduct, the California Republican Party's delegates had to look inward and decide where the party would go next with its leadership. A majority of about 1,200 delegates chose Patterson, who previously headed a Republican candidate recruitment and training program.

Patterson argued bringing the Republican message into new communities would be the key to success and said she would push candidates to focus on California issues rather than the president's message.

Her two rivals, former state Assemblyman Travis Allen and party activist Steve Frank, said energizing the party base that loves President Trump was the key to success. Both are strident backers of the president.

But Patterson had the backing of most elected officials, including top Trump supporters like GOP House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. She was viewed as the candidate better prepared to raise money and do the grunt work required of a chair.

Her opponents argued she represents more of the same leadership that led the party into decline. Both charged the state party has not advocated for strong conservative values and shied away from full-throated Trump support. Allen came in second and Frank placed third.

""California Republicans are every bit as Republican as Republicans across the country,"" Allen said in an interview last week. ""It's about time we have a Republican party that stands for our values, our ideals and supports our Republican president.""

After the vote, Allen said only that he hopes ""the Republican party starts fighting again for the good of all Californians.""

Patterson said prior to the election she supports Trump. Beyond McCarthy, she had the backing of key Trump supporters such as U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes and the state's two Republican National Committee members.

But some of Trump's most fervent California supporters were disappointed by the outcome. Stephanie Sporcich, a teacher, said she got involved with the state party because of Trump's election. She cast her vote for Allen, and saw the chairmanship race as a battle between the grassroots and the establishment.

""We're the ones that are the strongest Trump supporters with Trump values,"" she said, adding she and other new activists have already successfully infiltrated the party structure and will keep working to do so.

But Elizabeth Patock, another teacher, liked Patterson's focus on bringing ""non-traditional Republicans"" into the party. Patock did not vote for Trump and said she dislikes how ugly national politics have become.

She said Patterson ""has a positive message.""

Patterson is the first Latina to lead the state party. She did not make her personal heritage a major piece of her campaign, but said the party needs to use ""new messengers.""

California Republicans have struggled to appeal to the state's growing Latino and Hispanic population because of the party's position on illegal immigration, among other things. Patterson did not provide specifics Sunday on how she will deal with that issue.

As a gesture of goodwill, she named Frank and Allen as co-chairs of a voter registration committee. Both had highlighted the party's outsourcing of voter registration activities as a major flaw. And she called for unity among California Republicans.

""Our success will be a team effort, no egos, no personal agenda, no drama,"" she said. ""We're going to be about one thing: Winning.""

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari looks set for re-election, results from Saturday's general election show.

With results in from most states, he has a lead of more than three million votes over his rival Atiku Abubakar.

Mr Abubakar's People's Democratic Party (PDP) has called for a halt in the count, alleging irregularities.

Delays and violence marred the run-up to the vote but no independent observer has said that there was electoral fraud.

Mr Buhari, a member of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party, is seeking a second term in office.

So far the APC has 19 states, while the PDP has 16 plus the capital Abuja. The candidate with the most votes is declared the winner as long as they have at least 25% of the votes in 24 or more of the 36 states.

Each party says the other is working with the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) to influence the vote, which was initially scheduled for 16 February but delayed for a week at the last minute.

Mr Buhari has promised to build on his accomplishments in office so far, while Mr Abubakar, a business tycoon, has accused the president of wasting his term.

Whoever wins in Africa's most populous nation and largest economy faces a range of problems including power shortages, corruption, security threats, and an economic slowdown.

The election commission is due to formally announce the winner on Wednesday.

What are the allegations?

PDP chair Uche Secondus has called the count ""incorrect and unacceptable"". On Tuesday the party said counting should be stopped, alleging data from voter card readers had been manipulated.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nigerians are anxious to find out the winner of the election

The federal government has accused the PDP of trying to ""scuttle the polls"" and prompt a constitutional crisis.

The African Union, the UN and regional bloc Ecowas have called on parties involved in the election to exercise restraint and await the full announcement of the results.

The initial vote was postponed early on 16 February, five hours before polls were due to open. Voters were also choosing members of the House of Representatives and Senate.

Most of the country was calm but there were reports of attacks by the Boko Haram Islamist militant group in the north, and voter intimidation and attempts to steal ballot boxes, especially in the southern states of Rivers, Lagos, and Anambra.

A coalition of civil society groups reported that a total of 16 people were killed around the country - fewer than in previous elections.

Two people were arrested in Lagos after a group of armed young men attacked voters, eyewitness Ralph Onodike told the BBC.

""What they were saying was that if you were not [voting for the ruling party] APC, you'll be attacked,"" he said.

What are the main issues?

Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer but corruption and a failure to invest the proceeds from the industry have hampered development.

A slow recovery from a recession in 2016 means there are not enough jobs for the large number of young people joining the employment market. About a quarter of the working age population is unemployed.

73 million have voters' cards

51% of the electorate under the age of 35

73 registered presidential candidates

120,000 polling stations

Mr Buhari has quelled a militant Islamist rebellion in Nigeria's north-east, but Boko Haram remains active. There has also been an upsurge in violence in the Middle Belt as traditional herders and more settled farmers have clashed.

Until 1999 Nigeria was governed by either short-lived civilian administrations or military rulers. But this year marks 20 years since the return of democracy.

Mr Buhari was elected in 2015 - the first time an opposition candidate had defeated an incumbent to become president.

Both Mr Buhari and Mr Abubakar are from the mainly Muslim north of the country and both are in their 70s, while more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35.",Nigeria election 2019: Muhammadu Buhari takes early lead - BBC News,Bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47363328

Nelson Chamisa, leader of Opposition Movement for Democratic Change.

The opposition MDC party's National Council has resolved to establish a party school of ideology named after its founding president, the late Morgan Tsvangirai.

According to a statement released after last Friday's council meeting in Harare, the school will ""inculcate the ideals and principles of social democracy, smart leadership and infuse a culture of good governance across all strands of leadership"".

The move by the country's main opposition follows a similar scheme by ruling Zanu PF which established the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology after its own founding leader.

However, MDC spokesperson Jacob Mafume dismissed the Zanu PF programme had since lost meaning and value to the society.

""We need to understand that we are a pro-poor; pro-people party,"" Mafume told NewZimbabwe.com.

""We need to develop policies, analyse and evaluate them though the length of a social democratic pro-poor party. We need to be the option of the poor that uplifts the people.""

He condemned the Zanu PF institution, saying it was propagating violence and the killings of civilians.

""We believe that we can develop a developmental state that is social democratic,"" said Mafume.

""Ours has never been a party of violence; ours has always been a party of peace; ours has been always a party of tolerance.

""We have never killed anyone to be where we are. The MP and council seats that we have and the victories that we have obtained in the presidential elections have never been on top of any body's dead body.""

MDC presidential spokesman Nkululeko Sibanda added: ""Young Zimbabweans have grown up under a Zanu PF ideology of violence, political impropriety and President Chamisa wants to have an Africa-led by 'big great ideas' and not 'big men'.

""Improving life outcomes of the people and how to make sure that our young generation achieves a better life than ours is what our President believes in. He is effecting a society of great ideas.""

He added; ""We are moving away of Zanu PF's ideology of corruption, content, force, noise, discontent, complaining. We are gearing to cleanse our society from all these evils.""",Zimbabwe: Opposition Party to Launch Tsvangirai School of Ideology,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201902250258.html

For at least 80 years, some Republicans have referred to their major opponents as members of the ""Democrat Party,"" not by its name — the ""Democratic Party."" It's a jab suggesting that the party is not democratic.

At NPR we ""avoid loaded words preferred by a particular side in a debate.""

In a Monday statement, the liberal wing of the U.K.'s Parliament announced it would introduce five major demands for Britain's exit from the EU. The party also said it would call for a second referendum, possibly allowing for Brexit to be called off if those demands aren't met.

Britain first voted to leave the EU in mid-2016, but its actual departure plan has been a mess ever since. Prime Minister Theresa May's only proposed Brexit deal failed spectacularly last month, and members of Parliament have since approved a nonbinding amendment blocking a Brexit without a deal preserving relations with the EU. Parliament now has to approve a deal before the March 29 scheduled exit or, as Labour is now hoping, hold a referendum and potentially reverse Brexit altogether.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced the party's call for a ""people's vote"" on Monday, reversing his previously ""lukewarm"" stance on a referendum, BBC says. Still, this push will only come if Labour's five demands for a Brexit deal aren't met in a Tuesday vote. Those demands include a ""permanent customs union with the EU,"" as detailed in a press release here.

Some Greens, namely Howie Hawkins, have accused the congresswoman of appropriating the Green New Deal — a bold new plan introduced by Ocasio-Cortez that calls for the U.S. to run on 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.

""A lot of people think [Ocasio-Cortez] thought it up,"" Hawkins told The New Republic. ""But I'm the original Green New Dealer.""

Hawkins is referring to a plan he presented when he ran for New York governor in 2010, which proposed to fight climate change ""with the same urgency ... that our country demonstrated in converting to war production"" during World War II. The Green Party now has a separate Green New Deal.

Hawkins, who is considering running for the Green Party presidential nomination, did say he was happy that Ocasio-Cortez has helped some of the Green Party's ideas reach the mainstream, but added that the Democrats' version of Green New Deal is a watered down version of the Greens', which includes calls for single-payer Medicare-for-all, tuition-free college, and ""democratically run, publicly owned facilities.""

Dario Hunter, another potential Green Party presidential candidate, accused Democrats of touting ""cafeteria socialism"" where they only select certain elements of the political ideology that could help their campaigns.

Texas congressman John Cornyn prompted confusion and incredulity with an out-of-context Twitter post quoting the former Italian ruler.

He tweeted on Sunday: “We were the first to assert that the more complicated the forms assumed by civilisation, the more restricted the freedom of the individual must become.”

More than six hours later, after being asked to clarify the post, he said he was warning ”against an overly powerful central government”.

“Since so-called Democratic Socialists have forgotten or never learned the lessons of history, and how their ideology is incompatible with freedom, I guess we have to remind or teach them,” he tweeted.

Twitter users pointed out that Mr Cornyn was attacking socialism by quoting a fascist who ordered the murder of his socialist political opponents.

“I can’t decide if you’re too dumb to understand the quote or just a terrible American,” said one. “The lesson of history is that Mussolini was an enormous liar, and that he slandered progressive forms of government with fear mongering so that he could promote a far-right agenda built on patriotic distraction to enact the most dreadful anti-liberty policies possible.”

Canadian writer Jeet Heer tweeted: “When you consider the number of Democratic Socialists who were jailed and murdered for opposing Mussolini and Hitler, the true obscenity of this tweet becomes glaring.”

Jared Holt, a reporter for Right Wing Watch, wrote: “Senator who quoted Mussolini says he did so to warn against socialism, while neglecting to mention that Mussolini killed off his socialist opponents.”

Mussolini, who ruled Italy between 1922 and 1943, organised armed squads known as Black Shirts to terrorise political opponents.

Mr Cornyn will stand for a fourth term in 2020, and Donald Trump last week endorsed his re-election bid.

“Senator John Cornyn has done an outstanding job for the people of Texas,” the president tweeted.

99,Empty,2019-02-25T15:47:31Z,Labour's deputy leader has become the focus of resistance to Mr Corbyn after nine MPs quit the party over anti-Semitism to set up the new Independent Group.,"Tom Watson issued a direct challenge to Jeremy Corbyn today as he set up his own group of moderate MPs inside Labour and called for evidence of anti-Semitism in the party to be sent directly to him.

Labour's deputy leader has become the focus of resistance to Mr Corbyn after nine MPs quit the party over anti-Semitism to set up the new Independent Group.

Mr Watson has moved to create a new group inside Labour to promote the 'social democrat' tradition represented by many MPs who do not endorse Mr Corbyn's far left-wing agenda.

He warned today there was a 'crisis for the soul of the Labour Party' and insisted mainstream MPs who served Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had to have a say under Mr Corbyn's leadership.

In a further escalation he emailed all of the party's MPs and peers today asking to be copied into any new anti-Semitism complaints sent to Labour's general secretary Jennie Formby.

Mr Watson said his office would create its own system to track complaints in parallel with official investigations.

The moves - which will infuriate left-wing allies of Mr Corbyn - come as the leader of Momentum admitted Labour has 'under-estimated' anti-Semitism in its ranks.

Jon Lansman, who founded the hard-left campaign group out of Mr Corbyn's first leadership campaign, said Labour had to be more proactive to find anti-Semites because it has a 'much larger' number of racist members than it thought.

But he rejected claims from Labour deputy leader Tom Watson (pictured on Marr yesterday) that Mr Corbyn should take personal charge of the fight to root out abuse

Labour has 'under-estimated' anti-Semitism in its ranks and has a 'much larger' number of racist members than it thought, the leader of Momentum Jon Lansman (file) admitted today

Mr Watson unveiled plans for the new group on his website.

He said: 'I called on Jeremy to do more to unite the party and reshuffle the Shadow Cabinet to give greater weight to MPs with social democratic rather than socialist views.

'The need to see Labour as the broad church of its tradition is the main reason why I am convening a group of MPs this week who believe in the party's social democratic tradition to develop policies.

'As I told Marr: ''We're only electorally successful if those traditions can rub up against each other. Harold Wilson had Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins in his Cabinet, and so that is our challenge''.

'There is almost a crisis for the soul of the Labour party. Everyone that cares about our future - whatever tradition they represent - has to find it within themselves to work more closely together. And that is as big a challenge for Jeremy as it is for me.'

Labour sources close to Mr Corbyn played down the new group, insisting 'input of policy ideas' to develop the 2017 manifesto were 'welcome'.

Meanwhile, Labour has declined to comment on reports that Mr Corbyn is to meet former justice secretary Lord Falconer of Thoroton to discuss how the party can tackle the issue of anti-Semitism.

Mr Corbyn was said to be considering asking the peer, a former flatmate of Tony Blair, to be the party's anti-Semitism surveillance commissioner, with full oversight of how it handles complaints and decision-making processes.

Jon Lansman, who founded the hard-left campaign group out of Jeremy Corbyn's (pictured on Saturday in Telford) first leadership campaign, said Labour had to be more proactive to find anti-Semites

Mr Lansman - who is himself Jewish - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was 'extremely upset' by Ms Berger's departure, adding: 'I think any Jewish member of the party leaving the party because of anti-Semitism is a source of tremendous regret and sadness and some shame.'

He rejected Ms Berger's claim that the party is 'institutionally anti-Semitic'.

But he said: 'I do think we have a major problem and it always seems to me that we under-estimate the scale of it. I think it is a widespread problem.

'I think it is now obvious that we have a much larger number of people with hardcore anti-Semitic opinions which unfortunately is polluting the atmosphere in a lot of constituency parties and in particular online. We have to deal with these people.'

Mr Lansman said he welcomed Mr Watson's decision to bring forward cases of alleged anti-Semitism, saying: 'I think it is a responsibility of everyone in the Labour Party, from the top to the bottom, to report cases ... I think we should be more proactive in going out and seeking cases, so I welcome that.'

And on the deputy leader's decision to set up a group for centrist MPs, he said: 'We are a pluralist party ... I welcome that.'

Mr Lansman said measures had been taken to speed up decision-making in anti-Semitism cases, but added: 'It has taken very much longer than we had hoped and it has proved larger and larger.'

Mr Watson's intervention came as eight former Labour MPs formally met with their ex-Tory colleagues at the first meeting of the new Independent Group today (pictured)

But he was wary of calls for Mr Corbyn to take personal charge.

'Jeremy Corbyn has been an anti-racist campaigner all his life, I have known him for decades and I do absolutely believe in his commitment to eradicate that,' he said.

'I think he is overseeing the party's battle against anti-Semitism. I'm not sure about him taking personal responsibility for cases. I think if he did that, some people might argue that that would be inappropriate.'

Mr Lansman said the emergence of anti-Semitism as a major issue was in part due to the trebling of the size of Labour's membership since Mr Corbyn took the helm, with the 300,000 new members including some conspiracy theorists who are active on social media.

'There are conspiracy theorists in many parts of the political spectrum, I don't think it's exclusive to the Labour Party,' he said.

But he added: 'The Tory Party is a smaller party and an elderly party and the role of social media in fomenting and spreading some of the poison is therefore more of a problem in the Labour Party.'",Tom Watson makes direct challenge to Corbyn,Daily Mail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6743399/Tom-Watson-makes-direct-challenge-Corbyn.html

A BIG DEAL … NATASHA KORECKI: “Warren shuts down donor dinners, insider access”: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced Monday her campaign will shun fundraising through some of the old-fashioned means: dinners, donor calls and cocktail parties. In an email to supporters Monday, Warren also said she won’t sell access to big-name donors as candidates often do to raise money for a presidential bid.

“Warren has demonstrated as much in organizing events where she poses for photos with anyone who stands in line and requests it. Typically, candidates put a premium on such access, sometimes charging thousands of dollars for a personal photograph.” POLITICO

-- ESCHEWING high-dollar fundraising is a big deal and represents a shift for Warren, and perhaps a new standard other candidates will feel pressured to follow. This comes as many Democratic candidates have already taken a second look at whether they will continue to accept corporate PAC checks and could have a longer-lasting impact on how big donors and industry try to curry favor with candidates.

HEADS UP -- “Former campaign staffer alleges in lawsuit that Trump kissed her without her consent.

Johnson said she turned her head and the unwanted kiss landed on the side of her mouth, which she called ‘super-creepy and inappropriate.’ …

“Johnson said she told her boyfriend, mother and stepfather about the incident later that day, an account all three confirmed to The Post. Two months later, Johnson consulted a Florida attorney about the unwanted kiss …

“Two Trump supporters that Johnson identified as witnesses — a campaign official and Pam Bondi, then the Florida attorney general — denied seeing the alleged kiss in interviews with The Post. … Johnson, an event planner who lives in Madison County, Ala., is seeking unspecified damages for emotional pain and suffering.” WaPo … The complaint

The Dec. 7, 2017, meeting is just one example of interactions between Wehrum, a skilled lawyer and regulator, and former clients that ethics experts say comes dangerously close to violating federal ethics rules. … Late last week, three Democrats … asked the EPA’s Office of Inspector General to investigate Wehrum’s conduct.” WaPo

“The dispute is not merely a tactical one — it goes to the heart of how Democrats envision themselves becoming a majority party.

Read Full Article at RT.com,"A whopping one million people have already signed up to support Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign since the popular senator announced last week that he would take another shot at the White House in 2020.

After just one week of official campaigning, the Sanders campaign is shaping up to be a major political juggernaut. The Vermont senator announced last Wednesday that his campaign had raised a massive $6 million in the first 24 hours since he announced his second bid for the presidency — and now he’s giving his opponents even more to worry about.

In a video posted to Twitter on Monday, Sanders announced that one million volunteers had joined up across every congressional district in the country. Even more concerning for the other 2020 Democratic contenders, more than 324,000 of those sign-ups were new people who were not part of his 2016 campaign — proving that the senator is still able to attract new blood.

Breaking: In just six days, 1 million people have already signed on to support our campaign. We are just getting started. pic.twitter.com/2p6gljH2vT — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 25, 2019

The astonishingly quick progress will likely come as a surprise to many on both sides of the political spectrum who had dismissed Sanders as an unfeasible candidate due to his age (77) and his more socialist ideals — a departure from the more centrist, corporate-friendly positions taken by the Democratic establishment.

When Sanders announced his campaign last week, he said he was looking for 1 million people to back him. His team just said he's hit that mark.



But the number that other campaigns will notice: ""The sign ons include...324,186 new people who were not part of Sanders’ 2016 campaign"" — Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) February 25, 2019

In 2016, Sanders’ massive grassroots movement shocked the media and political establishment and proved that there was real demand among Democrats for more left-wing and socialist policies. The self-described “democratic socialist” is largely credited with moving the Democratic party to the left on issues like ‘Medicare for All’ and free college tuition.

But Sanders narrowly lost the party nomination to Hillary Clinton after the Democratic National Committee (DNC) — a supposedly neutral body — was found to be actively working to favor the Clinton camp at his expense, convinced that she was the candidate that could beat Donald Trump, even as polls showed that Sanders had a better chance at beating then-candidate Trump.

Also on rt.com He’s back: Will Sanders be able to make enough Americans ‘feel the Bern’ in 2020?

Sanders’ campaign has put fellow 2020 candidate Kamala Harris on the defensive, repeatedly having to answer questions about whether she is as “progressive” or a “socialist.”

The California senator, who is also seen as a strong contender among a crowded Democratic field, has said she is progressive, but has distanced herself from the “democratic socialist” label.

AOC is a D…,"The new wave of Democrats – with media darling New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) in the lead – are fully Socialist. And even more Reality-and-math-challenged than their immediate Democrat predecessors.

And that’s saying something.

AOC is a Democrat Socialist. She says so.

Newly re-minted Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is…a little crazy. And crazy radical.

But Pelosi is crazy and crazy radical – she ain’t AOC crazy and crazy radical. Or more realistically – Pelosi is at least somewhat politically pragmatic.

Pelosi and many of her legacy Democrats – and by “legacy” we mean anyone elected prior to 2018 – are now having to spend a lot of their time trying to refill the toothpaste tube…upon which AOC and Company are fervently jumping.

Because insanity keeps shooting out and all over them – and us. And Pelosi is understandably concerned the mess the Young Turks are making – threatens their new House Majority and any hope for electoral wins in 2020.

Pelosi Throws Shade as Green New Deal Unveiled:

“‘It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,’ Pelosi told Politico on Wednesday. ‘The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it right?’”

Now that’s a pretty chilly response.

Pelosi is right to be worried – for another reason.

Pelosi knows most of her Party – is WAY out there on the WAY Left with AOC.

And Pelosi fears AOCs incessant airtime, mindless enthusiasm and her Pez-dispensing Communism – will coax more and more Democrats out of “moderate” hiding. And into the bright light of full-on, unapologetic Socialism-Communism – they all long to fully embrace.

The current chair of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) is Tom Perez. Who is unbelievably radical. And he long ago embraced the Democrat Socialist openness AOC is inspiring.

DNC Chair Tom Perez Calls Democratic Socialist Ocasio-Cortez ‘The Future of Our Party’

AOC is in fact a Democrat Socialist. She says so. And the head of the Party – says she is the future of the Party.

Well, to quote former Washington Redskins Coach George Allen: “The future is now.”

Ask yourself: Is the Party’s voter base, their enthusiasm and energy on Pelosi’s side – or AOCs?

Pelosi’s concerns were yet again realized on Sunday’s “Fox News Sunday” – on which Perez appeared. He had to spend a good deal of time trying to slough off assertions the Party is Socialist-Communist – without actually denying the Party is Socialist-Communist.

If you’re explaining – you’re losing.

Another Party member excitedly enticed way out on AOCs skinny limb – is Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey to Unveil ‘Green New Deal’ Bill

The Senate’s Majority Leader – Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell – very helpfully offered to fast track Markey’s bill for a vote. So as to get a sense of the Senate – where each member is on this particular raft of Democrat Socialism.

Markey’s reaction was…not that of someone who thinks his bill is good news for his Party.

Sen. Markey Accuses Sen. McConnell Of Sabotaging Green New Deal…By Bringing it to Senate Floor

If you think Markey sounds confused – it’s only because he is.

He is confused by the fact a strong majority of Americans – do not think unilaterally crippling the American energy sector is a particularly good idea.

Nevertheless, Markey is loving his AOC-inspired newfound freedom – to propose taking more and more of our freedom.

So Markey is looking to cripple more than just the energy sector. Behold his Internet New Deal.

Oh – since we’re kicking around “New Deal” so much:

“The New Deal was a series of programs launched by Franklin D. Roosevelt during his presidency. The New Deal was Roosevelt’s way to solve the problems caused by the Great Depression….”

Except “Roosevelt’s way to solve the problems caused by the Great Depression” – did absolutely nothing of the sort.

FDR’s Folly: How Roosevelt and His New Deal Prolonged the Great Depression

Yet today’s Democrat Socialists – are happily re-embracing the name. And the REALLY awful government hyper-activity.

What do Markey and his Democrat Socialists want to do to the Internet?

A New Net Neutrality Bill Is Headed to Congress:

“Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) said he would ‘soon’ introduce a bill to permanently reinstate the net neutrality rules that were repealed by the Federal Communications Commission, led by chairman Ajit Pai, in 2017.”

Here the Democrat Socialists are even more New Deal-y than you think.

They are looking to impose landline telephone law – on to the Internet. Law that passed…in 1934. Smack dab in the middle of FDR’s failed New Deal and their prolonged Great Depression.

Yes, by all means – let’s bring back the Democrat Party-imposed Roaring Thirties. Let’s flash forward nearly a century – and ridiculously attempt to impose Great Depression law upon the 21st Century Internet.

From a tech perspective – this makes ZERO sense.

The World Wide Web – is orders-of-magnitude more intricate, complex and complicated than the landline telephone network.

Government constricting the private sector Web all the way down to landline phone line-size – so as to fit it into the massive slate of regulations – is to kill the private sector Web.

Which means from an economic perspective – Markey’s Internet New Deal makes ZERO sense.

Unless you’re a Democrat Socialist:

“Democratic socialists hold that capitalism is inherently incompatible with what they hold to be the democratic values of liberty, equality and solidarity; and that these ideals can only be achieved through the realization of a socialist society.

“Democratic socialism can be supportive of either revolutionary or reformist politics as a means to establish socialism.”

The AOC-Markey Green New Deal – is a Democrat Socialism revolution.

And will kill the private energy sector. Which is the point – right, Barack Obama?

Obama’s Promise the Bankrupt the Coal Industry

Markey’s Internet New Deal – is a Democrat Socialist revolution.

And will kill the private sector Internet. Which is the point – right, Democrat Socialist Robert McChesney?:

“(T)he battle over network neutrality is not to completely eliminate the telephone and cable companies. We are not at that point yet. But the ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phone and cable companies and to divest them from control.”

All of which sounds really good – right, Democrat Socialist California Senator Kamala Harris?

105,Empty,2019-02-25T22:10:00Z,Fairfax made the remarks in a surprise speech on Sunday.,"Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax invoked decades of racist violence on Sunday when he likened recent criticism and calls for his resignation in the wake of sexual assault allegations against him to a “political lynching” during an unexpected speech before the Virginia Senate on the last day of the legislative term.

Fairfax made several references to lynching in the speech, which comes weeks after two women publicly accused him of sexually assaulting them in the early 2000s. His remarks also come just over a week after the state’s House of Delegates and Senate both passed measures expressing “profound regret” for the racially motivated lynchings that occurred in Virginia in the decades after the Civil War.

“We talk about hundreds, at least 100 terror lynchings that have happened in the Commonwealth of Virginia under those very same auspices,” Fairfax said, according to the Washington Post. “And yet we stand here in a rush to judgment with nothing but accusations and no facts and we decide that we are willing to do the same thing.”

Fairfax’s comments, which came as Virginia’s Republican legislators are calling for a public hearing into the sexual assault allegations, immediately raised eyebrows. The Post said the comments pitted “racial progress against the call of the #MeToo movement to ‘believe women.’”

In his remarks, Fairfax argued that his story is connected to the history of lynchings in America. “I’m happy to be just one representative example of whether or not we’re going to rise to the better angels of our nature or go back down a very dark political road, where 50 years ago, had fingers been pointed at me in the exact same way, it’d be a very different outcome,” Fairfax said.

The Post noted that Fairfax’s comments implied “that he would have been subject to extrajudicial violence,” despite both of the accusations against him coming from black women, a group whose claims had no bearing on lynchings, which were spurred by accusations made by white men and women.

In his speech, which positioned Fairfax’s political future as being closely connected to the future of Virginia, Fairfax made other direct references to racism and injustice as he discussed the importance of due process, directly referencing the current 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in Virginia as well as the due process protections of the 14th Amendment — one of three constitutional amendments passed after the Civil War.

“If we go backward, and we rush to judgment and we allow for political lynchings without any due process, any facts, any evidence being heard, I think we do a disservice to this very body in which we all serve,” Fairfax added.

The lieutenant governor’s remarks were some of his most aggressive in the weeks after the two women — Scripps professor Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson, a schoolmate of Fairfax’s at Duke University — publicly came forward. Republican legislators condemned his speech.

Democrats, meanwhile, have largely remained silent. Many Democrats in the Virginia General Assembly have been navigating a tightrope since the allegations were made public. They’re currently grappling with a cascading series of controversies within the state party, after it emerged that both Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring wore blackface in the 1980s. So far, all three have refused to resign.

Some Democrats have voiced concerns that if Fairfax alone faces punishment, it will prove a double standard in how the party responds to allegations of sexual assault versus racism. Fairfax’s recent speech draws on this tension.

Fairfax’s reference to lynching calls to mind a painful history — one that high-profile black men accused of assault have invoked in recent years

As Vox’s Anna North has explained, Fairfax currently faces a pair of allegations. Tyson has accused Fairfax of forcing her to perform oral sex on him in 2004 while both were attending the Democratic National Convention, and Watson says that Fairfax raped her in 2000 while both were undergraduates at Duke.

Fairfax has denied the allegations and says both encounters were consensual. He has also called for the claims to be investigated by the FBI or other law enforcement.

Those calls have been echoed by other Virginia Democrats, who have largely avoided requests for public hearings into the issue, saying that hearings would quickly become a “political, partisan circus” and adding that they have concerns about a public hearing interfering with any police investigation. But by referencing lynchings on Sunday, Fairfax attempted to tie the allegations against him — both of which have been made by black women — to a long history of racial violence, one that recalls a time when a white woman’s accusation of sexual assault was enough to cost a black man his life.

Fairfax is not the first person to make this connection, as the Post notes. In the early 1990s, Clarence Thomas used the term “high-tech lynching” when the Senate Judiciary Committee raised the sexual harassment allegations brought against him by Anita Hill while he was a Supreme Court justice nominee.

Defenders of both comedian Bill Cosby, who was convicted of sexual assault in April 2018, and musician R. Kelly, who was recently indicted on 10 counts of sexual abuse, have also argued that the men were both victims of “public lynchings.”

But it’s worth noting that these specific cases often — if not exclusively — involved black men facing accusations of assault from black women, a fact that undercuts the effort to invoke the racist history of lynching.

And in pointing to lynching to deal with accusations of assault, critics say these men also minimize the harm this practice has had on black communities that were exposed to lynching and its aftermath. It has raised arguments that recent claims of lynchings in the wake of sexual assault allegations are often crudely and ignorantly applied, dismissing black accusers who already struggle to have their allegations heard in an effort to cast the men they’re accusing as the true victims of a racist America.

In comments to the Washington Post, Fairfax spokesperson Lauren Burke tried to distance the politician from these examples, arguing that his comments “stand on their own” and that the lieutenant governor only mentioned lynchings to highlight the importance of due process.

“There has been no investigation whatsoever,” of his case, she said. Burke declined to offer additional comment to Vox.

Virginia voters and legislators are divided over what should happen to Fairfax

For now, Fairfax has resisted the calls for him to leave office.

Initially, Virginia Democrats hesitated to call for Fairfax’s resignation, instead echoing requests for due process and an investigation. When Watson’s allegations were made public, some local politicians then called for Fairfax to resign, but when one Democrat proposed impeachment, those calls quickly receded.

In recent weeks, many Democrats — likely aware of the optics of forcibly ousting Fairfax, just the second black statewide elected official in Virginia’s history, who had until recently been called a rising star — have emphasized calls for an investigation from law enforcement.

Republicans, however, have announced that they want to hold public hearings where Tyson, Watson, and Fairfax all testify. In recent days, Watson and Tyson have both indicated interest in speaking publicly, but Tyson has said she will only participate if there is bipartisan support. Neither woman has publicly responded to Fairfax’s recent speech.

For now, with the Virginia General Assembly’s recent session now over, what happens next remains unclear. Public opinion polling has shown that Virginians are split on whether Fairfax should leave office, with more white voters than black ones supporting Fairfax’s resignation.

But with his recent remarks, Fairfax may find that he’s opened himself up to more criticism. “This is kind of a subtle way of making people choose between being anti-racist and being anti-sexist,” Rutgers University professor Salamishah Tillet told the New York Times on Sunday. “Black women are being cast as white lynch mobs. That should be a cause of deep alarm.”","Facing allegations of sexual assault, Virginia Lt. Gov.

Bernie Sanders’ entry into the 2020 presidential race has complicated fellow liberal Elizabeth Warren’s bid for the Democratic nomination, a path that runs straight through New Hampshire.

Sanders, a U.S. senator from neighboring Vermont, retains a strong following in the state where he trounced Hillary Clinton by more than 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential contest.

An Emerson College opinion poll of New Hampshire voters released on Saturday showed Sanders to be the top choice of respondents with 27 percent of the vote. Warren, a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, was far behind at 9 percent – a worrisome number given many New Hampshire voters are familiar with her.

But as Warren, 69, returned to the early voting state over the weekend for the second time this month, there were signs she could be chipping away at Sanders’ support a year before the New Hampshire primary election.

Some New Hampshire residents who voted for Sanders last time told Reuters they now were leaning toward Warren. Some said the 77-year-old Sanders’ political window had closed. Others said they wanted to see a female nominee.

“Bernie lost his shine,” said Candace Moulton, 36, who attended Warren’s campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. “I think we’re really ready to have a woman president, to be frank.”

New Hampshire often has been where presidential aspirations are solidified. While the Iowa caucuses serve as the first test of a candidate’s strength, New Hampshire holds the first party primary, and has been a state where a contender can build momentum, salvage a campaign or reach the end of the road.

Ten Democrats have already declared their candidacy for the party’s nomination, and more are expected to join the contest. The winner will likely face Republican President Donald Trump in the general election in November 2020.

New Hampshire’s primary traditionally has favored candidates with ties to the region, making it important for Sanders and Warren to target. Both are progressives with similar policy platforms that include providing universal health care coverage and raising the minimum wage.

Dante Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, said he expects the presidential field to narrow significantly by the time the primary comes.

“There’s a good likelihood that New Hampshire will be framed as a Sanders-Warren competition with one ticket out,” he said.

Should Warren fail to win Iowa, New Hampshire becomes a “must-win,” Scala said. “It’s hard to see her lasting if she can’t win here.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden could muddy things further if he mounts a bid. Biden placed second in the Emerson poll, and his high name recognition with voters could give him a boost.

FRIENDLY TERRITORY

Warren campaigned in New Hampshire as if she were a local.

“You guys know me,” she told a gathering of 1,000 state party leaders and activists in Manchester on Friday. She followed up by speaking to a full hall in Plymouth on Saturday.

On this swing, Warren played up her personal story over policy, talking about her family’s struggles growing up in Oklahoma and the challenges she faced as a young mother.

After the Plymouth event, Nancy Chandler, 84, said Warren won her support with a fiery speech where she talked about wanting “big, systemic change” and fighting for the middle class.

“I think the bus has passed,” Chandler of Warren, New Hampshire, said of Sanders.

Liz Alcauskas, 74, of Manchester, said many of Sanders’ ideas were important, but she planned to vote for a different Democrat in next year’s election.

“I would like to not have an old, white man be president,” she said. “It’s someone else’s turn now.”

Even some of Sanders’ most loyal supporters are unsure of him this time. Andru Volinsky, a member of Sanders’ 2016 steering committee in the state, said “my first inclination is towards Bernie, but I haven’t ruled out a handful of others.”

The home-field advantage enjoyed by Sanders and Warren has sparked speculation that other candidates may compete less intensely in New Hampshire, focusing instead on other early states.

Senator Kamala Harris of California made her first campaign trip to the state earlier this month and insisted she would be an active presence there. But she had made a point of visiting South Carolina, with its large swath of African-American voters, before New Hampshire.

Harris likely will also concentrate on gaining the majority of support from the millions of voters in her home state, which has its primary in early March but will allow early voting to begin around the time of the New Hampshire contest.

Raymond Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said other candidates cannot afford to write the state off.

“In 2020, we have such an immensely diverse group of candidates, in every sense of the word, that it’s dangerous to make any assumptions about how the primary will turn out,” Buckley said.

There remains room in the state for Warren’s support to grow. Her Plymouth event was filled with undecided voters.

“I feel very wide open right now. I feel like I could support anyone,” said A.J. Coppola, 32, from Thornton, New Hampshire. “I’m inclined to the person who is really passionate, who feels like they have energy behind them.”

Menahem Kahana/Getty Images

Until recently in Israeli politics, the extremist Otzma Yehudit party served as a useful foil, allowing other right-wing parties to look reasonable by contrast. Now, the party and its hateful, violent ideology could be entering the political mainstream thanks to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a move that even some of his staunchest backers won’t defend.

The leaders of Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) are disciples of U.S.-born rabbi Meir Kahane, whose original party, Kach, was banned from the Knesset in the 1980s and later listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. Kahane advocated the annexation of the Palestinian territories—involving the mass expulsion of Arabs and limiting the rights of those who remained—banning intermarriage between Jews and Arabs, and replacing Israel’s democratic government with a Jewish theocracy. He was assassinated in 1990.

The modern incarnation of the party has undergone an “alt right”–style rebranding but hasn’t strayed too far from its Kahanist roots. It still supports the annexation of the Palestinian territories, canceling the Oslo Accords, and taking over the Temple Mount, and it calls, vaguely, for expelling “enemies” of Israel. Some of its leaders hold regular celebrations in honor of Baruch Goldstein, the Kahanist who massacred 29 Palestinians at a mosque in Hebron in 1994. Three of the party’s four leaders have been arrested for incitements to violence, including posting photos of Arab politicians with nooses around their necks. The party currently holds no seats in the Knesset, having failed to pass the 3.25 percent threshold in 2015.

Last week, Netanyahu orchestrated a merger between Otzma Yehudit and Bayit Yehudi (Jewish Home), another small pro-settlement party, potentially bringing them into the Knesset as part of his right-wing government coalition after April’s elections.

Why is Netanyahu doing this? Wracked by personal scandals and a seemingly endless corruption investigation, he’s probably getting nervous about the election. Polls show that a new centrist alliance led by former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz and journalist-turned-politician Yair Lapid is poised to win more votes than Netanyahu’s Likud. That doesn’t mean Netanyahu himself will lose—Israeli prime ministers always govern by coalition—but he can’t afford to have too many right-wing votes spread out among lots of tiny parties that might not clear the threshold to enter the Knesset. It also wouldn’t be the first time he appealed to racism in the final days of a campaign.

Still, a move this controversial is risky. One Bayit Yehudi candidate resigned from the party in protest after the merger. One prominent Orthodox rabbi condemned the alliance, comparing Otzma Yehudit’s policies to the Nazi Nuremberg laws.

Netanyahu’s new partners were criticized in the U.S. as well, and not just by his usual critics. The American Jewish Committee issued a statement calling Otzma Yehudit’s views “reprehensible,” adding that they “do not reflect the core values that are the very foundation of the State of Israel.” The American Israel Public Affairs Committee endorsed that statement, saying it has a “longstanding policy not to meet with members of this racist and reprehensible party.” While AJC’s statement noted that mainstream Israeli parties have rejected the Kahanists in the past, it notably did not explicitly criticize Netanyahu, who is scheduled to speak at AIPAC’s annual conference in March. Still, it is rare for these organizations, which normally don’t comment on internal Israeli politics, to distance themselves from a decision by the prime minister.

At a time when open criticism of Israel is becoming increasingly mainstream in American politics, Netanyahu is responding by lurching ever further toward the far right.",Not Even AIPAC Will Defend Netanyahu’s Latest Decision,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/otzma-yehudit-netanyahu.html

The Young Democratic Party, YDP has flayed the destruction of its campaign materials in Opokuma, Bayelsa State by thugs the party claimed yesterday were aligned to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

The national chairman of the party, Mrs. Georgina Dakpokpo in a statement made available to Vanguard affirmed that the destruction was part of the efforts to muzzle the party in the state.

“Despite attempts to oppress and intimidate our Candidate, Engr Elvis Donkemezuo and supporters from time to time to no avail, it has become worrisome why the PDP is so scared of the growing popularity of the Young Democratic Party and our candidate in Kolokuma-Opokuma Constituency 2, so much that they have resorted to defacing our posters and banners around the constituency.

“As if that’s not enough they outrightly dismantled the new ones he put up with a futuristic architectural design of the Opokuma junction motorbike/Bus Terminal that cost him over a million naira.

And indeed, in 2018 populists won control of governments in Brazil, Italy, and Mexico, among other countries. Meanwhile, populists like the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte maintained extraordinarily high popularity ratings—one recent poll showed that Duterte still enjoyed an approval rating of 81 percent, according to a Pulse Asia survey taken in December. Most world leaders never approach such popularity levels.



Now, in 2019 and 2020, some political observers are again arguing that populism has already peaked. Gideon Rachman recently contended, in the Financial Times, that populism “faces its darkest hour” in 2019. A recent New York Times Interpreter column claimed that populism had a “rocky” time in the West in 2018, citing the Democratic Party’s gains in the U.S. midterm elections, and mixed election results for Poland’s populist Law and Justice Party in recent elections, among other factors.



Nonetheless, the populist wave seemingly will continue rising this year and next—with potential new victories both in the West and in other parts of the globe.

Representative Alexandria Ocaio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) questioned the morality of bringing children into a world that is struggling to address man-made climate change in a video posted to social media over the weekend.

“There’s scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult. And it does lead young people to have a legitimate question: is it okay to still have children?” Ocasio-Cortez told her 2.5 million Instagram followers.

Since besting six-term incumbent, former Representative Joe Crowley (D., N.Y.) in November, Ocasio-Cortez has leveraged her outsized social media following to build public support for the Green New Deal, which calls for the elimination of America’s carbon footprint within ten years. She has vigorously defended the proposal since its rocky introduction earlier this month as the only solution commensurate with the scale of the problem, and has attacked skeptics and moderates within her own party as too timid and deferential to the status quo.

Yup. If you don’t like the #GreenNewDeal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis. Until then, we’re in charge – and you’re just shouting from the cheap seats. https://t.co/h3KSJhHqDN — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 23, 2019

The majority of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders immediately endorsed the Green New Deal resolution as an aspirational concept, but have hesitated when asked to address its specific components.

Following the proposal’s introduction, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly announced that the Senate will vote on the non-binding measure, prompting criticism from Democratic leaders who argue the proposal was just a starting point and was not ready to be voted on.

(Reuters) - Bernie Sanders’ entry into the 2020 presidential race has complicated fellow liberal Elizabeth Warren’s bid for the Democratic nomination, a path that runs straight through New Hampshire.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders speaks during a news conference on Yemen resolution on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 30, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo

Sanders, a U.S. senator from neighboring Vermont, retains a strong following in the state where he trounced Hillary Clinton by more than 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential contest.

An Emerson College opinion poll of New Hampshire voters released on Saturday showed Sanders to be the top choice of respondents with 27 percent of the vote. Warren, a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, was far behind at 9 percent - a worrisome number given many New Hampshire voters are familiar with her.

But as Warren, 69, returned to the early voting state over the weekend for the second time this month, there were signs she could be chipping away at Sanders’ support a year before the New Hampshire primary election.

Some New Hampshire residents who voted for Sanders last time told Reuters they now were leaning toward Warren. Some said the 77-year-old Sanders’ political window had closed. Others said they wanted to see a female nominee.

“Bernie lost his shine,” said Candace Moulton, 36, who attended Warren’s campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. “I think we’re really ready to have a woman president, to be frank.”

New Hampshire often has been where presidential aspirations are solidified. While the Iowa caucuses serve as the first test of a candidate’s strength, New Hampshire holds the first party primary, and has been a state where a contender can build momentum, salvage a campaign or reach the end of the road.

Ten Democrats have already declared their candidacy for the party’s nomination, and more are expected to join the contest. The winner will likely face Republican President Donald Trump in the general election in November 2020. [nL1N20E0EH]

New Hampshire’s primary traditionally has favored candidates with ties to the region, making it important for Sanders and Warren to target. Both are progressives with similar policy platforms that include providing universal health care coverage and raising the minimum wage.

Dante Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, said he expects the presidential field to narrow significantly by the time the primary comes.

“There’s a good likelihood that New Hampshire will be framed as a Sanders-Warren competition with one ticket out,” he said.

Should Warren fail to win Iowa, New Hampshire becomes a “must-win,” Scala said. “It’s hard to see her lasting if she can’t win here.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden could muddy things further if he mounts a bid. Biden placed second in the Emerson poll, and his high name recognition with voters could give him a boost.

FRIENDLY TERRITORY

Warren campaigned in New Hampshire as if she were a local.

“You guys know me,” she told a gathering of 1,000 state party leaders and activists in Manchester on Friday. She followed up by speaking to a full hall in Plymouth on Saturday.

On this swing, Warren played up her personal story over policy, talking about her family’s struggles growing up in Oklahoma and the challenges she faced as a young mother.

After the Plymouth event, Nancy Chandler, 84, said Warren won her support with a fiery speech where she talked about wanting “big, systemic change” and fighting for the middle class.

“I think the bus has passed,” Chandler of Warren, New Hampshire, said of Sanders.

Liz Alcauskas, 74, of Manchester, said many of Sanders’ ideas were important, but she planned to vote for a different Democrat in next year’s election.

“I would like to not have an old, white man be president,” she said. “It’s someone else’s turn now.”

Even some of Sanders’ most loyal supporters are unsure of him this time. Andru Volinsky, a member of Sanders’ 2016 steering committee in the state, said “my first inclination is towards Bernie, but I haven’t ruled out a handful of others.”

The home-field advantage enjoyed by Sanders and Warren has sparked speculation that other candidates may compete less intensely in New Hampshire, focusing instead on other early states.

Senator Kamala Harris of California made her first campaign trip to the state earlier this month and insisted she would be an active presence there. But she had made a point of visiting South Carolina, with its large swath of African-American voters, before New Hampshire.

Harris likely will also concentrate on gaining the majority of support from the millions of voters in her home state, which has its primary in early March but will allow early voting to begin around the time of the New Hampshire contest.

Raymond Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said other candidates cannot afford to write the state off.

“In 2020, we have such an immensely diverse group of candidates, in every sense of the word, that it’s dangerous to make any assumptions about how the primary will turn out,” Buckley said.

There remains room in the state for Warren’s support to grow. Her Plymouth event was filled with undecided voters.

“I feel very wide open right now. I feel like I could support anyone,” said A.J. Coppola, 32, from Thornton, New Hampshire. “I’m inclined to the person who is really passionate, who feels like they have energy behind them.”",Pivotal New Hampshire primary may come down to Sanders versus Warren,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-new-hampshire-idUSKCN1QE2CR

The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) has expressed its willingness to join its efforts with those of other opposition parties in Singapore to achieve a common goal, namely “a freer and more democratic Singapore”.

Speaking at the SDP General Election Campaign Kick-Off at Mandarin Orchard on Saturday (23 Feb), party chairman Paul Tambyah said: “We are happy to work with other parties in our goal for a freer and more democratic Singapore.”

Dr Tambyah added: “SDP is a party with a clear ideology that puts people first over profits … It is a constructive party with a tenacity and a commitment to democracy and justice.”

SDP will be using #SDPNOW – The Way Forward as its GE 2019 slogan.

The campaign launch, according to SDP, was received with great enthusiasm from a “standing room only crowd”, and witnessed “many young faces in the crowd, several of whom were university, JC and polytechnic students” despite the abrupt change of venue.

“This bodes well for the party as we continue to reach out to Singapore’s youth and to excite them about the party and our plans for our nation’s future,” said SDP.

The original venue management KCC (Kingdom Community Church) Ventures Pte Ltd had cancelled the SDP campaign launch just one day prior to the event due to “JTC inspection” and political reasons, according to the party in a statement on Friday (22 Feb).

“This latest episode highlights the sick situation this country finds itself under PAP rule – gripped by fear and bullying. Contracts and agreements are broken last-minute with impunity.

“The SDP will not take such action lying down, we are strongly considering taking legal action,” warned SDP.

Consequently, SDP thanked “the Mandarin Orchard staff for their quick response” to the Party’s request for additional seating from “the original seating capacity of 250 … Another 50 seats were added with later arrivals having to stand,” SDP noted, adding that the party had also “chartered a bus to pick up participants who might have missed our announcement of the change of venue”.

During the campaign launch, SDP distributed information packs containing the Party’s message to voters, a house visit campaign card, information on how to donate and volunteer for SDP, and a copy of SDP’s newspaper The New Democrat.

The party’s Vice-Chairman John Tan revealed that SDP will be updating and re-launching “several policy papers in areas such as cost of living, housing, and healthcare”, on top of organising “a pre-election rally at Hong Lim Park in September” and publishing the SDP’s town council plans.

“The indifference of this government to suffering is disturbing … We must find our way back”: SDP

In its campaign message, SDP charged that the “indifference” of the present-day People’s Action Party (PAP) government towards suffering is “disturbing”.

“It is a government that has lost its way, utterly bereft of moral values,” the Party said.

“The ministers have little to worry about … They lavish themselves with astronomical salaries. Prime Minister Lee [Hsien Loong] collects $220,000 a month. Even the junior entry-level ministers are paid $100,000 a month. How long do we average Singaporeans have to work to earn that amount?

“And while they live in their bungalows and mansions, low-wage workers sleep in void-decks and 24-hour MacDonald’s outlets because they have nowhere else to go. Our elderly poor have to clear tables and wash toilets to survive, and poor families with young children are evicted from their flats because they cannot afford the rent,” said SDP.

The Party suggested that the predicament of many low-income Singaporeans is a result of misplaced trust in the PAP government.

“In the last elections, PM Lee asked voters to trust the PAP and promised that the government cares for us and will work to improve our lives.

“He has not kept his promise. He has increased our cost of living by raising water prices, Town Council fees, healthcare costs, electricity rates, bus fares, school fees, etc. Soon, he will raise the GST.

“He has brought in even more foreign workers to compete with us for jobs. The future for Singaporeans, young and old, are looking increasingly bleak.

“We were told that the prices of our flats would never fall. But now, the PAP admits that our flats will decline in value until they become worthless at the end of the 99-year lease.

“Trust the PAP? Trust doesn’t come from what you say, it comes from what you do,” SDP stressed.

“We must find our way back. We must find our nation’s heart again because a people without a heart is a people without a future. The SDP is committed to changing this by building a future of promise and hope for Singapore,” said SDP.",#SDPNOW: SDP “happy to work with other parties” for “a freer and more democratic Singapore”,Theonlinecitizen.com,https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/02/25/sdpnow-sdp-happy-to-work-with-other-parties-for-a-freer-and-more-democratic-singapore/

Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) office demanding to speak with the senator. After they refused to leave, several of them were arrested.

Who are the protesters?

The protesters were affiliated with the Sunrise Movement, a group that seeks to mobilize young people to be politically active in support of the Green New Deal, a piece of legislation pushed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) that includes proposals to ""upgrade or replace every building in US for state-of-the-art energy efficiency.""

According to its official set of guidelines for ""adult/elder allies,"" the group is ""focused primary on organizing young people: ~35 and younger.""

This is the same group that confronted Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in her office Friday. In that case, the children were recorded asking her to support the Green New Deal. Feinstein told the children that this was ""not a good resolution"" and that there was ""no way to pay for it.""

An edited version of this video resulted in Feinstein being criticized for the way she dealt with child protesters.

What happened Monday?

The Sunrise Movement tweeted video clips from the confrontation in McConnell's office Monday. According to the group's Twitter account, these young people were from McConnell's home state of Kentucky and had been ""looking for him in KY last week."" When McConnell never showed up for the Kentucky protest, the Sunrise Movement announced that they would be holding another protest on Feb. 25 in D.C.

Once they were inside McConnell's D.C. office, the protesters began singing and chanting slogans including, ""which side are you on?"" They carried signs demanding that McConnell ""look us in the eyes,"" slamming him as #OilMoneyMitch.

At some point, the protesters were escorted out of the building by the U.S. Capitol Police. According to the Sunrise Institute, ""39 young people were arrested"" during the protest. Although it didn't give out the total number for all the protesters in attendance, the group retweeted a Politico reporter who put the number at ""[m]ore than 100.""



Podcast host Paul Ingrassia tweeted video of the protesters singing as they were being led out of the Capitol.

McConnell wants a vote on the deal the protesters were promoting

McConnell has actually been fast-tracking the Green New Deal through the Senate so that it can be put up for a vote. Of course, this is likely because McConnell realizes that Feinstein and Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) refuse to support the bill. Forcing Democrats to vote on it would likely cause divisions within the Democratic Party while having little chance of actually passing.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass), who co-sponsored the legislation along with Ocasio-Cortez, called McConnell's push for a vote a ""Republican trick"" meant to ""sabotage"" the deal.

What else?

These protests aren't over yet. The group said that its supporters would be visiting the district offices of U.S. senators ""from all corners of the country"" on Tuesday.

McEnany joined Varney on his Fox Nation program and he began by playing some old video and attacking past statements Bernie Sanders made about Cuba. Varney is frustrated that Bernie won't admit that Socialism is awful.

Stuart congratulated Kayleigh for her new job because as long as you praise and glorify his name, Trump has a place for you.

Obviously Republicans will run ads that show Americans on bread lines, people jumping off buildings and hobos begging for change with cups in hand as a result of any programs that help the American people.

McEnany said as much in her opening salvo because she ended up comparing left wing policies to ""Venezuela"", but then Stuart got real for a minute.

“Trouble is, and we’ve talked about this before, Kayleigh, socialism is popular in some quarters,"" Varney observed. ""It could be watered-down socialism, like Sweden or Denmark or parts of Europe, but socialism doesn’t have a bad name.""

“And I think your job is going to be very tough to penetrate those people who think socialism is just fine and dandy,"" he continued.

“Yeah, I’m not going to underestimate the job ahead-- In the ranks of the Democratic Party, socialism has 60 percent approval. But in a national electorate, it is nowhere near majority support,” Kayleigh lied.

She warned, ""We can't let Bernie get away with touting the Finland model or the Norway model.""

Americans are sick and tired of seeing the rich get richer and richer and richer (Trump's moronic tax cuts for the wealthy) and the middle class and the working classes get poorer and poorer.

Proposing new plans to fight climate change and to make the health care industry better is not socialism. It's just plain smart. Nearly 80 percent of this country approve of and like Medicare. Same for Social Security. And here's another surprise for Kayleigh: She probably drove to work on socialist roads and enjoys the benefit of flying safely because of socialist air traffic controllers, though she'd never admit it.

↓ Story continues below ↓

Yet Republicans want Americans to wallow in self pity and anger as Trump does, blame the blacks and browns for all their troubles and ignore science and exhaustive studies based on facts to help a sliver of the American population become even wealthier.

As far as they're concerned, the rest of us can ""die, and decrease the surplus population.""

The field for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary has over a dozen declared candidates, including widely known names such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders. And on top that there are people like former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden who could enter the race at any time and immediately be contenders. And yet all of these voices are extremely similar in one crucial way: they all believe that we should fix the Industrial Age society we live in today. Whether that is with a pro-business agenda (if Bloomberg runs) or with a socialist agenda (Sanders) or something in-between, it is fundamentally thinking that is rooted in the past.

But there is one candidate, Andrew Yang, who offers a truly forward looking alternative with Universal Basic Income as one of his three core platform elements. Andrew knows we need to finally get past the Industrial Age

Andrew’s approach are the kind of new ideas that deserve to be a part of the discussion. And this is where you can have “More Yang for your Buck!” by sending Andrew to the debates. Either just donate to Andrew, or donate to your favorite candidate and then also give money to Andrew (as little as $1). To make it to the first debate, Andrew needs 65,000 donors. He is nearly halfway there.

So head over to Yang2020 now and be part of the insurgency of new ideas. Get more Yang for your buck!

A party led by a man convicted for his role in stealing $1bn from Moldovan banks which then had to be covered by taxpayers won 8%.

Victoria Bucataru, director of the Foreign Policy Association, says that the result means there is now a big chance that the Socialists and the Democratic Party will strike a deal on forming a grand coalition, though a Democrat-led minority government is also possible. If a grand coalition is formed, expect Moldovan politicians to duck and weave, seeking to extract the maximum political and economic benefit from both Russia and the EU.

Moldova, most of which consists of historic Bessarabia, lies squeezed between Romania, a member of NATO and the EU, and Ukraine, partly occupied by Russia. Transnistria, a tiny slither of its territory, broke away in 1992 and is in effect Russian-controlled, with Russian troops based there. In 1991 there were 4.3m people in the country, but now there are believed to be less than 3m because so many have emigrated to Russia, Romania or the West.

The election campaign was predictably dirty. Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase, the leaders of ACUM claimed that the authorities had been trying to poison them (the government denies this) and that election was marred by widespread fraud including the busing in and paying of voters from Transnistria. When Mr Nastase was elected mayor of Chisinau, the capital, last June, he was prevented from taking up the job when his opponents used the courts to block him, arguing that he had broken electoral rules by using social media on the day of the poll. As a result the EU froze aid to the country.

On February 14th Facebook announced it was deleting accounts which they indicated had been set up by government employees to manipulate voters. The outgoing government was, in effect, controlled by Mr Plahotniuc. In 2016 Vlad Filat, his main pro-Western rival, was jailed for corruption. On February 7th a British court seized £467,000 from Mr Filat’s son, a student in London, who lived an extravagant lifestyle. “I am satisfied ... that the cash was derived from his father’s criminal conduct,” said the judge. Among other things the 22-year old student had bought a £200,000 Bentley.

Over the last decade Moldova’s politicians have played a skilful game. The Socialists of President Igor Dodon have played on the nostalgia of older voters for Soviet-era stability, while most pro-Western politicians have told Western leaders that they should overlook their corruption because, if they lose power, Mr Dodon would deliver Moldova into the hands of Mr Putin. To Westerners Mr Dodon plays down his pro-Russian stance, arguing that he just wants a more balanced foreign policy.

Geopolitics always loom large when foreigners look at Moldova. However, polls show that most Moldovans care little about either Brussels or Moscow. A recent poll asked people what was the most important issue for them. Corruption came top at 49%, followed by the economy, at 19%. Moving closer to either the EU or the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union was a priority for only 2%.",Moldova is still caught between Russia and the EU,The Economist,https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/02/25/moldova-is-still-caught-between-russia-and-the-eu

After a chaotic weekend vote marked by accusations of fraud, the pro-Russian Socialist Party won the largest share of the vote, taking over 31 percent.

But under a new electoral system that divides the 101-seat parliament into seats elected by party lists and individual constituencies, Moldova's ruling Democratic party won the most seats.

Led by powerful oligarch Vlad Plahotniuc, the Democratic party won 23.9 percent of the vote but took 34 seats, three more than the socialists.

The pro-European ACUM alliance, which wants Moldova to seek closer ties with the European Union, came second with 26 percent. It took 23 seats.

A party led by a businessman convicted of billion-dollar fraud, Ilan Shor, won 8.46 percent of the vote - taking eight seats in parliament.

OPPOSITION PROMISES PROTESTS

Only Plahotniuc's Democratic Party has said it is ready to enter coalition talks.

President Igor Dodon's Socialists and the pro-European opposition have ruled out working with other parties.

On Sunday, pro-Brussels alliance leader Andrei Nastase said his party will only enter a coalition ""with the people of Moldova"" and that his supporters were ""ready to defend their rights on the street"".

Both Dodon and Nastase accused the ruling Democrats of massive election fraud that involved bringing in people from Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria and telling them how to vote.

Nastase alleged that ""they (the ruling party) are bussing in vulnerable people ripe for corruption.""

The Democratic Party in turn said the socialists offered bribes to residents of Transnistria to back their candidates.

The election campaign was chaotic, with ACUM leaders at one point claiming they were poisoned and Russian authorities accusing Plahotniuc of running a vast money-laundering scheme in 2013-2014.

Foreign election observers were to give a briefing later Monday on the conduct of the election, potentially giving critics ammunition to claim the vote was undemocratic.

BETWEEN MOSCOW AND THE EU

The vote reflected the deep divisions that for years affected the former Soviet republic nestled between Ukraine and Romania.

While many among the 3.5 million population want to maintain close ties with Moscow, others seek to follow the example of Romania - with which Moldova shares a language and long history - and look west to the EU.

The Democratic Party has sought a balanced approach between Moscow and Brussels.

But relations with the EU have deteriorated. Last November, the EU reduced aid to Chisinau citing a ""deterioration of the rule of law"" - a reference mainly to the struggle against corruption.

Russia, meanwhile, has rallied around Dodon - a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.

As well as seeking to keep Chisinau in its sphere of influence, Moscow has long backed separatists in Transnistria - a region that broke away from Moldova after the fall of the USSR.

Moldova has struggled to find its place since gaining independence with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

The economy is propped up by remittances from workers abroad, which has caused the working-age population to fall sharply.

Moldova last year ranked 117 out of 180 nations in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.

Speaking at a “Girls Who Code” event in New York City, self-identified democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hit back against critics of her Green New Deal resolution.

WATCH:

Ocasio-Cortez declares ""I'm the Boss… How 'bout that!"" while claiming that no one else has tried to come up with climate change policy before the Green New Deal. Apparently she's never seen @TheDemocrats policy platform… ever. This infighting is going to be fun to watch. pic.twitter.com/AV1TgRa5kU — Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) February 24, 2019

“I just introduced the Green New Deal two weeks ago, and it’s creating all of this conversation,” the New York Democratic congresswoman said Friday to moderator Reshma Saujani, the CEO of Girls Who Code. “Why? Because no one else has even tried. Because no one else has even tried.”

Ocasio-Cortez claimed that — regardless of success — the “power” goes to the individual who tries.

“So people are like, ‘Oh it’s unrealistic. Oh it’s vague. Oh it doesn’t address this little minute thing.’ And I’m like, ‘You try. You do it. ‘Cuz you’re not. ‘Cuz you’re not. So, until you do it, I’m the boss.’ How ’bout that?’”

Ocasio-Cortez introduced her Green New Deal resolution earlier in February alongside Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey. The bill not only calls for the U.S. to dramatically transition to 100 percent renewable energy in just a few years, but also demands upgrading all buildings in the country, addressing the emissions released from cow farts in a now-deleted FAQ page, and touches on a number of other progressive issues. (RELATED: ‘Dis Me. I’ve Been Around Awhile’: Joe Lieberman Is Not Impressed By Ocasio-Cortez)

The resolution has been met with criticism and ridicule from both parties. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, the second-highest ranking senator in his party, said after reading and re-reading the Green New Deal, he still had to ask a co-sponsor, “What in the heck is this?”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might bring the Green New Deal up for a vote in the upper chamber of Congress in the coming days. The move would force numerous Democratic presidential candidates to take a public stance on the bill.

The post Most Americans say colleges should not consider race or ethnicity in admissions appeared first on Pew Research Center.","As the debate over college admissions policies reignites, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that most Americans (73%) say colleges and universities should not consider race or ethnicity when making decisions about student admissions. Just 7% say race should be a major factor in college admissions, while 19% say it should be a minor factor.

The issue emerged again earlier this month when a federal judge heard closing arguments in the high-profile lawsuit against Harvard University that could eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court and influence the future of affirmative action in higher education.

While majorities across racial and ethnic groups agree that race should not be a factor in college admissions, white adults are particularly likely to hold this view: 78% say this, compared with 65% of Hispanics, 62% of blacks and 59% of Asians (the Asian sample includes only those who speak English).

There are also large partisan gaps on this issue. Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party are far more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say that race or ethnicity should not be a factor in college admissions (85% vs. 63%). These party differences remain when looking only at whites: 88% of white Republicans say that colleges should not consider race in college admissions, compared with 66% of white Democrats.

When asked about eight admissions criteria that colleges may consider, high school grades top the list. About two-thirds of Americans (67%) say this should be a major factor; 26% say it should be a minor factor. And while many colleges have stopped requiring standardized test scores as part of the application process, 47% of Americans say these scores should play a major role, while an additional 41% say they should play a minor role. Most Americans also think colleges should take into account community service involvement.

The public is more divided, however, over whether being the first person in the family to go to college should factor into admissions decisions. Some 47% say this should be considered, while 53% say it should not be a factor.

In addition to race or ethnicity, majorities also say that colleges should not consider an applicant’s gender (81%), whether a relative attended the school (68%) – a practice known as legacy admissions – or athletic ability (57%) when making decisions.

Across several of these items, views vary by education, with those holding at least a bachelor’s degree generally more likely than those with less education to say they should be at least a minor factor in college admissions. For example, college graduates are more likely than those with less education to say colleges should consider race (38% say it should be a major or minor factor vs. 22% among those without a bachelor’s degree) or being a first-generation college student (57% vs. 43%) in admissions decisions.

(Photo by JOHN THYS / AFP) (JOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images)

The Europe Union appears so desperate to punish U.S. tech giants that it’s ready to conduct radical surgery on its own online copyright laws.

The E.U. has proposed a new digital copyright directive that would force tech companies to secure rights from copyright holders to allow things like movies, shows, music, and other materials their users might upload to be shared on their sites.

That's a large departure from current copyright laws that require companies to take down copyrighted material when the copyright holders complain. It would also be prohibitively expensive for smaller European social sites, which could be a boon for American tech giants.

It’s not too late for Europe to avoid salting its own earth and ensuring the supremacy of Big Tech, as the European Parliament still must vote on these changes. But having things take such a self-destructive course offers a lesson in how abjectly tech policymaking can fail when only Big Copyright—specifically, large media companies—gets heard.

We’re getting disturbingly close to an internet split across the Atlantic—where only the likes of Facebook and Google can afford to compete on both sides.

A copyright chasm

The most dangerous part of this “Digital Single Market” copyright directive is its Article 13, “Use of protected content by online content sharing service providers,” which starts on page 65 of the text posted Wednesday.

That obligates any such online service—its definition excludes Wikipedia, online markets, messaging services and small startups less than three years old, but not social networks in general—to “obtain an authorization” from copyright holders whose work might be shared by its users.

That amounts to asking companies to license “all copyrighted content in the world,” Julia Reda, a German Pirate Party member of the European Parliament, wrote in a recent post.

Social sites that did not want to be held legally liable for their users’ posts would have to show they’d tried to secure those licenses and had made “best efforts to ensure the unavailability of specific works and other subject matter for which the rightholders have provided the service providers with the relevant and necessary information.”

That’s legalese for deploying automated filters to block the upload of files that match items in databases provided by copyright holders.

That represents an enormous departure from the “notice and take down” regime on both sides of the Atlantic, under which sites avoid liability if they promptly respond to reports of copyright infringement by taking down the content in question before letting the user challenge the takedown.

Does not scale

Few precedents exist for such a comprehensive monitoring regime aside from YouTube’s Content ID. That Google (GOOG, GOOGL) system lets copyright holders choose between having infringing copies of their content blocked or getting a share of the advertising revenue generated from them.

In a November blog post, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki wrote that the company paid out €800 million to EU rightsholders in the last year. Google declined to comment on the record, but in a Feb. 7 post, global affairs senior vice president Kent Walker said the proposed rules “aren’t carefully balanced.”

The GIF-sharing site Giphy also opted to license the clips behind its animated GIFs. “We went and started, day one, making licensing deals with all of the major movie producers, TV produces, studios,” founder Alex Chung said at the Collision conference in 2016.

But YouTube benefits from Google’s massive resources, and Giphy deals with a much smaller set of material.

“If anyone says Google can do it, therefore everyone else should—what a nonsensical statement to say,” said Evan Engstrom, executive director of the U.S. startup-advocacy group Engine. A 2017 study he co-wrote found that “the cost of filtering technologies far exceeds their benefit in limiting infringement.”

And although Article 13 includes fair-use rights to take copyrighted content for “quotation, criticism, review” and “caricature, parody or pastiche,” automated filters can’t sense the intent behind those legitimate reuses.

Weston Dombroski, with the legal team at the creator-crowdfunding site Patreon, echoed Engstrom’s filtering critique—“there is not a company in sight that has the filtering technology ready and available”—and noted the extra risk Article 13 poses to mash-up and remixed art.",How Europe could cement American online dominance,Yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-google-200659813.html

Monitors have condemned what they say are ""strong indications of vote-buying"" in Moldova's general poll on Sunday.

The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) also reported ""pressure on public employees"" and ""misuse of state resources"".

Moldovan politics include both pro-Russia and pro-EU parties which frequently clash with one another.

Both sides accused the ruling Democratic party of electoral fraud - but results showed no clear winner.

Moldova, a former Soviet republic, lies between the EU and Ukraine and is one of Europe's poorest countries.

Much of the controversy is linked to reports that voters in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region - where there are no polling stations - were bussed to other areas to cast their vote.

Parties have accused one another of bribing voters from the region, local media say.

With almost all votes counted, the country's electoral committee said the pro-Russia Socialist Party, allied to Moldovan President Igor Dodon, received the most votes at 31%. But the Acum (26%) and Democratic parties (24%), both pro-EU, came in second and third.

The parties will now enter negotiations to form a government.

Despite its criticisms, the OSCE said the elections had been competitive and that fundamental rights ""were generally respected"".

Yet the elections took place under a controversial new voting system which the OSCE said was created ""without inclusive public debate and consultation"".

Under the new system, the 101 seats in the parliament were split - 50 in a party list system and 51 in single-seat constituencies.

The OSCE said the new system caused ""difficulties and confusion"", but that most aspects of the election were still handled transparently and professionally.

But it criticised a campaign in which ""control and ownership of the media by political actors limited the range of viewpoints presented to voters"".

Lee snagged the first competitive Oscar win in his long career for his adapted screenplay for the drama “BlackKklansman.” He ended his acceptance speech with a pointed shot at Trump, urging those watching to vote him out of office.

“The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let’s all mobilize. Let’s all be on the right side of history,” Lee said, making no mention of Trump by name. “Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let’s do the right thing! You know I had to get that in there.”

Lee was referring to his 1989 movie “Do the Right Thing!” which lost the Best Picture Oscar to “Driving Miss Daisy.” Despite the screenplay win on Sunday, Lee similarly lost out on in the Best Director and Best Picture categories, which went to “Roma” director Alfonso Cuarón and “Green Book,” respectively.

Elizabeth Warren says she will forgo the chase for campaign money from the biggest donors in her quest for her party’s nomination for president.

In an email to supporters on Monday, Warren, of Massachusetts, acknowledged that “this decision will ensure that I will be outraised by other candidates in this race.”

But by making her move now as a proactive gesture, vowing to avoid any “fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren is betting that focusing on grassroots supporters will ultimately pay off by boosting her small-dollar donations as she battles a half-dozen or more rivals.

Warren billed her new fundraising policy as a way of matching her actions to her calls for a sweeping change to the nation’s political systems. She already has sworn off campaign donations from political action committees and federal lobbyists, but her new policy puts her in a league beyond most of the other Democrats already seeking the presidency or weighing runs.

Some of those rivals are already besting Warren in the hunt for donations that can often make or break a presidential candidacy. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign reported nearly $6 million raised in the first 24 hours after he entered the race last week, and California Sen. Kamala Harris’ campaign reported $1.5 million raised during the first day after her launch.

Harris and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York reportedly have signed on to appear at high-dollar fundraisers as they hustle to raise the cash necessary to compete in the jam-packed primary. They have sworn off donations from corporate political action committees, but none has gone as far as Warren pledged Monday.

“We’re going to take the time presidential candidates typically reserve for courting wealthy donors and instead use it to build organizing event after organizing event, in the early primary states and across the country,” Warren wrote to supporters.

Warren’s campaign has stayed mum about how much money it has taken in since she announced her candidacy. An early glimpse was included in Federal Election Commission year-end filings, which showed that she collected around $300,000 in the hours after launching her exploratory committee at the end of December. That’s a far smaller figure than what several of her competitors have reported raising. More recent fundraising emails have said she’s “falling short” in the money race.

“Let’s be real: Out of all the candidates Elizabeth is probably never going to raise the most money,” says a fundraising solicitation sent out Friday.

But during recent midterm elections she was a fundraising powerhouse who outraised all of the other senators currently running for the presidency, pulling in more than $30 million between her Senate fund and two separate fundraising committees, which she has since shut down. She also cut big checks at the time to candidates, Democratic federal campaign funds and state-level party committees in Iowa, Florida, Arizona, Nevada and New Hampshire.

In the interview, Reid said he wishes former President George W. Bush were president again “every day,” even though Reid “famously called the 43rd president a ‘loser,’ and a ‘liar,’ and even the worst president the country ever had,” CNN’s Dana Bash wrote.

“[Bush] and I had our differences, but no one ever questioned his patriotism. Our battles were strictly political battles,” Reid said. (RELATED: There’s A Special Election In Pennsylvania Coming Up. Will It Be A Conor Lamb Repeat?)

Reid also called Trump a “con man” and a “big fat guy,” according to CNN. The 79-year-old gave the interview after announcing he was in remission following a pancreatic cancer diagnosis in 2018.

Reid was one of the longest-serving floor leaders in history after serving as Senate Democratic leader from 2005 to 2017. During his tenure, the Nevada Democrat faced criticism from the left for compromising with the right on the Iraq War and criticism from the right for his connections to power brokers like Harvey Whittemore.

Even though Reid left the Senate when Trump first became president, the two have tangled politically since Trump’s inauguration in 2017. Trump mocked Reid’s support of an end to birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants by highlighting one of his past speeches in October 2018.

Reid has a history of criticizing Trump, but he also hasn’t pulled punches on members of his own party. Reid criticized his party’s rising star New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in January over her “radical” proposals.

But those points of agreement...,"I find that as often as not I agree with Matt Bruenig on policy matters. But those points of agreement can be obscured for me by differences of temperament and politics. Here though I find myself entirely in agreement with him on something called Modern Monetary Theory. You may not even have heard this phrase before. But you should and probably will soon. If you haven’t, you should familiarize yourself with it because it bulks very large in many current debates within the Democratic Party that you have heard about. It’s a big deal. Bruenig aptly describes it as “about using word games to make people believe that the US can have Northern European levels of government spending without Northern European levels of taxation.”

It’s not easy to simply explain what MMT is because it operates at several distinct and not always closely related levels.

At its simplest MMT states that government spending is not funded by taxing money or borrowing it. Taxes serve other purposes but getting money to pay for things is not actually one of them. As one of its top popularizing advocates put it, “Taxing the super rich at 70 or 80 percent is good in itself, because those people have too much money and are screwing up the world with it. But you don’t need it to fund an agenda.” In fact, all government spending, says MMT, is funded by printing money. At a very high level of abstraction there’s a way in which this redefinition of terms makes a certain sense. Indeed, there are elements of MMT that are similar to basic Keynesian economic theory – sort of Keynesianism on steroids or perhaps Keynesianism without a theory of inflation. For a more knowledgable and technical discussion see these two columns (one and two) Paul Krugman wrote on the question of MMT earlier this month. For pro-MMT arguments Stephanie Kelton is probably the most prominent advocate. You can see her arguments at her website.

To me, the discussions about MMT are very hard to pin down because it’s a bit hard to make sense of what level of practicality MMT advocates are trying to make their arguments. It can be a bit baffling like having a discussion about quantum physics and then hearing from the person you’re talking to that quantum physics makes some dramatic new things possible in the skyscraper you’re planning to build. That is quite likely completely untrue. So it is at a minimum quite unsettling. But again, to me the practical issues are not technical but political. And those I feel more comfortable speaking to.

If you look at the Green New Deal, you’ll see that it is actually a mix of two things. One is an extremely aggressive plan to address the climate crisis basically on all fronts: technology, infrastructure, regulation, etc. This is of course vastly expensive. But it’s not the biggest cost. But the really big spending isn’t for things that most of us would recognize as tied to climate or the environment at all. It’s basically the full social democratic policy package: universal health care, job guarantees, some version of a universal guaranteed income, free or no-debt higher education, etc.

Many of the things in the latter category are things that most Democrats believe in, others are quite controversial. Probably the bulk are things where the controversy comes down to matters of degree. The point I want to focus on here though is that these things are extremely expensive. (You can find a good discussion of these points in this and other columns by Noah Smith.)

If you look at the advocacy conversations surrounding the Green New Deal and various of these programs on the left and you get to how to pay for it … well, this is where MMT comes in. Setting aside the technical merits MMT increasingly serves as a placeholder to explain that the whole question is bogus. It’s not a matter of where do you get the money. The US government creates dollars and is in charge of how many dollars there are. So the whole question of where the government will get them is silly.

Here for example is The Intercept’s Ryan Grim this month in his email newsletter noting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez flummoxing NPR’s Steve Inskeep with MMT.

Ocasio-Cortez was interviewed on Morning Edition today and when asked how to pay for a Green New Deal, talked about decoupling the concepts of tax revenue and government spending, which is the cornerstone of Modern Monetary Theory. Amazing to hear that on NPR. Not sure Steve Inskeep quite got it; it could take a little while to sink in.

A month earlier he made the same point on Twitter: “Here’s @AOC talking up Modern Monetary Theory as an answer to how the government can fund a progressive agenda. She’s right.”

One of the seductive things about this popularization of MMT is that it piggybacks on something most Democrats rightly and strongly believe: that deficit hawkery is a greatly overstated concern that is supposedly the biggest deal in the world when Democrats are trying to increase spending and becomes magically irrelevant when Republicans want to cut taxes. Remember that we spent the first four years of Obama’s presidency being told by Republicans that Obama’s fairly moderate post-crisis spending had us months away from an apocalyptic debt crisis.

Debt markets give us pretty accurate reads of impending debt crises and lenders spent years essentially paying the US to borrow their money. That was stupid and mendacious, scare-mongering in favor of austerity. The biggest problem the global economy faces at the moment and in some ways has for a couple decades isn’t inflation but lack of aggregate demand. But with MMT “deficits don’t matter” as perhaps a shorthand for ‘the danger of deficits is greatly overstated’ has become literally deficits don’t matter or more broadly that deficits don’t even exist.

I have no doubt that there are MMT advocates reading this now saying, no, you’re not getting what MMT says or you’re caricaturing it. Maybe. But what I’m able to speak to is how it is playing out in a political context. As Bruenig explains, if you want Northern European-style social democracy you’re going to need to have significantly or dramatically higher rates of taxation. And not only much higher rates on the uber wealthy but generally higher rates on a much broader range of the population. Whatever the theoretical merits of MMT, its political role is simply to say that core fiscal policy realities simply don’t exist. Or to put it more concretely, because taxing and spending and debt and money supply are all part of one equation, well, let’s not worry about it! How do you fund it? Well, MMT!

All of this might be notional and sort of irrelevant to our immediate political moment if it weren’t for the fact that MMT is actually central to the Green New Deal and thus at the center of political debate among Democrats without, seemingly, most people even realizing it. We’re seeing top presidential candidates signing on to it without seeming to realize what’s in it or the levels of taxation that are built into or that there’s no actual plan for where any of those revenues come from – even if they’re sort of hokum’d away with MMT finger-waving. You can wake up in mid-2020 having no idea what you’ve signed on to.

As Bruenig puts it, MMT is amounting to “using word games to make people believe that the US can have Northern European levels of government spending without Northern European levels of taxation.” Bruenig probably supports 100% move in that direction. Maybe I support 50%. (I’m not talking about dollars, just a sense of scale.) But if we’re going to have this debate we should really have it with our eyes open about what we’re talking about. That makes sense just in terms of being in touch with reality. But it’s equally important politically because if you go into a big political fight having bamboozled ourselves in advance that will not end well.",Thinking about the Magical Elixir of MMT,Talkingpointsmemo.com,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/thinking-about-the-magical-elixir-of-mmt
131,Empty,2019-02-25T16:49:01Z,'Why do we need the North? We have a million more sheep and Bluff oysters',"A group of New Zealanders have launched an improbable campaign to declare their native South Island independent to stop people confusing it for their neighbours to the north.

Retired businessman Stanley Gyles, who claims to be the spokesman for a group of anonymous but “high-profile” South Islanders, has told a local newspaper those who live on the South Island are fed up of being lumped in with the more populous and developed North Island.

The cornerstone of the campaign would be to rename the island NZ South, Mr Glyes told the Otago Daily Times.

“When an international visitor goes home and says they had a great time in New Zealand, they may have only come to the South Island, so they should be saying, ‘we had a great holiday in NZ South’,” he said.

The South Island was historically the centre of gravity for New Zealand but over the decades more and more people have moved to the North Island, which boasts both the capital Wellington and the country’s largest city Auckland.

Today, the North Island is home to 77 per cent of New Zealanders, despite being significantly smaller in land mass.

But the NZ South campaign said their island had plenty going for it regardless, including famous wine regions, picturesque countryside, hydroelectric dams powering the whole nation and thriving ski slopes.

“The time has come for the South Island of New Zealand to be independent and to have its own identity – NZ South,” the campaign’s website states.

“NZ South is totally different to the North Island in every way.

“We don’t have an Auckland with its crime, violence, gangs, racial tensions and congestion.

“Why do we need the North Island? [We have] a million more sheep and Bluff oysters feeding our neighbours.”

Mr Gyles said his project also aimed to radically streamline local government and bureaucracy in “NZ South”, abolishing entirely all regional councils.

Some of the other items in the eccentric manifesto including banning “freedom campers polluting our countryside”, filling in vacant shopfronts, and introducing a new tax on tourists.

To push the campaign closer to its goal, Mr Gyles said they needed $900,000 (£474,000) urgently as seed funding.

The money would be used to hire constitutional lawyers, lobbyists, “social media gurus” and other researchers, who must all “share the same values and vision for a NZ South”, the website states.

However, despite their blue-sky thinking, Mr Gyles and his campaign has so far failed to drum up much support: only 41 people have liked their page on Facebook.

Undeterred, he told the Otago Daily Times he was planning a public roadshow to gauge enthusiasm for his secessionist plans.

“You can’t introduce something if people don’t want it,” he admitted.

The post AOC: It’s legitimate for people to ask amid this climate crisis whether it’s okay to still have children appeared first on Hot Air.","Feels like a 2020 Democratic slogan in the making: “Do you really want to bring children into the wasteland that our world will soon be?”

I don’t know, maybe we should consider this progress. When a party drifting from late-term abortion towards infanticide decides it’s better not to conceive in the first place, that feels like a win all around.

The newsiest part of this isn’t the bit about rethinking having kids, a common enough sentiment among climate-change doomsayers. It’s the part at the end where Ocasio-Cortez preemptively rejects more modest global-warming legislation that might eventually come before Congress. Like I said yesterday, the irony of crediting her with “jumpstarting the conversation” on the environment is that she and other Green-Party-style leftists aren’t interested in a conversation. The Green New Deal isn’t a maximalist opening offer made in the expectation that it’ll be negotiated down to something more realistic. It’s take-it-or-leave-it. The fact that Democratic fans keep comparing it to war mobilization captures the spirit of it: You wouldn’t declare war, as the United States did in World War II, and immediately begin haggling over a cap on the number of troops to be deployed. You’re facing an existential threat. You do what you need to win. There’s no “conversation,” at least not with the party’s Ocasio-Cortez wing. It’s this or oblivion.

Which is to say, when the day comes that Democrats finally have majorities in both chambers of Congress and one of their own in the White House, whatever green legislation actually emerges is a cinch to be opposed by AOC. The perfect is the enemy of the good, or mediocre. That’s what ideological purity means.

I agree with Jeryl Bier, anyway. She should drop the “some people think” hedging when discussing this. If she believes that Congress’s failure to pass the GND is so dire that people should decline to breed because of it, say so. Let’s jumpstart that conversation too, preferably right around the time next year’s campaign starts heating up. Exit question: Who’s going to pick up the $100 trillion or whatever tab for her agenda if young Americans stop having kids? Oh, right, right.

133,Empty,2019-02-25T12:20:11Z,"Given the recent incidents of anti-Semitism on the American left, the UK Labour Party’s collapse invites examination—and may offer a warning to the American Democrat Party.","Given the recent incidents of anti-Semitism on the American left, the UK Labour Party’s collapse invites examination—and may offer a warning to the American Democrat Party.

The United Kingdom’s Labour Party is bleeding, and seem to have little idea of how to cauterize the wound. This past week, nine members of British Parliament resigned from the party in protest, eight citing anti-Semitism as one of their chief concerns. Given the recent incidents of anti-Semitism on the American left, the UK Labour Party’s plodding collapse invites examination—and offers perhaps a grim warning to the American Democrat Party, which faces its own recent accusations of anti-Semitism.

Labour’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, disclosed that the party had received more than 650 complaints of anti-Semitism by its members since last April. Almost 100 members were suspended, and a dozen expelled.

Luciana Berger, one of the Labour Party’s most prominent Jewish MPs, stated in her resignation, “I cannot remain in a party that I have today come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic…The leadership has willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people within its ranks.” Berger’s resignation sent ripples within the national Labour contingency, given her small constituency in Liverpool had voted unwaveringly for the Labour Party for the entirety of its two-decade existence.

A Rash of Defections over Anti-Semitism

One of the latest defectors from the Labour Party, Joan Ryan, expressed that she was “horrified, appalled, and angered” at her party’s inability to eliminate its anti-Semitism, emphasizing that its leadership had permitted “Jews to be abused with impunity.” Ryan continued, “The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn has become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism. The problem simply did not exist in the party before his election as leader.”

The latest MP to quit the party, Ian Austin, referenced the “culture of extremism, anti-Semitism, and intolerance” that had come to dominate the party. As a former junior minister to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Austin is no stranger to criticizing Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Austin reiterated, “I am appalled at the offence and distress Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party have caused to Jewish people.”

The party’s response to the resignations has done little to quell the accusations of anti-Semitism. Following last week’s wave of resignations, Ruth George, the MP for High Peak, posted online a bizarre conspiracy theory that Israel was covertly funding the defectors, given that Berger was the former chair of the Labour’s “Friends of Israel,” a group within the UK Parliament that supports strengthening the British-Israeli alliance.

What Brought Things to This Point?

How did the UK Labour Party begin bleeding members? The question is complicated and probably equal parts anti-Semitism within the party, a slow burn of widespread indifference amongst the electorate, and a dramatic shift in the makeup of the party’s membership.

Most of the defectors have pointed rightfully to Corbyn as responsible for cultivating a culture of anti-Semitism within the party, and a series of recent incidents has supported such accusations. In 2014, Corbyn appeared at a ceremony in Tunisia honoring the Palestinian-Arab terrorists who perpetrated the 1972 Munich terror attack, where 11 Israeli Olympic competitors were brutally murdered. Corbyn even laid a wreath on the grave of one of the terrorists and, despite widespread condemnation, delivered no apology.

A few years prior to that incident, Corbyn had expressed public support on Facebook for a Los Angeles-based street artist after the artist complained that his mural depicting several anti-Semitic tropes was to be erased from a wall in London’s East End. The Labour Party leader was also a former member of the closed Facebook group Palestine Live, a forum where anti-Semitic memes are regularly shared. He left the group in 2015.

Corbyn isn’t alone. Accusations of anti-Semitism have swirled throughout the party for the past several years. Ken Livingstone, former mayor of London and once a part of the Labour Party’s senior leadership, engaged in frequent anti-Semitic behavior before his final departure from the party in 2018.

Livingstone was infamous for alleging that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. When his remarks resulted in suspension, he later appeared on Iranian national television on Holocaust Memorial Day to discuss how the Holocaust had been manipulated to oppress non-Jews. It is worth noting that Livingstone was never actually expelled from the party for his behavior. He resigned on his own volition, another data point indicative of the party’s weak stance on anti-Semitism.

Another MP, Naz Shah, was suspended for posting on social media various anti-Semitic posts, including one indicating that Israel should be relocated to the United States and another stating that “the Jews are rallying” to alter the results on a particular vote regarding Israeli military action. Another MP, Paul Flynn, suggested that the UK’s first Jewish ambassador to Israel might have dual loyalties, stating that it would be preferable to have “someone with roots in the UK [who] can’t be accused of having Jewish loyalty.”

Anti-Semitism So Far Isn’t Turning Off Enough Voters

The response among the electorate to the tide of anti-Semitism within the party has been less than encouraging. The hard data is that 40 percent of the electorate voted for Corbyn and his Labour ilk in 2017, a level that exceeded Blair’s turnout in 2005. As a former staffer for a member of Parliament reiterated dismally, either four out of ten people voting in 2017 did not care about rising anti-Semitism within the party or did not see it as a pressing issue.

This particular staffer did stress that very small minority of people would likely have voted for Corbyn because he is anti-Semitic, but that such a sentiment offers little comfort to those who genuinely fear the direction of the Labour’s leadership.

A consensus among UK policy figures regarding the party’s hard-left shift—and its simultaneous anti-Semitic swivel—is that changes in membership rules under Corbyn’s predecessor, Ed Miliband, are particularly to blame. Five years ago, Milliband simultaneously lowered party membership fees, resulting in a flood of younger, further left members, and scrapped the electoral college system that had been used to select the party’s leader in favor of a “direct democracy” selection process.

The result? A growing divergence between the political views of the Labour MPs and the party’s more radical members, who ultimately select the party’s leader. The recent defections seem the culmination of these ugly fractures.

There are upsides to making a party—and politics, in general—more accessible and relevant. However, there lie inherent difficulties in predicting a party’s shape following such tectonic shifts. Here, it seems anti-Semitism has become the soup du jour.

The American Parallel

What has taken place in the UK Labour Party is not distinctly different from what appears to be unfolding in the American Democratic Party. It perhaps offers a warning signal to Democratic leadership in the United States.

The flood of young people into the Democratic Party—mostly college-educated, white progressives—has pressured the party further leftward. As David French wrote last week in National Review, “When you look at the data, the people who are primarily moving the goalposts — the folks in charge of the change — are white progressives…In 2001, 42 percent of Democrats identified as moderate, 32 percent identified as liberal, and a surprising 23 percent identified as conservative. By 2018…46 percent of Democrats identify as liberal and 35 percent as moderate. Conservatives were down to 17 percent.”

Unsurprisingly, the UK Labour Party and Corbyn have long been a fan-favorite of the American Democratic Party’s hard-left wing, which sees the populist elements of Corbyn’s rise as parallel to its own anti-establishment rhetoric. Earlier this month, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shared glowing praise of a phone call with Corbyn, tweeting, “It was an honor to share such a lovely and wide-reaching conversation with you, @jeremycorbyn!”

Similarly, Democratic 2020 hopeful and socialist bulwark Sen. Bernie Sanders has a history of praising Corbyn. Over the past several years American commentators have lauded the UK Labour Party aplenty as a model for the American Democratic Party, and a force to fight “Trumpism” (see here and here).

Yes, there is something to profound to learn from the UK Labour Party. The slow implosion of the UK Labour Party is a reminder of where the American Democratic Party could be headed, if it allows its more volatile, hard-left progressive ranks to swallow the entire party.

Correlation Between Leftism and Racism

The recent controversy surrounding the anti-Semitic comments made by freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar offers a depressing form of deja vu for anyone who has watched the UK Labour Party gradually devolve into its current anti-Semitic mess. Omar’s comments weren’t an isolated instance of anti-Semitism from the left but in step with anti-Jewish sentiment that has been creeping within the ranks of the Democratic Party and left in general.

Recall that several leaders of the Women’s March have a history of anti-Semitic commentary, one even praising Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as her “mentor.” Farrakhan is an anti-Semitic, racist bigot whose most memorable quotes include labeling Hitler a “very great man” and Jews “termites.”

Omar’s comments weren’t an isolated instance of anti-Semitism from the left but in step with anti-Jewish sentiment that has been creeping within the Democratic Party.

Farrakhan’s connection to the Democratic Party goes much deeper. Several lawmakers who comprise the new House majority leadership have either attended events where he has spoken or had private meetings with him. Former president Barack Obama even posed for a photo with the man.

So when Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, attempted to distance herself from the Women’s March, declaring that the anti-Semitism within its ranks were unacceptable, the condemnation rang hollow. It seemed she could muster the strength to condemn the leaders of the Women’s March but not her own colleagues.

Democrats’ complacence with anti-Semitic rhetoric doesn’t stop with Farrakhan. The entirety of the boycott, divest, sanction movement against Israel is propelled by progressive groups and formalized by Democratic leaders.

Those who suggest such a movement is solely about Israel and not Jews should try to point to any other country that the left has systematically sought to economically and diplomatically isolate to the point that entire groups on college campuses are devoted to and obsessed with this one sole mission. The image of Jewish professors being kicked off of German university campuses in the 1930s is an image BDS supporters are keen to recreate in the United States—except using an Israeli passport to justify such expulsion.

Who supports such a movement outside of college campuses? The answer is predictably easy: Democrats. Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Omar are two Democratic politicians who have openly embraced the BDS movement.

Attempting to Hide the Growing Anti-Semitism Problem

Recently, Democratic Senators blocked the vote on Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-FL) anti-BDS bill, because a vote would likely expose the left’s anti-Semitism. But perhaps, if the Labour Party’s fate is any indication, that’s just what the left needs. Indeed, sunlight is the best disinfectant.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi having a conversation with Omar is grossly insufficient to address this problem.

Like the UK Labour Party, the anti-Semitism that remained on the fringe of progressive causes has crept into the formal institutions of the American Democratic Party. Although Democrat leaders have done their best to minimize accusations of anti-Semitism, it is only normalizing the anti-Semitism they nominally reject. Much in the same way Corbyn’s lukewarm response has allowed anti-Semitism to fester within the Labour Party, Democrats’ milquetoast answers could likely bring the same result.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi having a conversation with Omar is grossly insufficient to address this problem. If Democrats are serious about confronting anti-Semitism within their ranks, they should be stripping leadership positions from those who peddle anti-Semitic rhetoric and forcefully condemning such individuals. But no such removals are taking place, and instead of forceful condemnations with legitimate repercussions, we are witnessing juvenile “conversations” that seem to be the epitome of virtue-signaling.

The AOC tweet came in response to a segment in which co-host Pete Hegseth told viewers Monday that the decision to up entry level salaries would come at the expense of senior staffers and was essentially “communism.”

“Every Capitol Hill office has a limited amount of money to pay their staff. So you have to decide how to allocate it. She said everyone in my office will [be] paid a living wage,” Hegseth said. “Which means your entry level intern is making 52 grand while your chief of staff — who is a very important role in a congressional office — now is capped at 80 [thousand].”

“It’s actually socialism and communism on display,” he added.

The tussle with AOC is the latest news for Hegseth since he admitted on air two weeks ago that he did not wash his hands (something he later suggested was a joke).

Ocasio-Cortez has spoken at length about long hours and low salaries of Capitol Hill staffers and has aimed to use her own office salaries as an example (one that certainly won’t go unnoticed by staffers at other Democratic offices).

“Leadership starts with our choices. That’s why I decided that no one on my staff will make less than $52k/year. It’s likely one of the highest entry-level salaries on the Hill. We pinch pennies elsewhere, but it’s worth every dime to pay a living wage,” she said on Twitter to much fanfare last week.

Saturday's election, which U.S. observers said had lost some credibility after being abruptly delayed by a week by officials citing organizational glitches, was expected to be Nigeria's tightest since the end of military rule two decades ago.

At stake is the helm of Africa's top oil producer and biggest economy, rattled by a decade-long battle with Islamist militants in the northeast that has spilled into neighbouring countries and prompted the deployment of a regional task force.

Buhari, 76, is a former military ruler seeking a second term on an anti-corruption platform, while Atiku Abubakar, 72, a businessman and former vice-president, has pledged above all to expand the role of the private sector.

Initial results released by the national electoral commission (INEC) on Monday put Buhari in the lead. He won in four of Nigeria's 36 states – two in the southwest, and one each in the east and central parts of the country, INEC said, while Atiku prevailed in the capital Abuja.

In provisional results announced in state capitals but not yet confirmed by INEC, Buhari took the northeastern state of Yobe while Atiku won in Ondo state in the southwest.

Asked about the early results, Buhari told reporters: ""I don't want to depend on rumours... We will rather wait for INEC to announce the [full] results.""

But the chairman of Atiku's People's Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, said the election tallies announced so far were ""incorrect and unacceptable.""

""The results are being manipulated and cancelled for APC to retain power,"" he told reporters, referring to Buhari's party.

The full outcome, not expected before later in the week, appears to hinge on which man voters trust most to revamp an economy still struggling from a 2016 recession.

A credible and relatively calm vote would open a new chapter in the checkered political history of Nigeria, where nearly six decades of independence have been tarnished by military coups, endemic corruption and secessionist movements.

But doubts rose when the election was postponed on Feb. 16, just hours before it was due to begin, with authorities citing problems in delivering ballot papers and results sheets.

Delay likely depressed turnout: election monitor

The week-long delay in holding Nigeria's presidential election damaged public trust in the process and probably reduced Saturday's voter turnout, U.S. observers said.

""It is highly probable that such a late postponement had negative effects on voter turnout,"" John Tomaszewski, of the joint U.S. National Democratic Institute (NDI) and International Republican Institute observer delegation, told reporters.

""More significantly, the delay also undermined public confidence in INEC,"" he said.

The civil society group YIAGA AFRICA, which monitored the election, projected turnout at 36 to 40 per cent.

Situation Room, a monitoring mission comprising over 70 civic groups, said on Sunday as many as 39 people had been killed in election-related violence and over 260 in all since the start of the campaign in October.

Voting, however, took place ""in a generally peaceful environment,"" said Hailemariam Desalegn, head of the African Union observer mission and a former premier of Ethiopia.

""There were scattered incidents of violence but it was not seen as pervasive on Election Day,"" said Derek Mitchell, president of the U.S. observer mission.

Previous Nigerian elections have been marred by violence among supporters of different political parties that at times sparked sectarian conflict. Security forces are currently stretched by the Islamist insurgency as well as by communal violence and banditry in other areas.

Hours before polls opened, explosions rocked Maiduguri, capital of Borno state, epicentre of the insurgency. In neighbouring Yobe, residents of the town of Geidam fled a militant attack around the same time.

Scattered violence and problems with smart card readers that authenticate voters' fingerprints meant voting in a small number of precincts had to put off to Sunday, Mitchell said.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a group of San Francisco Bay Area students squared off over climate change in a sometimes tense exchange captured on video and widely shared on social media.

The 15-minute video of the impromptu Friday meeting captures the students and Feinstein debating the merits of the Green New Deal, an ambitious Democrat plan to shift the U.S. economy from fossil fuels to renewable sources such as wind and solar power.

The students passionately urged the California Democrat to support the legislation. But Feinstein, a 27-year veteran of the Senate, argued that the legislation had no chance of passing the Republican-controlled chamber.

""That resolution will not pass the Senate, and you can take that back to whoever sent you here and tell them,"" Feinstein responded after the students insisted the legislation was badly needed. ""I've been in the Senate for over a quarter of a century and I know what can pass and I know what can't pass.""

Republicans have mocked the Green New Deal as a progressive pipedream that would drive the economy off a cliff and lead to a huge tax increase, calling it evidence of the creep of socialism in the Democratic party.

Instead, Feinstein said she supported an alternate plan.

The students are members of Sunrise Movement, an activist group that encourages children to combat climate change.

Sunrise Movement's Bay Area leader Morissa Zuckerman posted the debate on the group's Facebook page. A few hours later, edited versions were being shared widely across social media platforms.

Zuckerman said Saturday the group didn't have an appointment with Feinstein. Zuckerman said the group had earlier sought a meeting with Feinstein, but the senator's staff said she was unavailable.

It was the students' decision to call on Feinstein's San Francisco office on Friday, Zuckerman said .

In the video, Zuckerman says, ""If this doesn't get turned around in 10 years, you're looking at the faces of the people who are going to be living with the consequences.""

Feinstein countered that she understands the consequences of climate change.

""I've been doing this for 30 years. I know what I'm doing,"" Feinstein said. ""You come in here and you say it has to be my way or the highway. I don't respond to that.""

Later Friday, Feinstein issued a statement calling the debate a ""spirited discussion"" and said ""I want the children to know they were heard loud and clear.""

Feinstein's spokesman Adam Russell declined further comment Saturday.

The tourist’s death will be referred to the local coroner, the statement also said.

The site of the tragedy, Tairua, is a popular holiday destination on New Zealand’s Coromandel Peninsula.

The region draws hordes of tourists every year, lured by its warm climate and beautiful beaches.

Mr Massey is not the first tourist to drown while swimming in the area recently.

In October, a man died at nearby Hot Water Beach after he tried to save a child who was struggling in the ocean.

The OSCE said Sunday's vote was ""tainted by allegations of pressure on public employees"" and ""the misuse of state resources"".

""Control and ownership of the media by political actors limited the range of viewpoints presented to voters,"" the monitors also said.

Both pro-Moscow and pro-EU forces have accused the ruling Democratic party of massive election fraud.

The election took place under a new voting system, which the OSCE said ""was adopted without inclusive public debates"".

Ex-Soviet Moldova elected a parliament with no clear majority, results showed on Monday, potentially throwing the impoverished country into political turmoil.

The pro-Russian Socialist Party, which is close to President Igor Dodon, won the largest share of the vote, taking over 31 per cent.

Dodon and pro-Brussels opposition leader Andrei Nastase have accused the ruling Democratic Party of vote buying.

They said the party, led by powerful oligarch Vlad Plahotniuc, had bussed in voters from the country's separatist breakaway region Transnistria and told them how to vote.

However, bad blood over Sanders' perceived resistance in conceding to 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has some within the party speaking up about the socialist senator's own elitist habits.

Six former staffers from Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign are lashing out at ""his Royal Majesty"" Sanders, criticizing his frequent use of private jets when he traveled the country rallying Democrats to show up and vote for Clinton.

What are the details?

In an interview with Politico, Clinton's former campaign director of rapid response, Zac Petkanas, didn't mince words:

I'm not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe.

A second Clinton aide told the outlet, ""We would try to fight it as much as possible because of the cost and availability of planes, but [the Sanders camp] would request [a jet] every time. We would always try to push for commercial. ... At the campaign, you're constantly trying to save like 25 cents.""

Another unnamed staffer added that initially, Clinton aides were surprised by Sanders' demands for private charters, saying, ""our working assumption was that 90 percent of the time it would be commercial.""

But soon, the senator's alleged insistence on being supplied with his own jet became ""a running joke"" in the Clinton campaign office, Politico reported.

How did the Sanders campaign respond?

Sanders' 2016 campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, fired back at the Clinton camp, calling them ""total ingrates"" for dismissing the senator's efforts to help Clinton become president.

""You can see why she's one of the most disliked politicians in America,"" Briggs told Politico. ""She's not nice. Here people are not nice. [Sanders] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.""

""It doesn't make me feel good to feel this way but they're some of the biggest a***oles in American politics,"" he added.

Anything else?

Sanders' use of private jets has come under fire before, seen as hypocritical given the senator's platform against the use of fossil fuels. But he doesn't appear to be letting his agenda get in the way of his travel habits.

In October, Sanders' 2018 campaign paid just under $300,000 to a charter jet company, Fox News reported.

The Sanders campaign reportedly purchased less than $5,000 in carbon offsets to compensate for the emissions expelled by the senator's plane usage that month.",Former Clinton campaign aides rip 'his Royal Majesty' Bernie Sanders over private jet use,Theblaze.com,https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-clinton-aides-rip-bernie-sanders

The incident occurred while the unnamed female holidaymaker, 45, was hiking in Tyrol’s Pinnistal valley in 2014.

A court in Innsbruck heard how the animals stampeded, most likely after they became agitated by the presence of the hiker’s dog.

Although the farmer insisted he had put up warning signs, the court ruled there were not enough and that, in any case, the footpath should have been fenced off from the herd.

Greenberg also said the payment is “complicated” because Kelly has to “rely on others acting on his behalf,” the Associated Press reports.

In addition to offering to pay the fee, fans have taken it upon themselves to raise money through GoFundMe campaigns for the singer - who pleaded not guilty to the criminal sexual abuse charges on Monday.

On GoFundMe, there have been more than 45 campaigns set up to “free R Kelly”.

“Need help freeing an innocent man,” one of the campaigns reads.

So far, just one of the GoFundMe accounts has raised more than $5 - with the leading account showing $25 raised of its $5,000 goal.

On Monday, the Associated Press reported Kelly had still not posted bail.

Kelly was indicted on 10 counts of sexual abuse against four victims - three of which were underage at the time of the sexual abuse.

Kelly’s next court date is scheduled for 22 March.

The Independent has contacted the Cook County Court for comment.",R Kelly investigation: Female fans are trying to pay the singer's bail,Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/r-kelly-investigation-update-female-fans-bail-pay-money-how-much-women-a8796526.html

The incident occurred while the unnamed female holidaymaker, 45, was hiking in Tyrol’s Pinnistal valley in 2014.

A court in Innsbruck heard how the animals stampeded, most likely after they became agitated by the presence of the hiker’s dog.

The court has now found the farmer to be negligent, and ordered him to pay compensation to the victim’s husband and son.

Although the farmer insisted he had put up warning signs, the court ruled there were not enough and that, in any case, the footpath should have been fenced off from the herd.

But the ruling has angered many of the region’s farmers, who say it will become a threat to their livelihood in a region that attracts huge numbers of Alpine tourists.

The Tyrolean Chamber of Agriculture described the incident as “tragic” but said that it felt the verdict was “out of touch with reality”.

In a statement, it said: “The ruling is generating a great deal of anxiety and uncertainty among farmers, who are faced with the question of whether they should allow their cows to graze, or whether they should close off the pastures completely.

“Footpaths across meadows and pastures would have to be fenced off, and made inaccessible to walkers.

“An obligation to put up fences would be economically unreasonable for farmers and would, in many places, mean the end of pastoral farming.”

Since besting six-term incumbent, former Representative Joe Crowley (D., N.Y.) in November, Ocasio-Cortez has leveraged her outsized social media following to build public support for the Green New Deal, which calls for the elimination of America’s carbon footprint within ten years. She has vigorously defended the proposal since its rocky introduction earlier this month as the only solution commensurate with the scale of the problem, and has attacked skeptics and moderates within her own party as too timid and deferential to the status quo.

Yup. If you don’t like the #GreenNewDeal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis. Until then, we’re in charge – and you’re just shouting from the cheap seats. https://t.co/h3KSJhHqDN — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 23, 2019

The majority of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders immediately endorsed the Green New Deal resolution as an aspirational concept, but have hesitated when asked to address its specific components.

Following the proposal’s introduction, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly announced that the Senate will vote on the non-binding measure, prompting criticism from Democratic leaders who argue the proposal was just a starting point and was not ready to be voted on.

When Bernie Sanders launched his bid for the presidency in 2015, he was dismissed by political and media elites as an outsider with radical ideas that would prevent him from being taken seriously by Democratic primary and caucus voters.

Now, as Sanders mounts his second bid for the presidency, the same political and media aristocrats speculate about whether Sanders will have a hard time distinguishing himself in a field of candidates who echo his stances on issues ranging from Medicare for All to wage hikes to tuition-free college and implementing a Green New Deal.

Sanders won the ideas primary four years ago, an accomplishment he nodded to in his announcement on Tuesday of his 2020 bid: “Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were ‘radical,’ and ‘extreme.’ We were told that Medicare for All, a $15 an hour minimum wage, free tuition at public colleges and universities, aggressively combating climate change, demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes, were all concepts that the American people would never accept. Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.”

The appeal of the ideas Sanders raised with his 2016 presidential bid, to young people in particular, transformed the politics of the Democratic Party and the nation. Now, everyone in the party—well, just about everyone—wants to identify as a bold progressive. As such, we are told, Sanders is just one of the crowd of similarly inclined contenders bidding for a chance to take down Donald Trump.

So is Sanders a victim of his own success? Has he so expanded the range of debate in the Democratic Party that he, himself, is no longer viable?

Don’t bet against the guy just yet.

As media and political elites misunderstood what made Sanders stand out in 2016, they are now misunderstanding what will make him stand out in 2020.

Read also Bhaskar Sunkara, “Bernie Sanders, American socialist”, Le Monde diplomatique, January 2016. Sanders was the only democratic socialist running for the Democratic nomination four years ago, and it is likely that he will be the only democratic socialist mounting a serious bid next year. His ideology is what has distinguished him in a country where, until his 2016 campaign jump-started the ideological discourse, the “s” word was often relegated to the fringe of the debate. And it will continue to distinguish him—not as an extreme and “unelectable” figure, but as the generator of big ideas that often extend from and build upon the tradition of the New Deal and the “Economic Bill of Rights” messaging that secured the Democratic Party its greatest victories.

When Sanders ran four years ago, he got credit for proposing bold responses to the health-care, education, economic, environmental, and social challenges the country had either neglected or failed to adequately address. The ideas proved to be popular, but they weren’t particularly new. For the most part, Sanders was calling for an American embrace of policies and programs that were implemented long ago in Canada, Britain, Germany, and, of course, the social democracies of Scandinavia.

Sanders’s identification as a democratic socialist was not a liability in 2016. It was a strength. It made him an intellectually dynamic and exciting contender who addressed America’s anxieties and its hopes—not merely because with the solutions he proposed but in the way he put the pieces together by comfortably talking about doing battle with “oligarchy” and “plutocracy” and “the billionaire class.”

At a time when Americans were sick and tired of the political “competition” between right-wing dogma and centrist double talk, Sanders spoke a language that made sense. He focused on fundamental questions and provided fundamental answers: People who are ailing need affordable health care, and a single-payer national health-care program will get the care they need; people working 40 hours a week shouldn’t be living in poverty, and a $15-an-hour minimum wage will make ends meet; young people shouldn’t have to take on overwhelming debt in order to get an education, and free tuition will change the calculus. Ending austerity and addressing inequality costs money, and taxing the rich will help to balance the books.

It was common sense, rooted in the democratic-socialist agenda Sanders has embraced and articulated for the better part of six decades. Such common sense that voters in 23 Democratic primary and caucus contests choose the candidate who was borrowing from the playbooks of the Scandinavian social democrats—as well as American pioneers such as Eugene Victor Debs and the Socialist Party mayors who ran cities like Milwaukee across much of the 20th century.

As in the 1930s, when Franklin Roosevelt consulted Socialist Party stalwarts such as Norman Thomas and A. Philip Randolph, and as in the 1960s, when the Kennedy and Johnson administrations took cues from socialists such as Randolph and Michael Harrington, 2016 proved to be a moment that was ripe for what the Sanders campaign referred to as a “political revolution.”

The moment will be just as ripe in 2020. The challenges that needed to be addressed four years ago remain unaddressed today, and in many cases have been made more daunting by the Robin-Hood-in-reverse approach of Trump and his billionaire-aligned Republican allies in Congress. Because of Trump’s racism and crude attacks on immigrants and refugees and women’s rights, there will be an even greater need to focus on an equity agenda that Sanders was sometimes criticized in 2016 for not emphasizing enough. In 2020, that agenda was central to an announcement of candidacy that declared: “I’m running for president because, now more than ever, we need leadership that brings us together—not divides us up. Women and men, black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native born and immigrant. Now is the time for us to stand together.”

In that same “complete the revolution” announcement on Tuesday, Sanders promised that “Together we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic, racial, social and environmental justice. And together we can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country.”

Unlike most of the other candidates, who are evolving toward where Sanders is already at, the independent senator from Vermont simply has to be his own authentic self—the guy who started working with the Young People’s Socialist League and civil-rights groups as a student at the University of Chicago and who joined the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom that Randolph and another democratic socialist, Bayard Rustin, organized in 1963.

The point here is not to suggest that the Democratic Party is about to go socialist, or that if Sanders is nominated and elected that America will suddenly be a socialist country. The point is that, after 30 years of globalization, 20 years of digital revolution, and 10 years of automation, with climate change posing an existential threat and with inequality surging in a new age of monopoly, the United States is at a critical juncture. The reactionary policies of the Trump administration will not meet the demands of this moment, but neither will the centrist “New Democrat” or “Third Way” approaches that have too frequently constrained Democratic administrations in the past four decades.

This is a potential New Deal moment, a potential Great Society moment. Bigger ideas, bolder approaches, better answers are needed if this country is going to respond in a meaningful way to climate change, to economic and racial injustice, to the dislocation caused by the collapse of the old economy, and to the monopolization of the new economy by a handful of tech giants.

Just as there was in the 1930s, and in the 1960s, there is now an opening for the Democratic Party to fill a void in our politics and policy-making. But to fill that void, the party must be willing to embrace at least some ideas that have been labeled as “socialist”—and to maintain the embrace even when a Herbert Hoover or a Barry Goldwater or a Donald Trump attacks. Social Security was described as a “socialist” program, but FDR fought for and implemented it. Medicare was attacked as a “socialist” program, but LBJ fought for and implemented it. Major strides on behalf of racial justice, gender equity, disability rights, and environmental protection, to implement fair taxation and to provide a safety net, were often decried by the right as “socialist” initiatives—as backers of a Green New Deal are now learning—but, as these policies have been advanced, society has come to the point even centrists and some conservatives recognize their value.

It is not necessary to claim that democratic socialism has all the answers—certainly Sanders does not do so—but it is necessary to recognize that there are old socialist proposals that have always made sense and new socialist proposals that make sense in a moment of economic, environmental, and social disruption.

Sanders, to a far greater extent than the other 2020 contenders, is prepared to do this. He’s not doctrinaire or romantically idealistic. He’s practical and serious-minded. He’s a former mayor, who ran his state’s largest city ably. He’s been in the US House and the US Senate for almost three decades, compiling a record of getting things right when most Republicans and many Democrats got them wrong. He is a serious thinker and analyst of ideas, who is familiar with social democracy, as it has been practiced and as it now is being practiced in Scandinavian countries—to such an extent that he once organized town meetings in Vermont with Denmark’s ambassador to the United States. And he is prepared to talk about how social-democratic programs have worked well for countries such as Norway, Sweden, Germany, and Canada.

It’s not a hard sell. Polling suggests the people are ready. Social-democratic responses to contemporary challenges—like providing health care as a right, not a privilege; like taxing the rich to fund job creation and green infrastructure—are popular, especially with young voters and with the historically dispossessed voters who must be mobilized to win in 2020. If Sanders runs as a more-ambitious version of who he was in 2016—with comprehensive proposals for meeting the ancient need of equity in a new machine age of globalization, digital revolution, automation—he will stand out from the field of Democratic contenders. Perhaps sufficiently to secure the nomination.

This is what terrifies Donald Trump. That’s why the president used his State of the Union address to target Sanders and the growing number of elected officials, such as New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who identify as democratic socialists.

“Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” the president announced. “America was founded on liberty and independence—not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”

Trump doesn’t care to know that many ideas that have been attacked as “socialist,” such Social Security and basic-income grants, can be traced back to essays written by the radical pamphleteer Tom Paine, the revolutionary who called the American experiment into being. But Trump does know that at least some Democratic insiders still get thrown off by red-baiting rhetoric. And you can be sure he will apply the “s” label to any Democrat who gets near him in 2020.

What distinguishes Sanders is that the senator from Vermont is not going to be thrown off by Trump’s barbs.

Trump may think “socialism” is a scare word, and many prominent Democrats may indeed get scared when it is referenced, but Sanders is comfortable discussing his democratic socialist ideology. “Do they think I’m afraid of the word? I’m not afraid of the word,” says Sanders.

Sanders is not defensive. He’s aggressive. While Trump equates the humane democratic socialism that millions of Americans embrace with “government coercion, domination and control”—in a desperate attempt to narrow the discourse—Sanders makes honest comparisons that expand and enhance the dialogue.

“I happen to believe that, if the American people understood the significant accomplishments that have taken place under social-democratic governments, democratic-socialist governments, labor governments throughout Europe, they would be shocked to know about those accomplishments,” the senator told me several years ago. “How many Americans know that in virtually every European country, when you have a baby, you get guaranteed time off and, depending on the country, significant financial benefits as well. Do the American people know that? I doubt it. Do the American people even know that we’re the only major Western industrialized country that doesn’t guarantee healthcare for all? Most people don’t know that. Do the American people know that in many countries throughout Europe, public colleges and universities are either tuition-free or very inexpensive?”

What makes Bernie Sanders stand out is an ability to move the discussion forward by educating voters rather than trying to frighten or divide them. At the heart of that education is an understanding that is hardwired into the American experience.

This essay continues our exclusive collaboration with The Nation, publishing jointly commissioned articles monthly, both in print and online. To subscribe to The Nation, go here “Let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me. It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in 1968, when he stated that, ‘this country has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor,’” says Sanders. He went on:

“It’s time we had democratic socialism for working families, not just Wall Street, billionaires and large corporations. It means that we should not be providing welfare for corporations, huge tax breaks for the very rich, or trade policies which would boost corporate profits as workers lose their jobs,” he said, echoing a line that he frequently repeats in his standard campaign speech across the country. It means that we create a government that works for all of us, not just powerful special interests. It means that economic rights must be an essential part of what American stands for. It means that health care should be a right of all people, not a privilege.”","Bernie Sanders, four years on",Mondediplo.com,https://mondediplo.com/openpage/bernie-sanders-four-years-on

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a democratic socialist, but most Democrats aren't. Wanting higher taxes on the really rich and a more generous safety net is one thing. Heck, even some Republicans and conservatives favor those ideas. There's little evidence, though, that the folks who voted for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to weaken the capitalist system and work toward eliminating the private sector. Such are the explicit goals of democratic socialists, or at least, the Democratic Socialists of America, a group of which Ocasio-Cortez is a member.

It should be no surprise, then, that Democratic presidential contenders are rejecting AOC's ""democratic socialist"" label, even as they vaguely support her fantastical ""Green New Deal"" idea. In recent days, Kamala Harris flatly declared, ""I am not a democratic socialist,"" while Beto O'Rourke said meeting the nation's ""fundamental challenges"" will require ""harnessing the power of the market."" Joe Biden said he was for a ""moral capitalism."" And Amy Klobuchar dismissed ""Medicare for all,"" as a only a ""possibility in the future."" That universal health-care plan, of course, is the big policy idea of the one 2020 candidate who currently self-describes as a democratic socialist, Bernie Sanders.

Conveniently, rejecting socialism is a handy way for Sanders' rivals to remind Democratic voters that the Vermont independent really isn't one of them. It's also a sign that despite some polls suggesting ""socialism"" is rising in popularity vs. ""capitalism,"" Democrats have no interest in letting Trump define their candidate and party as socialist, even with the ""democratic"" qualifier. Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly referred to herself as a capitalist, although typically with some addendum about markets needing rules, maybe like Germany's. Other candidates might favor aspects of Scandinavian-style capitalism, with its higher income tax rates and larger welfare state.

It would be awesome, however, if there was at least one Democrat running for president who full-throatedly and wholeheartedly favored American capitalism. It's been pretty successful, after all. Recall the Democratic presidential debate in 2015 when Sanders declared America ""should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people."" Hard pass from Hillary Clinton, who said, ""We are not Denmark. ... We would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history of the world.""

Not that we shouldn't see how other countries do things and swipe good ideas where we can. We should. But we also have to be careful. America is kind of its own thing, a continent-spanning nation with a large and diverse population. What works over there, might not work so well over here.

In the 2014 paper, ""How can Scandinavians tax so much?"" Henrik Jacobsen Kleven, an economist at the London School of Economics, cautions American policymakers from mechanically mimicking the Nordic nations: ""They are small and homogenous, racial and religious diversity is limited, human capital is high, and they have been largely unaffected by violent conflict. It is not clear to what degree lessons learned from Scandinavia carry policy implications for large, diverse, and unequal countries such as the United States ... replicating the Scandinavian policies and institutions in societies that are fundamentally different is unlikely to be achievable or perhaps even desirable.""

Indeed, we are not Denmark. Or Sweden or Germany. Focusing so much on what other countries appear to be doing right and what America appears to be doing wrong can leave us blind to our many successes. Or even to view successes as failures. Sure, America has lots of billionaires, just like other advanced economies. Some even have more of the superrich per capita than the U.S., including Sweden and Norway. (Though no large economy produces superrich people who get that way through entrepreneurship like America does.) So, too, Big Tech might be getting too big, but Europe would prefer to be regulating its own currently non-existent tech titans than America's. And the idea that U.S. real worker wages have been stagnant for decades is a sketchy economic conclusion that requires questionable assumptions about inflation to be true. The most competitive economy in the world? There's a good case to be made that it's America's.

We already have a major political party whose leader thinks American capitalism has been failing for decades.

An Emerson College opinion poll of New Hampshire voters released on Saturday showed Sanders to be the top choice of respondents with 27 percent of the vote. Warren, a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, was far behind at 9 percent — a worrisome number given many New Hampshire voters are familiar with her.

But as Warren, 69, returned to the early voting state over the weekend for the second time this month, there were signs she could be chipping away at Sanders' support a year before the New Hampshire primary election.

Some New Hampshire residents who voted for Sanders last time told Reuters they now were leaning toward Warren. Some said the 77-year-old Sanders' political window had closed. Others said they wanted to see a female nominee.

""Bernie lost his shine,"" said Candace Moulton, 36, who attended Warren's campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. ""I think we're really ready to have a woman president, to be frank.""

New Hampshire often has been where presidential aspirations are solidified. While the Iowa caucuses serve as the first test of a candidate's strength, New Hampshire holds the first party primary, and has been a state where a contender can build momentum, salvage a campaign or reach the end of the road.

Ten Democrats have already declared their candidacy for the party's nomination, and more are expected to join the contest. The winner will likely face Republican President Donald Trump in the general election in November 2020.

New Hampshire's primary traditionally has favored candidates with ties to the region, making it important for Sanders and Warren to target. Both are progressives with similar policy platforms that include providing universal health care coverage and raising the minimum wage.

Dante Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, said he expects the presidential field to narrow significantly by the time the primary comes.

""There's a good likelihood that New Hampshire will be framed as a Sanders-Warren competition with one ticket out,"" he said. Should Warren fail to win Iowa, New Hampshire becomes a ""must-win,"" Scala said. ""It's hard to see her lasting if she can't win here.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden could muddy things further if he mounts a bid. Biden placed second in the Emerson poll, and his high name recognition with voters could give him a boost.

Friendly territory

Warren campaigned in New Hampshire as if she were a local. ""You guys know me,"" she told a gathering of 1,000 state party leaders and activists in Manchester on Friday. She followed up by speaking to a full hall in Plymouth on Saturday.

On this swing, Warren played up her personal story over policy, talking about her family's struggles growing up in Oklahoma and the challenges she faced as a young mother.

After the Plymouth event, Nancy Chandler, 84, said Warren won her support with a fiery speech where she talked about wanting ""big, systemic change"" and fighting for the middle class.

""I think the bus has passed,"" Chandler of Warren, New Hampshire, said of Sanders.

Liz Alcauskas, 74, of Manchester, said many of Sanders' ideas were important, but she planned to vote for a different Democrat in next year's election.

""I would like to not have an old, white man be president,"" she said. ""It's someone else's turn now.""

Even some of Sanders' most loyal supporters are unsure of him this time. Andru Volinsky, a member of Sanders's 2016 steering committee in the state, said ""my first inclination is towards Bernie, but I haven't ruled out a handful of others.""

The home-field advantage enjoyed by Sanders and Warren has sparked speculation that other candidates may compete less intensely in New Hampshire, focusing instead on other early states.

Senator Kamala Harris of California made her first campaign trip to the state earlier this month and insisted she would be an active presence there. But she had made a point of visiting South Carolina, with its large swath of African-American voters, before New Hampshire.

Harris likely will also concentrate on gaining the majority of support from the millions of voters in her home state, which has its primary in early March but will allow early voting to begin around the time of the New Hampshire contest.

Raymond Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said other candidates cannot afford to write the state off.

""In 2020, we have such an immensely diverse group of candidates, in every sense of the word, that it's dangerous to make any assumptions about how the primary will turn out,"" Buckley said.

There remains room in the state for Warren's support to grow. Her Plymouth event was filled with undecided voters.

""I feel very wide open right now. I feel like I could support anyone,"" said A.J. Coppola, 32, from Thornton, New Hampshire. ""I'm inclined to the person who is really passionate, who feels like they have energy behind them.""",New Hampshire Primary May Come Down to Sanders Vs.Warren,Voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/new-hampshire-primary-may-come-down-to-sanders-vs-warren/4803291.html
147,Empty,2019-02-25T12:58:52Z,WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will forgo the chase for campaign money from the biggest donors in her quest for her party's nomination for president.,"By ELANA SCHOR and BRIAN SLODYSKO

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will forgo the chase for campaign money from the biggest donors in her quest for her party’s nomination for president.

In an email to supporters on Monday, Warren, of Massachusetts, acknowledged that “this decision will ensure that I will be outraised by other candidates in this race.”

But by making her move now as a proactive gesture, vowing to avoid any “fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren is betting that focusing on grassroots supporters will ultimately pay off by boosting her small-dollar donations as she battles a half-dozen or more rivals.

Warren billed her new fundraising policy as a way of matching her actions to her calls for a sweeping change to the nation’s political systems. She already has sworn off campaign donations from political action committees and federal lobbyists, but her new policy puts her in a league beyond most of the other Democrats already seeking the presidency or weighing runs.

Some of those rivals are already besting Warren in the hunt for donations that can often make or break a presidential candidacy. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign reported nearly $6 million raised in the first 24 hours after he entered the race last week, and California Sen. Kamala Harris’ campaign reported $1.5 million raised during the first day after her launch.

Harris and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York reportedly have signed on to appear at high-dollar fundraisers as they hustle to raise the cash necessary to compete in the jam-packed primary. They have sworn off donations from corporate political action committees, but none has gone as far as Warren pledged Monday.

“We’re going to take the time presidential candidates typically reserve for courting wealthy donors and instead use it to build organizing event after organizing event, in the early primary states and across the country,” Warren wrote to supporters.

Warren’s campaign has stayed mum about how much money it has taken in since she announced her candidacy. An early glimpse was included in Federal Election Commission year-end filings, which showed that she collected around $300,000 in the hours after launching her exploratory committee at the end of December. That’s a far smaller figure than what several of her competitors have reported raising. More recent fundraising emails have said she’s “falling short” in the money race.

“Let’s be real: Out of all the candidates Elizabeth is probably never going to raise the most money,” says a fundraising solicitation sent out Friday.

But during recent midterm elections she was a fundraising powerhouse who outraised all of the other senators currently running for the presidency, pulling in more than $30 million between her Senate fund and two separate fundraising committees, which she has since shut down. She also cut big checks at the time to candidates, Democratic federal campaign funds and state-level party committees in Iowa, Florida, Arizona, Nevada and New Hampshire.

That left her with about $11 million in the bank at the end of December, records show.",Democrat Elizabeth Warren plans to forgo big-money donors,Bostonherald.com,https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/02/25/democrat-elizabeth-warren-plans-to-forgo-big-money-donors/

Disaffected Labour MPs are to be asked to join a new group within the party in a bid to avoid further resignations.

The move, led by deputy leader Tom Watson, is intended to give more of a voice to MPs from Labour's social democratic tradition.

Nine MPs from that wing of the party left Labour last week, criticising the party's leadership and direction.

Mr Watson claimed on Sunday that the new internal grouping was the only way to hold the party together.

He said it would give a platform to MPs whose views were not currently represented in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet and a chance for them to discuss and shape policy.

A source close to Mr Corbyn said more discussion about policy was a good thing and had been a hallmark of his leadership, but signalled there would be no major shift away from current policies which were popular with voters.

Nine Labour MPs quit the party last week, accusing Mr Corbyn of a ""lurch to the left"" and tolerating a culture of bullying and anti-Semitism in the party.

Mr Watson, whose close friend Ian Austin is among those who have left, warned there was a ""crisis for the soul"" of the party and urgent action was needed.

In creating the new grouping, Mr Watson insisted he was not stoking a rebellion against Mr Corbyn but standing up for pluralism within the party.

Strength in numbers

The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson

It's likely there will be a meeting of the new group in the next 48 hours - because allies of Labour's deputy leader say this is ""urgent"" if further defections are to be staved off.

And I'm told the group could attract a substantial number of MPs, including former ministers.

It won't just be a kind of support group for those who feel disillusioned, and thinking of defecting. The intention is to give these MPs more influence, and they will undertake proper policy work.

But there could be an iron fist in this velvet glove.

At the moment we are seeing a steady trickle of Labour MPs leaving. If, however, a much larger group feel subsequently that their ideas are being ignored, then - as one source put it - there is ""strength in numbers"".

So Jeremy Corbyn could be told - change position or face not a splinter, but a proper split.

The Labour leader, himself, will be addressing his MPs behind closed doors in Parliament tonight. And how he handles the defections, the new grouping - and much else besides - could determine if anyone else walks out of the party soon.

With the Independent Group of MPs convening their inaugural ""business meeting"" later today, then the disillusioned know they have the option of travelling to a different political destination.

Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said he regarded himself as a social democrat in the mould of Tony Crosland, the former Labour cabinet minister, and he felt able to speak out during shadow cabinet.

But he told the BBC's Politics Live that he recognised some Labour MPs felt they needed a ""greater platform"".

""I would say to all colleagues, you have a contribution to make,"" he said. ""There is room for different voices.""

The move was also applauded by Jon Lansman, the chair of pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum. ""We are a pluralist party ... I welcome that.""

While the intention is to unify, the BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said one MP warned if there was a hostile response from the party leadership, it could lead to further splits.

Mr Corbyn has called on the nine who quit Labour to stand down and seek re-election as independent MPs.

Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has said those who resigned from her party had ""betrayed"" their seats and would be ""crushed"" if by-elections were held.

Speaking on Saturday at a Labour rally in Nottinghamshire, she said she would rather die than join a new party.

In response, Mr Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that he thought ""dying is a virtue that is over-rated"" and said it was ""incumbent on all of us to dial down the rhetoric"".",Labour group planned for unhappy MPs,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47355532

Americans are now as likely to identify as pro-life (47 percent) as they are pro-choice (47 percent). A similar survey taken by Marist just last month found Americans were more likely to identify as pro-choice than as pro-life by a 17-point difference.

Even more surprising is the sudden change in younger Democrats’ views on abortion. February’s poll of Democrats under the age of 45 found that 34 percent identify as pro-life, and 61 percent as pro-choice. This is a significant increase compared to last month’s 20 percent and 75 percent, respectively.

This surge in pro-life Americans comes after several states have passed or pushed for radical policies advocating for unlimited access to abortion, at any stage of gestation, for any reason or no reason at all. The survey was conducted Feb. 12-17, just weeks after New York passed the Reproductive Health Act, expanding access to post-viability, third-trimester abortions, and repealing protections for aborted children older than 20 weeks who are born alive. A proposed bill in Virginia would allow abortion up until the point of birth, and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam endorsed giving doctors and mothers the power to decide whether an infant lives or dies after it is born. Last week, the Vermont House passed an even more extreme version of the New York RHA.

“The recent legal changes to late-term abortion and the debate which followed have not gone unnoticed by the general public,” said Barbara Carvalho, director of The Marist Poll. “In just one month, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of Americans who see themselves as pro-life and an equally notable decline in those who describe themselves as pro-choice.”

Marist has been polling abortion views for more than a decade. Carvalho said this is the first time since 2009 that as many or more Americans have identified as pro-life as have identified as pro-choice.

The survey also found an overwhelming opposition to late-term abortions. Seventy-one percent of Americans say abortion should be generally illegal during the third trimester of pregnancy, and 71 percent strongly oppose late-term abortion after 20 weeks of gestation, approximately when babies can be delivered as preemies and survive.

Despite polling and public opinion, Democrats don’t seem to be acknowledging the warning signs, or their now “pro-life” constituents. After trying to walk back his comments, Northam doubled-down on Jan. 31, declaring “I don’t have any regrets.”

The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote today on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would protect newborns who survive botched abortions by requiring appropriate care and admission to a hospital. Earlier this month, when Sen. Ben Sasse, the author of the bill, asked for unanimous consent to the legislation, he was blocked by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. Perhaps today’s vote will once again expose just how radical the ;eft has become on abortion.

With late-term abortion sure to become a hot topic in 2020, the growing divide between radical abortion advocates and voters’ more moderate beliefs is not something the Democratic Party can ignore much longer.",New Poll Finds Americans Shift Dramatically Toward Pro-Life Label,Thefederalist.com,http://thefederalist.com/2019/02/25/new-poll-finds-americans-shift-dramatically-toward-pro-life-label/

The current government wants closer EU integration and warns of catastrophe if the country falls back into Russia’s sphere of influence.

But corruption scandals and worries over the health of its democracy have tarnished the country’s image and weakened the appeal of the pro-Western political class.

The opposition Socialist Party, which favours closer ties to Moscow, took a slight early lead at 29.5%t, with 30% of votes counted. The ruling pro-Western Democratic Party trailed with 28.8%, while an opposition bloc called ACUM, campaigning to fight entrenched corruption, was third with 22%.

A clearer picture of the final tally will emerge on Monday.

An inconclusive election or one marred by allegations of fraud could tip the country back into instability just as it has recovered from a $1 billion banking scandal in 2014 and 2015.

If the results are split, it could set the stage for weeks of coalition talks or another election.

“If no one has a parliamentary majority, I think that there will be attempts to form it, but the risk is high that it could come to a snap election in the coming few months,” President Igor Dodon told reporters.

On Saturday, Dodon, the former Socialist Party chief, called the campaign “one of the dirtiest in our entire history”. He and leading opposition figures have threatened to launch street protests and raised concerns about vote-buying.

Moldovan president hopes to cancel EU Association Agreement Moldova’s president said today (17 January) he hoped the ex-Soviet state’s Association Agreement with the European Union would be cancelled if his party obtains a parliamentary majority, paving the way for an alliance with Moscow.

“If the elections are rigged even more than they have already been rigged to this day, we will come out to protect our vote,” ACUM leader Maia Sandu said.

Poisoned politics

The campaign has already been dogged by controversy.

In the past few days alone, ACUM’s leaders said they were being poisoned on the orders of the authorities, which the Democratic Party swiftly dismissed as a “strange accusation”.

Russia’s interior ministry announced an investigation into Democratic Party leader Vladimir Plahotniuc, accusing him of involvement in organised crime, prompting Plahotniuc’s party to accuse Moscow of election meddling.

The Democratic Party had already been accused of trying to bend the electoral system in its favour by introducing changes in 2017 on how votes are cast.

Previously, Moldovans voted on party lists, but the Democratic Party introduced a mixed system of party lists and first-past-the-post constituency races, against the advice of European rights experts. The Democratic Party rejects suggestions it benefits most from the new voting system.

It has in turn accused Dodon of colluding with Russia to put the Socialists in power, which the president denies.

“Moldova has the potential for development, it’s only necessary that the authorities not be corrupt, that they should think about the people, and not only about their own pockets,” said Alexandra Ciorescu, a 72-year-old pensioner.

Believing in the future

The EU forged a deal on closer trade and political ties with Moldova in 2014 but has become increasingly critical of Chisinau’s track record on reforms.

One of Europe’s poorest countries, which is squeezed between Ukraine and EU member state Romania, Moldova plunged into crisis in 2014 and 2015 after $1 billion was pilfered from three banks.

The EU froze aid after a court struck down the victory in the Chisinau mayoral race of one of ACUM’s leaders, Andrei Nastase, on a technicality last year. The European Parliament declared it “a state captured by oligarchic interests”.

EU freezes aid to Moldova as row over mayoral election rages The European Union said on Wednesday (5 July) it had frozen a €100 million aid package to Moldova after a disputed mayoral election race in the capital Chisinau which critics say undermined the country’s democratic credentials.

Plahotniuc’s party has trumpeted the achievements of its government under Prime Minister Pavel Filip. The economy is growing, the banking system has stabilised and cooperation with the International Monetary Fund resumed.

“I believe in the future of Moldova,” Filip said after casting his vote. “We are ready to continue reforms and all social programmes, the implementation of which will change the lives of Moldovan citizens for the better.”

Dodon and the Democratic Party have clashed over issues ranging from relations with Russia to ministerial appointments. But some Moldovans suspect that the Socialists and Plahotniuc collaborate behind the scenes to carve up the state between themselves – a suggestion rejected by Dodon in a Reuters interview in January.",Moldova looks set for hung parliament as opposition threatens protests,Euractiv.com,http://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/moldova-looks-set-for-hung-parliament-as-opposition-threatens-protests/

Family vacations included tours of aerospace facilities and, on one occasion, a trip to watch a space-shuttle launch at Cape Canaveral. Laintz’s mother managed a bakery, and Laintz, the youngest child in the family, recalled enjoying a warm home life. He played soccer and football, and spent summers hunting and fishing on a ranch that his family owned in North Dakota. As a teen-ager, though, he slipped into trouble—he was arrested first for driving under the influence, and then, in his late teens, for felony car theft. He spent a year in prison, where he learned to weld, and a few more years in halfway houses. Then, in 2003, he moved to Alaska, where he joined a Christian fellowship and took seasonal jobs welding, repairing roofs, and working in a fish-processing plant. He often made good money, and his life seemed back on track. Six years later, though, when he was thirty, he returned to Colorado and, while working in a warehouse, tore a tendon in his wrist. A doctor prescribed opioids for the pain, and Laintz immediately started abusing them. Then a friend persuaded him to try heroin, and soon he was addicted. He was arrested on a charge of possession and, while out on bond, in early October of 2016, failed to show up for a court-ordered drug test. He was arrested again and booked into the Pueblo County jail. As part of the standard booking procedure, medical personnel at the jail evaluated him. Pueblo County had a contract with Correctional Health Partners, a doctor-owned, for-profit company based in Denver, to provide health services; there was a medical facility on site, supplied with basic equipment. Laintz told company nurses on duty that he used heroin and suffered from hepatitis C, an affliction common among intravenous drug users. Correctional Health staff prescribed loperamide (for diarrhea) and meclizine (for nausea and vomiting) to ease his withdrawal while he awaited sentencing, a lawyer representing Laintz said. A week later, though, according to filings in a recent lawsuit, Laintz submitted a written request for medical help, noting that he was experiencing a level of pain “so bad I don’t know what is going on,” and that he could “hardly breathe” and “hardly move.” A Correctional Health E.M.T. gave him over-the-counter medication for “possible chest pain or anxiety/panic attack.” On October 15th, a Saturday, when his mother visited, Laintz complained to her, too, of severe pain. The following Thursday, he was sentenced to ninety days in jail. When his mother returned, a week later, he told her that he was still in “rough shape,” so she called the Correctional Health unit. His father also went to speak to the county sheriff, who oversaw the jail. A physician’s assistant examined Laintz again, and found that he had low blood pressure and an elevated pulse. According to court documents, she told him to try “relaxation and breath control.” After he told deputies that he was too weak to walk to the dining hall, they allowed other inmates to bring him food in his cell. On November 1st, an administrator at Correctional Health left a voice-mail message for Laintz’s mother reporting that, according to the medical staff, “everything is pretty much normal.” He suggested that Laintz had been deliberately hyperventilating to produce his symptoms, in an attempt to be sent to the hospital. “There is no medical reason for him to go,” the administrator said, and asked her to tell her son “to quit hyperventilating and to coöperate with us.” That evening, however, a sheriff’s deputy noticed that Laintz looked pale and was having difficulty breathing. The deputy declared an emergency, but, rather than send him to a hospital, a Correctional Health physician’s assistant ordered treatment with intravenous fluids in the jail’s medical facility. When Laintz insisted on being taken to the hospital, a sergeant at the jail overruled the assistant and sent Laintz in a police car to the St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center. There, according to his lawyer, doctors diagnosed dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia, and acute renal and respiratory failure. They put him in a medically induced coma and intubated him, then had him airlifted to a hospital near Denver, where he spent a month undergoing multiple procedures, including the partial removal of a lung. He also lost part of six toes to gangrene. “It’s a weak pilot, but, if you stick with it, by Season 3 you grow completely numb to the show’s quality and just keep hitting Next Episode.” Laintz is suing the county and Correctional Health Partners for “deliberately indifferent policies.” The county declined to comment on pending litigation. In a court filing on February 12th, Correctional Health disputed Laintz’s account, saying that “at no time” did its personnel fail to “address and treat his medical needs.” Madison Barr, a spokeswoman for the company, had previously told me that she also could not comment on the lawsuit, but she pointed out that increasing numbers of people are entering jails with medical problems related to chronic conditions, such as addiction, and that, at the time of their booking, “these conditions don’t necessarily show symptoms.”

There are more than three thousand jails in the United States, usually run by sheriffs and county offices, which house some seven hundred thousand people. They are typically waiting to make bail—or, if they can’t, to go to trial or enter a plea—or are serving short sentences. Barr is right about the crisis of chronic health conditions among them. According to a study released in 2017 by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly half the people held in jails suffer from some kind of mental illness, and more than a quarter have a severe condition, such as bipolar disorder. The same year, the bureau reported that about two-thirds of sentenced jail inmates suffer from drug addiction or dependency; that number was based on data from 2007-09, so it does not take into account the recent catastrophic rise of opioid addiction. That epidemic and other public-health emergencies, in jails across the country, are being aggravated by failings in the criminal-justice system. Jails have a much higher turnover rate than prisons, where inmates generally serve long sentences. Prison wardens face their own problems, serving populations that suffer from chronic diseases and conditions related to aging, in addition to high rates of addiction and mental illness. Yet the crisis is particularly acute in jails, because large numbers of people booked into custody are in a state of distress or, like Laintz, will suffer withdrawal, which can require close monitoring and specialized treatment that jail wardens are not equipped to provide. Many jails are in rural or poor counties, where administrators complain that they have neither the resources nor the expertise to hire, train, and supervise doctors and nurses in the particular demands that their facilities require. Increasingly, they have turned to for-profit companies operating in the field known as “correctional health care,” which pledge to deliver quality care while containing costs. The growth of for-profit firms providing medical services to the incarcerated is part of a trend that started in the nineteen-eighties, during the Reagan Administration, toward privatization in the general management of correctional facilities. The trend accelerated after the passage of tough sentencing laws in the nineties—notably the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994—which caused the number of people held in jails and prisons to jump from about three hundred thousand, in 1980, to more than two million today. More than a third of that population is African-American. According to a 2018 study from the Pew Charitable Trusts, more than half the states hire private companies to provide at least some of their prison health care. There are no comprehensive statistics about the prevalence of private health-care companies in jails. But, according to the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, which accredits programs in correctional facilities around the country, about seventy per cent of the jails that it inspects outsource their medical services, and for-profit companies have a sizable share of those contracts. People held in correctional facilities are entitled to a judicially mandated standard of care, but no large-scale studies have been conducted to compare the quality of treatment provided by private companies with that provided by government-run services. The evidence available from lawsuits filed against the companies is troubling, however. With the help of Gabrialle Landsverk and Alejandra Ibarra Chaoul, postgraduate researchers at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, I reviewed complaints, depositions, and affidavits in lawsuits filed against jail operators and correctional-health-care companies. We focussed on two of the largest nationwide providers, Corizon Health, which is based in Brentwood, Tennessee, and Wellpath, which is headquartered in Nashville. The two companies have been sued about fifteen hundred times during the past five years—according to the federal and state court records that we collected—over matters including alleged neglect, malpractice, and, in dozens of cases, wrongful injury or death. (Corizon was the defendant in more than a thousand of the cases.) Most of the suits were filed pro se, or without the help of a lawyer; petitioners had legal counsel in only about a quarter of them. More than a hundred ended in settlements, but, owing to confidentiality agreements, it is often not clear whether the company or the local government made a payment, or, if so, for how much. Corizon reports that it is responsible for the care of about a hundred and eighty thousand people on a day-to-day basis. Wellpath, which until last November was known as Correct Care Solutions (the company changed its name after merging with a competitor), says that it is responsible for about two hundred and fifty thousand people on any given day. Executives from both companies told me that the lawsuits shouldn’t be seen as indicative of over-all problems with how they treat patients. Many cases involve flimsy or inconclusive evidence and don’t result in findings of liability. Donna Strugar-Fritsch, a prison-health-care consultant based in San Francisco, who advises state and local governments on providing medical services to prisoners, said that, for the companies, managing suits alleging poor treatment is “just a cost of doing business in this industry.” Patrick Cummiskey, Wellpath’s chief strategy officer, told me that the company is concerned, above all, with maintaining good health among inmates, and that it believes that providing quality care will reduce its financial risks in the long run. He also pointed out that Wellpath routinely indemnifies state and local governments from all legal costs in cases involving alleged medical mistakes. “We bear the risk of malpractice,” he said, so “we’re incentivized to provide quality care.” In some states, though, public-interest lawyers have brought class-action suits alleging inadequate health care against the entire system. In Arizona, civil-rights groups filed a class-action suit in 2012. A year later, after the state passed legislation privatizing prison health care, it signed a contract with Corizon to provide medical services in its prisons. In 2015, a federal district court, seeking to resolve the suit, approved a settlement in which the state pledged to overhaul care. But, last June, Judge David Duncan found that “widespread and systemic failures remain,” and held the state in contempt, issuing it fines of more than a million dollars. Martha Harbin, who has served as Corizon’s director of external relations, said in an e-mail that the company does “not agree with the judge’s description” of its performance in Arizona. Last month, the state, which has also disputed the judge’s finding, announced that, as of July, it is awarding the contract to another company. In December, in a case in which a federal judge is supervising a settlement designed to improve medical services at Baltimore’s city jail, the State of Maryland, which oversees the facility, said in court documents that Wexford Health Sources, the company it hired to provide the services, had failed to respond to directions to improve its performance. It had allegedly provided “unreliable” reports, and operated while “critically short of care providers and clerical staff,” leaving “key clinical and leadership positions vacant for lengthy periods.” Wexford lost the contract, though it is not a party to the litigation, and a spokesperson for the company said that it and the state “had a difference in opinion” about how to best provide health care to inmates. Taken as a whole, evidence from cases across the country suggests that four decades of policy failures in both health-care and criminal-justice reform have left a largely neglected population vulnerable and, at times, at risk, and that for-profit companies, which were promoted as a solution, have instead become an integral part of a troubled system. “Why so mopey? Not every dog has his own bowl of vodka.”

The standard of care that incarcerated people have a right to receive was established in the landmark case of Estelle v. Gamble, in 1976. J. W. Gamble was an inmate in the Huntsville Unit of the Texas prison system. On November 9, 1973, a six-hundred-pound bale of cotton fell on him while he was on work assignment in a textile mill. He complained repeatedly of severe back pain, and prison doctors gave him pain relievers, but they did not take any X-rays. After refusing to work, he was moved to solitary confinement. He filed a pro-se lawsuit, in the form of a twenty-four-page handwritten complaint, objecting to the quality of medical care he had received. A federal judge dismissed the suit, but Gamble appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which appointed Daniel K. Hedges, a corporate litigator in Houston, to represent him. Hedges never met his client, but he argued that Gamble’s treatment was unconstitutional, because of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, where Hedges again argued it. Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for an eight-to-one majority, found that “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners” was indeed inconsistent with Eighth Amendment guarantees, and ordered that Gamble’s care be reëvaluated. Gamble himself did not benefit from the ruling: after his case was returned to the Fifth Circuit, the appellate court found that his care had not been sufficiently poor to justify compensation. (A few years later, he was killed by a fellow-prisoner.) Still, practitioners of prison medicine today like to point out that, thanks to Gamble’s suit and Marshall’s opinion, the incarcerated are the only people in America with a constitutional right to health care. The Estelle decision was handed down just as the American Medical Association was leading a drive to reform health care for the incarcerated. It conducted a survey of conditions in hundreds of jails, in which operators reported dilapidated and ill-equipped facilities. Many lacked emergency medical equipment. Some didn’t even have first-aid kits. The standard of care set by Estelle was modest, calling only for an absence of “deliberate indifference.” But, building on the decision, the A.M.A. sought to establish uniform standards, which, in turn, led to the creation, in 1983, of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. Estelle also spawned a wave of civil-rights litigation seeking to enforce the Eighth Amendment protection; this gradually led to improvements in the judiciary’s definition of a required standard. Today, prisoners are typically entitled to what a judge for the First Circuit Court of Appeals defined, in 1987, as “adequate” care at a level “reasonably commensurate with modern medical science.” (The irony remains that inmates’ rights to health care have expanded, while citizens on the outside still have no universal right to care.) Litigation, though, is not always the best way to improve public policy. David Cloud, who works on prison-health-care issues for the Vera Institute, a nonprofit research group that focusses on criminal justice, told me, “I definitely don’t want to discount the importance of litigation, because it’s so critical.” Still, he added, correctional health care is more than an arena that requires legal accountability when failures occur. Its troubles affect many people beyond those who are incarcerated. Jails may hire private companies in the interest of saving taxpayer dollars. But, if people suffering from addiction or chronic illness are released back into communities without having received adequate treatment, “they’re still going to draw on taxpayers—just somewhere else.”

Companies that contract to provide health care to the incarcerated are tapping into an enormous business opportunity—annual spending now exceeds ten billion dollars—and they are obligated to their owners to seek profit. David Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project, at the American Civil Liberties Union, told me that companies therefore have compelling incentives to cut costs and staff, which can result in “denying care in what is literally a captive market.” He added, “I don’t mean to suggest that government-run prison health care is perfect. It’s often appallingly deficient. But, at least when a government is providing the service, there is some measure of oversight. There is some measure of democratic control.” Apart from the court-enforced standards that have evolved since Estelle, “you don’t have that with the private companies.” Day to day, correctional-care companies treat people on site for complaints like headaches and minor injuries. Nurses wheel carts through cellblocks to dispense over-the-counter and prescription medications; people who are sick can either call out for help or submit written requests. Nurses, nurse practitioners, physician’s assistants, and administrators typically staff jail infirmaries around the clock. In larger, urban jails, doctors, psychiatrists, and social workers may also work on site. In rural counties, they appear perhaps once or twice a week for consultations. When no doctor is present, one is usually on call to consult by telephone in emergencies. In situations requiring surgery or other complex procedures, correctional-care companies are supposed to send patients to a hospital. The companies negotiate multiyear contracts with each jail and prison that they serve. Medical staff, prescription drugs, and outside services such as hospital stays constitute the major costs. Often, the companies receive a per-diem, per-individual rate, so profits depend on holding costs below that amount. Sometimes contracts include provisions that increase a company’s potential profit if it holds down transfers to hospitals or to other outside providers. Medicare and private health-insurance companies follow similar incentives to contain costs, prioritize preventive care, and avoid unnecessary tests and procedures. But a distinct feature of correctional health care is that, if incarcerated people believe that their health—or their life—is in jeopardy, they can’t just drive themselves to an emergency room. As Fathi put it, “Market forces don’t operate in the prison context for the reason that prisoners have absolutely no consumer choice.” The potential effects that contract incentives might have on health care have featured in a number of lawsuits in recent years. One case involved a forty-four-year-old man named Kenneth McGill, who was booked into the jail in Jefferson County, Colorado, after violating probation for a D.U.I. conviction. He had been there two months when, in September of 2012, he began to experience facial drooping and dizziness—symptoms, he thought, of a stroke. He and other inmates reported his symptoms to the deputies on duty and to a nurse with Correctional Healthcare Companies, which had a contract to provide medical services at the jail. (The company has no connection to Correctional Health Partners; in 2014, it was acquired by Correct Care Solutions, the company that became Wellpath.) According to court documents, company staff waited more than twelve hours before sending McGill to a hospital. Doctors there determined that he had had a stroke—he says that he still suffers from vertigo and from a loss of mobility in his right arm—and he sued the company. Anna Holland Edwards, one of McGill’s attorneys, told me that, at the trial, she and her colleagues pointed to a provision in Correctional Healthcare’s contract which stipulated that the company had to pay the first fifty thousand dollars in costs when an inmate went to the hospital. “There’s nothing wrong with being a for-profit company,” she said in her closing argument. “But the intersection of profit and health care has its problems.” She continued, “The company gets to decide whether the care is provided and know that they’re the ones that have to pay for it when it is.” (A spokesperson for the county later disputed that its contract with Correctional Healthcare discouraged hospitalization.) The jury awarded McGill eleven million dollars, including more than seven million in punitive damages against Correctional Healthcare. The parties then settled for an undisclosed amount. David Perry, Wellpath’s chief legal officer, said that Correctional Healthcare’s “way of doing things was different in some respects from ours.” But he also argued that provisions requiring companies to pay for off-site costs, though common, don’t encourage cost-cutting, because, if a company fails to provide quality services, “eventually your clients will hold you accountable for it.” Martha Harbin, of Corizon Health, told me that maximizing on-site care “respects the taxpayer dollars used to pay for correctional health care,” and reduces the risk of people escaping from hospitals. (Escapes from hospitals are, in fact, a recurring problem.) But, she said, “we don’t hesitate to send people off site if the evidence points to that need. If they have to go, they have to go.”

Many of the nurses and doctors I spoke with who work in jails described their careers as a moral calling. They serve people on the margins of society: it is not unusual for them to encounter patients who haven’t visited a doctor in years. Ned Higgins, a psychiatrist in South Carolina who has worked on contract for Wellpath, told me that he finds working in county jails inspirational. “We’re helping the seriously mentally ill,” he said. “The vast majority of inmates, patients, that I see were off their medicine when they got arrested. I see our mission as to get them back on their medicine and get them off street drugs. I think we do that very well.” Specialists in the field agree. “People really are trying to provide high-quality health care, and jail environments are really tough,” Brent Gibson, a physician who is the chief health officer of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, said. “Nobody wants a bad health-care outcome.” Still, a significant amount of the serious neglect documented in lawsuits arises from the fact that jails have become a primary provider of medical care for the severely mentally ill. Rhonda Levand was confronted with the sometimes harsh consequences of that reality in the case of her daughter, Raynbow Gignilliat. In 1992, when Gignilliat was seventeen and in her junior year of high school, in Marietta, Georgia, she was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Eventually, she graduated from college, got married, had three sons, and worked as a paralegal, a substitute teacher, and a freelance writer. She didn’t always take her medications, Levand told me, and “every year she would go through a little cycle where she was a little bit manic.” But then she would right herself. In 2013, Gignilliat and her husband divorced, which seemed to trigger a new crisis for her and led to a number of short hospital stays. Levand by then was living near Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she now works as a paraprofessional special-education teacher and a receptionist. That October, she invited her daughter to stay with her. Gignilliat had never been violent with her before, Levand said, but on October 27th she started “pushing and shoving” her, and upending furniture and breaking things in the house. Levand called the police, and Gignilliat was arrested for aggravated battery and property damage, and was taken to the Sandoval County Detention Center. The health services at the jail were provided by Correctional Healthcare, the company that was later acquired by Wellpath. Medical staff noted that Gignilliat had mental-health needs, but she refused to take medication. “If they don’t consent to take the medicine, they don’t force them,” Levand told me. In fact, neither the company nor the jail had legal authority to do so; in New Mexico, such action requires state-court approval. Medical or jail staff could have petitioned a judge to name a “treatment guardian” for Gignilliat, but did not. Levand could have petitioned, too, but says she didn’t know that this was an option. After a social worker referred Gignilliat to a physician’s assistant for psychiatric evaluation, corrections officers placed her in a segregated cell, according to a legal complaint. She was allowed to leave it only to take a shower or to consult with a social worker or with medical staff; some days, she refused a shower and did not leave her cell at all. By mid-December, she had become deeply delusional, and the warden finally transferred her to the emergency room at the University of New Mexico Hospital. A doctor there diagnosed bipolar disorder and psychosis, treated her with anti-anxiety medication, and persuaded her to eat—according to Levand, she had lost about twenty pounds. She was then sent back to jail, where she again went unmedicated. Two weeks later, Gignilliat was transferred to the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute. Staff there obtained a court-appointed treatment guardianship, and, in late January of 2014, she was administered medication, and her condition stabilized. At the end of March, the district attorney dropped the criminal charges against her, and she went back to Georgia. Photographs taken there show her smiling as she embraces her children. Yet, on June 12th, she swallowed a fatal dose of pills; she died two days later, at the age of thirty-nine. The next month, Levand filed suit on behalf of Gignilliat’s children. Sandoval County and Wellpath, which inherited the liabilities in the case from Correctional Healthcare, said that, since Gignilliat’s suicide took place more than two months after she was released, they bore no responsibility. However, court papers filed by Levand describe starkly the daily suffering that her daughter endured while in segregation. Ultimately, the county and the company agreed to a confidential financial settlement. David Perry said that Wellpath rarely pursues jury trials, because “it is very expensive to litigate cases, notwithstanding how justified you believe your position to be.”

The situation that Gignilliat encountered is not uncommon: few local jails have dedicated mental-health facilities, and operators often resort to managing people by placing them in segregation. Yet even in jails that do provide dedicated care the quality can be poor. In the summer of 2013, Bradley Ballard was detained in New York City’s jail on Rikers Island for a parole violation. He was thirty-nine years old and suffered from diabetes, but he had previously received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and was assigned to the mental-health unit. Under a contract signed with the city in 2001, Corizon Health shared responsibility for medical services at Rikers and oversaw the mental-health facility. In September, according to a legal complaint, Ballard was moved to solitary confinement, after dancing provocatively in front of a female corrections officer. For six days, medical personnel and jail guards looked in on him, but did not offer him any assistance. He was then discovered lying naked and covered in his own waste. He had mutilated his genitals, and died hours after being found, from sepsis and diabetic ketoacidosis. In 2014, civil-rights lawyers filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ballard’s mother and his estate. The New York State Commission of Correction, in reviewing the case, said that the performance of the company and of the city’s Department of Corrections was so “incompetent and inadequate as to shock the conscience.” The city paid nearly six million dollars, reportedly the largest settlement involving the death of an inmate in the city’s custody. (Corizon did not contribute any of the funds, because, according to Martha Harbin, the contract stipulated that the city would bear financial responsibility for all malpractice claims.) Corizon’s contract expired at the end of 2015, and it was not renewed. A group of New York-based nonprofit health-care providers has since taken over the provision of medical services at Rikers. The Department of Corrections Commissioner, Cynthia Brann, said in a statement that, with the new arrangement, the city has “taken major steps to overhaul the delivery of healthcare in our jails.” Both jail operators and private health-care companies recognize that it would be better to treat mentally ill people, especially those who are nonviolent, in specialized hospitals or in dedicated units in jails. But building those facilities and hiring counsellors and psychiatrists to staff them requires government funding that many operators don’t have. There are “never enough beds” to accommodate such cases, Patrick Cummiskey, of Wellpath, told me. Jails are “absolutely the wrong place” to treat mental illness, he said, yet they “have become the largest mental-health provider in most communities.” David Perry said that Wellpath no longer bids on contracts in counties where there is a “disproportionate number of mental-health cases” and inadequate local resources to handle them. “We don’t get involved,” he said. “You’re just setting yourself up for this problem.” Poor care for mentally ill prisoners, he added, reflects taxpayers’ unwillingness to fund dedicated facilities and programs, not “our company’s quality.”

Opioid addiction, too, is an area in which jail health care is increasingly relied on by default. Last year, according to a preliminary estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than seventy-two thousand people died from overdoses—almost two hundred people a day. The C.D.C. has also reported that overdoses now constitute the leading cause of death among Americans under the age of fifty. And many people suffering from addiction pass through jails on charges related to their habit. Madaline Pitkin was one of them. She grew up in Portland, Oregon, and attended Catholic school, where she was a good student. She was “very spirited,” her father, Russell Pitkin, told me. “She was always into competition and sports and was always trying to improve herself.” She enrolled at the University of Oregon, but wasn’t happy there, so she switched, for a time, to Portland Community College. According to the Oregonian, which ran a series of articles on her case, she sometimes paid her bills by working as a barista or, at Christmas, as one of Santa’s elves. At some point in her twenties, she drifted into heroin addiction, and, in April of 2014, she was arrested on a warrant for an earlier arrest and for possession. During her booking at the Washington County jail, which, until May of 2015, had a contract with Corizon Health, she told a nurse that she used a gram of heroin a day. A week later, at the age of twenty-six, she died of dehydration, after vomiting and suffering diarrhea as she went through withdrawal. Company personnel allegedly failed to provide an I.V. to keep her hydrated, and did not respond adequately to her four handwritten pleas for help. In her final request, on April 23rd, she wrote, “I haven’t been able to keep food, liquids, meds down in six days. I feel like I am very close to death. . . . Please help me.” Last December, a federal judge approved a ten-million-dollar judgment against Corizon and Washington County for Pitkin’s family, the largest known amount that the company has been ordered to pay. (Corizon had fully indemnified the county.) Steve Rector, who became Corizon’s C.E.O. last year, said in a statement, “The lessons we’ve learned from this case have been catalysts for significant changes we have made and are still making to our clinical program.” The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said that Pitkin’s death was a “tragedy,” and that it has reformed health care at the jail, with a new private company. Nancy Fishman, a criminal-justice policy expert at the Vera Institute, told me that “every sort of convocation of sheriffs or jail administrators or law enforcement” these days is consumed by the opioid crisis and its impact on jail health care. She added, “There’s just a sort of general sense that we’re being overwhelmed, and we don’t know what to do.” Brent Gibson, of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, said that “not everyone accepts that substance abuse is a chronic disease.” Some jails treat addiction as a “moral problem,” and treat opioid withdrawal only with drugs that alleviate its symptoms. In other jurisdictions, sheriffs and administrators do follow the recommendations of public-health advocates who argue that the best way to defeat addiction is to guide people toward long-term treatment, with access to methadone or to similar drugs that can allow them to either safely maintain their opioid use or gradually reduce and cease it. The National Commission recommends that prisons and jails adopt a comprehensive treatment plan that includes medications to ease withdrawal and others, such as buprenorphine, that safely satisfy cravings for drugs. The commission also advises psychological counselling and in-detention meetings with recovery groups, such as Narcotics Anonymous. But the resources to support such public-health approaches are small in comparison with the vast sums spent on jails and prisons themselves. David Cloud, of the Vera Institute, said that many rural and poor counties “don’t even have medications or treatment providers in the community” to address opioid addiction, let alone in their jails.

On August 18, 2016, Sally Yates, then the Deputy Attorney General in the Obama Administration, released a memorandum directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to begin “the process of reducing—and ultimately ending—our use of privately operated prisons.” The memorandum did not address for-profit correctional-health-care companies directly, but it was the boldest turn away from the country’s partially privatized incarceration system in decades. The Presidential election was less than three months away, and Hillary Clinton, who was then leading Donald Trump comfortably in most polls, tweeted her support, suggesting that the order would stand if she won the White House. The share prices of the country’s two largest private-prison builders and operators, GEO Group and Corrections Corporation of America (since renamed CoreCivic), fell by nearly forty per cent in a single day. After Trump was inaugurated, one of the first acts of his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, was to rescind the Yates order. (After the election, according to the Washington Post, GEO hired two people who had worked in Sessions’s Senate office to lobby for the company’s interests.) Opponents of privatized detention have argued, on philosophical and constitutional grounds, that certain governmental powers—such as those to wage war, to use lethal force in the name of the law, and to hold people in detention—should not be hired out to profit-seekers. Yates’s decision was made on a more pragmatic basis: drawing on the findings of a study produced earlier that August by the Justice Department’s Inspector General, she asserted that the government is better at running prisons than corporations are. Private companies, she wrote, “simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs,” and “they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.” “Could you dig your knees into the back of my seat a little higher and to the left?” The concurrent rise of for-profit health care in jails and prisons has not been accompanied by the kind of public debate, congressional scrutiny, or scholarly research that has informed other fields of health policy. Yet there are notable public and nonprofit alternatives. In some European Union countries, where universal access to health care is fully established, prison and jail health care is often administered by state health services. In the Netherlands, for example, a specialized public service treats prisoners on the basis of an “equivalence principle,” meaning that the care provided should be the same as if they were free citizens. In this country, some physicians and health-care specialists advocate for greater investment in community treatment centers—residential and nonresidential facilities that seek to treat and stabilize individuals suffering from addiction or mental illness through medication, peer counselling, and social services, and where nonviolent offenders suffering from these conditions might be directed, as an alternative to jail. Other practitioners argue that prison health services in the United States work best when they are provided by nonprofits that also deliver medical services for the general population (as is now the case in New York City). Since the late nineteen-eighties, four states—Texas, Georgia, New Jersey, and Connecticut—have contracted prison medical services to their state university systems, whose facilities also serve the public. Newton Kendig, a physician specializing in infectious diseases and a clinical professor of medicine at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., has spent most of his career overseeing health care in prisons. He told me that contracting with public universities has advantages—for example, specialists on a medical-school faculty can consult on prisoners’ cases. The University of Texas has pioneered the use of telemedicine, or videoconferencing, to treat the incarcerated. But the university model hasn’t always succeeded. Last July, after a woman gave birth in her cell at the York Correctional Institution, in Niantic, Connecticut, where health care was overseen by the University of Connecticut, and where there had been other complaints about care, officials transferred responsibility for prisoner health care statewide back to the state corrections agency. I met Kendig last summer in his office at George Washington’s medical school, where he is currently leading an initiative to draw on academic medical expertise to improve health care for inmates. Now in his early sixties, he told me that he had chosen to practice in correctional health because he “wanted to care for at-risk populations.” He served as the director of medicine for Maryland’s correctional facilities, and then, in 1996, he joined the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is overseen by the Surgeon General. After twenty years of service, he retired as a rear admiral and an Assistant Surgeon General. The Commissioned Corps is another public model that might be adapted to provide an alternative to privatization. It is a uniformed medical civil service of more than six thousand physicians, public-health specialists, and other professionals. Among other duties, members design and manage medical and mental-health programs for federal prisoners. They also work for the C.D.C., to monitor and respond to epidemics, and provide medical expertise during emergencies, such as hurricanes. Kendig told me that the corps’s public-service mission, the opportunity it provides to work for diverse federal agencies, and its generous government pensions have helped it to recruit and retain talented personnel devoted to prison health care, which is, as he put it, a “highly structured and paramilitary environment” that requires a “special person” to embrace it for a career. “The advantage of the public model is that public service gives you stability,” he continued. “The turnover in the private sector is very high.” However, the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have proved hostile to expansions of publicly funded medical services. Last year, the Administration, as part of its drive to reduce nonmilitary federal spending, proposed cutting the corps’s budget by forty per cent.

There are, nevertheless, signs that the country is moving toward a new consensus on criminal-justice reform. That includes support within the Republican Party for public policies that may improve medical services for the incarcerated. A major advancement in the field was reached in May of last year, when the Texas state legislature passed the Sandra Bland Act. On July 10, 2015, Bland, a twenty-eight-year-old African-American woman, was stopped in her car by a police officer in Waller County, northwest of Houston, for failing to signal a lane change. In an encounter captured by the officer’s dashboard camera, Bland argued with him, and he escalated the confrontation, finally pulling out a Taser and shouting, “I will light you up!” He arrested her and booked her into the county jail. During her processing, Bland said that she had attempted suicide earlier that year, following a miscarriage. Three days later, she hanged herself in her cell. A grand jury indicted the officer on a perjury charge, but prosecutors dropped it in exchange for his agreement to never again work as a policeman. Bland’s family reached a settlement with the county, which reportedly paid close to two million dollars. The law enacted in her name requires authorities to make a “good-faith effort” to divert anyone who is arrested and is suffering from acute mental illness or addiction away from jail and into treatment, particularly if the illness or addiction is related to the reason that the person was arrested. The “good-faith” standard for sheriffs and jail operators is a soft one, but lawmakers have created incentives for judges to grant bail to the afflicted, and have provided ninety-two million dollars in new funding for mental-health services and monitoring of people judged to be suicide risks. The Bland Act was introduced by Democrats, but, after some police-reform measures were removed, it passed unanimously in the Republican-led legislature, and was signed by Governor Greg Abbott, a conservative Republican. That bipartisan support reinforced what I heard from sheriffs and jail-health specialists elsewhere: that the effort to address the unnecessary suffering and loss of life caused by inadequate mental-health and addiction treatment must transcend the current polarization of national politics. Health care isn’t the only sector of criminal-justice reform in which cross-party coalitions have formed. In December, President Trump signed the First Step Act, which passed in the Senate in a vote of eighty-seven to twelve, and which the House of Representatives approved in a vote of three hundred and sixty to fifty-nine. Among other things, the law is intended to reduce the nation’s incarceration rates by lowering mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Kenneth L. Favier, a theologian and a public-health specialist, argues in his 2017 book, “Humane Health Care for Prisoners,” that a “radical revision” of the criminal-justice and mental-health systems is needed, to transfer “large numbers” of people suffering from mental illness “into community treatment settings as well as prevent such persons from being arrested and incarcerated in the first place.” Historically, sweeping changes in civil rights have occurred only after a moral awakening among at least a vocal minority of the public. So far, the articulation of a better ethic of prison medicine is mostly consigned to a small body of specialized literature, including Favier’s book. His core principle succinctly echoes European policies and standards, as well as the standards advocated in civil-rights lawsuits since Estelle v. Gamble. He writes that, except for “understandable and acceptable” constraints required for the administration of safe custody, “it should not matter that one is a prisoner.”",The Jail Health-Care Crisis,Newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/04/the-jail-health-care-crisis

Over the past week, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro spoke of the need for the U.S. government to reckon with and make up for centuries of stolen labor and legal oppression. But instead of backing the direct compensation of African-Americans for the legacy of slavery, the Democratic candidates are talking about using tax credits and other subsidies.

Long defined as some type of direct payment to former slaves and their descendants, the shifting definition of reparations comes as White House hopefuls seek to solidify their ties with African-Americans whose support will be crucial to winning the Democratic nomination. But it risks prompting both withering criticism from Republicans and a shrug from black voters and activists if the proposals are seen as an empty gesture that simply renames existing policy ideas as reparations.

""Universal programs are not specific to the injustices that have been inflicted on African-Americans,"" said Duke University economist William Darity, a veteran advocate of reparations. ""I want to be sure that whatever is proposed and potentially enacted as a reparations program really is a substantive and dramatic intervention in the patterns of racial wealth inequality in the United States — not something superficial or minor that is labeled as reparations and then politicians say the national responsibility has been met.""

Montague Simmons of the Movement for Black Lives, which has pushed for reparations, said the debate is ""not just cash payments.""

But ""unless we're talking about something that has to be systemic and transfers power to the community, it's not likely going to be what we would consider reparations,"" she said.

For now, that's not how most Democratic presidential contenders are talking about reparations.

Harris has proposed monthly payments to qualified citizens of any race in the form of a tax credit. Warren has called for universal child care that would guarantee the benefit from birth until a child enters school. Families with income less than 200 percent of the poverty line would get free access and others would pay no more than 7 percent of their income.

Those benefits would likely have a disproportionate impact on African-Americans. But except for longshot candidate Marianne Williamson, no Democratic White House hopeful has called for financial remuneration for blacks.

Harris told reporters in Iowa on Sunday that ""we have to all acknowledge that people have not started out on the same base and have not had equal opportunities to success.""

Castro told The Root, a black online news site, that America ""would be better off"" if the government addressed the issue of reparations, which he said he would explore if elected.

And in New Hampshire on Friday, Warren said the U.S. needs to confront its ""ugly history of racism"" and ""talk about the right way to address it."" Asked whether she would support reparations for Native Americans, she responded: ""It's an important part of the conversation.""

Warren has been criticized for claiming Native American identity early in her career and apologized recently to the Cherokee Nation for releasing DNA test results as evidence she had Native American in her bloodline, albeit at least six generations back.

In terms of a direct payment, reparations could be a tough political sell. In a Point Taken-Marist poll conducted in 2016, 68 percent of Americans said the country should not pay cash reparations to African-American descendants of slaves. About 8 in 10 white Americans said they were opposed to reparations, while about 6 in 10 black Americans said they were in favor.

Republican strategist Whit Ayres said the issue of reparations is ""symptomatic of the fundamental debate that is roiling the Democratic Party today.""

""There is no doubt that issues of race have been and remain critically important in American society,"" he said. ""But the idea that you resolve those issues by taking money from white people and giving it to black people will make race relations worse, not better. Republicans would love to have that debate.""

Pressed on ""Fox News Sunday"" on whether reparations would ultimately end up in the Democratic platform, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the issue is ""something that will be discussed during the course of the presidential nominating process.""

Even if Democrats are rethinking the definition of reparations, Ta-Nehisi Coates, who sparked a national debate over the issue with a 2014 essay in The Atlantic, said the recent chatter is promising. He noted that a Dave Chappelle comedy skit mocked the idea in 2003.

""It has generally been dismissed as utter lunacy,"" Coates said. ""It's not being mocked now. Step one is to get people to stop laughing.""

When Barack Obama ran to become the nation's first African-American president, he opposed reparations. But in an interview with Coates in the final days of his presidency, he didn't question the legitimacy of the concept.

""Theoretically, you can make, obviously, a powerful argument that centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps,"" Obama said, referencing the racial disparities faced by black Americans today.

155,Empty,2019-02-25T14:46:09Z,Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wants Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to appear as a witness at the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"The Trudeau government issued a broad waiver on Monday allowing former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell the Commons justice committee details of her conversations with government officials about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an order-in-council (OIC) posted online, the government says Wilson-Raybould — ""and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin"" — can report to the committee and to the federal ethics commissioner any cabinet confidences ""in any information or communications that were directly discussed with her respecting the exercise of that authority while she held that office.""

The OIC also ""waives ... to the extent they apply, solicitor-client privilege and any other relevant duty of confidentiality to the Government of Canada"" regarding what Wilson-Raybould discussed with other government officials as justice minister ""respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin while she held that office.""

The waiver does not extend, however, to any communications between Wilson-Raybould and the director of public prosecutions on SNC-Lavalin while she was justice minister — ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" says the text of the order.

The order sets the stage for what could be an extraordinary session of the justice committee. Wilson-Raybould was expected to speak before the committee this week; a time has not yet been set for her appearance.

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya — and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet entirely on Feb. 12. She's offered no comment since on the SNC-Lavalin affair or the company's attempts to secure a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution, arguing that she's still bound by solicitor-client confidentiality from her time as federal attorney general.

The OIC clears a few things up in advance of Wilson-Raybould's appearance before the committee. The ex-minister, who said she is ""anxious"" to testify before the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, wrote to committee chair Liberal MP Anthony Housefather today saying it would be useful for the committee to have an ""authoritative statement"" on the scope of what she can say prior to her appearance.

""I am anxious to appear at the first available time,"" she wrote. ""However, I believe that in advance of my appearance the members of the committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.""

Wilson-Raybould, who has retained retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell as counsel, also requested an extended period of 30 minutes to make an opening statement to the committee.

Under pressure to waive solicitor-client privilege for his former justice minister and attorney general, Trudeau said earlier today Wilson-Raybould would be given leeway to speak.

Earlier today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to testify at the committee, insisting Canadians should be outraged by the allegations of political interference in a criminal case.

A motion tabled by the Conservatives said Trudeau should be called to answer questions given his ""alleged direct involvement in a sustained effort to influence SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution."" It called on the prime minister to appear at a two-hour televised committee under oath sometime before Mar. 15.

The motion was defeated in the Commons this evening.

During a news conference on Parliament Hill Monday, Scheer described the SNC-Lavalin affair as an unprecedented attempt to alter the course of justice through political interference.

""Politicians don't get to execute our justice system,"" he said.

""What we've seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption, with those at the very top of the Prime Minister's Office implicated in what could be the obstruction of justice.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer outlines the motion he will introduce calling on the Prime Minister to appear before the Justice Committee . 1:25

It's rare for a prime minister to appear before a committee.

On Sept. 7, 2006, then-prime minister Stephen Harper appeared before a special committee on Senate reform.

Former prime ministers have occasionally appeared before Commons committee hearings. Former prime minister Paul Martin appeared before a committee on the Kelowna Accord on Nov. 9, 2006 and Brian Mulroney spoke before a committee looking into the Airbus settlement on Dec. 13, 2007.

Last week, Canada's top civil servant Michael Wernick told the justice committee that he warned Wilson-Raybould that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Trudeau said Friday that Wernick is an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council,"" the PM said. ""His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

In September 2018, the government amended the Criminal Code to allow for remediation agreements, enabling prosecutors to use them as an alternative to a criminal trial ""at their discretion to address specified economic crimes if they consider it to be in the public interest and appropriate in the circumstances,"" according to the Department of Justice website.

If the accused organization upholds the terms and conditions of the agreement, charges can be stayed and a criminal prosecution avoided.

Shawcross doctrine

According to the government website, the purpose of remediation agreements is to denounce wrongdoing and hold the organization to account, while reducing harm to innocent employees, shareholders and other third parties. The organization would have to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing and pay a financial penalty.

In the case of SNC-Lavalin, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada opted not to pursue a remediation agreement and chose instead to proceed with prosecution. It advised the company of that decision on Sept. 4, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould, as attorney general at the time, had authority to override the decision and halt prosecution. Wernick confirmed last week several meetings were held on the topic — including a telephone call on Dec. 19 he initiated, during which he warned Wilson-Raybould of the economic consequences of prosecuting a company that employs about 9,000 people.

He insisted there was never ""inappropriate"" interference.

According to the so-called Shawcross doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Delay advising investors

Arguing in favour of calling Trudeau to speak to the committee, Conservative justice critic and deputy leader Lisa Raitt said it's in the public interest to have the prime minister testify in order to bring together the various threads of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Raitt also asked why SNC-Lavalin was told of the prosecutor's decision on Sept. 4 but didn't disclose that information to its shareholders until Oct. 10.

""Who in the Prime Minister's Office, what cabinet minister, or even did the prime minister give assurances to SNC-Lavalin that they would not have to disclose a material fact to their shareholders because they were going to sort it all out?"" she asked.

Five legal experts appeared before the committee today; some couched their comments by saying they don't have all the facts yet.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond is a senior associate counsel at Woodward and Company LLP and a professor at the Peter Allard School of Law, University of British Columbia. She told the committee the law imposes limits on anyone trying to influence an attorney general acting in the role of chief prosecutor.

'Crisis' in rule of law

""Those engaging in that must point to lawful authority that actually backs up their actions, and I would say the Shawcross doctrine is a flimsy authority,"" she said.

Turpel-Lafond said she believes it's important to hear from all of those involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair, not just Wilson-Raybould, because the situation is escalating to the level of a ""crisis in the rule of law.""

She said the RCMP integrity unit could investigate the matter — if it isn't doing so already — to determine if there was a ""subtext"" to the discussions between various officials and Wilson-Raybould regarding the criminal prosecution.

""If there's evidence that a prosecutor is fired and there was an attempt to influence or direct her attention to something that didn't have lawful authority, then it does raise the spectre of obstruction of justice, because obstruction of justice requires this sort of fear-favour element,"" she said.

Maxime St-Hilaire, associate professor at the Faculty of Law, Université de Sherbrooke, said he finds it difficult to understand how information conveyed to an attorney general would be useful after a decision had been made to not overturn a prosecution.

""If there are cabinet discussions after that decision has been made, then I find that quite difficult to understand,"" he said.

Wendy Berman, lawyer and partner at Cassels Brock and Blackwell, explained the role of remediation agreements, noting they can take several years and are meant to prevent situations where companies might ""wither away"" and cause collateral damage.",Scheer wants Trudeau to testify on SNC-Lavalin affair,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-snc-lavalin-trudeau-1.5032214
156,Empty,2019-02-25T23:29:00Z,"Jody Wilson-Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react as the politically damaging affair grinds on, and that’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, Susan Delacourt writes.","Or is it? While Jody Wilson-Raybould’s split with the Prime Minister’s Office is not apparently linked to any leadership ambitions, it is abundantly clear now that the former justice minister is driving the bus in this whole saga over SNC-Lavalin .

Once again, without uttering a word about the specific grievances, Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react. Last week, she managed to get a hearing from cabinet and caucus — and this of course came after the resignation of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

On Monday, on the eve of her much-anticipated appearance at the Commons justice committee, Raybould demurred, issuing instead a long letter setting out the conditions under which she intended to speak.

So while Wilson-Raybould is not the leader or even a would-be leader of her party, she definitely has forced Liberals to follow her — if only to try to anticipate her next move.

That’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, new to cabinet and government a little over three years ago and a relative newcomer to the Liberal party.

When Lucien Bouchard left Brian Mulroney’s cabinet in 1990, that Conservative government carried on without him. Ditto for Paul Martin’s exit from Jean Chretien’s cabinet in 2003. Damage was done in both cases, certainly in the long term, but neither prime minister seemed overly concerned with keeping the departed minister in the fold.

In fact, it’s difficult to remember any other politician who retained the power to keep dictating rules of engagement to a Prime Minister’s Office after leaving cabinet.

Trudeau’s reaction to this whole saga has been curious. For several days after the story of Wilson-Raybould’s grievances about SNC-Lavalin first broke in The Globe and Mail earlier this month, the prime minister did not speak to her.

Then he spoke to her a couple of times in Vancouver and seemed to be confident she would stay in cabinet — until she quit, hours later. He apologized to her behind the closed door of the cabinet room last Wednesday, only to have her stand up in the Commons and warn that she was waiting a chance to “speak my truth.”

Late last year, Trudeau was asked in one of his year-end interviews to sum up U.S. President Donald Trump in a word. “Unpredictable,” Trudeau replied, which summed up a lot of things, especially his disciplined silence in the face of Trump’s trade-related tantrum after the G-7 meeting in Charlevoix last June.

In the end, Canada and the U.S. did end up signing a new trade deal a few months later and Trump stopped calling Trudeau and Canada names on his angry Twitter feeds.

Trump’s unpredictability isn’t Trudeau’s biggest problem now — Wilson-Raybould’s is. But when you think about it, the prime minister is handling them the same way, which is probably a mistake.

Trudeau’s strategy on Trump, distilled to its essence, was basically this: say nothing, don’t rise to the bait and fan out to seek allies and experts while the situation cools down. A similar strategy seems to be under way now, inasmuch as the Trudeau government’s response can be called a strategy.

But Wilson-Raybould’s disaffection with Trudeau and how she’s been treated is looking far more methodical than Trump’s episodic outrage of last year.

What’s more, in Trump’s case, Trudeau could count on most of Canada to be on his side. With some exceptions, Canadians were more likely to stick up for their prime minister in any battle with the unpredictable Trump.

This confident streak — maybe overconfident streak — is at the nub of the Wilson-Raybould saga now. It is striking to see the ways in which Trudeau and his team have just left the slate blank in this whole tale, banking on the conviction that Canadians will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Each day in the Commons, this is basically what Trudeau says — that Canadians know his government is balancing concern for jobs and the law. “Trust us,” he says, while the government fans out, looking for experts and allies to attest to Trudeau’s integrity and hoping that the mess will go away.

Sometimes scandals do blow themselves out; sometimes ministers — or angry presidents — just go away, and governments carry on in their absence.

Nothing in this nearly three-week-old saga over Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin gives any indication of following that pattern. Trudeau and his government aren’t leading themselves out of the controversy — they’re following and reacting — and Wilson-Raybould is doing the leading.

157,Empty,2019-02-25T21:13:47Z,"Former justice minister says she is “anxious to appear at the first available time,” but remains constrained by what she say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and ongoing cases still before the courts.","“It may well be that we have a situation where we have a prosecutor that was removed from her role, as opposed to an attorney general that should have resigned,” Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former Saskatchewan provincial court judge, told the Commons justice committee.

OTTAWA—Discussions the Prime Minister’s Office had with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould about criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin are “troubling,” lack a strong legal justification and may have led to her being “fired,” a respected jurist said Monday.

The director of public prosecutions decided last fall to proceed with criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin, rejecting the company’s request for a remediation agreement that would have spared it a conviction and, with it, a 10-year ban on government contracts.

“Perhaps this is an instance where a prosecutor was actually fired for establishing a boundary that was not popular or accepted. I’m not sure of that. I think there is some suspicion and concern here about that.”

“In fact, prosecutors should not resign. Lead prosecutors, when they’ve taken a decision, should hold firm to their position and that is consistent with the rule of law,” Turpel-Lafond said.

Now those interventions are in the spotlight amid questions whether lines were crossed.

Wilson-Raybould appears to have stuck by that decision in the face of meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s senior aides and the top civil servant, despite concerns about the future of the Quebec company if the charges went ahead.

Turpel-Lafond, who currently practises law and teaches in Victoria, expressed serious doubts about the government’s claim — articulated by Wilson-Raybould’s successor, David Lametti, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Liberal MPs — that officials are permitted to hold robust discussions with an attorney general under the so-called Shawcross Doctrine.

Once a decision is made to pursue a prosecution, there is “limited authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point and going forward,” Turpel-Lafond said.

She said if the talks went beyond a “more passive and respectful approach,” and the purpose “was to persuade the attorney general as prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern.”

And she cast doubt on Lametti’s and Wernick’s assertions that the decision to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin is one that still remains open to the attorney general, even with the preliminary inquiry underway.

She said there should be a “full” airing of what was said to Wilson-Raybould, adding it would be something she’d expect the RCMP’s sensitive investigations or “integrity” section would already be looking into.

Two other legal experts agreed that the Shawcross Doctrine — a concept imported from the United Kingdom — does not justify any pressure put on an attorney general to make or change a prosecutorial decision.

That decision, they said, is the attorney general’s alone to make.

“The attorney general should not be put under pressure by colleagues and in particular should not be put under partisan political pressure,” said Mary Condon, interim dean of Osgoode Hall Law School.

Maxime St-Hilaire, an associate law professor at the University of Sherbrooke, said the clear line would be better drawn if Canada’s attorney general did not also serve as justice minister inside a federal cabinet.

Trudeau told the House of Commons he would partially lift confidentiality obligations on his former attorney general so she can testify about allegations that his office was at the centre of what the Opposition says was a “sustained effort” to influence the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Under fire in the House for weeks, Trudeau told question period Monday that Wilson-Raybould would be able to appear at the justice committee and “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

Monday night, the Trudeau cabinet issued an order-in-council waiving cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould for discussions she had on SNC-Lavalin, clearing the way for her testimony to the committee.

However, “in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,” the waiver did not extend to communications Wilson-Raybould had with Kathleen Roussel, director of public prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin.

It was not entirely clear when her long-awaited appearance will be scheduled, as her expected appearance Tuesday was postponed.

In a letter sent earlier Monday to the committee, Wilson-Raybould stated that she is “anxious to appear at the first available time.”

But she said that she remained constrained by what she can say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and the ongoing cases involving SNC-Lavalin still before the courts.

“The government can waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence. I cannot, Wilson-Raybould said in her letter to Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, chair of the committee.

She said she wants to delay her testimony until “we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.”

When she does appear, Wilson-Raybould said she wants to make an extended opening statement of about 30 minutes to provide “my best recollection of all relevant communications.”

Trudeau has denied he or anyone in his office applied any inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She has not yet spoken publicly to confirm or deny the allegation, saying she is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Late Monday, the Commons voted 155-106 against compelling Trudeau to testify before the committee, as the Conservative and NDP opposition wanted.

The prime minister again defended his actions, telling the Commons that “at every stage,” his government did what it promised Canadians, to stand up for jobs and growth while protecting the rule of law and the independence of the justice system.

“We’ve consistently and continually stood up for the 9,000 jobs at SNC-Lavalin and good jobs right across the country,” Trudeau said.

“That’s exactly what we’ll continue to do and we will continue to do it in a way that ... always respects the rules and norms that govern our institutions.”

SNC-Lavalin and two former employees were charged in 2015 under the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act with one count of bribing former members of the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi, and one count of fraud under the Criminal Code.

The scandal, over whether the prime minister’s office pressured its justice ministry to help a Quebec firm facing fraud charges, has consumed the nation for the past two weeks. Each detail that has dripped into the public domain has generated multiple opinion columns and dominated airwaves.

Part of that scrutiny owes to the federal electoral season – with the opposition seizing on any whiff of Mr. Trudeau tainting the rule of law as the nation heads to the polls this fall. But it’s also captured public attention because it seems to stand in opposition to everything that Trudeau, and the Canada he represents, stands for: a respite to the pressures squeezing the rule of law, human rights, and liberal values in the rest of the world.

Recommended: Bring on the ice and snow: Ottawa’s Winterlude celebrates a frozen north

When Trudeau was propelled into power, it was his brand as a fresh and youthful face, positive politics, and a new and more transparent way of governance that drew the electorate to him. While more than three years of decisionmaking at the top has necessarily damaged his “real change” brand, he remains a beacon for many middle-power countries in the world, especially as the United States under President Trump has put into question the American commitment to a rules-based, international order.

Now Trudeau faces charges that his government is, essentially, just like everybody else’s.

A WOMAN BORN TO NOBLE PEOPLE

The scandal began after The Globe and Mail published a report earlier this month that alleged that the prime minister’s office put pressure on Jody Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister to help SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution for its dealings in Libya. According to the newspaper, she resisted. She was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and has since resigned – without revealing anything about why, citing solicitor-client privilege.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould is a powerful symbol of Trudeau’s branding. She both personified his pledge to build a new relationship with indigenous people in Canada as a historic reconciliation and his commitment to gender equality.

And while the main issue that could damage Trudeau concerns the rule of law, Alex Marland, author of “Brand Command: Canadian Politics and Democracy in the Age of Message Control,” says that gender and race add to the scandal at a sensitive moment.

“If the attorney general happened to be a white guy, to what extent would the story be an issue? It would still be an issue,” he says. “It’s just that because it happens to be an indigenous woman and this particular prime minister – and not even just the prime minister, it’s just the nature of society at the moment. It’s really a sensitive thing to have a white man and a prime minister demote an indigenous woman, especially in Canada where we’re going through this period of reconciliation.”

When the scandal broke, Trudeau immediately said he did not “direct” Wilson-Raybould to reach an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin, which faces charges of fraud and corruption. The firm employs 9,000 people in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Liberals in the election. But Trudeau’s carefully constructed statement only led to speculation that he was engaging in a semantics game because the government had something to hide. He tried to stifle it by saying her continued presence in his cabinet spoke for itself. The next day she stepped down, signing her resignation “Puglaas,” her name in her native Kwak’wala language, which means “a woman born to noble people.”

Days later Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s longtime friend and influential principal secretary, resigned. In his letter he said there was no untoward pressure placed on Wilson-Raybould, but his resignation only turned up the speculation.

It was only in testimony in the House of Commons justice committee last week that Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council of Canada, shed some light on a basic timeline of meetings that have taken place. He essentially admitted a degree of pressure placed on the justice minister but said that it wasn’t inappropriate.",A murky scandal threatens to mar Trudeau's – and Canada's – good names,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/murky-scandal-threatens-mar-trudeaus-canadas-good-names-220949695.html

Besides that critical race in B.C.'s Burnaby South for Jagmeet Singh, there are two other byelections being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe and Outremont in Quebec.

Burnaby South is one place where all three major parties have been competitive in past elections. The NDP held onto the seat by a hair more than one per cent of the votes in 2015.

The Liberals, who usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby, faced challenges in this campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he's not taking anything for granted, but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,"" he said.

Singh has been without a seat since he was chosen as leader of the NDP in October 2017. The B.C. riding has been the focus of the party's heaviest campaigning efforts since Singh announced he would run for that seat in August. Expectations are Singh will take the win in this byelection.

But the NDP is also squaring off against the Liberals in another race — to defend former leader Tom Mulcair's seat in the downtown Montreal riding of Outremont.

Outremont

The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily.

The NDP's support in Quebec has been fading, and the riding was a Liberal stronghold before Mulcair seized it in a 2007 byelection, the first-ever win in the province for the NDP and one that helped set the stage for the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011.

Countrywide, that Orange Wave is now little more than a ripple. The NDP has been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night in October, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

Singh also presents unique challenges in Quebec ridings.

Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, told The Canadian Press people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality — and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in the eyes of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about [the turban],"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Sanchez is running against Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan, Conservative Jasmine Louras, Bloc candidate Michel Duchesne, PPC candidate James Seale and Green party deputy leader Daniel Green.

York-Simcoe

York-Simcoe is almost certainly a safe Conservative seat. The Tories won it by 45 points in 2011 and still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Stephen Harper was defeated.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson told CBC News on Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue.

Federal leader Andrew Scheer also said that the current SNC-Lavalin controversy embroiling the Liberals will only sway more voters to Davidson's camp.

Big day today on Parliament Hill.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould is set to speak her truth about the SNC-Lavalin controversy this week—specifically, tomorrow,* when she appears before a justice committee that’s looking into whether the PMO tried to pressure her into going easy on SNC-Lavalin.

Will she light it up? If the former AG adds credible colour to the story being told by anonymous sources this past week, it will be a devastating day for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, writes Andrew MacDougall: “If you’re Trudeau, it’s hard to envision an appearance in which Wilson-Raybould doesn’t burn everything—Trudeau included—to the ground. There has been some serious red-on-red action on the nation’s front pages in the past few days, and only one side can survive.” (Maclean’s)

No, no, no: The men who wanted SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution engaged in “Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting” of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by repeatedly refusing to accept her authority on the file and then insisting she was under no pressure, writes Anne Kingston:

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from [Privy Council Clerk] Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it. Through it all a question emerges: How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say “No” before she was heard? (Maclean’s)

Singh needs this win: Monday is also byelection day. Votes will be counted in three ridings, including Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Outremont in Montreal. But the one everyone will be watching is Burnaby South, where NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to finally secure a seat in the House. With his leadership in question, and the NDP low on polling and fundraising support, Singh needs victory—and the SNC-Lavalin mess embroiling Liberals can only help “(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” saysRichard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.” (Canadian Press, CBC News)

Politics show round-up

Didn’t catch the weekend politics shows? Here’s what you missed:

In his testimony to the justice committee Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick attacked the original Globe and Mail story that kicked off the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Bob Fife, one of the journalists who broke the story, made the rounds, and on CTV’s Question Period defended the scoop: “In politics the best defence is often a strong offence, and particularly shooting the messenger, but in his testimony [Wernick] actually confirmed what we reported—we reported Miss Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to cut a deal so SNC-Lavalin would not be prosecuted, would pay a fine. We did not say the Prime Minister directed her to do so. Nobody said that. In fact nobody did do that.” (CTV video tweet)

Speaking on Question Period Conservative Justice Critic Lisa Raitt said Wernick’s committee testimony shows lines were crossed with Wilson-Raybould: “Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end. And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.” (CTV News)

Following Friday’s recommendation by the National Energy Board that the Trans Mountain pipeline be approved, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa is on track to wrap up consultations with 117 Indigenous committees that would be impacted by the pipeline within the next few months: “The work that we have done so far and the work we will continue to do in the coming months, I can tell you that I feel that we are in a very strong position to conclude these consultations within the next 90 days. But we must get it right.” (Global News)

On Trans Mountain, Canada’s fisheries minister Jonathan Wilkinson told CBC’s The House that increased tanker traffic from the pipeline expansion won’t have much additional impact on endangered southern resident killer whales because they’re already being blasted with underwater noise. “It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline, he said. “There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year, there are thousands of ferries…. All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there’s a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.” (CBC News)

163,Empty,2019-02-25T14:09:25Z,Canadian minister signalled that his government may not ratify a new North American trade agreement if the duties remain,"White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he’s working to remove U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico, after a Canadian minister signalled that his government may not ratify a new North American trade agreement if the duties remain.

Kudlow made the comments on a panel at the National Governors Association’s winter meeting in Washington on Sunday. He spoke after Marc Garneau, Canada’s transport minister, said “I don’t know if we are going to get there” in approving the deal if the tariffs aren’t removed.

The duties are no longer needed now that the two countries and Mexico have agreed on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, Garneau said. Kudlow also suggested that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was working toward having the tariffs removed.

“Ambassador Lighthizer and his group, we are working on that, we are hard at work on that, to solve that issue,” Kudlow said of the metals tariffs after Garneau spoke. Earlier in the panel discussion, Kudlow said the new three-nation agreement was “very strong” and that Trump taught him tariffs can be a good negotiating tactic to break down trade barriers.

Canada retaliated dollar-for-dollar against U.S. tariffs last year, and Garneau’s comments on Sunday were some of the sharpest about the dispute since then as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau leads his government toward an October election. Garneau said that while political energy may shift to other issues in coming months, the tariffs alone are a major stumbling block to ratification.

‘Unnecessary Tax’

“Those tariffs are an unnecessary tax which is weighing down on both countries,” said Garneau, a former astronaut who served on U.S.-led space missions. He also said the original U.S. justification for tariffs on national security grounds was never justified.

“This will present us with real challenges as we begin the process of ratification in Canada — I don’t know if we are going to get there,” Garneau said.

Canada would quickly drop its metals tariffs and ratify the agreement in response to a U.S. move, Garneau said. “We want to go ahead and do it because this is very good for both of our countries,” Garneau said of ratifying the trade agreement.

Garneau appealed to the governors in the audience to push the Trump administration to drop the tariffs, noting that Canada is the top export market for many U.S. states. The U.S. also has a US$2 billion surplus in steel trade with Canada, and the bilateral deficit on aluminum is because America needs more of that metal than it can produce, Garneau said.

Letter to Ross

Mexican officials have also called for the metal tariffs to be removed, and a coalition of business, agricultural and trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter in January asking the same of Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Kudlow touted the new trade agreement on Sunday before Garneau spoke, saying it was a “template” for other pacts and would bring US$62 billion of auto investment to the U.S. Such agreements are better than broad, multilateral trade pacts that sink to the “lowest common denominator,” Kudlow said.

Passing the USMCA would also be helpful as a “show of unity” by North America against other trade competitors like China, he said.

164,Empty,2019-02-25T19:05:29Z,"With a big scandal in Ottawa that centres on a large company in Quebec, who cares about that part of the country west of Ontario?","Something important happened Friday. In a much earlier age — like, a month ago — it would probably have made big headlines. But that was before federal Liberals began devouring themselves bit by bit over a scandal they insist is a total figment of the imagination of their former justice minister.

Social media can only handle one outburst of moral fervour at a time, so the important thing that happened got buried away where people wouldn’t notice. Except in western Canada, which doesn’t count. Because with a big scandal in Ottawa that centres on a large company in Quebec, who cares about that part of the country west of Ontario?

The important thing that happened was a ruling from the National Energy Board. It was identified as a “Reconsideration” of its original ruling on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, because a court found the first ruling inadequate and ordered a retry. The retry once again concluded the project should go ahead, while tacking on 16 new recommendations to the 156 conditions already demanded.

Until Jody Wilson-Raybould’s conscience came along, Trans Mountain was right up there with the most pressing matters facing the Trudeau government, which snapped up ownership of the pipeline after so badly bungling the issue that the original builder opted to back out. But Friday’s NEB ruling slipped by with all the fanfare of a statement from the federal fisheries minister celebrating Cod Replenishment Day.

Until Jody Wilson-Raybould’s conscience came along, Trans Mountain was right up there with the most pressing matters facing the Trudeau government

Even in the provinces that would be most affected by the pipeline, reaction was muted. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley did not perform a handstand while barking “Take that, Jason Kenney!” Instead she observed warily, “It’s not a victory, but it’s an incredibly important step.”

Scott Moe, her counterpart in Saskatchewan, observed that the ruling does nothing to alter the uncertainty created by the Liberals’ determination to push through Bill C-69, which Moe and many others believe will make it even harder to win approval for crucial infrastructure projects.

“We need to find regulatory certainty as we move forward, and I fear Bill C-69 will not provide us with that,” he said.

Notley shares his concerns about the regulatory shackles Ottawa is intent on affixing to Canada’s energy industry.

“When we lost the case in August, my biggest concern then was actually the NEB process,” she said. “That to me was the process I was worried could be dragged out much longer than it has been.”

Notley is a New Democrat, Moe a conservative, but they share a lack of faith in the Liberals’ ability to do right by their provinces and the millions of Canadians who live there, or whose livelihood depends to some degree on the energy industry. The furor over Wilson-Raybould has demonstrated that the Trudeau Liberals were willing to move heaven and earth to prevent SNC-Lavalin facing corruption charges that might impact Quebec’s economy and the company’s employees, at the same time they profess helplessness to free the oil and gas business from its torment.

In SNC-Lavalin’s case, Trudeau was willing to go so far as to press Wilson-Raybould to overlook a key section of the law his government put in place that blocked SNC-Lavalin from receiving a get-out-of-jail pass on the basis of its economic importance. And when she wouldn’t bow to him, his chief aide made a point of reminding her of his concerns, as did Canada’s top bureaucrat, backed up by additional pressures on her chief of staff. Even as the crisis rages around it, the government appears intent on finding a way to save the company from itself, with possible changes that could let the company bid on federal contracts even if it’s found guilty on the corruption charges.

Don’t expect that to satisfy the hard-boiled elements determined to hold up the project at any cost

None of that sort of leeway appears on the horizon for the energy business, which provides paycheques to far more Canadians than SNC-Lavalin could ever hope. Friday’s NEB ruling only stirred further the forces of obstructionism that have managed to impose one delay after another.

“We still say no to the project. Even if one Nation says no to the project, the project isn’t (happening). They don’t understand what consultation means,” declared Chief Judy Wilson, a member of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs.

“All I can say is this is going to bring more people together. This will never have the Indigenous support along the pipeline,” added Grand Chief Stewart Phillip.

The NEB heard interventions from 52 Indigenous groups and individuals. Lawyers, chiefs and environmental absolutists are already gearing for new court challenges. They insist traffic associated with the pipeline will put untold pressure on killer whales off British Columbia’s coast, a claim dismissed by federal Fisheries Minister Jonathan Wilkinson.

”It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline,” said Wilkinson, a Vancouver Liberal.

“There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year,” he told the CBC. “There are thousands of ferries … All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there’s a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.”

Don’t expect that to satisfy the hard-boiled elements determined to hold up the project at any cost. The West’s economy isn’t important enough to the Trudeau government to take the sort of extreme steps it has in the SNC-Lavalin affair. It still has hopes of enough support from Quebec in October’s election to justify its willingness to bend, twist and possibly break its own laws, but west of Ontario is a Liberal desert, and even its B.C. support may suffer from the Wilson-Raybould fallout.

Notley also faces an election, which must be held by May, with little evident hope of victory. A loss would cost Trudeau an important one-time ally in his fight for a carbon tax. In her place he’d face the far-more combative Jason Kenney and a revival of the west-vs.-east antagonism that took so long to cool in the wake of an earlier Trudeau.

The federal cabinet now has 90 days to decide on whether to press ahead with the NEB recommendation. As if Justin Trudeau needs another outburst of “progressive” anger on the cusp of his re-election bid. Maybe he’ll get lucky and a new scandal will appear to again divert Canadians’ attention from the mess he’s wrought in the West.

Scheer introduced a House of Commons motion Monday afternoon that would demand Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appear at the Commons justice committee to explain his role in allegations former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured not to proceed with a criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

“Quite simply what we’ve seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the Prime Minister’s Office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice,” Scheer said in a news conference before introducing the motion. Scheer said Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick’s testimony to the justice committee last week made it clear that SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the Criminal Code to be changed to allow for remediation agreements. Those allow companies to avoid a criminal prosecution in exchange for accepting responsibility for wrongdoing, paying fines and reparation to any victims, relinquishing any financial benefit from the actions and showing changes to prevent misdeeds from being repeated. Striking such an agreement would mean SNC-Lavalin could avoid a criminal prosecution in Canada for allegations it bribed officials in Libya to win contracts there.

Scheer said the Liberals launched “an unsolicited, co-ordinated and sustained effort by the PM himself to get the former attorney general to change her decision. “Canadians need to be outraged at the suggestion that politicians were putting pressure on independent agents of the Crown, independent legal officers, to try to get a better deal for well connected friends of the Liberal party,” Scheer said. “That is unacceptable and we need to be outraged about this because of the implications it has on the entire justice system across the country.”

The Liberals don’t appear ready to support the Conservative motion to call Trudeau to testify. The motion would not be binding in any event, and a Commons committee can’t summon a sitting MP to appear before it. Arif Virani, the Liberal parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, said in the House of Commons there isn’t a need for the Commons to inject itself into the proceedings of the justice committee. If the committee wants to call certain witnesses the committee members can decide who they want to hear from, he said. “Committees of this house do exemplary work,” said Virani. “We’re confident that the committee hearings will continue to be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the answers and information that they seek.” Thus far the committee has heard from Wernick, deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin and current Justice Minister David Lametti. Lametti replaced Wilson-Raybould in the job in January, when she was shuffled to veterans affairs. She resigned from cabinet altogether a few days after the allegations of improper pressure were first raised, but continues to sit as a Liberal MP. She is expected to testify at the committee this week but no date or time has been confirmed. Trudeau denies any improper conduct occurred and that any conversations on the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin were done with Wilson-Raybould knowing the final decision was hers alone.

Victoria Maruyama was born in Hong Kong and, because her father was Canadian, has been a Canadian citizen since she was a baby. When she was a year old, the family moved to Edmonton, where she grew up.

At the age of 22, she went to Japan to teach English.

""I met my kids' dad,"" Maruyama said in an interview with The Canadian Press. ""The plan was just to teach English throughout Asia, move around from one country to the next, but he kind of scotched my plans.""

She was seven months pregnant with their first daughter, Akari, in 2009 when Conservative government amendments to the citizenship laws took away her right to pass on citizenship to her children unless they were born in Canada.

By that time, it was too late in her pregnancy to fly back to Canada. Her second daughter, Arisa, was also born in Japan.

The girls are now seven and nine years old and, despite moving back to Edmonton almost two years ago, Maruyama is still fighting for them to become Canadian.

""We had to struggle to get my kids in school. We had to fight to get them health care. They had no health care for months. Then they had it for six months and then they were stripped of it again,"" she said.

""It should be my right to come home with my children and for them to be educated and ... have health care and vaccinations and all those basic things.""

A January letter from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada notes Akari and Arisa were rejected because ""they are not stateless, will not face special and unusual hardship if you are not granted Canadian citizenship and you have not provided services of exceptional value to Canada.""

Officials with the federal department said in a statement that decision-makers determined that criteria for citizenship have not been met.

""As part of the determination, the best interests of the child were considered,"" they said in an email. ""However, sufficient evidence was not provided to demonstrate that the children have been denied access to basic services in Canada.""

Maruyama's lawyer, Charles Gibson, has filed an application for a judicial review in Federal Court. He argues that the rejection is unlawful and that the Citizenship Act is discriminatory.

""It creates two classes of Canadian citizens,"" he says in court documents. ""One class that can perpetually pass on or inherit Canadian citizenship and one that cannot. The Citizenship Act precludes the applicant's mother from passing ... on her Canadian citizenship to the applicant.

""As a result, the applicant has suffered a great deal of hardship.""

Don Chapman, an advocate for ""lost"" Canadians, said the law also goes against the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Canada signed in 1990.

""You have the right to live in the country with your parents. You have the right to an education. You have a right to medical. You have a right to seek legal guidance if the country won't do this,"" he said.

Chapman said there are many expat Canadians who could find themselves in the same situation.

""It's a problem that's going to explode.""

When Justin Trudeau was citizenship and immigration critic, he promised in a March 2011 news release to change the ""anachronistic"" law.

If the kids had been abandoned, the kids would be Canadian. - Don Chapman, advocate for 'lost' Canadians

But Morgan said the Liberal government still hasn't addressed the loophole for second-generation Canadians born abroad.

""It means there's only one group of Canadian citizens that have a litmus test to get their kids in,"" he said. ""If the kids had been abandoned, the kids would be Canadian. If you or me or any other Canadian adopts the children, they have a right of citizenship. If Vicki had been an immigrant Canadian and then naturalized, her kids would be Canadian.""

He said the Maruyama family is caught in the middle of the 2009 legal changes.

""There's Trudeau going a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian, and no, no and no,"" said Chapman, who noted the Conservative Opposition has also been silent on the issue. ""They all talk about refugees and immigrants, but no one is talking about this.""

Maruyama said if they aren't able to get citizenship, her girls could apply for permanent residence status as immigrants — a possibility confirmed by the federal Immigration department.

""They would have a higher level of citizenship than me because they [could] ... pass on citizenship to their children,"" she said. ""But me living here 20-some years is not enough.

167,Empty,2019-02-25T23:42:04Z,Why did Trudeau apply ‘relentless pressure’ to get Wilson-Raybould to change her mind? The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could,"There is no calm for the Liberals as the storm of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s upcoming appearance at the justice committee rumbles towards them.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday he has waived solicitor-client privilege, freeing the former justice minister to talk about “relevant matters” as long as she does not touch on two court cases involving SNC-Lavalin.

Meanwhile, Wilson-Raybould said in a letter to the committee chair that she is willing to testify at the “first opportunity,” but wants to make sure there is clarity on possible constraints on what she can say — which suggests it may not be in the next couple of days.

While we don’t know when Wilson-Raybould will appear at committee, we do know she wants 30 minutes for an opening statement. You don’t need half an hour to say that the whole SNC-Lavalin saga, and recent allegations of political interference in the justice system, are just a big misunderstanding.

On Monday afternoon the committee heard from a former Saskatchewan judge who has gone on record as saying the affair should be investigated by the RCMP if there is evidence Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to another portfolio over her refusal to reconsider her position on asking the director of public prosecutions to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond has said a police investigation would be necessary to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, calling the prospect of the attempted influence over a prosecution “not only immoral, (but) illegal.”

Last week I suggested that Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at cabinet and Liberal caucus might auger a closing of ranks and an attempt by all sides to tamp down more controversy. After the clerk of the Privy Council’s unconventional committee appearance last week and Wilson-Raybould’s letter of intent, I’m less sure.

The appearance at committee of Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, suggested he thinks there is nothing to see here — that Canadians should have faith in the system because laws are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held,” he said last Thursday.

As to his own conversation with Wilson-Raybould on December 19th last year, he made clear he believes it was neither immoral nor illegal. He said he told the then-attorney general her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of SNC and discussed whether a deferred prosecution agreement for the company was still an option. “I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate,” he said. “I was informing the minister of context.”

The adjudicator of whether Wernick, and perhaps even the prime minister himself, crossed any lines will be the ethics commissioner. If prosecutors agree with Turpel-Lafond, the affair may even end up before the courts and be settled by a judge.

But what perplexes me is why Wernick, the prime minister, and senior advisers Gerald Butts and Katie Telford even discussed a remediation agreement for SNC after Wilson-Raybould made clear she was not disposed to negotiate one, when a perfectly sound plan B was already being worked on.

As my colleague Gabriel Friedman revealed in the Post on Saturday, the department of Public Services and Procurement is finalizing changes to the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy under the Integrity regime. This word salad governs whether corporations convicted of crimes can bid on federal projects.

SNC’s fear is that a conviction on corruption charges for bribing Libyan officials could lead to a 10-year ban on access to government infrastructure projects — the source of around 15 per cent of its $9 billion in revenue in 2017.

But the changes being contemplated by the government could reduce the ineligibility period from the automatically mandated 10 years to a debarment at the government’s discretion.

This policy change has been in the works for years — the public was invited to comment back in fall 2017 and the government says the update is being “studied and finalized.” A statement in the revised policy consultation said it is expected to take effect in “early 2019.”

One lawyer Friedman quoted said the debarment could conceivably be reduced to six months, a year or even no ineligibility at all. The proposed changes would widen the scope of offences that could lead to debarment, including human trafficking and environmental violations. The idea is that a one-size-fits-all punishment must be made more flexible if the range of offences is broadened.

SNC chief executive Neil Bruce has said the failure to secure a DPA would likely lead to three to four more years of court battles because the company considers itself not guilty.

But unless I’m missing something, a DPA would require an admission of culpability.

Under the new integrity regime, the company would also have to admit to wrongdoing before throwing itself on the mercy of the Registrar of Ineligibility and Suspension at Public Services. But, in that event, the company could claim mitigating circumstances, because the executives who perpetrated the alleged corruption have left and steps have been taken to ensure there is no repeat of the errant conduct.

So if the government already had an alternative to a deferred prosecution agreement that is expected to become policy in the next month or so, why did the prime minister and his most senior advisors risk flirting with immorality, if not illegality?

As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked Monday, if the decision to grant or refuse a deferred prosecution agreement was Wilson-Raybould’s alone — as the prime minister maintains — why did he apply “relentless pressure” to get her to change her mind?

168,Empty,2019-02-25T22:07:09Z,He said the government will waive some of the solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences that have so far kept her silent,"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued an official cabinet order to allow Jody Wilson-Raybould to publicly testify about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The cabinet order, called an order-in-council, was published Monday evening, and comes on the same day Wilson-Raybould released a letter saying she needs more clarity on the constraints on her speech before she’ll schedule an appearance at the House of Commons justice committee.

The committee has invited Wilson-Raybould to testify about her version of events about the allegation, published in the Globe and Mail, that she was politically pressured to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The order allows Wilson-Raybould and “any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin” to disclose to the justice committee information about discussions on that subject that are covered by cabinet confidences or solicitor-client privilege.

It also allows those people to disclose the information to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, who is also conducting an investigation into the matter.

Cabinet confidence privilege protects information that is the subject of discussion at cabinet meetings or between cabinet ministers. Solicitor-client privilege protects information that is given by the government’s legal advisor.

“However, in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings, this authorization and waiver does not extend to any information or communications between the former Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin,” the order says.

Trudeau had given a vague promise earlier on Monday that he would allow Wilson-Raybould to publicly testify about “relevant matters.”

Wilson-Raybould’s letter to the justice committee — revealed Monday afternoon — said these issues need more attention before she’ll agree to testify.

“I am anxious to appear at the first available time,” she said in the letter dated Feb. 25. “However, I believe that in advance of my appearance, the Members of the Committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.”

She said she has taken legal advice, but still needs the government to waive privilege. She also said the committee should get its own legal advice on what can be discussed without violating the Parliamentary convention that it not interfere with ongoing court matters.

“I would prefer not to schedule my appearance before the Committee until we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues,” she said.

I am anxious to appear at the first available time

Wilson-Raybould said that when she does appear, she would like 30 minutes for an opening statement to give her recollection of events, and then would stay and answer questions for as long as the committee wants.

SNC-Lavalin is facing criminal charges for allegedly bribing public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011. It has also filed a case in Federal Court that challenges the decision made by federal prosecutors last September to not negotiate a remediation agreement. Remediation agreements see a company admit wrongdoing, pay a fine, and obey other compliance conditions, but avoid a guilty conviction in court.

The political controversy centres on whether Wilson-Raybould, when she was justice minister and attorney general, was pressured by Trudeau or his senior staff to order federal prosecutors to stay the corruption case against SNC-Lavalin and instead pursue a remediation agreement. It is a Canadian constitutional principle that attorneys general must not be pressured politically when acting in their role of overseeing the federal prosecution service.

The Commons justice committee started its study of the matter last week, and heard a fiery defence of the government’s side from Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council.

Despite Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about solicitor-client privilege, Wernick told the committee he doesn’t see any privilege around the conversations. “I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor,” he said. “The matter was never discussed at cabinet, ever. So she was not giving advice to cabinet. She was not advising the prime minister.”

Wernick predicted that Wilson-Raybould will raise concerns about three meetings, including a phone call he had with her on Dec. 19, 2018 — just weeks before she was shuffled out of the justice minister role.

He told the committee he was confident that all the conversations were “lawful.” Yet he also said that in his conversation with her, he told Wilson-Raybould that “a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.”

The Conservatives sought to turn up the pressure on Trudeau by calling on him to testify at the justice committee. On Monday they introduced a motion that, citing Trudeau’s “alleged direct involvement” in pressuring Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin case, called on him to “to appear, testify and answer questions at the (justice committee), under oath, for a televised, two-hour meeting, before Friday, March 15, 2019.”

The Liberals used their majority to defeat the motion on Monday evening by a vote of 155 to 106.

Earlier Monday the justice committee heard testimony from lawyers and law professors with expertise on remediation agreements and the role of attorneys-general in government.

UBC law professor Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge, said that once prosecutors have reached the “decision point” to proceed with a trial, she is skeptical government officials having any legal basis for raising it with the attorney general.

“There is limited lawful authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point, and going forward,” she told the committee.

Turpel-Lafond said it’s fine for government officials to offer their assistance if the attorney general wants more information, but that’s where the limit lies.

“I think when we get beyond that position of the more passive and respectful approach, and we get into a very rigorous position of saying, ‘I challenge you to take a different position,’ I think we are into very serious issues with the rule of law,” she said.

In the US, the upcoming election, the coronation and other domestic developments were perceived as variables that could impact the ambitious Thai chair. Then…","To persuade Trump to come to Bangkok, the Thai chair must prepare a package of things only Trump can get.

Across the other half of the globe, Thailand's Asean chair has been viewed with scepticism and doubt. In the US, the upcoming election, the coronation and other domestic developments were perceived as variables that could impact the ambitious Thai chair. Then there is a bigger lingering question about President Donald Trump's overseas trips this year.

Policymakers and political pundits in Washington DC have paid more attention to headline news of political developments in Thailand than the Asean chair. Indeed, the electoral campaigns by various parties, especially Thai Raksa Chart, have intrigued observers of Thai politics. Obviously, the party's electoral strategy has spawned myriad conspiracy theories in the Western media.

Kavi Chongkittavorn is a veteran journalist on regional affairs. He was recently in Washington..

As for Coronation Day in early May, there was some anxiety as to why foreign dignitaries have not been invited. The ceremony will follow all the steps that were taken in 1950 when his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, ascended the throne. For Thais, it will be a time for celebration in the Kingdom. It will have no impact on the Thai chair.

To understand Thailand's role in Asean, one has to understand the evolution of its engagement since its birth in 1967. In the past 52 years, Thailand has been the most consistent in supporting the regional organisation, which was born out of the Cold War. Through thick and thin, it has never backslid on its Asean policy. All Thai governments, past and present, have only sought to strengthen Asean and increase its relevancy. Even in the worst period during the 2008-2009 chairmanship, Thailand managed to kick start the Asean charter which came into effect that year. Bangkok successfully pushed for the Asean Master Plan of Connectivity and the establishment of the Asean Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. In anticipation of the Asean Economic Community, previous Thai governments spent several billion baht to increase awareness among the Thai public and promote seamless Asean economic integration.

This time around, Thailand has identified 13 deliverables during its chairmanship. This is a tall order but achievable. Over the past nearly five years, the current military administration has tried even harder to deepen the Thai commitment to Asean. Most importantly, Thailand wants to raise the profile and centrality of Asean to prepare the bloc to cope with the new challenges coming from new disruptive elements, including technology and uncertainties arising from fluid regional and international environment.

Therefore, it has an ambitious plan. Thailand has already invited leaders of the five members of the UN Security Council to Bangkok in early November. Since 2005, Asean holds its most important gathering at its year-end summit, known as the East Asia Summit (EAS), which is the only strategic forum in the region. For the 14th EAS, Germany, Britain and France have already replied that their leaders will join a working lunch with their EAS counterparts from Asean, the US, China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, India, Australia and New Zealand ahead of the summit. It is incumbent on the Asean chair to see to it that this mega gathering takes place and further strengthens ties between Asean and the global movers and shakers.

In 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and European Council President Donald Tusk joined the working lunch ahead of the EAS as special guests of the chair. Last November, under the Singapore chair, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde attended a similar function.

As a result, this year Mr Trump's overseas itinerary is under close scrutiny by the Asean members. He is visiting Hanoi to attend the second Trump-Kim summit beginning tomorrow. Then, he plans to visit Japan twice. First, Mr Trump will become the first foreign leader to meet with Japanese Crown Prince Naruhito, who will become emperor after ascending the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1. Then, the US president is to visit Japan again to attend the G20 summit a few weeks later in Osaka.

Now the most frequently asked question is whether Mr Trump will make a fourth trip to Asia. The answer depends on what he will get out of it. To persuade him to come to Bangkok, the Thai chair must prepare a package of things only Mr Trump can get. Otherwise, he will just skip the EAS as in the previous year. He halfheartedly participated at the EAS in the Philippines in 2017, much to the chagrin of his host, President Rodrigo Duterte.

As the Thai chair enters its third month, an agenda of deliverables in all three pillars -- political/security, economic, social/culture -- is taking shape. In particular, at the upcoming Asean senior official meeting (SOM) in Chiang Rai early next month, it will also indicate the path of Asean to tackle external challenges posed by the new realignment of the major powers. The Asean version of the Indo-Pacific concept would mark the grouping's first attempt to raise its regional code of conduct, enshrined in the 1976 Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, to the global level. In 1992, the TAC was circulated as a UN document and since then has attracted 38 signatories including the European Union. Apart from its original principles and norms, the Thai chair has already included the grouping's additional best practices, such as the principle of mutual respect, trust and benefits to the Asean norms, which have brought peace and prosperity to Southeast Asia.

Indeed, after the March 24 election, whatever transpires will not alter the Thai Asean chair's planned deliverables and commitments due to the support of the Asean consensus.",Thailand's Asean chair: Views from Washington,Bangkokpost.com,https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1635234/thailands-asean-chair-views-from-washington

A movement is afoot to claim that the Nazi collaborators and the SS units made up of Ukrainians, Latvians and other eastern Europeans, were actually nationalistic heroes and in no way associated with the Nazis. I have written a number of articles exposing the role of these collaborators in the Holocaust and their complicity in murdering tens of thousands of Jewish men, women and children.

I have received emails from Ukrainians and Latvians who claim the Holocaust never took place. Others write that while Jews were indeed killed, they deserved the death and destruction the Nazis brought down on their communities.

And then there are others who claim that journalists who write articles about the Ukrainian and Latvian SS units – and the parades that are held in those nations to this day honouring these Nazi collaborators – are “pro-Russian” or somehow spouting Kremlin propaganda.

I’ve had the distinction of being singled out as such in a recent report on Russian disinformation by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute of Ottawa, a right-wing think-tank.

The report’s author, Marcus Kolga, claims my articles about the role of Ukrainians and Latvians in the Holocaust and their service in SS units has parroted the Kremlin’s narrative and has “been critical of Canada’s support for states targeted by Kremlin aggression.”

For starters, the articles I have written about Ukrainian and Latvian Nazis who butchered Jews don’t even mention Canada’s support for those two countries, let criticize that support.

My articles are about those who would deny that Ukrainians, Latvians, and others from eastern Europe eagerly participated in the Holocaust and supported Adolf Hitler. The articles also expose those who would declare these Nazi collaborators as some kind of heroes.

To be sure, the Ukrainian and Latvian governments were not happy about my articles, considering they exposed their nations’ dark past in supporting the wholesale slaughter of Jews.

And the Macdonald-Laurier Institute has received funding from the Latvian Ministry of Defence. In addition, the Embassy of Latvia in Canada has also provided sponsorship for the institute.

What is going on in Latvia and the Ukrainian and other east European nations is a Nazi whitewash designed to rehabilitate those from these countries who took part in some of the most heinous crimes in history.

Here’s how it works.

Ukrainian and Latvian militia and police units were among the most brutal in helping the Nazis hunt down and murder Jewish men, women and children.

They were good at killing defenceless people. So good, that the Holocaust Chronicle, published in 2003 and written by 7 top scholars in the field of Holocaust studies, noted that Ukrainians were also sent to help kill Jews during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in April 1943. The Chronicle published a photo of two of Ukrainian SS members standing over the bodies of Jews murdered during that uprising. See the photo below:

SS General Jurgen Stroop, later executed as a war criminal, was very pleased with the Ukrainian, Latvian and Lithuanian volunteers who helped him and his men murder and hunt down 56,000 Jews. In his diary Stroop wrote that these killers were not only “nationalists and anti-Semites” but among his best troops. They were “wild at heart and with a tendency towards base things. But nevertheless obedient,” Stroop gushed about his Ukrainian, Latvian and Lithuanian killers.

The Ukrainian militias who murdered Jews in the ghetto and elsewhere went on to serve in a new SS unit created by the Nazis, the 14th SS Galizien Division. Stroop was brought on as an advisor to the newly created division.

A similar development happened in Latvia. The members of Latvia’s Arajs Kommando, who had killed an estimated 26,000 Jews for the Nazis, went on to serve in the Latvian SS legion.

These SS units were sent to fight the Russians as they closed in on the Third Reich.

Decades later the whitewash began. The Ukrainians and Latvians who fought for the SS – as the whitewash explains – weren’t really Nazis. They instead were nationalists fighting for their own country against the Russians. And of course none of them committed any type of crime, or so the whitewash explains, carefully ignoring the previous role of the individual members in these SS units in the mass murder of tens of thousands of Jews.

Last year, Karlis Eihenbaums, Latvia’s Ambassador to Canada, launched an attack on Canadian journalist Scott Taylor who wrote about the Latvian Legion (15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian) et al) and Latvian killers like war criminal Herberts Cukurs as well as the members of the Arajs Kommando. Like the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, Eihenbaums suggested such articles were “fake news” and “disinformation.” And like the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, Eihenbaums tried to smear the journalist by suggesting he was under the “influence” of the Russian government. Eihenbaums also targeted my articles.

As I have written before, the eager participation of some Latvians in the Holocaust is not “fake news.” It is a well-documented historical fact that many of the killers from the Arajs Kommando went to the Latvian Legion. These Latvians, Ukrainians, Estonians and others from eastern Europe nations served Hitler and his war aims. No number of claims of “fake news” can change that fact.

These days there are parades in Latvia and Ukraine to honour these SS units who fought under the Swastika. These parades and memorials, which have attracted the support of Neo-Nazis and other fascist groups, have long been controversial and questioned by many throughout Europe. See the photo below and note the white pride shirt on the young Ukrainian with the Ukrainian SS veteran.

For instance, the controversy over the Latvian Legion and the annual parade held in Riga (each March) to celebrate these Nazi collaborators is well known and has been going on for two decades, long before the term “fake news” was even coined. In 1998 the parade caused a storm of protests around the world, particularly in Israel, where Holocaust survivors couldn’t understand Latvia’s desire to celebrate such ruthless killers. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac were among those that year to protest the Latvian parade. The Times of Israel reported on last year’s Latvian SS parade in Riga, which took place mid-March.

So much for “fake news.” Did Helmut Kohl and Jacques Chirac spread Russian “disinformation” when they denounced the SS parade in Latvia? Of course not.

This whole issue isn’t about “fake news” or Russian “disinformation.” It is about individuals and nations trying to whitewash their Nazi collaboration and rewrite history, while attacking journalists and other organizations who don’t want to let that happen.

While the Macdonald-Laurier report carefully ignores the crimes of Ukrainians and Latvians who supported Hitler’s Third Reich and butchered Jewish men, women and children by the thousands, there are those in the U.S. Congress and Jewish community speaking out against the Nazi whitewash.

In late April 2018 more than 50 members of the U.S. Congress condemned the government of Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to glorify “Nazi collaborators.”

The letter, signed by both Republicans and Democrats, outlined concerns about ongoing ceremonies to glorify leaders of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army as well as 14th SS Galizien Division (aka 1stGalician/Galizien or the 1st Ukrainian Division). “It’s particularly troubling that much of the Nazi glorification in Ukraine is government-supported,” noted the letter to U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan. The letter was initiated by Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island.

In the summer of 2018 B’nai Brith Canada’s chief executive officer Michael Mostyn called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to use his trip to Latvia that year to push back against that country’s glorification of Nazi collaborators as well as attempts to deny the nation’s role in the Holocaust.

Mostyn called on the Canadian government to speak out more forcefully to denounce parades in Latvia and other eastern European nations that honour units who fought with the Nazis during the Second World War.

“We must challenge all those who distort the historical record on governments, military units or organizations that fought with, supported or sympathized with the Nazis during World War II,” Mostyn wrote to Trudeau. “This includes government leaders who acquiesce in, or fail to condemn, a process of Nazi glorification that amounts to Holocaust distortion.”

“Those who glorify the record of such organizations or units cannot dismiss criticism as ‘fake news’ “,added Mostyn. “The fact is that some organizations and their leaders, now glorified for their fight against the Soviet army, were also involved in atrocities against Jewish civilians or embraced ideologies that were deeply anti-Semitic and perpetuated social hostility towards their Jewish populations. This is why B’nai Brith rejects any efforts to constrain historians and the media from researching what happened and publicly explaining it in an objective manner.”

These are words that those at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute should pay attention to.

He was told by an officer that he had been flagged for investigation. Then, he was arrested.","Yasser Ahmed Albaz was about to board a flight from Cairo, Egypt to Canada on the night of Feb. 18, when security pulled him aside and confiscated his passport. He was told by an officer that he had been flagged for investigation. Then, he was arrested.

The last thing Albaz told his family was that he loved him. That WhatsApp message reached them at 10 p.m., his eldest daughter, Amal, recalls.

In the week since, neither Amal, nor her two younger siblings or their mother have heard directly from their father. They received some information through a message he sent to a friend in Egypt who said he had been arrested by Egypt's state security. They've also received updates from a lawyer they hired and Canadian consular officials.

It wasn't immediately clear why Albaz had contacted a friend directly but wasn't able to contact his family in Oakville, Ontario.

The Albaz family said that they learned which prison he had been taken after hiring a lawyer in Cairo. The lawyer and Canadian consular officials have confirmed to the family that Albaz was being held in Cairo's Tora prison for additional questioning, expected to take place on Tuesday.

Albaz has not yet been charged with any crime, the family said.

They declined to provide National Observer with the lawyer's name and contact information out of fear that this could endanger the lawyer's safety.

The Tora prison has been the focus of a Human Rights Watch report that revealed its harsh conditions, torture practices and routine human rights violations of thousands of prisoners.

""We're horror-struck,"" Amal told National Observer, adding that her father isn't political. ""There is no clarity on why this happened. We don't know anything right now.""

Albaz, 51, had been on a business trip Cairo since December, working with a client for his small engineering firm in Oakville. Amal said that her father remained in touch with the family throughout the trip, until he was detained.

Global Affairs Canada said in a statement they were aware of the detention of a Canadian citizen, but that they couldn't disclose additional information for privacy reasons, said spokesman Richard Walker.

Despite being in touch with a consular officer, Amal is urging the Canadian government to intervene at the highest levels and apply pressure on the Egyptian government for more information and his release.

More specifically, they want Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to intervene. In recent months, Freeland has spoken out about detentions of human rights activists in Saudi Arabia, and about the two Canadian men who remain in custody in China.

Walker was unable to confirm if either Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or Freeland had been informed of the matter.

""We need the prime minister and Minister Freeland to pick up the phone now,"" Amal said. ""The biggest concern for us is his safety.""

""We can't let our father spend another day in that horrible prison.""

'By now, he will have been brutalized and tortured'

Egypt has been on the radar of human rights organizations and news agencies in recent months for its practice of arbitrary detentions and abuse of detainees. Amnesty's 2018 report on the country found that ""the authorities used torture and other ill-treatment and enforced disappearance against hundreds of people, and dozens were extrajudicially executed with impunity.""

The same day as Albaz's arrest, Egyptian authorities detained a New York Times correspondent David Kirkpatrick, holding him incommunicado for hours before forcing him onto a flight back to London without explanation. At the time, Michael Slackman, international editor of The New York Times, said: “We are deeply disturbed that the government of Egypt detained our correspondent, kept him incommunicado, denied him food or water and refused to allow him into the country.”

Albaz is the fifth high-profile arrest of a Canadian in Egypt over the past five years, including John Greyson and Tarek Loubani, and Khaled Al-Qazzaz.

At the time, the government's direct intervention aided in their release.

""I know exactly the journey he took from the first step he took to now,"" Loubani, an emergency physician at the London Health Sciences Centre, said in an interview. ""By now, he will have been brutalized and tortured...It's been a week. I guarantee they're trying to hide their scars or worse. ""

John and I were beaten and tortured in Egypt. Canadian Yasser Albaz is currently experiencing the same, and I pray he is not killed in the process. Canada must act swiftly and forcefully to bring him back. @AmalAlbaz — Tarek Loubani (@trklou) February 24, 2019

Loubani was detained by the Egyptian government in 2013 with Greyson, without explanation for over 50 days. They were both ""beaten to a pulp"" in what he calls was a ""welcoming celebration"" that every inmate at Tora prison received. He describes it as ""an eight hour long brutality.""

""It's not a secret there,"" he said. ""Everybody knows about it.""

When Loubani demanded a medical examination, the doctors found he had broken ribs and that he was urinating blood. Greyson had an obvious boot mark in his back.

""The experience was mine and I never want it to be anybody else's,"" he said. ""I do not care what this man's political inclination is. What I know is no man deserves that treatment.""

Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy was also released in 2015 after spending more than 400 days in a maximum security Egyptian prison.

The entire detention process in Egypt is defined by its arbitrariness and brutality, Loubani said of his experience. ""This is the MO of the Egyptian dictatorship,"" he said, noting that the only thing that got him and Greyson released was ""massive pressure by the Canadian government.""

There is no legal exit for Albaz, Loubani said, because there is no independent judiciary in Egypt at the moment.

""It is 100 per cent subservient to the military dictatorship,"" he said. ""There's only one solution here and that solution is political...""They need to apply pressure because these things will only get worse over time. Canada's voice matters and Canada's voice has a say is (Albaz's) case.""

""I know that we can't realistically stop the arrest of every Egyptian that's being unfairly detained but...it's incumbent on us to protect the people we can, and that's Canadians,"" he added.

The Albaz family says it is most concerned about the prison's brutal reputation.

""We've been in Canada for two decades,"" Amal told National Observer. ""We've traveled back and forth many times and nothing like this has ever happened.""

The community has rallied around the family; Albaz was a well-known philanthropist and businessman in the community. But, the family hasn't been able to sleep or eat properly since, Amal said.

""Every time we think about how stressed we are, we think about how much worse it is for him,"" she said.

173,Empty,2019-02-25T13:30:26Z,"Trump Adviser Larry Kudlow Says He's Proud Of Trudeau, Canada For 'Hanging Tough' On Huawei Case huffingtonpost.ca","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's senior economic adviser gave Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a symbolic pat on the back Sunday for how the federal government has been ""hanging tough"" on the diplomatically delicate extradition case of senior Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou.

Larry Kudlow said he's ""proud"" of how Canada has handled the Meng matter — a tacit acknowledgment of the diplomatic bind the U.S. Justice Department created for the federal Liberals in December when they asked that the chief financial officer and telecom scion be arrested and held in Vancouver, pending extradition.

Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is at the centre of a sprawling U.S. indictment unsealed last month that accuses the growing tech juggernaut of misrepresenting its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary between 2007 and 2017 to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran. She and the company are facing 13 counts of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice.

Watch: Trudeau says 'rule of law' followed in Meng Wanzhou case

""I'll just say how proud I am of Prime Minister Trudeau, and Canada, for hanging tough on Huawei,"" said Kudlow, director of the U.S. National Economic Council.

He acknowledged the grief the case has caused Canada since Meng, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver pending an extradition hearing, was detained at the city's airport in early December: two Canadians have since been detained in China, ostensibly for national security reasons, while a third — convicted by a Chinese court of drug trafficking — is facing the death penalty.

""That's why I'm so proud of Prime Minister Trudeau for staying with the rule of law and assisting the United States. I'm very proud of him.""

Kudlow made the comments following an appearance on a free-trade panel at the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington alongside federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau. And it wasn't the only instance that he dropped the prime minister's name.

As world leaders were gathering last year in Argentina, where Trump, Trudeau and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto signed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the prime minister approached Kudlow in an effort to move past the animosity that had erupted six months earlier at the G7 meetings in June in Quebec.

Trump, apparently piqued by Trudeau's hard-line rhetoric on tariffs and trade, unleashed a Twitter tirade that denounced the prime minister as ""dishonest"" and ""weak,"" refusing in the end to sign on to the agreed-upon end-of-summit communique. Kudlow called Trudeau's comments a ""betrayal,"" while U.S. trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested he deserved a ""special place in hell.""

The dust-up left Canada-U.S. relations, already strained over the ongoing NAFTA talks and a burgeoning cross-border tariff war, at their lowest point in recent memory — until Trudeau crossed the corridor to reach out to Kudlow.

""He came up to me — this is a true story — after the USMCA ceremony, he walked across the hall to come up and grab my hand and give me a hug,"" Kudlow said. ""I asked him if we could please turn the page on any of that stuff that occurred last spring, and he said, 'Absolutely,' and then we started having some policy discussions.

""Justin just grabbed my hand and gave me a bear hug, and I was thrilled.""

Asked whether the animosity has similarly diminished between the two leaders, Kudlow said: ""I think it's partly happened.""

Trump floats possibility of dropping charges

On Friday, Trump himself floated the possibility — again — that the U.S. could drop criminal charges against Huawei, as the president wrapped up two days of negotiations at the White House aimed at resolving America's own ongoing trade dispute with China.

""We're going to be discussing all of that during the course of the next couple of weeks,"" Trump said at the White House during an Oval Office meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping's special envoy, Vice Premier Liu He.

""We'll be talking to the U.S. attorneys. We'll be talking to the attorney general. We'll be making that decision. Right now, it's not something we've discussed.""

Late Sunday, Trump announced he would hold off on a dramatic spike in tariffs on Chinese exports, originally scheduled for Friday, pending the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks that he said on Twitter have ""made substantial progress.""

""Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself at Mar-a-Lago to conclude an agreement.""","Trump Adviser Larry Kudlow Says He's Proud Of Trudeau, Canada For 'Hanging Tough' On Huawei Case",Huffingtonpost.ca,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/02/25/larry-kudlow-trudeau-huawei_a_23677401/

Nitin Sharma traces the journey of the rally, which was conceived  38 years ago and has enthralled rallyists as well as tricity r…","It was on the evening of July 19, 1980 that the St John’s Old Boys Association (SJOBA) was formed at the founder president Manmohan Lal Sarin’s home in Chandigarh. Nine months after the body came into being, SJOBA organised its first Scooter Motorcycle SJOBA Rally on March 8, 1981. While the first edition of the rally saw more than 40 riders competing, the second edition also saw the introduction of cars and jeeps in. The rally, which started as a one-day long affair, will see its 32nd edition being held over three days starting March 1 later this year

“The first meeting of SJOBA was held with 19 members on July 19, 1981 and the founding members were keen on organising a sporting event. Unlike other sports, motorsports gives an opportunity to a young rider to compete against an older rider and vice versa; this was the main reason we decided to hold the first SJOBA Rally in March, 1982.,” recalls Sarin, adding how he would accompany his brother Ranjit Lal Sarin to chalk out the route. “We also came out with a souvenir publication, which we used to raise funds for advertisements to conduct the rally,” adds Sarin.

The first rally, which was flagged off from the St John’s High School, Sector 26, was meant only for the scooter/motorbikes. The four-wheelers were introduced in the second edition. The first route of the rally saw riders traversing from Chandigarh to Kasauli-Dagshai-Chail and back to Chandigarh on the same day.

This year, the rally will be conducted for the first time in the plains with the new route covering places like Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Garshankar in Punjab apart from seeing a night stage.

“We started with the stage format and a couple of women riders too competed in the second edition of the rally. As the number of participants grew in the coming years, we made it a two-day affair in 1996. After getting the affiliation with Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) in 2000, we also introduced the time-speed-distance (TSD) format in 2007 apart from converting the rally to a three-day long drive in 2006, which meant that the city residents could also see the rallyists in action. Nowadays, more and more riders are competing in the TSD format too and that is good for rallying. This year we have also introduced the night stage apart from conducting the rally in plains in Punjab,” said SPS Ghai, one of the founding members of SJOBA.

Champions Speak

With rallyists like five-time SJOBA champion Suresh Rana to celebrities like Gul Panag, the rally has seen some of India’s top ranked rallyists in its 31 editions. Rana, who is a multiple winner of Raid-De-Himalaya, will be making his return to SJOBA this year after missing the rally for some years. “The best thing about SJOBA Rally is that it helps you prepare for the more tougher rallies with the same kind of terrain and competitiveness. It is a short rally in terms of number of days as well as route but that makes it more competitive too. I am making a return to the rally after some years and I will be driving a Gypsy this time instead of Grand Vitara. The fact that the rally is being held in plains will make the rally more open and it will be a exciting thing to compete in the night stage too,” shares Rana, who is based in Manali.

Kalka biker Mohit Verma, a three-time winner in the rally in the motorbikes format with his first title coming in 2011, sees the rally as a big stepping stone in his racing career. 28-year-old Verma, who became the only Indian rider to win the Raid-De-Himalaya, Desert Storm, Dakshin Dare and SJOBA Rally in 2014, is currently away from the circuit due to an injury.

“If you are a beginner, the SJOBA Rally puts you in competition against experienced riders and a rider can take him time to master the format and return back strong in the next edition. When I won the title in 2011, it was one of my first titles and gave me a lot of confidence. In 2014, when I won the titles in all the rallies, it meant a lot for me. I suffered an injury in 2015 but those wins are always special for me,” shared Verma. Two-time winner in TSD format, Jagmeet Gill also believes the same. “Winning the rally twice in the TSD format as a former student means a lot for me. I had competed for the first time in 2009 in the rally. As a rallyist, one enjoys the tough competition in this rally,” shared 34-year-old Gill.

Woman Power

Over the years, SJOBA Rally has seen more than 50 women participants competing as riders as well as navigators. Last year, the rally saw riders like Sarah Kashyap, Anita Krishan and Suzanne Bull competing in the Extreme Moto category apart from some woman riders in the TSD format. Kashyap, who had moved to Dubai last year, is the only Indian female rider to complete Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm.

The 33-year-old competed for the first time in the rally in 2015 while riding a Bullet. Last year, Kashyap finished first in the ladies category and 11th overall in Moto Extreme category. “I first heard about SJOBA rally when I was kid. I never thought I will compete in the rally one day. When I competed in the rally in 2015, it was my first rally ever and I had never raced before that. I kept falling off the motorbike and I even got a heat stroke after which the organsiers asked me if I wanted to continue. I got an appreciation award that year and it motivated me. I have competed in the rally three times so far and it has laid the foundation for many cross-country rallies for me. It was easily the stepping stone for Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm and taught me the required skills. The rally has new routes every year and it poses fresh challenges every year,” shares Kashyap.

Former Miss India and Bollywood actress Gul Panag too competed in the TSD format in the rally in 2010 with her two cousins and an aunt. Panag acted as the navigator for her cousin Simrat and they won the event in the women’s category in TSD format. “It was an experience to remember for all of us. My team consisted of my two cousins and aunt and all four of us competed in the TSD format. Being the navigator, I was responsible for guiding my cousin about the route and also keep a track of others things. It was a different challenge in every stage and we enjoyed a lot competing in such a rally. It is good to see more and more women riders competing in such events,” shares Panag.

Logistics Control

There is a lot of logistics involved in the rally that sees close to 80 riders competing in the 4WD Extreme, Moto Extreme and TSD categories apart from spectators stage SSS.

Vishal Sharma, the present president of SJOBA, says their task begins with charting out the route. “The chalking of route begins 40-50 days prior to the rally and we do the recce of the whole route more than five times. Then there is the task of making rule books and log books for the route. Once I was officiating as a marshal and sitting on a hill top. A group of monkeys came and took my equipment,” he laughs.

Another SJOBA member Vivek Bansal handles the communication part of the rally which means setting up the communication channels and radio for the drivers. “I am Ham Radio operator and the toughest part in SJOBA rally is to provide coverage in the valleys. Most of the times, we sit on hilltops to get full coverage. Once while officiating at Barog, we had a slide shave when lightning struck my radio and other equipment,” shares Bansal.

Kshitij Sharma, secretary, SJOBA, too has seen the action from close. “This year, more than 140 SJOBA members will act as volunteers and we have got close to 80 entries. The event has been successful because of the efforts of all the members as well as riders,” says Sharma.

The Way Ahead

With new sponsors supporting the rally, it will see the night stage happening this year. As Manmohan Lal Sarin proudly shows the first souvenir, he is quick to add, “The rallying gods have been kind to us in all these years. Apart from one incident in the starting years when a car skidded down and the death of a rider in an accident some years later, the rally has been conducted smoothly. When a rallyist died in an accident, we were deeply saddened and thought about discontinuing the rally.

But then Brother Meredith told us to remain calm and see it as a mishap, which can take place in any sport. When the car of a competitor fell into a khud, Jimmy Sehgal, one of the competitors and leader at that point, stopped and helped the rider. Such heartwarming incidents have given strength to the organisers and rallyists.”

‘My first win at SJOBA will always be special’

SPS Garcha, 65, still remembers the first time he competed in the SJOBA rally. It was the first edition of the rally in 1981 and the 1971 batch alumnus of St John’s was also actively involved in organising the rally. Garcha, who started competing in motorsports in 1977, became the first winner of the Scooter/Motorbike Open SJOBA Rally in 1981 and went on to become the national champion for five successive years from 1982 to 1987.

Garcha won the rally on a Jawa motorcyle and was told not to compete in the following editions of the rally to give others a chance.

“I was actively involved in planning the route and doing the recce for the rally. I used to have a 1966 JAWA motorbike at that time. After the first stage in the morning, we had lunch at Solan with me in the lead but on the eay back , my bike’s rear brakes got heated. As the route was uphill, I removed the brakes and continued. Riding uphill does not require much of rear brakes and when I reached Barog, the brakes had cooled down and I completed the last stage. I have very find memories of my first win,” says Garcha.

The motorsports champion also used to run a garage in those days. The following years saw him working closely with the Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) and officiating in many rallies besides working as the federation’s regional director. A senior steward and technical delegate with FMSCI, the former rallyist is still involved in charting the route and officiating at the SJOBA Rally. “In the 1980s, we would read books and magzines to learn about various rules and the various formats of a rally. Since the rally was held only in Stage Rally format, it would mean spending hours chalking out the route and understanding the map. There was less traffic and most of the roads were tracks. Despite tech advancements, the core of the racing has remained intact. That’s why a lot of new riders compete every year,” adds Garcha.

Looking back at his long and adventurous innings, Garcha remembers an incident during the Raid De Himalaya. “I was officiating as one of the stewards of the course when one of the cars did not cross the next point. Knowing that something was wrong, we reversed and sure enough, I saw skid marks. It was close to midnight but we launched a search for the car.

Finally. More than 16 months after he cruised to victory in the NDP leadership race, the 40-year-old politician from Ontario clinched his first federal seat in a British Columbia byelection Monday.

Not only will Singh now be able to lead his party from the floor of the House of Commons, he may also have saved his political career, for defeat in Burnaby South on Monday — as many NDP insiders have put it — was simply not an option for the third-place party. Singh’s victory came in one of three byelections held Monday, as voters in key battleground areas cast ballots against the backdrop of the lingering SNC-Lavalin scandal. In York-Simcoe, the Conservatives hold onto a Greater Toronto Area riding that has been a lock for the party since 2004. And here in Outremont, a diverse and multilingual district at the heart of the Island of Montreal, voters returned to their long-established tradition of electing Liberals, 12 years after Thomas Mulcair’s breakthrough here became the symbolic forerunner to the unprecedented success of the “orange wave” election in 2011.

The NDP leader campaigned against a Liberal government he accuses of cosying up to corporate friends, falling short on affordable housing and failing to take climate change seriously. The riding was previously held by Kennedy Stewart, an NDP MP who won by about 500 votes in 2015 and resigned the seat last year to run for Vancouver mayor. David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said a Singh victory is the first bit of good news the NDP has had in a long time. Under Singh’s leadership — which began when he cruised to victory in the October 2017 leadership race — the NDP has stalled in the polls, seen a parade of sitting MPs quit or announce they won’t run again in the general election, and experienced a sharp drop in fundraising from more than $18 million in 2015 to roughly $5 million last year.

Singh’s entry to the House of Commons gives the party a chance to change the narrative, Coletto said. “It gives them a huge opportunity to pivot and to start rebuilding his own reputation,” he said. “Low expectations can be a really powerful tool, because it’s easier to meet them.” Singh’s chances may have been boosted by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which the NDP has used to portray the Liberals as a band of faux-progressive allies of big business. Combined with a Liberal stumble — candidate Karen Wang was replaced by former MLA Richard Lee partway through the race — and the possibility that People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson snags votes from the Conservatives’ Jay Shin, the riding looked primed for a Singh win, said political scientist David Moscrop. “Burnaby South is sort of cooked for him to win,” he said Monday morning. Meanwhile, the results in York-Simcoe pointed to victory for Conservative candidate Scot Davidson. For 14 years, the riding north of Toronto was home to Peter Van Loan, a Harper-era cabinet minister who resigned from the House of Commons last year. That continued Monday with Davidson on pace to beat Liberal challenger — and second-time candidate — Shaun Tanaka. With such a record of Conservative voting, Coletto said he is looking to see how Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party — and local candidate Robert Geurts — performs in the riding. “The most important signal we get from tonight is how well does Max Bernier’s party do,” he said, adding the party could make an impact in all three byelections. “That will give us an indication of the potential effectiveness of his party,” he said. Meanwhile, Outremont was a Liberal stronghold for decades, until Mulcair won it for the NDP in a 2007 byelection. It is therefore hallowed turf for New Democrats, who see Mulcair’s success as the symbolic toehold for the “orange wave” in 2011, when the party was lifted to its best-ever federal election result by overwhelming success in Quebec. But now that Mulcair has left politics, local lawyer Rachel Bendayan wrested Outremont back for the Liberals Monday night. By late Monday, she had a sizable lead over Julia Sanchez, an economist who worked for decades in international development, who campaigned on an environment-focused platform for the NDP. One factor in the race may have been voter reaction to the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has a strong local component given the company is headquartered nearby in downtown Montreal and is a significant employer in the province. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute not-for-profit polling firm, said while early polling has suggested the Liberals have taken a hit during the controversy, SNC-Lavalin is seen in a different light — as a big employer worth saving — by many in the province. But regardless of its impact Monday, it is too early to conclude whether the controversy surrounding the company and Justin Trudeau’s office will linger into the fall general election, Moscrop said. “I think this is a reminder to the Liberals that, boy, you don’t want this in the news in October,” he said. “The sooner you deal with this completely, the better.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Shortly after becoming Premier, Doug Ford demanded changes to his Ontario Provincial Police security detail because he didn’t trust the rotating cast of officers, according to newly disclosed court records.

Internal police e-mails filed in Ontario Divisional Court also show that the Premier’s office was interested in retrofitting a van for his travels, relaying a $50,000 cost estimate to the OPP.

Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair submitted the internal e-mails to bolster his claim that Mr. Ford and his office have interfered in police operations. The senior officer is asking the courts to order the province’s Ombudsman to review the hiring of Mr. Ford’s friend, Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, as the next OPP Commissioner.

Story continues below advertisement

Deputy Commissioner Blair, who was also a front-runner for the position, went public with his concerns in December, alleging that “inappropriate political interference or cronyism” could impact OPP operations. In his filings and correspondence, he alleged the Premier’s office directed a sole-sourced “off-the-books” request for the OPP to refit an executive van for the Premier’s use. He further alleged the Premier relayed to police that he wanted a meeting with then-OPP Commissioner Vince Hawkes to ask him to replace a rotating security detail for Mr. Ford with permanent bodyguards, and if not, ""perhaps a new Commissioner would.”

Deputy Commissioner’s Blair’s most recent court filings, made on Feb. 15, include internal e-mails about Mr. Ford’s concerns and an estimate for the van overhaul. The Premier’s office says, however, he should not be accessing those records and making them public.

“It is extremely troubling that Mr. Blair is apparently using his office to obtain confidential information and documentation and then filing such documents in a public court record to further his own personal agenda in the court process he himself initiated,” said Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for the Premier.

In an e-mail to The Globe, the spokesman added that the allegations about off-the-books purchase requests by the Premier’s office “are a complete fabrication by Mr. Blair and are categorically false.”

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak released a statement saying the van proposal is “wildly inappropriate"" when the government is implementing budget cuts elsewhere. ""It’s the gravy train for Ford, and cuts for everyone else.”

The OPP e-mails filed in court show that in mid-July, just a few weeks after the Progressive Conservative government had taken power, Mr. Ford expressed concern about his shifting cast of police-assigned bodyguards. In an e-mail to his supervisor, an officer assigned to Mr. Ford relayed the Premier’s displeasure as he prepared to travel to a first ministers meeting.

“[W]hat ... is going on? I’m going to Moncton with 3 officers I don’t know. This is too much. ... I keep getting new people in the truck. I just want my own protection team,” Sergeant Terrance Murphy wrote what Mr. Ford told him after he picked him up to go to the airport. He reported the Premier saying he had no faith in newly assigned bodyguards.

“I have not formed the trust with them. I have asked for my own detail of officers who I trust already. It feels like I’m not being heard, like I’m getting f***ed around by the OPP, and I’m getting more pissed off,” the e-mail reads.

“I’m going to call the Commissioner and sort this out,” the Premier then said, according to the e-mail.

In the July e-mail exchange, the police officer quotes Mr. Ford as saying he wanted to meet the then-OPP Commissioner “so he can see how serious I am about this. If he can’t sort this out, then maybe a new Commissioner can make it happen.”

The Premier’s office defended Mr. Ford’s request and again took issue with the release of internal e-mails related to security.

“These types of requests are made by politicians of all stripes, at both the federal and provincial levels of government,” said Mr. Jefferies. “Internal police reports are by definition, in our opinion, highly confidential documents.”

The Globe and Mail reported this week a senior government official warned Deputy Commissioner Blair in December about publicly disclosing any more sensitive OPP materials as part of his court bid.

The OPP e-mail exchanges filed in court further reveal that on Nov. 21, when the hunt for a new commissioner was concluding, the OPP received an e-mailed cost estimate of $50,696 for the interior redesign of an executive van for the Premier’s potential use.

A Mississauga company called A1 Mobility had provided this estimate – which involved installing WiFi, leather seats, a mini-fridge, a couch and a TV – to an executive assistant in the Premier’s office, who in turn relayed it to the police force.

Deputy Commissioner Blair has alleged in court documents that this cost estimate was relayed in a potential contravention of police procurement policies. The Premier’s office says these assertions are “categorically false.”

“As has been repeatedly stated by the Premier, he requested the OPP look into the possibility of obtaining a cost-effective used van for purposes of working and travelling the province,” said Mr. Jefferies. “The e-mails sent to the OPP from a member of the Premier’s Office staff are not an official procurement of a van, instead they are a cost estimate and reveal an effort to minimize expense.”

Mr. Jefferies said the retrofit has not happened. OPP Staff Sergeant Carolle Dionne said the police force would not comment about matters that are being litigated, including what happened to van-retrofit request that was received by the OPP.","Doug Ford demanded changes to his OPP security detail, according to court filings - The Globe and Mail",The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-doug-ford-demanded-changes-to-his-opp-security-detail-according-to/

Duff Conacher, co-founder of the non-partisan organization that advocates for democratic reform and government accountability, expressed concern after the Star first revealed the Tories urged lobbyists to sell tickets to Wednesday’s fundraiser.

“The PC Party asking lobbyists to sell high-priced tickets to the premier’s fundraising event shows that the Ford government is willing to sell access to the premier for cash, and to trade favours with lobbyists, in violation of the interests of the people of Ontario,” he said. Conacher, an adjunct professor of law and politics at the University of Ottawa, said the governing party will “feel compelled to return the favour by protecting the interests of the lobbyists’ clients. “That means the public interest will be violated.”

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford. No one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said during a trade mission to Washington. “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should make the Tories $2 million.

“We have to run campaigns.” As disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories appealed to lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government. The ban on corporate and union donations has made selling tickets a challenge. Until the changes three years ago, which were triggered by a Star probe of Liberal political fundraising excesses, companies could purchase entire tables for dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. But now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wants to continue to do business with the Tories, said there has been “tremendous pressure” on his company to sell tickets. “You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” the consultant said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said Friday that “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner said that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.” Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, has said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.” In November, the Tories repealed a section in the campaign finance reform bill that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees. That new loophole means a company or union could, theoretically, make a political contribution in someone else’s name. The government has emphasized it only made the amendment because the disclosure form was a nuisance to contributors.

After weeks of embarrassing leaks — including revelations in the Star about a new health “super agency” and the opposition NDP’s unauthorized release of a draft government bill — Elliott will table legislation on Tuesday.

“There’s no real surprise in the sense that I’ve said from the beginning that we need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” the minister told reporters Monday at Queen’s Park. “We have some significant problems that we’re dealing with when we have over 30,000 people who are waiting for long-term care beds,” said Elliott. “We have 1,200 people every day in hospitals across Ontario who are receiving health care in hallways and storage rooms; and the wait-list for mental health and addictions is way too long,” she said.

Confirming what the Star first reported on Jan. 17, Elliott said as part of the restructuring there would be a new “super agency” overseeing how health services are delivered. “What we really need to do is focus our health-care system on the patient. That’s what the centre of all of this is about — to make sure that patients’ needs are considered and thought of first and foremost.”

The minister emphasized that the head of the new super agency would not be a patronage appointment. “We are thinking about the people that we are going to be appointing to the agency. We are wanting to make sure that we are connecting with people that are knowledgeable about our health-care system so that’s what we are concentrating on,” she said. “We are finalizing our appointments ... it is going to be a professional person.” In recent months, the Tories have been criticized for appointing friends of Premier Doug Ford, including Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner, 72, the proposed new commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, whose party’s obtaining of draft legislation led to a mid-level government bureaucrat being fired on Feb. 4, said she’s worried about what the revamped system will look like. “They better close this idea of a super agency that’s going to take away the local specifics around what people need in their communities,” said Horwath. “We’re very, very concerned about that,” she said, warning of increased “privatization” in health care. The draft bill, which Elliott downplayed as a “very early” version, would give the new super agency unprecedented powers to contract out health services. One of the leaked documents, titled “agency review weekly status report,” indicates the government has used focus groups to gauge acceptance of the health-overhaul plan. Some 20 existing health agencies are expected to be folded into the new body. Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

The Canadian Press





LETHBRIDGE, Alta. -- A spokeswoman for Alberta Premier Rachel Notley appeared to acknowledge the poor optics of a weekend appearance Notley made at a hospital, which the Opposition says broke rules prohibiting political activity at health facilities.

Cheryl Oates posted on Twitter on Sunday that while Saturday's event was in a public area of the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge, the premier's office will ensure future campaign events are not done at Alberta Health Services facilities.

A picture Notley posted on Twitter of the event showed her standing at a podium with the message ""Rachel Notley, fighting for you"" on it, with health-care workers standing behind her.

United Conservative House Leader Jason Nixon said in a news release that Notley's NDP government and AHS should be investigated by the province's ethics commissioner for what he called a ""partisan campaign event.""

AHS policy states that elected officials may access their facilities for the purpose of carrying out their duties, provided they don't engage in political activity.

The health agency tweeted Sunday that the Notley event was not organized by AHS, and that participants were not representing the agency.

""The AHS Political Activity Policy, which came into effect in March 2012, is designed to maintain AHS's non-partisan role in health-care delivery, and to protect our staff and patients,"" the health agency said in a separate tweet Sunday.

An Alberta election must happen before the end of May, and Notley could call a vote at any time.

""The NDP's use of a public hospital to launch a partisan attack is an unethical abuse of public resources. Alberta's hospitals belong to Albertans, not to the NDP,"" Nixon said in his statement..

Nixon also suggested Notley and her staff broke government rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital.

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney called the event ""an unethical abuse of public resources.

""Stop campaigning at public expense. Call the election,"" Kenney challenged Notley on Twitter.

Oates said on Twitter that ""not a single tax dollar"" went to the announcement.

""The nurses who came to speak out about the dangers of (Kenney's) plan to privatize health care, came on their own time because they are worried about what he will do to front-line services,"" she stated.

Kenney responded by posting that his party will maintain a ""universally accessible, publicly funded health-care system.""",Opposition accuses Alberta premier of breaking rules with event at hospital - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/opposition-accuses-alberta-premier-of-breaking-rules-with-event-at-hospital-1.4310811

Health Minister Christine Elliott says there have been changes from a leaked draft version that the NDP revealed late last month.

The draft bill showed that Ontario was planning a health ""super agency,"" with the proposed legislation allowing the government to roll local health integration networks, Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and other government health agencies under that umbrella.

The NDP has warned that language in the draft bill allows for greater privatization in the health system.

But Elliott has said the legislation will not include two-tier care, private hospitals, making patients pay for more services out of pocket, or privatizing services such as long-term care inspections and the air ambulance service.

Insurance broker Jasvir Deol defeated Edmonton-Mill Creek MLA Denise Woollard. Clinical psychologist Chand Gul also ran for the nomination in the new southeast Edmonton riding, called Edmonton-Meadows.

More than 400 members cast a ballot in the contested nomination, which Woollard called a reflection of democracy. So far, most NDP incumbents have stood for nomination without facing opposition.

""What's really important to remember is that we have a fight on our hands now that the UCP has decided to parachute in an unknown — a manager of a football club of all things — who doesn't live here, doesn't know the people,"" Woollard said.

""[It] tells us that, I think, the UCP would like to see a victory here. So … we need to work together and we need to work pretty fiercely I think, very strongly to maintain this riding as an NDP riding,"" Woollard said.

""The UCP will be throwing money at him and at that campaign. So that makes another bit of an obstacle. There are challenges ahead.""

Deol has lived in the community for 26 years.

""I know the challenges in this community, I know the opportunities,"" he said.

Kenney raised concern on Twitter that the premier was holding a partisan news conference in a public hospital, which is against Alberta Health Services policy.

183,Empty,2019-02-25T16:15:46Z,Jennifer McKenzie has resigned as leader of the New Brunswick NDP a day after members voted for a leadership review.,"Jennifer McKenzie, who tried to move the New Brunswick NDP back to its socialist roots, has resigned as party leader, a day after members voted to hold a leadership convention before the end of August.

In a statement Monday, McKenzie said she was resigning ""effective immediately.""

""The NDP has by a vote this week determined that there will be a leadership convention within the next six months,"" she said. ""I have decided not to participate in such a leadership contest.""

McKenzie has been leader since August 2017 and led the party to a dismal showing in the provincial election last September, when the NDP won no seats.

On Sunday at Moncton's Darts Club, 95 delegates took part in the vote on whether to hold a leadership convention.

The vote was close, with 52 in favour and 43 against, said Danny Légère, who holds a labour seat on the NDP provincial council. He said the results of the 2018 election definitely affected the leadership review.

""At the end of the day, there are some who feel that leadership may be a factor in that,"" he said.

In a Monday afternoon scrum, Jennifer McKenzie told reporters she's proud of the work she did before resigning as leader of the NDP. (CBC)

In a Monday afternoon scrum, McKenzie admitted she was surprised by the result and said she's ""not part of that vision"" of where the party wants to go.

Despite the vote Sunday, McKenzie could have remained leader until a convention, when she could have run against other candidates to try to keep the post. But she chose to resign immediately and said she won't run again for the leadership.

In her statement, McKenzie said she was ""thankful,"" for the opportunity to be leader. Despite the disappointing results of the Sept. 24 election, she said she was glad that the party had a full slate of candidates and that more than 50 per cent of them were women.

McKenzie finished third in Saint John Harbour, the riding represented by the last NDP member of the legislature, Elizabeth Weir, who retired from politics in 2005.

In 2018, the NDP received more than 19,000 votes provincewide, a 60 per cent drop from 2014 and its worst result in a New Brunswick election in 44 years.

McKenzie campaigned on a return to the NDP's socialist beginnings, promising universal childcare, pay equity, home care, better nursing home ratios and pharmacare.

This was a shift from what former leader Dominic Cardy pushed for. He alienated some people by endorsing the Energy East pipeline and distancing himself from unions. He's now a minister in the Progressive Conservative government.

""I was the new kid on the block, and the party was renewing itself and going back to its socialist roots,"" McKenzie said ""That is something that's quite new and different. We haven't seen that for a long time in this province and it's going to take some time to sell.""

In 2018, the NDP received five per cent of the popular vote, down from 11 per cent when Cardy was leader.

The NDP appears to have missed the wave that propelled the two other alternative parties (the Green Party and People's Alliance) to greater success. The Greens had 11 per cent and the Alliance had 12 per cent of the popular vote last election, and each won three ridings.

McKenzie said people may have chosen Green over NDP because there has been confusion about what sets them apart.

""[The Greens] are not a socialist party, they're not a party to the left,"" she said. ""Because we haven't had a lot of socialism and socialist policy in this province, people did not understand the difference.""

4 leaders in 14 years

Since Weir resigned in 2005, the NDP has had four leaders, including McKenzie, who ran for the leadership unopposed.

No date has been set for the leadership convention, which has to be held in the next six months.

The vote was by secret ballot, Légère said, but some people did voice their disagreement with the results.

""Some felt that we shouldn't be changing leaders as often as we do. It wasn't good for the party, that we needed consistency. Some felt otherwise.""

184,Empty,2019-02-25T20:59:03Z,Her intention was apparently to use hospital space to trash her opponent. It was obviously improper and literally indefensible,"We bring you word today of a modest pre-election kerfuffle in Alberta, an event perhaps no bigger than the breath of a butterfly. On Saturday, New Democratic premier Rachel Notley, who will be up for re-election in the next few months, made an appearance at the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge. A premier can find a lot of excuses to visit a hospital. The election campaign has not yet officially begun, and I do not suppose anybody would have done more than grumble if Notley cooked up some pretext for a meeting with health workers, or perhaps even a photo-op with some shiny new sci-fi equipment purchased with government dollars.

But when the premier’s comms team announced Friday that Notley would be using hospital space to “make a statement and answer questions in response to Jason Kenney’s recently announced plans to freeze health care spending and explore privatization of Alberta’s health care system,” that attracted attention. Notley’s intention was apparently to use hospital space to trash her main electoral opponent.

And she did exactly that, with uniformed hospital staff clustered around her. She spoke surrounded by signage that did not read “Government of Alberta,” or anything nonpartisan of the kind, but that instead had the party slogan that is already appearing on NDP election signs around the province: “Rachel Notley. Fighting For You.”

There was no effort at all to give Notley's visit a phony nonpartisan character

This event was obviously improper and literally indefensible. Alberta Health Services, the authority which operates the province’s hospitals, has a policy that is pretty clear. If AHS lacked such a policy, Notley’s action would still be both gross and dumb; but it has one. And that policy says that “AHS facilities shall not be used for any political activity, including, but not limited to, use for the purposes of canvassing, campaigning, making political announcements, touring, and other activities.”

To the degree that there is any exploitable ambiguity about this rule, which is not restricted to official campaign periods, Notley’s communications brainiacs seem to have gone out of their way to destroy it. There was no effort at all to give Notley’s visit a phony nonpartisan character. Her intention to attack a political opponent was explicitly declared. Notley’s communications director Cheryl Oates kinda-sorta-quasi-non-apologized for the event, tweeting “we understand the concern and will ensure future campaign events are not done at AHS facilities.” Conservatives were not slow to notice that Oates had seemingly admitted that the premier had indeed held a “campaign event” in violation of AHS policy.

Alberta has a law mandating fixed election periods, but not specific dates. This provides enough elasticity to allow a premier to hop around the province weeks before an election, making generous infrastructure announcements while keeping the starter’s pistol in its holster. Notley is doing just this, and it is in line with Alberta’s traditions. The Chinook Hospital appearance was a subtly higher, less-familiar level of banana republicanism. Even a Progressive Conservative government of the bad old days would probably have had second thoughts about organizing a Two Minutes’ Hate against the opposition leader in a hospital atrium.

Those bad old days were pretty bad, when it came to politicians of the government party preening with, on and within public works and abusing institutions to obtain re-election. One legitimate reason to vote for Notley’s New Democrats is — or was — that they put a stop to the worst excesses of this sort. Certainly no one should expect a premier or any other politician to behave like a saint. Scheduling pork announcements for maximum convenience and making use of control over the election date: these are all in the game. Even the NDP’s emerging strategy of making the election brutally personal is to be expected. You know I have never been a pious ninny about “negative campaigning.”

But this is a case in which stupidity is the generous explanation for a premier’s conduct — walking into that hospital, seeing the campaign signs, going ahead with the press conference, and never sensing a problem of optics (the politician’s euphemism for “ethics”). More likely she just didn’t care, because the breach of policy will be litigated, and the reporters’ barrage of freedom-of-information requests answered, only after the election.

Moreover, as I write this, there hasn’t been any sign of an actual apology for the Chinook fiasco, as opposed to a promise that it will not happen again now that the NDP has gotten the benefit from it once (in a city that is bound to be in play electorally). Indeed, the New Democrats seem determined to campaign further on the incident, emphasizing how frightened those poor nurses are of the hatchet-wielding monster Jason Kenney. Albertans have never watched a New Democratic government run for re-election, but B.C. and Saskatchewan know what it looks like when the party of labour triumphant pulls out all the stops. It’s not likely to get prettier.

Police say they've closed an investigation dating back to spring 2017. That's when investigators started looking into claims that an HWAD nomination meeting was rigged in favour of federal Conservative staffer Ben Levitt when it should actually have gone to local lawyer Vikram Singh.

Investigators say they uncovered forms that ""appeared to have been falsified"" from the credentials table, where Singh and challenger Jeff Peller have always maintained party officials tipped the scales in Levitt's favour. They even found that one person who appeared to have voted that night died a week earlier.

The forms from the credentials table were ""all marked in what appeared to be a similar manner.... These ballots were all votes for Ben Levitt,"" said police. Police said they interviewed people named on the forms and found they didn't actually attend the meeting and did not vote.

Police seized more than 61 items as evidence, including 1,800 PC Party ballots, 345 credentials referral forms and 1,648 pages of email correspondence. They also interviewed nearly 150 witnesses from multiple jurisdictions and executed 15 judicial authorizations.

But in the end, police say, there wasn't enough to charge anyone.

""Hamilton police have reviewed the matter with the Crown Attorney and at this time, there is insufficient evidence to proceed with the laying of criminal charges,"" police said in a media release Monday.

""During the extensive investigation, several persons of interest were identified. Two arrests were made, but those individuals were subsequently released unconditionally. Hamilton police have reviewed the matter with the Crown Attorney and at this time, there is insufficient evidence to proceed with the laying of criminal charges.""

Vikram Singh, a local lawyer, won the total of seven other voting tables, but Levitt won based on the credentials table. (vsingh.ca)

Singh isn't upset about the lack of charges, and instead expresses gratitude that volunteers and voters supported him.

""I have full faith in Hamilton Police Service, and the detectives who spent countless hours on what appears to be an extensive and thorough investigation,"" he said.

""This story is something to reflect on, for the public and the electorate, to ensure we improve our system.""

The PC party, meanwhile, said Premier Doug Ford wasn't leader of the party when the nomination battle happened, and fixed the mess when he did become leader.

He was ""elected leader of our party on a promise to clean up the mess left behind by Patrick Brown,"" the party said in an email. ""He took immediate action to set aside the nomination and reopened it under a transparent and fair system.

""Questions surrounding the allegations contained in the police report should be directed to Patrick Brown. ""

The HWAD matter dates back to a May 7, 2017 nomination meeting at Ancaster High School.

Levitt, Singh, Peller and Jobson Easow all wanted to run for the PC party in June 2018 in the newly drawn riding. Police found Singh, a Dundas lawyer, won the combined vote of the seven regular voting tables. Levitt's win mainly came from the credentials table, which was staffed by Dykstra, Stanley and PC staffer Logan Bugeja.

Patrick Brown was still Ontario PC party leader. Singh and Peller appealed to the party to investigate, which the party refused. Both then went to the courts and asked for a judicial review.

In court documents, Dykstra said the party felt Singh ""inspired mistrust"" and ""didn't fit the right demographic."" He also said the party could pick whoever it wanted, regardless of who won at a nomination meeting.

Peller eventually dropped his challenge. Singh continued, and went to court to try to unveil a surreptitiously recorded conversation between himself and some party insiders. The court turned that down, saying the conversation had been part of trying to reach a settlement.

The party was also successful in getting the court to rule that Singh hand over $136,315 for legal costs over the secret recording.

In the end, Singh dropped his challenge too. Levitt asked for another nomination meeting, which he won. Singh wanted to run for that nomination but his application wasn't accepted.

The HWAD incident was just one of several PC nomination challenges at the time. In the end, Brown was ousted from the party following sexual misconduct allegations. Doug Ford became the leader, and eventually premier.

(the BS-Line), this is far from a done deal. The unfolding corruption scandal at SNC-Lavalin and the company’s proprietary role in SkyTrain technology puts this Millennium Line extension in question. The underlying assumptions that have been used to justify the subway also do not add up, regarding projections of growth, ridership or technology performance of various options.

The recommendations for a SkyTrain subway to UBC are based on a report that updates the 2012 SNC-Lavalin/Steer Davies Gleave report. Since SNC-Lavalin is the main supplier of SkyTrain throughout the region, it is not surprising SkyTrain was their recommendation, and since the current update is based on the 2012 report, it would come to the same conclusion again.

The Expo and Millennium Lines are a proprietary unconventional railway, of which the technical patents are owned by Bombardier and the engineering patents owned by SNC-Lavalin.

“Only seven lines have been built in almost 40 years, with only three seriously used for urban transport. Why is Metro Vancouver now the only region in the world that continues to build with SkyTrain?” asks Malcolm Johnson of the group Rail for the Valley.

Given SNC-Lavalin’s proprietary rights for SkyTrain technology and its ongoing criminal prosecution for fraud and corruption that could result in a ban from bidding on government projects in Canada, the mayors requested confirmation that other companies beside SNC-Lavalin could competitively provide SkyTrain technology.

SNC-Lavalin is already banned from bidding on Word Bank projects due to corruption, and Bombardier is also being investigated.

There also are the questionable underlying assumptions of growth and ridership projections used to justify a SkyTrain subway.

Simple solutions that could be implemented immediately have been avoided to reinforce the narrative that a subway on Broadway is the only option to serve ridership to UBC and that the system is already at capacity. Commuters have been held hostage for over a decade to justify this scheme.

Alternate routes such as along Fourth Ave. have been under-served while increased commuters from the opening of the Evergreen Line have been dumped on Broadway rather than diverted to other less-congested routes with express or expanded B-Line buses.

Also, the mode comparative costs have been biased to SkyTrain. UBC Professor Patrick Condon has shown how LRT tram systems throughout Europe and North America are built for under $50 million per kilometre, while the evaluation report vastly inflates costs to $282 million per kilometre.

The $4-billion SkyTrain subway 7.1-kilometre extension from Arbutus to UBC would be about $563 million per kilometre. Both LRT and subway estimates include a 30- to 50-per-cent contingency, even though the subway has much more risk of unknowns with underground streams and utilities to divert.

The whole 13-kilometre SkyTrain subway from VCC to UBC would be at least $7 billion. If LRT was used, the whole route could be continuously built without a transfer point for much less than the $2.8 billion already committed for the phase to Arbutus. However, that option is not part of the updated report.

If they proceed with the subway, it will be enormously disruptive and damaging to local businesses all along the route for years. Many business owners are already panicking, knowing that even with a bored tunnel there will be cut and cover at every station and for utilities. And it is still a possibility of a bait and switch like SNC-Lavalin did for Canada Line when approvals were for boring while the resulting contract was for cut and cover. There is a lot of money at stake.

Of course, the biggest money is in the development along the line. Development is really what this is all about.

But this anticipated development is not needed to meet growth and will mostly serve the global capital that will further undermine affordability. The subway extension from Arbutus to UBC is predicated on using development fees to help fund it. This will require large amounts of density bonusing for luxury condos at UBC, Jericho Lands, station areas and other sites, on top of rental development that is exempt from development fees.

So rather than development fees going to pay for civic amenities like replacement of community centre facilities at Jericho Hill, it will be going to pay for the provincial, federal and TransLink responsibilities of transit funding. This is an encroachment onto the municipal tax base. Already, TransLink is getting a regional property tax and development fee to pay for the subway’s first phase to Arbutus.

In October 2016, Green Vancouver Coun. Adriane Carr brought forward a motion, seconded by NPA Coun. Melissa De Genova, that opposed the use of development fees to fund transit. It was voted down by Vision. But now both incumbents and their parties (except for Coun. Colleen Hardwick) voted for the subway extension that included funding from development fees.

Vancouver city staff have confirmed that the number of projected new units is beyond that justified for projected population growth. And existing zoned capacity is already well beyond what is needed to meet projected growth to 2040. Yet the rush to rezone continues.

These policies go back to the failed EcoDensity policies of 2007. Former NPA mayor Sam Sullivan copyrighted the name and his then-director of planning, Brent Toderian, defined the program. After the 2008 election, when Sullivan and the NPA were wiped off council except for one seat, he said that he was a victim of density. But Vision, which promised to reconsider EcoDensity, just rebranded it with Toderian as the Greenest City.

Then Vision also approved the regional change from the Livable Region Strategic Plan to the Regional Growth Strategy. This included regional designation of Frequent Transit Development Areas that Broadway, like Cambie, is destined to become if the subway is implemented.

From 2007, the city was warned that making density and growth a primary objective would lead to massive displacement. Demolition of existing affordable rentals, character/heritage houses, secondary suites, and small businesses, would be replaced with much more expensive new construction. And that has come to pass with an affordability crisis as predicted, that will be expanded with the Broadway subway, BS-Line, corridor planning currently underway.

Sullivan now is a provincial MLA as the B.C. Liberal critic for municipal affairs. He is proposing to take away municipal land-use authority on areas around transit to further expedite this tower development agenda. The B.C. budget makes reference to expediting delivery of development project approvals, so the NDP may be looking at encroaching on municipal land-use authority too.

All this just goes to show that bad ideas are not necessarily left or right politically and can continue through various regimes. Although Vision was wiped off council in the last election, without different directions to staff from the new council, we will continue to have more of the same. But the Broadway subway is not a done deal yet and this can be turned around like the freeways and urban renewal schemes of the 1960s.

FA can be further enzymatically converted in other commercially interesting molecules, such as vanillin and bioplastics. In several organisms, these transformations often start with a common step of FA activation via CoA-thioesterification, catalyzed by feruloyl-CoA synthetases (Fcs). In this context, these enzymes are of biotechnological interest for conversion of lignin-derived FA into high value chemicals. In this study, we describe the first structural characterization of a prokaryotic Fcs, named FCS1, isolated from a lignin-degrading microbial consortium. The FCS1 optimum pH and temperature were 9 and 37°C, respectively, with Km of 0.12 mM and Vmax of 36.82 U/mg. The circular dichroism spectra indicated a notable secondary structure stability at alkaline pH values and high temperatures. This secondary structure stability corroborates the activity data, which remains high until pH 9. The Small Angle X-Ray Scattering analyses resulted on the tertiary/quaternary structure and the low-resolution envelope in solution of FCS1, which was modeled as a homodimer using the hyperthermophilic nucleoside diphosphate-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase from Candidatus Korachaeum cryptofilum. This study contributes to the field of research by establishing the first biophysical and structural characterization for Fcs, and our data may be used for comparison against novel enzymes of this class that to be studied in the future.

Currently, the vast majority of scientific articles related to Fcs concentrate on its application for vanillin production, when combined with the action of an enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase [ 29 – 35 ]. In addition to that, there is literature focusing on the description of Fcs transcriptional regulatory mechanism and its role in FA degradation [ 36 – 39 ]. Currently, there is no solved structure of prokaryotic Fcs, as well as, a gap of studies analyzing the biophysical properties of this enzyme. In this study, it is presented a comprehensive biophysical characterization and low-resolution envelope, along with the structural stability and biochemical characteristics, of a Fcs, namely FCS1, which was derived from a lignin degrading consortium.

Physiologically, this class of enzymes is of particular importance in the sensing of aromatic molecules by microorganisms and activation of respective pathways. The product of the reaction catalyzed by Fcs, feruloyl-CoA, binds to a MarR-family transcriptional repressor and effectively abrogates its ligation to the DNA, thus enabling the expression of genes related to the degradation of FA and other related p-hydroxycinnamic acids in several species [ 23 – 27 ]. Recently, the metagenomic profiling of a lignin-degrading consortium, originated from soil of a sugarcane plantation [ 28 ], revealed the major metabolic pathways related to degradation of phenolic compounds, including a number of putative sequences correspondent to Fcs, denoting the catabolism of FA and other p-hydroxycinnamates.

In prokaryotes, FA catabolism occurs via four major pathways: non β-oxidation, β-oxidation, non-oxidative decarboxylation, and side-chain reduction [ 22 ]. The first two pathways employ Fcs as initial step, by catalyzing the CoA-thioesterification of FA in feruloyl-CoA, with ATP consumption. The subsequent reactions direct the intermediates towards ring fission by the central metabolism, usually via vanillin and, posteriorly, through the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway.

Several research groups are currently focusing in strategies for lignin valorization, mainly exploring chemical catalysis and biological degradation approaches. The latter revolves around “mimicking” nature’s strategies for lignin degradation and consequent carbon cycling, mainly through the identification, characterization and improvement of lignin-degrading organisms and their enzymes. Traditionally, white-rot fungi are the best characterized lignin degraders and there is extensive literature on the enzymatic mechanisms of fungal lignin peroxidases [ 9 , 10 ]. Recently, bacterial degraders have also been the focus of research, not only concerning their capability of lignin depolymerization, but also the catabolism of aromatic molecules derived from its breakdown [ 11 – 13 ]. Therefore, there is great opportunity for genetic and metabolic engineering of microbial pathways, aiming the conversion of lignin in value-added products [ 14 – 16 ]. FA is the precursor of subunit guaiacyl in lignin biosynthesis, is near ubiquitous in plant cells walls of various grasses, where it endows structural rigidity and resistance by cross-linking to pentosan, arabinoxylans and hemicelluloses [ 17 ]. As biorefineries adapt to meet the cellulosic ethanol production goals, it is expected that FA, as other cinnamic acid derivatives, will play a major role as resources for bioproducts. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the successful production of vanillin [ 18 – 20 ] and bioplastics [ 21 ] from FA derived from lignin streams and lignocellulosic biomass.

In comparison with first generation biofuels, which utilize sucrose or starch as source of fermentable sugars, the lignocellulosic biomass-reliant second-generation counterparts are considered more cost-effective and less threatening to food security and land usage policies [ 2 ]. Nevertheless, the full implementation of second generation biorefineries is hindered by considerable technological and economical hurdles, including feedstock recovery, biomass pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation optimization and biofuel separation [ 3 , 4 ]. In this context, lignin conversion and valorization has emerged as a possible solution for both cost-effectiveness of second-generation biorefineries and excessive reliance on petroleum-derived chemicals [ 5 – 7 ]. It is predicted that the amount of lignin residue from cellulosic biorefineries solely in the USA will reach as much as 62 million tons per year [ 8 ], denoting the great opportunity of valorizing this stream into high-market compounds.

Lignocellulosic biomass harbors a barely explored mine of fermentable sugars and aromatic polymers as structural components. The cellulose and lignin fractions represent the first and second most abundant sources of organic carbon on Earth, respectively, rendering lignocellulose as an attractive possibility for alternative resource of fuels and chemicals [ 1 ].

The ELS measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern) [ 61 , 62 ]. The measurements were performed using a fixed FCS1 concentration of 13.4 μM (1 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values. FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to ELS measurements.

The Fluorescence emission measurements were performed on a steady-state spectrofluorometer model Cary Eclypse Varian. FCS1 concentration was 5 μM (0.38 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values (pH 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to measurements. The three tryptophan residues of FCS1 were excited at 295 nm (20 o C) and the fluorescence emission was measured from 300 to 450 nm. The buffer contribution was subtracted in each of the experiments. The measurements were made in triplicate and the average values reported.

The CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter. FCS1 concentration was 10 μM (0.75 mg/mL) in 20 mM acetate–borate–phosphate buffer adjusted at different pH values (pH 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). FCS1 was incubated overnight in the corresponding buffer prior to measurements. All spectra were measured using a 1 mm quartz cuvette at 20 o C over the wavelength range from 190 to 270 nm. For each pH value, eight scans (obtained on degree scale, mdeg) were averaged to form the final CD spectrum. Furthermore, CD measurements were collected at pH 7 and different temperature values (20, 60, 70 and 90 o C). The buffer contribution was subtracted in each of the experiments.

The SAXS measurements were performed at the SAXS beamline of National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). SAXS measurements for FCS1 were performed at 1 and 5 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer adjusted at pH 7. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000xg for 10 min (at 4 o C) and then loaded into a 1 mm path length cell made of two thin parallel mica windows and maintained at 20 o C during the measurements. The wavelength of the X-ray beam was 1.48 Å and the sample-to-detector distance (1 m) was adjusted to record the scattering intensity for q values ranging from 0.013 to 0.340 Å -1 . A total of five successive frames of 60 s were recorded for each sample and buffer scattering was measured before each sample scattering. The X-ray patterns were recorded employing a two-dimensional CCD detector (MarResearch, USA) and the integration were performed by the FIT2D software [ 56 ]. The scattering of water measured on the same sample cell was used to normalize the data to absolute scale. The distance distribution function was evaluated using the GNOM software [ 57 ]. At least eight dummy atom models (DAMs) were calculated using the DAMMIN software [ 58 ] without imposing any symmetry restrictions, and the resulting models were compared with each other using the DAMAVER software [ 59 ]. The CRYSOL software [ 60 ] was used to generate theoretical scattering curves from the three-dimensional structures. The atomic coordinates of the low-resolution model of FCS1 are available from the corresponding author upon request.

The hydrodynamic radius (R H ) of the FCS1 was determined by dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer, Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK). This system employs a fixed scattering angle of 173 o . DLS measurements for FCS1 were performed at 1 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer adjusted at pH 7. The hydrodynamic radius was converted to molecular mass (kDa) considering a spherical molecule and using the Zetasizer software.

The servers for remote protein homology detection HHPRED [ 49 ] and PHYRE2 [ 50 ] were used to search for homologs for FCS1 in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [ 51 ]. Molecular model for FCS1 was built using homology-modeling methods and the MODELLER software [ 52 ]. The alignment of the amino acids sequence of FCS1 against the amino acids sequence of NDP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Candidatus Korachaeum cryptofilum (ckcACD) [ 53 ] was used as input to the MODELLER software, together with the atomic coordinates of the latter (PDB 4XYL, dimeric structure) used as template. The homology model was modeled as a dimer. The template (PDB 4XYL) has 4 chains (A, B, C and D). The chains A and B served as templates for the chain A of our model (monomer), while the chains C and D served as templates for the chain B of our model. Sequences were aligned with Protein BLAST [ 54 ]. Conservation analysis was conducted with T-Coffee [ 55 ] software using 1.002 sequences with E-value < 1e-100.

For thermostability determination, purified FCS1 in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was incubated at room temperature, 25, 37, 45, 70 and 85°C for 15, 30 and 60 min. For evaluation of enzyme stability in different pHs, 400 ng of purified FCS1 was incubated for 1, 5 and 24 h in 20 mM ABF buffer, pH 7.0–10.0, at 4 ºC. Residual activity was assayed as described in the enzymatic assay topic (incubation at 37°C for 10 min) and immediately read at 345 nm.

The enzymatic activity in a range of pHs was assayed in either 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pHs 5.8–8.0) or 20 mM (acetate-borate-phosphate) buffer (pHs 7.4–9.4). After stopping FCS1 reaction by heat inactivation (70°C for 15 min), the was pH neutralized to 7.8 by adding a highly ionic strength buffer (phosphate buffer at 2 M). Then, the volume of 150 μL of each reaction were collected and absorbance at 345 nm was read immediately. As controls, reactions without added enzyme were used for each temperature and pH value evaluated. All reactions and controls were made in triplicate and the average values reported. All initial assays were conducted with an additional control containing FA and heat-inactivated enzyme.

The temperature range from 15°C to 90°C was chosen for determination of FCS1 optimal temperature. A total volume of 200 μL reactions (as described above) were incubated at the temperature range in a T100 thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) for 5 min, using the assay do conditions described above.

For determination of kinetic parameters of FCS1, the above reaction was assayed with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.05 mM to 0.50 mM. Mathematical adjustments were made using the software Graph Pad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software) to calculate the parameters. The assays were performed in triplicate and at least three independent experiments were carried out.

The enzymatic assays were adapted from previously described methods [ 47 , 48 ], the schematic reaction was included in S1 Fig . The reaction mixture (200 μL) contained 2.5 mM of MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM of FA, 2.0 mM of ATP, 0.4 mM of coenzyme A, 40 ng of purified FCS1 and 100 mM of potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8. The activity assay was initiated by the addition of the enzyme and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Following incubation, 150 μL of the reaction were used to read the absorbance at 345 nm due to formation of feruloyl-CoA (ε 345nm = 1.9 x 10 4 M -1 cm -1 ), using an Epoch2 Microplate Reader spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) containing 0.3 mg/mL of lysozyme, 1 mM of DNase and 5 mM of phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, under agitation, the cells were disrupted in ice bath by an ultrasonic processor (10 pulses of 30 s at 30% duty cycle; Ultrasonic Homogenizer 4710 Series, Cole-Palmer Instruments). The soluble protein fractions were obtained by centrifugation for 1 h and 30 min at 8,000 rpm, 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was filtered once in 0.45 μm and twice in 0.22 μm filters. The final solution containing the protein of interest was purified by affinity chromatography in AKTA Start system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) using a 5 mL HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) charged with Co 2+ and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Elution of FCS1 was achieved using a 0–100% linear gradient of buffer B (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole). Afterwards, the eluted protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/600 GL column (GE Healthcare) in buffer C (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl). Buffer Exchange and protein concentration were performed using Amicon device (Merck, USA). The concentration of purified FCS1 was measured by DeNovix DS-11 spectrophotometer (ε 280nm = 43,570 M -1 cm -1 ) (Uniscience, USA) and by Bradford quantification [ 46 ]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using a 12.5% gel in a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra System electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 for 3 h and distained in distilled water overnight.

The cells from a single colony of E. coli BL21 (DE3) containing the construction pET28a-FCS1 were grown in liquid LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/mL) for 16 h at 37°C and 200 rpm. 8 mL of the overnight culture were used to inoculate 800 mL of fresh LB-kanamycin medium, followed by incubation at 37°C and 200 rpm until the optical density (OD) at 600 nm reached a value of 0.6–0.8. To induce recombinant protein expression, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, followed by incubation at 30°C, 200 rpm for 4 h. After expression, the culture media was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 4°C for 15 min and the cell pellet was kept at -20°C.

FCS1 sequence (GenBank accession: MG214406) was retrieved, codon-optimized, synthetized and cloned as previously described [ 28 ]. This previous work also showed the enzyme applicability for bioproduction of vanillin, together with an enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase. The domain architecture of the enzyme, named FCS1, was further evaluated using the Pfam and SMART databases [ 40 – 42 ]. Calculation of biochemical and biophysical parameters for the putative protein sequence were performed via Protparam [ 43 ] online tool. The annotation of orthologous groups was done by comparison against the EggNOG 4.5.1 database [ 44 ]. The phylogenetic tree was built with MEGA 7 [ 45 ].

188,Empty,2019-02-25T19:41:20Z,"Government has included renewables in the country's energy mix as part of plans to mitigate the impact of climate change, says energy Minister Jeff Radebe.","Although there have been calls for the scrapping of independent power producers from some quarters, including trade union the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and opposition party the Economic Freedom Fighters, government is determined IPPs are here to stay to ensure security of electricity supply.

Among other objections, the announcement of the unbundling of Eskom stirred fears job losses in the coal sector, particularly through the introduction of renewable IPPs in the generation space.

In response, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe on Sunday held a briefing to clarify government's rationale for including renewables in the country's energy mix.

Here are the five reasons outlined by Radebe:

1. Climate change

SA committed itself to the Paris Agreement to mitigate the effects of climate change. This means SA must make a contribution to a global effort in reducing carbon emissions and other ""climate resilient"" developments, Radebe said.

""The basic rationale behind renewable energy is therefore arresting the high negative impact of fossil fuel sources of energy such as oil and coal.""

Renewable IPPs so far have reduced carbon emissions by 33.2 million tonnes, in addition to carbon dioxide and water savings of 39.2 million kilolitres by December 31, 2018, the minister added.

2. Energy policy

The decision to include renewables in the electricity system dates back to a 1998 White Paper on Energy Policy. In November 2003, the ANC-led government adopted the White Paper on Renewable Energy. It sets a target for 10 000 GW hours to be achieved by 2013. At the time, Eskom's generation was 90% dependent on coal and government had made a decision to move away from solely being reliant on fossil fuels, Radebe explained.

The Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) 2010, promulgated on May 6, 2011, indicated that by 2030, 17 800 MW of new capacity would be provided by renewable energy.

Furthermore, a Green Economy Accord was negotiated by social partners and government and signed on November 17, 2011 – which makes commitments to developing a ""greener economy"". Among other things, it sets a target of 3 725 MW to be generated from renewable energy by 2016.

Vision 2030 under the National Development Plan (NDP) also calls for SA to invest in skills, technology and institutional capacity to support a competitive renewable energy sector to leverage its solar resource. The NDP, adopted in 2012, states SA needs at least 20 000 MW of renewable energy by 2030.

3. Lack of investment in coal projects

Locally commercial banks such as Standard bank and Nedbank are ""no more willing"" to support coal-fired power projects, Radebe said.

Internationally, countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are also against funding coal projects due to climate concerns.

The World Bank and other international development finance institutions and commercial banks have instituted a no-coal policy.

China, India and the US and others are also down-scaling coal-fired fleets.

4. Renewable energy is becoming cheaper

Radebe said that initially, renewable energy programmes were ""relatively higher in pricing"", but costs have since declined. ""Steep falls [have been] recorded from wind and solar PV technologies,"" he said.

Radebe listed an example of how wind technology was first priced at 151 c/kWh in November 2011, but has since fallen to 62 c/kWh by 2016.

5. Positive impact on the economy

Radebe highlighted the benefits of renewable energy to the economy, which includes attracting investment commitments of R209.4bn from the private sector.

Renewable IPPs have also created 38 701 job years, meaning full-time jobs have been created for 38 701 people for one year. Local communities have also benefited from over R1bn spent by IPPs on education initiatives, among other socio-economic upliftment projects.",Fin24.com | 5 reasons renewables are here to stay,Fin24.com,https://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/5-reasons-renewables-are-here-to-stay-20190225-2
189,Empty,2019-02-25T09:35:57Z,"Next‐generation metallodrugs: This Review aims to critically evaluate the potential of polyoxometalates, especially organically functionalized hybrid and nanocomposite structures, as future clinically applied metallodrugs in the combat against cancer. Abstrac…","Monitoring of the FITC labeled {Eu(SiW 11 O 39 ) 2 }–CMC within HeLa cells showed that the nanoparticles were preferably located in the perinuclear region in close proximity to the nuclei. 98 Clathrin‐mediated endocytosis was proposed as POM‐free chitosan nanoparticles are internalized by this pathway; however, this was later excluded as the cellular uptake of POM‐CT was not inhibited by the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine indicating a clathrin‐independent pathway. 99 Thus, macropinocytosis and caveolae‐mediated endocytosis were suggested as internalization pathways for, at least, POM‐CT hybrids as chitosan‐DNA‐poly(γ‐glutamic acid) complexes are uptaken by these pathways. 125

Nevertheless, it is still generally assumed that POMs are mainly taken up by cells by some form of endocytosis. Different POTs were traced within murine macrophage J774 cells revealing POM containing vacuoles within the cells, wherefore, it was suggested that POMs might bind to scavenger receptors and enter the cell by scavenger receptor‐mediated endocytosis. 124 Similarly, huge POMo nanoparticles such as (NH 4 ) 42 [{(Mo VI )Mo 5 VI O 21 (H 2 O) 6 } 12 {Mo 2 V O 4 (CH 3 COO) 30 }] were found to be located within endosomes that were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of Hep‐G2 cells, supporting internalization by an endocytotic pathway. 119

The antiproliferative activity of an anticancer drug is directly associated with its degree of cellular uptake. It is well accepted that POMs are able to penetrate cancer cells, as many studies have experimentally confirmed their location within the cytoplasmic space. 46 , 99 , 109 - 111 , 119 However, no convincing data has been reported revealing the exact mechanism. Owing to their large size and negative charge, POMs are supposed to be rather unable to penetrate the largely negatively charged cell membranes of mammalian cells. POMs such as the Keggin‐type were characterized as super chaotropic agents with a surprisingly high tendency to adsorb on neutral and hydrophilic surfaces, whereby POMs with lower charge densities were more chaotropic. 120 Owing to this feature, POMs exhibited destructive activity towards model cell membranes by adsorbing to the vesicle surface, followed by the formation of a stable POM–lipid conjugate, which finally desorbs from the membrane (Figure 10 ). 121 , 122 These desorption processes led to leaky membrane structures. Studies with anionic lipids revealed that depending on the charge density, the POM–lipid interactions can switch from electrostatic to hydrophobic nature, owing to the charge neutralization by cationic counterions. 123

3.2 Proposed Modes of Action and Biological Targets of Antitumoral Polyoxometalates

Figure 11 shows most of the putative mechanisms of antitumoral POMs in a comprehensive Scheme. The first suggested mechanism for the antitumor activity of POMs was that by Yamase, which was already mentioned in the introduction.19 Briefly, repeated reduction/oxidation cycles between the POM and cell components, most likely members of the electron transport chain, are supposed to interfere with ATP generation, which finally leads to apoptosis (Figure 11 a). The theory is widely accepted, as a series of studies revealed a putative correlation between the cytotoxicity and the redox potential of bioactive POMs.38-44 This correlation is a weak one and only applies to very closely related structures, as other factors like size, structure, and composition play also a significant role. In general, there is no unambiguous correlation between the anticancer activity of POMs and parameters such as POM size, total net charge, charge density, oxidation power, and archetype.

The figure depicts the activation of NK cells via antibody binding enhancing the recognition of tumor cells (antigens are depicted as purple triangles) by NK cells.

The release of cytochrome c (purple circle) triggers the apoptotic machinery of the cell, which ultimately activate the final executers of apoptosis (caspases).

3.2.1 Activation of Cell Death Pathways Apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy are types of cell death, which are generally highly sophisticated processes including complex signaling cascades that are tightly regulated. According to Section 2, a number of POMs induced apoptosis by the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway as no study describes, for example, the involvement of a death receptor, which is a hallmark for extrinsic apoptosis. The reason for this is that most POMs mainly induced “internal damage” by oxidative stress, which is signaled to mitochondria (Figure 12 b). Some POMs like the Wells–Dawson POM are able to induce apoptosis by affecting the expression of cell death regulators, for example, by increasing the amount of the pro‐apoptotic proteins Bax and Bim (Figure 12 c).126, 127 Other POMs, such as Krebs‐type, do also reduce the expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein bcl‐2 and the transcriptional factor NF‐κB (Figure 12 c).33, 34 Active NF‐κB is responsible for the expression of genes that protect the cell from undergoing apoptosis, however, many tumor types have a constantly active NF‐κB and therefore its inhibition represents a promising approach in cancer therapy. Furthermore, Krebs‐type tungstobismuthates are able to increase the expression of p53 activating apoptosis partially by this pathway (Figure 12 d).33 The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that induces anti‐carcinogenesis events such as cell growth arrest and inhibition of angiogenesis, making it the guardian of the genome and one of the most promising targets as about 50 % of human cancers are thought to be related to p53 mutations.128 Some POMs like the CoII containing Krebs‐type (H 2 im) 2 [(W(OH) 2 ) 2 (Co(H 2 O) 3 ) 2 (Na 4 (H 2 O) 14 )(BiW 9 O 33 ) 2 ] are able to enhance the activation of caspase‐3, the final executioner of apoptosis.35, 127 Na 7 [CrIIICuIIW 11 O 39 ] was observed to induce the upregulation of both cytochrome c and activated p38 in human ovarian SK‐OV‐3 cancer cells (Figure 12 e), despite its very low anticancer activity (IC 50 =1.87 mm).127 Cytochrome c is an essential component of the electron transport chain but plays also a decisive role in apoptosis as its release from the mitochondria into the cytosol upon apoptotic stimuli triggers apoptosis.129 Thus, POM‐induced overexpression of cytochrome c can promote cell death. p38 is a mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) that has oncogenesis suppressing properties as it is required for dormancy, that is, inhibition of the cell proliferation upon certain stress stimuli.130 Furthermore, Na 7 [CrIIICuIIW 11 O 39 ] is also able to trigger autophagy, which means that two cell death pathways can run in parallel. The same was observed for PM‐17 as it induced apoptotic and autophagic cell death in vitro and in vivo.18 The sandwich POM [H 4 {CuII 9 AsIII 6 O 15 (H 2 O) 6 }(AsIIIW 9 O 33 ) 2 ]8− exhibited remarkable activity against cancerous K‐562 (leukemia) and Hep‐G2 (liver) cells (IC 50 =0.4 μm for both) by affecting lysosomes in vitro, which led to the induction of both apoptosis and autophagy.131 The autophagy inducing property might originate from the AsIII containing unit as As 2 O 3 is known to induce autophagy in leukemia cells by increasing the level of Beclin‐1, a critical regulator of autophagy.132

3.2.2 DNA Interaction One of the main stimuli inducing intrinsic apoptosis is DNA damage. Therefore, the anticancer activity of a series of POMs and POM‐based hybrids was associated with DNA lesions but mainly induced indirectly as the negative charge of both molecules is supposed to prevent direct electrostatic interactions. However, some POM‐based structures were found to directly interact with DNA (Figure 12 f), for example, [(CpTi) 3 SiW 9 O 37 ]7− interacts strongly with DNA, most likely via its CpTi moiety.43, 47 These results were confirmed by the group of Habibi, which investigated the behavior of different CpM‐substituted Keggin POTs (M=ZrIV, TiIV, FeII) towards ctDNA and suggested a direct but noncovalent groove or outside stacking binding mode for the POM.46 Later, the number of POMs directly interacting with ctDNA was extended, including [PV 2 Mo 10 O 40 ]5− and [V 18 O 42 (H 2 O)]12−.31, 109-111 Despite the suggested groove or outside stacking interaction, the exact POM binding mechanism remains elusive. Another study investigating the interaction between heptamolybdate [Mo 7 O 24 ]6− and the DNA model bis(p‐nitrophenyl)phosphate showed that the POM was able to cleave the phosphodiester bond by a yet unknown mechanism.133

3.2.3 Inhibition of Angiogenesis Angiogenesis describes the formation of new blood vessels, a vital process in cell growth.134 As cancer cells are rapidly dividing, tumors need special blood supply to provide oxygen and other nutrients to continue their abnormal growth. Thus, they induce angiogenesis by activating various growth factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which stimulate the formation of blood vessels. The inhibition of angiogenesis promoting factors is a potential approach in cancer therapy. A series of POMs, including lacunary and fully saturated Keggin, sandwich Keggin, and Wells–Dawson structures, interact strongly with bFGF leading to the inhibition of its proliferation promoting activity in HUVECs.135, 136 Independent of the charge, Wells–Dawson POMs were most efficient in binding bFGF and therefore it was assumed that the POM structure determines the affinity towards bFGF. Competition assays with suramin, which is known for its angiosuppressive properties, and heparin, an activity enhancer and inhibitor of bFGF, revealed that POMs bind in the vicinity of the heparin binding site, which is rich in positively charged amino acids. According to the dimensions of the proposed binding site, Wells–Dawson structures are supposed to fit better into it than the smaller Keggin ions, which might explain the differences in binding affinity (Figure 12). POM binding might interfere with the ability of bFGF to interact with its receptors, which is required for its angiogenesis promoting function (Figure 12 g). Figure 12 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Putative POM‐binding site of bFGF. a) Crystal structure of human bFGF (PDB entry 1BFF137) with the putative binding site being marked by a red circle. Side chains of amino acids that potentially contribute to heparin binding are shown as sticks. b) Coulombic surface representation of bFGF is illustrated with blue surfaces representing regions exhibiting a positive potential, whereas gray and red surfaces possess neutral and negative potentials, respectively. c) Zoom view and dimensions of the putative POM‐binding site. d) Polyhedra structures and dimensions of the Keggin and Wells–Dawson anions for easier comparison. Blue polyhedra are {MO 6 }, green polyhedra {XO 4 }, green sticks carbon, dark blue sticks nitrogen, red sticks and spheres oxygen. Mo‐based giant POMs like (NH 4 ) 42 [{(MoVI)Mo 5 VIO 21 (H 2 O) 6 } 12 {Mo 2 VO 4 (CH 3 COO) 30 }] exhibited astonishing anticancer activities against some cancer cell lines with high selectivity towards Hep‐G2 cells (IC 50 =9–55 μg mL−1) mainly by inhibiting angiogenesis (Supporting Information, Table S1, described as Mo‐compounds 1–3).119 The Mo‐nanoparticles impaired the formation of blood vessels by inhibiting key processes of angiogenesis, namely VEGF‐induced proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells (HUVECs) and neovascularization on CAM (chorio‐allantoic membrane). Furthermore, the level of NO, a mediator of angiogenesis, was also significantly reduced in the presence of the POMos as was the VEGF‐induced phosphorylation of signal‐regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (AKT), signaling processes normally associated with the promotion of angiogenesis (Figure 13 h).

3.2.4 Interaction with Proteins Owing to their negative charge and their tendency to bind to neutral or hydrophilic surfaces, POMs interact with an array of proteins.138 Ectonucleotidases are membrane‐associated enzymes that hydrolyze extracellular nucleotides to the respective nucleosides and are thus involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes.139 They can be subdivided into four families, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatases (NPPs), alkaline phosphatases (APs), and ecto‐5′‐nucleotidase (eN). POMs are potent inhibitors of ectonucleotidases, with some of them being superior to known inhibitors (Figure 13 i; Supporting Information, Table S17).140 Crystallographic studies investigating the interaction of decavanadate, metatungstate, octa‐, and heptamolybdate with rat and bacterial NTPDase1 revealed that decavanadate and heptamolybdate bind either at the periphery (rat NTPDase) or deep inside the active site cleft (bacterial NTPDase) of the enzyme at positively charged patches, where they interact with substrate binding residues (Figure 13).141, 142 Therefore, it was suggested that enzyme inhibition occurs by blocking the nucleotide‐active site interaction. Octamolybdate (Figure 13 i) is located at the entrance of the active site cleft and could also interfere with substrate binding. Interestingly, one of the most potent inhibitors, metatungstate, binds distantly from the active site and therefore the inhibitory effect might result from POM‐mediated destabilization of the entire enzyme structure. Figure 13 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint POM‐binding sites of NTPDase1 from Legionella pneumophila. The structure of bacterial NTPDase1 consists of two domains (cyan and green cartoon) with the interface forming the active site cleft. The depicted structure is taken from PDB entry 4BVO142 as model example. The interacting amino acid residues are shown as sticks. Light blue spheres are tungsten, cyan spheres molybdenum, gray spheres vanadium, cyan/green sticks carbon, dark blue sticks nitrogen, red sticks oxygen. Dashed lines represent POM–protein interactions. Note that octamolybdate forms a covalent bond with a serine (Ser 127). The inhibition of human NTPDase1, also known as CD39, is of particular pharmacological interest as it converts ATP into adenosine, which is an important molecule in the suppression of the antitumor T cell response and therefore it is exploited by tumors to overcome immune response.143 NTPDase1 inhibition by metatungstate led to a significant in vivo suppression of murine B16‐F10 melanoma (inhibition rate ca. 86.1 %, 5 mg kg−1) and to a moderate reduction of murine colon adenocarcinoma (MCA‐38, ca. 27.3 %, 5 mg kg−1) in mice.144 Metatungstate was not active in NTPDase1 deficient tumor‐bearing mice confirming NTPDase1 inhibition as the mode of action. Further studies investigating the effect of several POMs on human NTPDase1‐3, NPP1‐3, and rat eN revealed that POMs were most efficient in inhibiting NTPDase1‐3 and NPP1, with some of them exhibiting inhibition constants in the nanomolar range (Supporting Information, Table S17).145, 146 [Co 4 (H 2 O) 2 (PW 9 O 34 ) 2 ]10− was identified as a very potent inhibitor of human NTPDase1‐3 (K i =4, 20 and 100 nm), being the most potent inhibitor of human NTPDase1 described to date. POMs are also potent inhibitors of tissue specific alkaline phosphatase (TSAP, from calf intestine) and of tissue non‐specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSAP, from pork and human), with some of them being active at nanomolar concentrations (Supporting Information, Table S17).145, 147 Regarding human TNSAP, [P 6 W 18 O 79 ]20− (K i =2.3 μm) is the most potent inhibitor.145 APs are highly expressed by osteoblasts to hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate for bone mineralization. This osteoblastic activity is remarkably increased in prostate cancer, which preferentially metastasizes to bone, leading to dysregulated bone formation.148 Therefore, the inhibition of APs by POMs could be a promising strategy in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. A series of POMs were tested on several kinases showing high specificity for protein kinase CK2.149 Protein kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of proteins leading to their modification, that is, change in enzymatic activity, cellular location, or interaction behavior to regulate cellular processes such as signal transduction. Protein kinase CK2 is upregulated in many cancer types and thus associated with their increased proliferation rate and ability to suppress apoptosis.150 Derivates of the Wells–Dawson (IC 50 =1–70 μm) and Preyssler archetype (IC 50 =1–5 μm), and giant POM anions (IC 50 =8–70 μm), showed moderate to high inhibition of CK2. In contrast, smaller POMs such as Keggin derivates (IC 50 =60–1000 μm) were less active indicating that the POM structure roughly determines the inhibitory effect. Further analysis revealed that the POM binding site is located at an exposed site outside the ATP/peptide binding pocket and the catalytic cleft from where the POM could however interfere with the activation loop of CK2 (Supporting Information, Figure S4).151 A high‐throughput screening study assaying 400 POMs was performed to identify potential histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors revealing [{(n‐Bu)Sn(OH)} 3 GeW 9 O 34 ]4− as the most efficient HDAC‐inhibitor (IC 50 =1.1 μm) (Figure 14 j).48 HDAC is an enzyme that is responsible for the removal of the acetyl group from an acetylated lysine making histones to wrap DNA more tightly. This is an essential process as DNA expression is regulated by the acetylation and deacetylation of histones. HDACs are involved in cell‐cycle progression and differentiation and therefore disturbances in HDAC encoding genes are linked to tumor development rendering them promising targets.152 This rationale was confirmed by the in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of [{(n‐Bu)Sn(OH)} 3 GeW 9 O 34 ]4−, which were discussed in Section 2.2.1. Several POMs like [V 10 O 28 ]6− or [P 2 W 18 O 62 ]6−, which are known to exhibit antitumor activity, have also been described as potent P‐type ATPase inhibitors (Figure 14 k).153-155 P‐type ATPases are a large group of ion pumps that play a crucial role in maintaining the ionic balance in cells and therefore have been described as potential molecular targets for the treatment of several diseases. P‐type ATPases like Na+/K+‐ATPase also act as signal transducer and their activity was found to be significantly changed in tumors making Na+/K+‐ATPase inhibitors particularly interesting as anticancer drugs.156 Therefore, the reported anticancer activity of some POMs, especially that of decavanadate and other POVs, may partially derive from their ability to inhibit P‐type ATPases. However, POM‐mediated P‐type ATPase inhibition is not tumor‐cell‐selective. Besides this, decavanadate induces mitochondria membrane depolarization and inhibits mitochondrial oxygen consumption in vivo rendering mitochondria the main toxicological target for decavanadate (Figure 14 l).157 The mechanism behind the anticancer activity of POM‐bisphosphonate (POM‐BP) complexes, which were discussed in Section 2.2.2, is supposed to be the inhibition of the prenylation of important proteins like the Ras subfamily, which belong to the class of small GTPase. The Ras genes are the most common oncogenes in human cancer, and point mutations within these genes result in the accumulation of activated Ras, which in turn causes a permanent cell growth‐promoting signaling, ultimately leading to cancer.158 Therefore, the Ras pathway is a promising biological target. BPs like Zol are known to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase, an enzyme supplying precursors for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids that are essential for prenylation. In the same way, POM‐BP complexes could inhibit the prenylation of (mutated) Ras, preventing it from reaching its full functionality, and thus impairing tumor growth. This mechanism was supported by the finding that the addition of geranylgeraniol (GGOH), an isoprenol that is also used for protein prenylation, impaired the antitumor activity of Mo‐based POM‐BP complexes as prenylation was restored. Interestingly, the activity of V‐containing BP complexes was not affected by GGOH, suggesting that the activity of these complexes is governed by the POV unit and thus follows a POV‐based mode of action. Besides the discussed biomacromolecules, POMs interact with an array of other important proteins including phosphatases, kinases, polymerases, proteases, actin, sulfotransferases, and sialyltransferases (Figure 14 m).28, 138, 159-162 POM‐mediated inhibition of certain enzymes has a specific effect on the cell viability and may thus contribute to pharmacological activities. Some of these enzymes are membrane‐associated proteins of which targeting is facilitated as the POM does not has to enter into the cytoplasmic space for inhibition.",Polyoxometalates as Potential Next‐Generation Metallodrugs in the Combat Against Cancer,Wiley.com,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201803868

Abstrac…","Monitoring of the FITC labeled {Eu(SiW 11 O 39 ) 2 }–CMC within HeLa cells showed that the nanoparticles were preferably located in the perinuclear region in close proximity to the nuclei. 98 Clathrin‐mediated endocytosis was proposed as POM‐free chitosan nanoparticles are internalized by this pathway; however, this was later excluded as the cellular uptake of POM‐CT was not inhibited by the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine indicating a clathrin‐independent pathway. 99 Thus, macropinocytosis and caveolae‐mediated endocytosis were suggested as internalization pathways for, at least, POM‐CT hybrids as chitosan‐DNA‐poly(γ‐glutamic acid) complexes are uptaken by these pathways. 125

Nevertheless, it is still generally assumed that POMs are mainly taken up by cells by some form of endocytosis. Different POTs were traced within murine macrophage J774 cells revealing POM containing vacuoles within the cells, wherefore, it was suggested that POMs might bind to scavenger receptors and enter the cell by scavenger receptor‐mediated endocytosis. 124 Similarly, huge POMo nanoparticles such as (NH 4 ) 42 [{(Mo VI )Mo 5 VI O 21 (H 2 O) 6 } 12 {Mo 2 V O 4 (CH 3 COO) 30 }] were found to be located within endosomes that were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of Hep‐G2 cells, supporting internalization by an endocytotic pathway. 119

The antiproliferative activity of an anticancer drug is directly associated with its degree of cellular uptake. It is well accepted that POMs are able to penetrate cancer cells, as many studies have experimentally confirmed their location within the cytoplasmic space. 46 , 99 , 109 - 111 , 119 However, no convincing data has been reported revealing the exact mechanism. Owing to their large size and negative charge, POMs are supposed to be rather unable to penetrate the largely negatively charged cell membranes of mammalian cells. POMs such as the Keggin‐type were characterized as super chaotropic agents with a surprisingly high tendency to adsorb on neutral and hydrophilic surfaces, whereby POMs with lower charge densities were more chaotropic. 120 Owing to this feature, POMs exhibited destructive activity towards model cell membranes by adsorbing to the vesicle surface, followed by the formation of a stable POM–lipid conjugate, which finally desorbs from the membrane (Figure 10 ). 121 , 122 These desorption processes led to leaky membrane structures. Studies with anionic lipids revealed that depending on the charge density, the POM–lipid interactions can switch from electrostatic to hydrophobic nature, owing to the charge neutralization by cationic counterions. 123

3.2 Proposed Modes of Action and Biological Targets of Antitumoral Polyoxometalates

Figure 11 shows most of the putative mechanisms of antitumoral POMs in a comprehensive Scheme. The first suggested mechanism for the antitumor activity of POMs was that by Yamase, which was already mentioned in the introduction.19 Briefly, repeated reduction/oxidation cycles between the POM and cell components, most likely members of the electron transport chain, are supposed to interfere with ATP generation, which finally leads to apoptosis (Figure 11 a). The theory is widely accepted, as a series of studies revealed a putative correlation between the cytotoxicity and the redox potential of bioactive POMs.38-44 This correlation is a weak one and only applies to very closely related structures, as other factors like size, structure, and composition play also a significant role. In general, there is no unambiguous correlation between the anticancer activity of POMs and parameters such as POM size, total net charge, charge density, oxidation power, and archetype.

The same was observed for PM‐17 as it induced apoptotic and autophagic cell death in vitro and in vivo.18 The sandwich POM [H 4 {CuII 9 AsIII 6 O 15 (H 2 O) 6 }(AsIIIW 9 O 33 ) 2 ]8− exhibited remarkable activity against cancerous K‐562 (leukemia) and Hep‐G2 (liver) cells (IC 50 =0.4 μm for both) by affecting lysosomes in vitro, which led to the induction of both apoptosis and autophagy.131 The autophagy inducing property might originate from the AsIII containing unit as As 2 O 3 is known to induce autophagy in leukemia cells by increasing the level of Beclin‐1, a critical regulator of autophagy.132

Another study investigating the interaction between heptamolybdate [Mo 7 O 24 ]6− and the DNA model bis(p‐nitrophenyl)phosphate showed that the POM was able to cleave the phosphodiester bond by a yet unknown mechanism.133

3.2.4 Interaction with Proteins Owing to their negative charge and their tendency to bind to neutral or hydrophilic surfaces, POMs interact with an array of proteins.138 Ectonucleotidases are membrane‐associated enzymes that hydrolyze extracellular nucleotides to the respective nucleosides and are thus involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes.139 They can be subdivided into four families, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatases (NPPs), alkaline phosphatases (APs), and ecto‐5′‐nucleotidase (eN). POMs are potent inhibitors of ectonucleotidases, with some of them being superior to known inhibitors (Figure 13 i; Supporting Information, Table S17).140 Crystallographic studies investigating the interaction of decavanadate, metatungstate, octa‐, and heptamolybdate with rat and bacterial NTPDase1 revealed that decavanadate and heptamolybdate bind either at the periphery (rat NTPDase) or deep inside the active site cleft (bacterial NTPDase) of the enzyme at positively charged patches, where they interact with substrate binding residues (Figure 13).141, 142 Therefore, it was suggested that enzyme inhibition occurs by blocking the nucleotide‐active site interaction. Octamolybdate (Figure 13 i) is located at the entrance of the active site cleft and could also interfere with substrate binding. Interestingly, one of the most potent inhibitors, metatungstate, binds distantly from the active site and therefore the inhibitory effect might result from POM‐mediated destabilization of the entire enzyme structure. Figure 13 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint POM‐binding sites of NTPDase1 from Legionella pneumophila. The structure of bacterial NTPDase1 consists of two domains (cyan and green cartoon) with the interface forming the active site cleft. The depicted structure is taken from PDB entry 4BVO142 as model example. The interacting amino acid residues are shown as sticks. Light blue spheres are tungsten, cyan spheres molybdenum, gray spheres vanadium, cyan/green sticks carbon, dark blue sticks nitrogen, red sticks oxygen. Dashed lines represent POM–protein interactions. Note that octamolybdate forms a covalent bond with a serine (Ser 127). The inhibition of human NTPDase1, also known as CD39, is of particular pharmacological interest as it converts ATP into adenosine, which is an important molecule in the suppression of the antitumor T cell response and therefore it is exploited by tumors to overcome immune response.143 NTPDase1 inhibition by metatungstate led to a significant in vivo suppression of murine B16‐F10 melanoma (inhibition rate ca. 86.1 %, 5 mg kg−1) and to a moderate reduction of murine colon adenocarcinoma (MCA‐38, ca. 27.3 %, 5 mg kg−1) in mice.144 Metatungstate was not active in NTPDase1 deficient tumor‐bearing mice confirming NTPDase1 inhibition as the mode of action. Further studies investigating the effect of several POMs on human NTPDase1‐3, NPP1‐3, and rat eN revealed that POMs were most efficient in inhibiting NTPDase1‐3 and NPP1, with some of them exhibiting inhibition constants in the nanomolar range (Supporting Information, Table S17).145, 146 [Co 4 (H 2 O) 2 (PW 9 O 34 ) 2 ]10− was identified as a very potent inhibitor of human NTPDase1‐3 (K i =4, 20 and 100 nm), being the most potent inhibitor of human NTPDase1 described to date. POMs are also potent inhibitors of tissue specific alkaline phosphatase (TSAP, from calf intestine) and of tissue non‐specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSAP, from pork and human), with some of them being active at nanomolar concentrations (Supporting Information, Table S17).145, 147 Regarding human TNSAP, [P 6 W 18 O 79 ]20− (K i =2.3 μm) is the most potent inhibitor.145 APs are highly expressed by osteoblasts to hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate for bone mineralization. This osteoblastic activity is remarkably increased in prostate cancer, which preferentially metastasizes to bone, leading to dysregulated bone formation.148 Therefore, the inhibition of APs by POMs could be a promising strategy in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. A series of POMs were tested on several kinases showing high specificity for protein kinase CK2.149 Protein kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of proteins leading to their modification, that is, change in enzymatic activity, cellular location, or interaction behavior to regulate cellular processes such as signal transduction. Protein kinase CK2 is upregulated in many cancer types and thus associated with their increased proliferation rate and ability to suppress apoptosis.150 Derivates of the Wells–Dawson (IC 50 =1–70 μm) and Preyssler archetype (IC 50 =1–5 μm), and giant POM anions (IC 50 =8–70 μm), showed moderate to high inhibition of CK2. In contrast, smaller POMs such as Keggin derivates (IC 50 =60–1000 μm) were less active indicating that the POM structure roughly determines the inhibitory effect. Further analysis revealed that the POM binding site is located at an exposed site outside the ATP/peptide binding pocket and the catalytic cleft from where the POM could however interfere with the activation loop of CK2 (Supporting Information, Figure S4).151 A high‐throughput screening study assaying 400 POMs was performed to identify potential histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors revealing [{(n‐Bu)Sn(OH)} 3 GeW 9 O 34 ]4− as the most efficient HDAC‐inhibitor (IC 50 =1.1 μm) (Figure 14 j).48 HDAC is an enzyme that is responsible for the removal of the acetyl group from an acetylated lysine making histones to wrap DNA more tightly. This is an essential process as DNA expression is regulated by the acetylation and deacetylation of histones. HDACs are involved in cell‐cycle progression and differentiation and therefore disturbances in HDAC encoding genes are linked to tumor development rendering them promising targets.152 This rationale was confirmed by the in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of [{(n‐Bu)Sn(OH)} 3 GeW 9 O 34 ]4−, which were discussed in Section 2.2.1. Several POMs like [V 10 O 28 ]6− or [P 2 W 18 O 62 ]6−, which are known to exhibit antitumor activity, have also been described as potent P‐type ATPase inhibitors (Figure 14 k).153-155 P‐type ATPases are a large group of ion pumps that play a crucial role in maintaining the ionic balance in cells and therefore have been described as potential molecular targets for the treatment of several diseases. P‐type ATPases like Na+/K+‐ATPase also act as signal transducer and their activity was found to be significantly changed in tumors making Na+/K+‐ATPase inhibitors particularly interesting as anticancer drugs.156 Therefore, the reported anticancer activity of some POMs, especially that of decavanadate and other POVs, may partially derive from their ability to inhibit P‐type ATPases. However, POM‐mediated P‐type ATPase inhibition is not tumor‐cell‐selective. Besides this, decavanadate induces mitochondria membrane depolarization and inhibits mitochondrial oxygen consumption in vivo rendering mitochondria the main toxicological target for decavanadate (Figure 14 l).157 The mechanism behind the anticancer activity of POM‐bisphosphonate (POM‐BP) complexes, which were discussed in Section 2.2.2, is supposed to be the inhibition of the prenylation of important proteins like the Ras subfamily, which belong to the class of small GTPase. The Ras genes are the most common oncogenes in human cancer, and point mutations within these genes result in the accumulation of activated Ras, which in turn causes a permanent cell growth‐promoting signaling, ultimately leading to cancer.158 Therefore, the Ras pathway is a promising biological target. BPs like Zol are known to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase, an enzyme supplying precursors for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids that are essential for prenylation. In the same way, POM‐BP complexes could inhibit the prenylation of (mutated) Ras, preventing it from reaching its full functionality, and thus impairing tumor growth. This mechanism was supported by the finding that the addition of geranylgeraniol (GGOH), an isoprenol that is also used for protein prenylation, impaired the antitumor activity of Mo‐based POM‐BP complexes as prenylation was restored. Interestingly, the activity of V‐containing BP complexes was not affected by GGOH, suggesting that the activity of these complexes is governed by the POV unit and thus follows a POV‐based mode of action. Besides the discussed biomacromolecules, POMs interact with an array of other important proteins including phosphatases, kinases, polymerases, proteases, actin, sulfotransferases, and sialyltransferases (Figure 14 m).28, 138, 159-162 POM‐mediated inhibition of certain enzymes has a specific effect on the cell viability and may thus contribute to pharmacological activities. Some of these enzymes are membrane‐associated proteins of which targeting is facilitated as the POM does not has to enter into the cytoplasmic space for inhibition.",Polyoxometalates as Potential Next‐Generation Metallodrugs in the Combat Against Cancer,Literatumonline.com,https://pericles.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201803868

Manitoba’s chief public health officer says substance abuse and a lack of prenatal care were common factors in many of those cases.,"WINNIPEG—At least 10 infants have been treated for syphilis in Manitoba in the last six months, and the public health office says the methamphetamine crisis could be exacerbating the outbreak. The number of people with syphilis has nearly tripled since 2014 — to 350 from 118. For women, it’s gone to 168 from 16 in four years.

Michael Isaac, Manitoba’s acting chief public health officer, says women can pass the bacterial infection on during pregnancy. Isaac says substance abuse and a lack of prenatal care were common factors in many of the cases. The province is urging people to practise safe sex and to get tested. Women should seek regular prenatal medical care, especially if they are intravenous drug users.

“I think the injection drug use that we are seeing in Manitoba certainly is linked with crystal methamphetamine use,” Isaac said Monday. “And we’ve noted that some of the moms with congenital syphilis have been using crystal meth and injecting drugs.” Winnipeg’s police chief has said the skyrocketing use of meth is creating a crisis for police, treatment centres and health-care services. The Addictions Foundation of Manitoba has said meth use increased by more than 100 per cent in adults and nearly 50 per cent in youth since 2014. Isaac said the rise in injection drug use is linked to the increase in blood-borne illnesses such as syphilis. Syphilis can have a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other conditions. Tests confirm whether a person has the infection and, once diagnosed, it is easily treated with penicillin.

“It’s a very treatable and preventable condition,” Isaac said. If untreated, syphilis can be passed on before or during a pregnancy and can result in birth defects or stillbirth.

Congenital cases of syphilis were rare in Manitoba and Isaac said no babies were born with the infection for decades before 2015. “We noticed in late 2018 and early 2019 a large increase in cases of congenital syphilis, especially the last six weeks.” Of those mothers, Isaac said, 70 per cent were using drugs. Health Minister Cameron Friesen said the outbreak is affecting hard-to-reach populations, in particular people with addictions, and that’s created a significant challenge. He said a plan has been developed by public health experts to increase testing and education, but there are not simple or easy solutions. Documents obtained by the Manitoba NDP in December have also shown a rise in communicable diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis. NDP Opposition Leader Wab Kinew said the government has known about the connection with intravenous drug use but hasn’t acted on it. “We need a safe injection site in Winnipeg. We need more harm reduction measures,” he said. “We also need to have a variety of public health outreach steps taken.” Multiple provinces, including Alberta, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, are also seeing cases of congenital syphilis.","Spike in Manitoba babies treated for syphilis, substance abuse likely factor",Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/25/spike-in-manitoba-babies-treated-for-syphilis-substance-abuse-likely-factor.html

The question came to a head over the weekend when documents, including a set of talking points, were released to the media. The documents suggested the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services was trying to control the message given to parents. In one email to staff, a manager in another jurisdiction noted the ministry “has asked us not to stray outside of their messaging.”

The issue boiled over Monday during question period at Queen’s Park.

Lisa MacLeod, the embattled minister of children, community and social services, told the legislature that allegations the program was frozen are “erroneous,” and that if the program had continued under changes introduced by the Liberals, it faced bankruptcy.

NDP leader Andrea Horwath shot back that the province would be be bankrupting families with its new program.

NDP MPP Monique Taylor was ejected from the legislature after accusing the government of “lying” to parents. Ottawa West-Nepean Progressive Conservative MPP Jeremy Roberts, who has a sibling with autism, did not stand up to applaud statements made by Premier Doug Ford and MacLeod, who is the MPP for Nepean. (A spokesman for Robert said he would not comment on the incident.) Ottawa South MPP John Fraser said parents had lost confidence in MacLeod and needed “a fresh set of eyes and ears” on the issue.

Meanwhile, the ministry released a statement saying agencies were instructed last October to bring in only new clients in three priority areas.

“At no point did Minister MacLeod instruct the Ministry of Children, Community and Social services to freeze the wait list,” said the statement. “These families were prioritized for services and supports following changes made to the Ontario Autism Program in January 2018, which placed significant funding pressures on the program budget that could not be supported within the allocated budget. Minister MacLeod secured the necessary investment upon taking office.”

In an interview Monday, Alex Munter, the president and CEO of CHEO, said that as of July 2018, the autism program at CHEO was facing a $8.2 million shortfall in a $25-million program because of the changes introduced in January 2018. As a result of the shortfall, CHEO cut discretionary expenses in the program and imposed a hiring freeze. CHEO also asked the province for more funding. “The shortfall would have had impacted services through CHEO,” Munter said. The autism program is different from the rest of the programs at CHEO, he said. In most other treatment areas, clinicians make decisions. In this program, the government dictates which children get services and how much. The program has been rebooted four times in the past three years and changing criteria has been hard for families, Munter said. But parents who called CHEO would have been told that if their child was not in one of the priority groups they would not be admitted into the program. “The reality is that we were working with a major budget shortage that we were trying to manage,” he said. “I can see why people thought we should have been more public. But we don’t normally start negotiations in a public kind of way. Our first step is to bring it to government.” Munter noted the issue has become a highly polarized, partisan debate. “We’re not going to participate in that.” It is still unclear how much individual families will receive under the new program, known as the “childhood budget,” which is targeted at low and middle-income families. It will depend on how long the child remains in the program. A child who enters the program at age two could receive as much as $140,000, but another child entering the program at seven could only receive as much as $55,000. Many parents are concerned they won’t meet the income test and will get little or nothing.

Sherri Brown, the mother of nine-year-old Quinn, said her son has been on the wait list ever since she moved to Ontario in September 2017 from British Columbia. “Thirty hours a week would change the entire trajectory of his disability. I wish I could afford 30 hours a week. I can’t,” Brown said.

The priority categories set by the province are “cherry-picking” who would receive services, she said. “For our kids, every months makes a difference. To halt a wait list for six months in unconscionable. This is a neurological disorder. Six months is forever.”

Meanwhile, Brown argues that funding for autism should be covered under the province’s Health Ministry, not the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services. “Three independent medical professionals have indicated that Quinn needs this level of treatment. It’s the gold standard of treatment for children with autism,” she said.

“A three-year wait list wouldn’t fly for children with cancer. But it flies for our children.”

194,Empty,2019-02-25T10:00:00Z,"Don’t expect to see the much-discussed national pharmacare plan in the March budget, writes David Olive.","Universal pharmacare has long been in place widely in Europe. The Liberal-dominated Commons health committee called last year for universal pharmacare, because about 20 per cent of Canadians are uninsured or under-insured for drugs. And roughly one in 10 Canadians goes without prescription drugs because they cannot afford them.

In the spring budget, just over three weeks from now, the Trudeau government will once again pass on the chance to finally give Canadians the universal pharmacare that doctors and a multitude of studies have shown is needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the country’s prescription-drug bill.

That’s not what the doctor ordered, but it is what the insurance lobby wants. And the Trudeau government will oblige the private insurers, who fear having to compete with universal pharmacare.

Morneau will speak glowingly of how the Trudeau government is “filling the gaps” in our patchwork system of drug spending by government, private drug plans, and the $3.6 billion that Canadians spend out of pocket on prescriptions. Actually, Morneau will add complexity to the patchwork system rather than streamline it.

But in his next budget, which was set last week for March 19 , Finance Minister Bill Morneau will reject that holistic solution. He will instead announce narrowly targeted partial coverage of selected patient groups.

A government that has already broken its promise to balance the books by now understandably blanches at the estimated $20.4 billion annual cost of universal pharmacare. But the country’s total drug bill would actually drop by an annual $4.2 billion, according to the federal budget watchdog, due to volume buying by a single provider.

Putting private-sector insurers ahead of the people doesn’t sound like an effective means of winning a tight election contest in October.

The Alberta election campaign hasn’t officially started yet, and already the man poised to win it has effectively declared war on the rest of the country.

As premier, after a provincial election that must be held by May 31, Jason Kenney will demand that Ottawa sunder the federation by withholding transfer payments from provinces that don’t do Alberta’s bidding (that would be B.C., Quebec and to a lesser extent Ontario) by deep-sixing their misgivings about new heavy-oil pipelines in their backyards.

If those pipelines don’t rapidly materialize, Kenney will hold a nationally divisive Alberta referendum on the equalization-payments system. And he wants Ottawa to debauch the Federal Court of Appeal, which ordered a halt to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, by using a Constitutional provision to overturn that decision.

At home, Kenney will set Indigenous communities against each other, favouring pro-pipeline communities with subsidies (that sure sounds like a bribe), and withholding the same from pipeline opponents.

He’ll throw Alberta teachers into confusion over elements of the curriculum that strike him as an NDP socialist plot. And he’ll strip farm workers of recently won means of redress for workplace injuries, on the untested theory that a safe farm is an unprofitable one.

Premier Rachel Notley has already blamed Canada for Alberta’s self-inflicted woes. Expect four more years of the same, only ramped up to firebrand level.

But understand that the next spell of Wildrose Country vitriol is coming from a good place. Kenney says he is simply “moving Alberta from an apologetic or defensive posture to an assertive posture.”

Apologetic? We await with interest a list from Kenney of Alberta’s apologies.

No rush, our patience is infinite.

Tariff-bully Trump: First Canada, now Germany

Canada may soon have an ally in Germany in our mutual despair over the U.S. as a threat to our economies.

Germany is bracing for the same 25 per cent tariffs on U.S. auto imports that U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Canada with in pressuring Ottawa for a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that neither Ottawa nor Canada’s business community much likes.

The looming tariffs on the German auto sector threaten to pitch Europe’s biggest economy into recession.

Recall that Trump justifies America’s continued 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian steel on the specious grounds that imported Canadian steel girders somehow threaten U.S. national security.

A long-awaited report by Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, a former steel baron, is expected to make the same bogus assertion about imports from Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG.

Likely the best way this turns out is a compromise that imposes quotas on German auto imports, but that would be damaging in reducing the revenues of a key German economic sector.

A more productive outcome would be a German commitment to make more vehicles in the U.S. The Germans already do so, of course.

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said recently she doesn’t understand how the BMWs built in South Carolina are a threat to U.S. national security. She might be wiser to put ironies aside and accurately broadcast Trump’s tariffs as an attack on Europe, given that the German auto sector assembles vehicles and sources parts widely across that continent.

None of this would be an issue, of course, if only Detroit made cars as well as the Germans, who perfected the internal-combustion engine in the 19th century and have never looked back.

In a notice of intent to sue filed last month, lawyers for Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair allege that Ford damaged the officer’s reputation when he accused him of breaking the Police Services Act by speaking out against the hiring of a Ford family friend for the force’s top job.

Blair’s lawyer Julian Falconer further alleges that Ford’s comments were meant to intimidate his client, who publicly criticized Toronto police superintendent Ron Taverner’s appointment as OPP commissioner.

“Specifically, it is alleged that you intentionally, deliberately, and maliciously made statements you knew or ought to have known to be false,” Falconer said in a letter to Ford.

Falconer said Ford told media that Blair had allegedly violated the act, when there is no evidence the veteran officer did so at any time during his career.

“The preparation, distribution and publication of these defamatory words have caused extensive harm to Deputy Commissioner Blair’s professional and personal reputation, as well as other damages to be specified at a later date,” Falconer said.

In December, Blair said OPP officers had expressed concerns the selection process which resulted in Taverner’s appointment was unfair and could raise doubts about the police service’s independence.

Blair, who was also in the running for the commissioner’s job, also suggested that Taverner’s appointment be delayed until an investigation could be conducted by the province’s ombudsman.

After the ombudsman declined to investigate, Blair launched a legal challenge in an attempt to force the watchdog to probe the hiring. Ontario’s Divisional Court is expected to hear the case in April.

The court documents filed in the case also contain more details about Blair’s allegations that Ford’s chief of staff asked the OPP to purchase a “larger camper type vehicle” and have it modified to the specifications of the premier’s office, with the costs associated with the vehicle “kept off the books.”

The documents show the cost to taxpayers for the van remodel would be over $50,000, not including the cost of the vehicle itself. The custom features were to include a 32-inch television with Blu-Ray player, a mini-fridge, black leather captain’s chairs and a reclining leather sofa bench, the documents said.

A spokesman for Ford said Monday that the premier asked the OPP to look into obtaining a “cost-effective used van” for him to work and travel in across the province.

“The emails sent to the OPP from a member of the premier’s office staff are not an official procurement of a van, instead they are a cost estimate and reveal an effort to minimize expense,” Simon Jefferies said in an email.

It is alleged that you intentionally, deliberately, and maliciously made statements you knew or ought to have known to be false

Blair’s lawyers said they filed the notice of intent to sue for defamation after the government failed to respond to four letters seeking to clarify if Blair was under a Police Services Act investigation.

Jefferies denied Ford’s statements were a reprisal against Blair.

“Mr. Blair is an unsuccessful candidate, and still appears to be clearly upset that he did not get the job,” he said, adding that the premier would respond to any legal proceedings through his counsel if necessary.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath called Ford’s actions “shameful” and said his comments were an attempt to intimidate Blair.

196,Empty,2019-02-25T18:36:33Z,Ontario is set to introduce legislation Tuesday to transform the health-care system in the province.,"

Allison Jones, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Ontario is set to introduce legislation Tuesday to transform the health-care system in the province.

A leaked draft version of the bill that the NDP revealed late last month showed that Ontario was planning a health ""super agency,"" with the proposed legislation allowing the government to roll local health integration networks, Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and other government health agencies under that umbrella.

There have been changes since then, Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday, though she didn't say how extensive.

""This is something that we have thought about long and hard,"" she said.

""It's going to significantly reduce hallway medicine by making sure that people find the care that they need. What we really need to do is focus our health care system on the patient. That's what the centre of all of this is about.""

The concept of a super agency is unlikely to have fallen by the wayside, as it was baked into nearly every element of the draft bill and three board members have already been appointed.

The NDP has warned that language in the draft bill allows for greater privatization in the health system.

But Elliott has said the legislation will not include two-tier care, private hospitals, making patients pay for more services out of pocket, or privatizing services such as long-term care inspections and the air ambulance service.

Leaked government documents have shown a new model of ""integrated care delivery"" is being created, called MyCare groups, intended to provide patients with seamless, co-ordinated care and a single team of providers for their care needs.

There are slated to be 30-50 MyCare groups across the province, with up to 10 early adopter sites being set up in the spring, according to the documents.

Another document listed risks in the plan, including ""service disruption and capacity to manage and oversee (local health integration network) functions during transition period,"" as well as potential labour disruption with unionized care co-ordinators at the networks.",Ontario health transformation bill to be introduced Tuesday,Ctvnews.ca,https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ontario-health-transformation-bill-to-be-introduced-tuesday-1.4311850
197,Empty,2019-02-25T18:39:25Z,Ontario is set to introduce legislation Tuesday to transform the health-care system in the province.,"Ontario is merging 20 health agencies into one super agency and will establish local health teams to co-ordinate care as part of a system overhaul.

Health Minister Christine Elliott announced the health-care transformation Tuesday at Bridgepoint Active Healthcare. The government intends to introduce legislation at Queen’s Park later in the day.

Elliott said too much time is spent maintaining a fragmented system and far too many people believe it is the patient or family’s job to navigate the complicated landscape.

“The value of our health care system is locked in silos,” Elliott said. “We are leaving Ontarians behind because we have a system that is disconnected.”

A new agency, called Ontario Health, will consolidate local health integration networks, Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and several other agencies.

As well, Ontario Health Teams will be established to provide what Elliott calls seamless access to health services, including primary care, hospitals, home and community care, palliative care, residential long-term care, and mental health and addictions services.

The teams would be responsible for delivering all of the care for their patients and connecting them to services. Elliott said the goal is to have 30 to 50 health teams set up, each responsible for up to 300,000 people.

“The idea is to have Ontario Health be the agency that is responsible for coordinating the care,” Elliott said.

The government said people will still be able to choose who provides their care, and more choices will be available through technology, such as giving patients an option to securely access their electronic health records and virtual care options.

“The system will be based on our public model. People do not need to fear. They will continue to pay for their health care services using their OHIP card,” Elliott said.

Watch Elliott’s full announcement below.

President and CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association Anthony Dale said they were excited by the news and the opportunities it presents.

He said Monday’s announcement allows, “the local healthcare provider community, for the first time in a very long time, to work together to deal with local healthcare needs without oversight by a third party and without nearly as much red tape as there is today.”

“it’s about reducing the amount of unnecessary third-party oversight that’s clogging the ability of the system to deal in a hands-on way with the healthcare needs of individual patients,” explained Dale.

In terms of cost savings, Elliott said the new health plan will save money down the road. However, it is not clear whether the new health plan would lead to layoffs.

Background materials from the government said that Ontario Health would eliminate “duplicative back office infrastructure and administration.”

When asked how many fewer staff there would be under Ontario Health, Elliott said: “That is something we can’t answer right now because of the fact that it is going to be up to the local Ontario health teams to structure the care that’s going to be needed in that local area.”

When asked about possible layoffs, Dale said, “Change is imminent in the agencies, I think the people who work there know it.”

“But there are a lot of amazing, very hard-working people with a lot of expertise to add, and the minister, what I heard her say, is she wants to help them focus their efforts in supporting patients and clinicians in patient care, and I think that’s a pretty powerful motivation for those people,” he added.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she fears the changes will open the door to greater privatization of services.

“This morning’s press conference did not allay our concerns about opening up our public health care system to private, for profit, motivated corporations,” she said.

The Ontario Health Coalition said it would fight any attempt to privatize the public non-profit health services, while the Canadian Union of Public Employees said it will begin escalating actions across the province to push the government to reconsider the changes.

“This dangerous Ford government reboot of our public health system must be stopped before patient care and safety fall victim to the gaps, holes and pitfalls this massive overhaul will create,” said CUPE Ontario President Fred Hahn.

But the changes had some supporters in the health care sector, including the associations representing the province’s doctors, registered nurses and hospitals.

Dr. Nadia Alam, president of the Ontario Medical Association, welcomed the proposed changes, saying patients are currently struggling to get the care that they need.

“If we can do anything to make that easier it’s a good day,” she said.

The Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario said they’re optimistic that the government plan will divert money from middle management in the health bureaucracy to front line care.

“I think some of those organizations, quite frankly, have ballooned in terms of staffing,” said CEO Doris Grinspun. “I think what they need is a very clear mandate.”

University of Toronto Professor Raisa Deber shares her thoughts on what the province’s reform plans will mean for patient care in Ontario.

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

It’s Not Real; It’s Puccini: People often suspend realism. In the movie “Spiderman” the hero swings through the canyons of Manhattan using threads of “spider silk” he attaches from building to building as he travels down the street. In Puccini’s La Boheme, the leading lady sings a beautiful aria on her death bed, in the last stages of consumption, tuberculous filling her lungs will bodily fluids. The realist may say that is not possible. The opera buff may respond it’s not real; it’s Puccini.

Human imagination is boundless.

Unfortunately, many scientists, commentators and politicians expect other physicists and commentators to suspend realism when examining climate science produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and other reports from similar organizations. Critical thinking is not welcome.

For example, 40 years of calculations from comprehensive satellite data show that the atmosphere is warming modestly, but not over the Antarctic. The calculations are verified using temperature measurements by different instruments in weather balloons, taken over a part of the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect occurs in the atmosphere. The temperature trends in the atmosphere include effects of all greenhouse gases, such as changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor occurring from natural El Niño events.

The IPCC, etc. use surface temperatures, which are not comprehensive and include many other influences such as urbanization and change in land use. Surface temperature trends show a far greater warming rate than atmospheric trends. The IPCC, etc. claim that the primary cause of surface warming is carbon dioxide and that it is dangerous for humans. The advocates of dangerous warming have not produced a substantiated foundation, a tested hypothesis that demonstrates how a minor warming of the atmosphere causes a far greater warming of the surface. Further, the models they use predict a pronounced warming of the upper troposphere above the tropics, a “tropical hot spot.” Observations by balloons, and satellites show that it’s simply not there. It is as if the Climate Establishment is saying about their work: it’s not physics, it’s climate science!

********************

Will Happer – Realist: President Trump did the unthinkable for many. He appointed a distinguished physicist, William Happer, to a committee being formed to review the security risks to the nation from climate change. Readers may recall that TWTW has suggested that the threat assessments are dubious at best. They lack critical thinking. Fort Eustis, VA, on the James River, is listed as one of the military facilities most at risk from sea level rise caused by global warming. The tidal gages in the area show that sea levels are not rising by an unusual extent.

But, the entire area of Norfolk / Newport News, which is on the low coastal plane, is sinking. Land subsidence is occurring, primarily from ground water extraction from two major wells which are forming clear funnels that show subsiding land centered on these wells. One well is at West Point on the York River about 30 miles northeast of Fort Eustis. The other well is in Franklin, Virginia, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Eustis. A cost-effective alternative for water may be to replace these wells with one or two desalination plants similar to that employed in Carlsbad, CA, using prefiltration technology developed in Israel.

When the appointment of Happer was announced, the global warming chorus roared – how dare the president appoint a physicist who may question the threat assessments by experts. The noise may be reminiscent of the uproar the occurred when President Reagan dared question the assessments of the experts who considered that the Soviet economy was comparable to that of the US, including the first US Nobel laureate in economics. After the Soviet economy collapsed, the critics of Reagan forgot their previous economic assessments.

A sample of the response to Happer can be found in an editorial in Science Magazine written by a journalist for an environmental news service, E & E News.

“William Happer, a prominent opponent of climate science in the Trump administration, is heading a new White House effort to downplay the national security risks posed by climate change.”

“Happer, who is not a climate scientist, has rejected mainstream climate science for years. He routinely says that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and that the world could burn more fossil fuels without harm. Happer heads a group called the CO2 Coalition, which advocates for a rejection of climate science, and he has said the world is in a ‘CO2 drought.’”

“’Frankly, it’s insulting to those in the intelligence community and those who are in our science agencies,’ [Francesco] Femia [co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security] said. ‘Within the Pentagon and within the intelligence community, there are a lot of people who are evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots, and they see a risk and they begin to put that into their analysis because they know if you don’t do so, you’re going to have a blind spot on security. And that’s never a good thing.’”

Such comments prompt a response such as, “Why do these evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots ignore atmospheric temperature trends, where the greenhouse gas effect occurs?” And “What is fact-based about claims of exponential sea level rise, increasing sea levels by an ever-increasing rate?”

But, perhaps the most pointed response came from physicist Luboš Motl in his blog, The Reference Frame, when addressing political comments by former mayor Michael Bloomberg and Senator Chuck Schumer:

“Can’t they see that Happer clearly knows more about these matters – especially the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect is an example) and the relative CO2 famine in the present – than they and their Senate clubs and aides combined? Bullying of a scientist by a politician is the right word here.”

This goes to the core. The enormous benefits of carbon dioxide fertilization are well-documented, substantiated by experiments and real-world observations, but ignored by the IPCC and the climate chorus. Worse, the IPCC, etc. have produced a distorted version of the absorption and reemission of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Defending the Orthodoxy, Changing Seas, and Other Scientific News.

********************

The Greenhouse Effect: this is the first in a series on the greenhouse effect as it is being measured in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases are nearly transparent to sunlight but partially opaque to thermal radiation from Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is a predicted warming of the surface and lower atmosphere and a cooling of the stratosphere and upper atmosphere as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, H2O. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is of lesser importance. Nitrous oxide, N2O, and methane, CH4, make only minor contributions to greenhouse warming. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen, N2, and oxygen, O2, are not greenhouse gases since they are nearly transparent to both sunlight and thermal radiation. There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect exists, but there is considerable uncertainty about how large it is.

Many economic models show that small warming of any kind will benefit the Earth, for example, by lengthening growing seasons and by lessening human mortality due to extreme cold. Separately, increasing concentrations of CO2 have enormously positive effects on the growth of crops and forests. Greening of the Earth from more CO2 is already being observed from satellites. It is important to resolve whether the greenhouse effect from credible increases in CO2 concentrations will be modest and beneficial or large and harmful. Theoretical uncertainties in science have traditionally been resolved by comparing theoretical predictions with observations. Comparing predicted and observed temperature changes of the surface and lower atmosphere is an incisive way to resolve theoretical uncertainties about the magnitude of the greenhouse effect.

Surface and lower-atmospheric temperatures are expected to warm in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. But surface temperatures, and their global averages, are influenced by other factors, like land-use changes, suburban and urban development. Surface temperatures are measured by thermometers here and there—sometimes in very bad locations—, and effort is made to interpolate between sites, often poorly. In contrast, satellites can measure atmospheric temperatures with nearly full sampling of the globe and with few of the systematic errors that plague surface measurements.

Instruments on satellites measure the intensity of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere. Temperatures are deduced from these intensities by methods analogous to those used in scanning temporal thermometers, available in most pharmacies. Atmospheric temperatures determined from satellite observations have been confirmed by direct measurements of temperature from weather balloons, many hundreds of which are launched every day.

Another reason to use atmospheric rather than surface temperatures as the touchstone for testing climate models is that climate models predict maximum warming at altitudes of 5 to 10 km in the tropical atmosphere. Lesser warmings are predicted for the surface, where it is harder to make reliable measurements.

Using atmospheric temperature data, John Christy et al. have repeatedly shown that the global climate models, in general, greatly overestimate the warming of the bulk atmosphere. Using 60 years of weather balloon data, Ross McKitrick and Christy have shown that an assumed pronounced warming centered over the tropics at about 30,000 to 35,000 feet (9 to 11 km, 300 to 200 millibars) is not found. The McKitrick and Christy study reinforces a 2007 study by Douglas, Christy, Pearson and Singer. This “hot spot” may be logically derived from a warming of the surface, whatever the cause. Its failure to appear after 60 years of observations is significant. There is something wrong with the theory. methodology, and/or procedure used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers such as the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the models on which they rely.

TWTW addressed this lack of a pronounced warming in the context of the widely accepted Global Annual Energy Budget by Kiehl and Trenberth on January 26 and February 2. The vicinity of center of the graphic depicts the concepts at issue “Thermals and Evapotranspiration” at the surface absorbing heat then rising in the atmosphere then releasing latent heat in the atmosphere. Based on the evidence presented by McKitrick and Christy, these processes are not intensifying. Thus, assumptions that storms, floods, droughts, etc. are intensifying are not justified by observational evidence.

Using observed evidence, Christy et al. have shown that the divergence between climate models and actual nature is increasing. The divergence is likely to continue unless the theory and methodology used by the IPCC, et al., are changed substantially. This is the first of several TWTWs that will address our understanding of the actual greenhouse gas effect and why the efforts of the IPCC, et al. are faulty.

Although not comprehensive and not embodied in a coherent theory, significant observational data of the atmosphere are being collected. These data suggest the IPCC has significantly overestimated the total greenhouse gas effect, especially that of carbon dioxide. These data bring into question the right side of what is depicted in the Kiehl and Trenberth diagram, the outgoing surface radiation resulting in far less outgoing longwave radiation. Unfortunately, outgoing longwave radiation, which is in the infrared range, cannot be observed from the surface.

The 1979 Charney report assumed that the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide, which had been measured by laboratory experiments, would be greatly amplified by increased water vapor. Since there were no comprehensive measurements of outgoing longwave radiation, there was no hard evidence supporting or refuting this concept. Thus, the 1979 Charney report embodied speculation concerning the impact of greenhouse gases that may have been appropriate at that time; but, as with atmospheric temperature trends, this speculation has been superseded by observational data.

To better express the effects of greenhouse gases on outgoing infrared radiation, it is useful to think of placing thin layers of slightly smoky glass over a bright light shining through a window with each layer of glass being less smoky, clearer. As more layers are placed on, the total effect increases, but effect of the last layer is less noticeable than the previous one. In terminology that will follow in future TWTWs, if there is no interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere (the window), it is said to be transparent. If there is considerable interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere, it is said to be opaque. Different greenhouse gases interfere with different wavelengths of outbound infrared energy. At a particular wavelength, carbon dioxide may be transparent to infrared energy, yet at a different wavelength, opaque to infrared energy. The ability of greenhouse gases to absorb, then re-emit energy varies with the wavelength of the energy.

Since the advent of the satellite era, several countries have been compiling data on the atmosphere. For example, with what is called the A-Train of multiple satellites, and a similar, lower orbiting, C-Train, satellites from the US, France, and Japan collect a wide variety of data, including visible, infrared and microwave energy, phases of water, studies of vegetation, atmospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, aerosols, clouds, water levels on land areas, snow depths, etc. The information is shared among international partners.

Future installments in TWTW will discussed how these data, and other data, are compiled and developed into databases that are available to the public and can be downloaded onto personal computers. Further discussions will include how these calculations based on observations contradict the findings of the IPCC, etc., and their models. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues – Atmosphere.

********************

Hurricanes and Climate Change: On her web site, Climate Etc., Judith Curry has posted two installments on a series about Hurricanes & Climate Change. The first is on detection, going back about 5,000 years. The second is on attribution which she states must be based on observations, not models. See links under Models v. Observations.

********************

Additions and Corrections: A reader on WUWT wrote that TWTW linked to the headline of comments on a paper changing ocean pH with changing wind patterns. The link created the impression that the paper contradicted recent lowering of pH claimed by many. Actually, the paper showed 159-year reconstruction of pH based on a set of coral collected in the northern South China Sea. TWTW should have made such a comment under the link.

********************

Number of the Week: Not €1.57 billion, but closer to €7 billion. An EU energy study claimed that annual levies on UK consumers in 2016 for subsidies to renewable electricity were €1.57 billion, whereas the correct figure is closer to €7 billion. It seems that subsidies for green energy are experiencing more exponential growth than increases in sea level. See link under Problems in the Orthodoxy.

Climate change science pioneer Wallace Smith Broecker dies

US professor raised early alarms about climate change and popularised term ‘global warming’

By Jonathan Watts, The Guardian, Feb 19, 2019

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/19/climate-change-science-pioneer-wallace-smith-broecker-dies

“Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the ‘Achilles heel of the climate system’ and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt.

“In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company.

“His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience.”

Hurricanes & Climate Change: Detection

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 17, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/17/hurricanes-climate-change-detection/#more-24723

“I am preparing a new Special Report on Hurricanes and Climate Change.

“There has not been a timeline or synthesis of these results for the past five thousand years, either regionally or for the entire coastal region. However, it is clear from these analyses that significant variability of landfall probabilities occurs on century to millennial time scales. There appears to have been a broad ‘hyperactive period’ from 3400 to 1000 years B.P. High activity persisted in the Gulf of Mexico until 1400 AD, with a shift to more frequent severe hurricane strikes from the Bahamas to New England occurring between 1400 and 1675 AD. Since 1760, there was a gradual decline in activity until the 1990’s.”

Hurricanes and Climate Change: Attribution

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 20, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/20/24737/#more-24737

“Models and theory suggest that hurricane intensity and rainfall should increase in a warming climate. There is no theory that predicts a change in the number of hurricanes or a change in hurricane tracks with warmer temperatures.

“Convincing attribution of any changes requires that a change in hurricane characteristics be identified from observations, with the change exceeding natural variability.”

“The IEA WEO 2018 supports a worldwide energy transition and forecasts capacity additions in power generation, by type, by 2020.

“There is no need to delve into levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and all the minutia associated with LCOE calculations. The cost and output of units being installed worldwide establishes, unequivocally, that wind and PV Solar are more expensive.”

“In the case of the 1976 Swine Flu episode, President Ford, acting on the advice from the country’s best medical advisors, authorized dramatic action — aggressive intervention, in the form of a national immunization campaign — which turned out badly. Many of the advisors that had originally convinced President Ford to act almost immediately had second thoughts, long before the adverse effects started to turn up. Historians have been critical of Ford but the blame stems from the difficulty of decision making under deep uncertainty.”

1. The Green New Deal’s Impossible Electric Grid

Renewable energy can’t consistently balance power supply with demand.

By Robert Blohm, WSJ, Feb 20, 2019

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-green-new-deals-impossible-electric-grid-11550705997

“Mr. Blohm is an elected member of the Operating Committee and the Standards Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the continental bulk electric system’s reliability regulator designated by the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and by all the Canadian provinces’ energy regulators.”

In expressing a critical concern Mr Blohm writes:

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal calls for a fully renewable electric power grid. Regardless of the economic or political challenges of bringing this about, it is likely technologically impossible.

“An electric power grid involves second-by-second balancing between generated supply and consumer demand. In the case of a sudden imbalance—such as from the loss of a generator’s output—all the remaining generators on the grid instantaneously pool together. Each one pitches in a small part of the required power to make up for the lost generator fast enough to keep supply and demand balanced.

“This doesn’t work for wind and solar because you can’t spontaneously increase wind or sunshine. Hydro power is limited and unevenly distributed around the country. And for safety reasons, nuclear power—even if the Green New Dealers accepted it—can’t be cranked up to neutralize imbalances. Nor can consumer demand be suddenly reduced enough.

“Fossil-fuel turbines, by contrast, very naturally compensate for sudden supply outages. The inertia of the spinning mass of rotors provides the extra energy needed to compensate for the loss for the first few seconds. (Wind-rotor inertia is too short-lived.) Meanwhile the generators’ on-line reserve capacity kicks in, giving a rapid boost in power output to prevent the turbines from slowing down. That substitute power, called “governor response,” lasts as long as 15 minutes. During that time a single replacement generator ramps up to compensate entirely for the loss. All the turbines on the grid are thereby restored to their original speed, and the governor response is rearmed for the next disturbance.

An all-renewables grid would require prohibitively expensive battery storage to compensate for sudden power losses. Even with batteries, the lost power would have to be fed through “inverters”—a technology that converts variable-wind-speed alternating current, solar-power direct current, and battery-power direct-current into alternating current—to allow for synthetic inertia and governor response in the case of a disruption.

“But according to a 2017 report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, if a large enough share of the power grid flows through inverters, the grid itself may collapse. Existing inverter technologies have faced serious software problems and prompted outages where they have been deployed. The IEEE is trying to create a global standard for inverter design—though heavy input by Chinese suppliers bent on commandeering the technology may pose a national-security risk if the U.S. were to incorporate the standard.

“How could the market price in the cost of providing rapid replacement energy that renewable sources can’t provide reliably? The entity that caused the outage should need to pay. Yet the power industry—to say nothing of the Green New Dealers—hasn’t given this much thought. An all-renewables power grid is destined to collapse.”

",Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #349,Wattsupwiththat.com,https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/02/25/weekly-climate-and-energy-news-roundup-349/
199,Empty,2019-02-25T08:01:47Z,"Southern Utah wasn't always a riding paradise, but as they say, if you build it, they will come. The post 2019 Bible Feature Story: Slow Roll appeared first on BIKE Magazine.","As I climbed out of a truck in Utah's Gooseberry Mesa parking lot, toothy, redrock peaks filled the view to the north and east, highlighted by the world-famous skyline of Zion National Park. I'd been told to expect a two- to three-hour ride that was rugged and technical. But perusing our flat surroundings made me skeptical.

Perhaps sensing my apprehension, Jake Weber, a retired Army combat engineer-turned guide with Utah Mountain Biking Adventures, offered a measure of reassurance. ""We get a lot of people who show up and say they want to ride 30 miles every day of their trip,"" he told me. ""But after about 15 miles on their first day, they're like, 'Yeah, we're good,' and they're ready for a beer at the trailhead.""

Welcome to the land of ""mesa miles."" Maybe you've heard of them. In short—no pun intended—they're harder than standard miles which makes them feel longer. The more you ride them, the more comfortable you get disclosing that you ""only"" rode 10 miles today and it still took two hours.

I had never ridden a mesa mile when I got to Washington County, Utah, which is well known to desert aficionados as a singletrack oasis and has hosted the world's premier freeride competition, Red Bull Rampage, off and on since 2001. Still, it remains something of a hidden gem to the rest of the riding world, in part because it's remote: four hours from Salt Lake City, six hours from Phoenix, nine hours from Denver.

St. George, the county seat and a city of roughly 90,000 people, spent decades as a retirement community for golfers and still attracts celebrities like Michael Jordan to its greens come winter. But starting around the mid 2000s, adventure took a bite out of golf's place as the area's top attraction. The number of local outfitters swelled from a dozen to more than 50. Mountain biking overtook road biking as the most popular two-wheeled pursuit. With an almost 90-percent population jump since 2000, Washington County ranks as the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America. It also has a warmer climate than its sometimes-rival, Moab, five hours to the northeast, and offers legitimate riding and 60-degree temps in the belly of winter.

On this beaming morning in early October, photographer Margus Riga and I had joined a local crew for a spin along the South Rim and through Hidden Canyon. Gooseberry, the original mesa ride and still a lot of locals' favorite mesa of the five with trails, carries an almost-mythical reputation among those who know about it. Mostly that is due to Goose's sandstone features and their surprising, albeit intimidating, ridability.

""They're like giant rock biscuits that you can just roll up onto,"" said 54-year-old Kenny Jones, who owns Gooseberry Yurts and once finished 14 straight Leadville 100s back-to-back. ""A lot of the bottom sections of the rocks have a nice, roll-y out. So they look really steep but then the tranny grabs your front wheel and gets you out of the vertical position.""

We followed Quentin Morisette, owner of Over the Edge Sports in nearby Hurricane, as he weaved between puddles in the rock—and the brine shrimp they hold, making it a no-no to ride through them—and abided by the local code not to leave tracks in the dirt. He led us to a playground that he called the Skatepark: two deep, connected bowls that mimic the flow of a purpose-built concrete bowl. From there we swooped between stands of juniper, piñon and cedar trees, as well as the mesa's namesake gooseberry bushes. After 15 minutes of wrestling our bikes up, down and over the sandstone landscape—a full-body workout that longtime local Bill Bergeron compares to ""being stuck in a cage with a gorilla""—we came upon a 20-foot-tall biscuit that looked like a soft-serve ice-cream tower. It was steep and layered, with a small drop at the entry over significant exposure. Morisette hiked to the top for the second time in his life and prepared to drop in.

The line, my riding partners explained, was not to be confused with the Wall of Considerable Consequences, which we'd pass later, or the Wall of Death, which we'd skip. Morisette rolled in, landed the initial drop and rocketed out the bottom as the rest of us filmed it with our phones. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" shouted Weber, who served two tours in Iraq and left the military after a pair of traumatic brain injuries saddled him with PTSD. Now he coaches a local high school team and rarely sees someone test the sharp end, hence his incredulous response.

Morisette let out a sly grin. ""I've been riding here for 23 years, and it just gets better,"" he said. ""When you're on the rock, the sky's the limit.""

As we continued toward Gooseberry's high point, I realized why locals pay attention to their tires' side knobs here: You need a lof of support to grip the off-camber sandstone. It helps that the trail is marked by white dots on the rock, too; otherwise it's easy to wander off track.

We pedaled over a 4-foot-wide plank to the Point, an airy perch overlooking the valley and Zion. The trail only gains 300 vertical feet from the White Trailhead (elevation: 5,100 feet above sea level) to here, but the entire ride includes about 900 feet of gain. ""It's all 10 feet at a time,"" Morisette quipped.

We ogled the old Rampage venue to the north, which includes the notorious King Kong descent, as well as Flying Monkey, a mesa across the valley where the government, legend has it, used to send furry primates down a rail propelled by a rocket at supersonic speeds to test military ejector seats.

Then we returned the way we came, back to the trailhead. Slightly under the weather, I collapsed in the gravelly shade, feeling like I'd ridden 20 miles if not more. Someone informed me it was actually less than 10. I sighed, chalked it up to the mesa effect and closed my eyes for a nap, while the others tipped back beers in the sun.

According to Washington County's GIS department, the local mountain biking scene encompasses 296 miles of mapped trails to go with a gnarliness spectrum ranging from sublime cross-country favorites like Hurricane Rim, J.E.M. and Dead Ringer, to the five local mesas and their sandstone playgrounds, to big-boy gravity lines that attract the world's best freeriders every October.

The area's rise to prominence happened neither quickly nor due to a mass movement. On the contrary, it started in late 1993 when a pair of native sons took up the sport at age 49. Twin brothers Morgan and Mike Harris had grown up in Rockville, a tiny town on the Virgin River at the mouth of Zion Canyon, but because their father forbade them from riding dirt bikes, they didn't start until they were 26. As Morgan tells it, they rode motos for 20 years, then performance ATVs for three, at which point they grew wary of the danger and turned to mountain bikes.

In the early days, Morgan rode a primitive bike with a shoddy fork. ""Boy, I went home bloody a lot,"" he chuckles. A few other locals were riding at the time, but they mainly stuck to the mellow Green Valley Loop. ""There wasn't any real anchor trail to draw people to the area,"" Harris recalls.

He and Mike used to hunt deer, coyotes and rabbits on Gooseberry Mesa, and they often heard visitors talk about slickrock riding in Moab. They knew Gooseberry contained similar features and started poking around, starting with the slab that parallels the White Road. They built a short trail through one of the mesa's mini-canyons, then found out they needed a permit. So they met with the BLM in 1994 to talk about expanding their work to the north and south rims and Hidden Canyon. ""Originally they wanted 15 cents a foot, per year, for the use of the land,"" Harris says. Then the agency softened its stance. ""They said if you can have everything completed by Trail Days of 1996, we'll do a trail dedication. We had it done, but it took them until '98 to dedicate it.""

With Gooseberry complete, the Harris brothers turned their attention to Little Creek Mountain, which they'd been staring at for years from Gooseberry. They started exploring its slabs, ancient petroglyphs and fossils (there's actually a dinosaur bone embedded in the sandstone in one spot) and potential trail corridors that didn't require slaughtering flora. After a year-and-a-half of building there—with unofficial permission from a BLM official, Harris says—the agency changed its mind and asked them to stop. So they did, again shifting to where they thought the next destination could be. In this case it was a long redrock spine that would come to be known as Church Rocks.

Mike Harris quit riding after Little Creek, leaving Morgan to continue alone. Luckily others picked up the slack, and soon enough a growing community of riders had built Guacamole, which fostered its own mini-network on the mesa including The Whole Guacamole, Holy Guacamole and Salt on the Rim.

Harris left to build trails in Nevada after constructing Holy Guacamole, and now, at age 73, he just maintains existing routes. But the foundation he and Mike laid continues to anchor the network. If you ask 20 locals to name their favorite trail, like I did, you could get 15 different answers. The scene now includes a 100-mile race—True Grit, held every March in St. George—and a respected advocacy organization, the Dixie Mountain Bike Trails Association (DMBTA), which was launched in 2010 by True Grit founder Cimarron Chacon. ('Dixie' is a common moniker in Washington County because the early settlers grew cotton, which led to the area being known as 'Utah's Dixie.')

DMBTA only counts about 75 official members, but more than 2,000 people follow the organization on social media, ""and a lot of them come out to our volunteer days,"" says club president Kevin Christopherson. Others hand him money on the trails, even if they're not from the area. In addition, the Rampage organizers have donated about $14,000 to DMBTA each of the past two years.

The roots and robust support keep the area on the broader map, attracting riders from around the world—with a healthy dose of freeriders each spring, an influx that Morisette affectionately calls the Canadian Invasion. The key to providing such a reliable product when so many other destinations in the region cannot, he says, is the geography. Just north of Hurricane, Interstate 15 goes from 3,500 feet in elevation to above 5,000 and stays there, which places Zion on the northern edge of viable winter and early spring riding.

Although a lot of local rides, particularly the mesas, require driving a fair distance to park at a trailhead, not everywhere does. One of the guys we rode Gooseberry with, a diehard XC fanatic named Josh Wolfe, lives in St. George and doesn't own a car. We bumped into him the next morning in the nondescript parking lot for Zen and Barrel Ride, just over a dirt mound from St. George's subdivisions and commercial sprawl. We had just finished up an ambitious combo ride in a group of eight.

Wolfe was on his way out for a midday loop, and after our morning figure-eight on Zen and Barrel, I understood why he lives so close to these trails. Zen features the kind of ledgy, technical terrain that makes your forearms cramp. Kenny Jones called it a ""rim-basher trail,"" and halfway through our descent it delivered. Jake Miller, a Red Rock ambassador and standout local rider, buckled an $1,800 carbon wheel in two places without crashing. Despite its ride-from-home proximity to a city of 90,000, you still feel like you're away from the hectic rush of civilization when you reach the top. Then the real fun begins. Both Riga, who lives in Vancouver and calls the North Shore home, and I deemed it our favorite trail of the week.

We continued on to the freeride-friendly Barrel from there, led by longtime St. George rider Bryce Pratt, who built it 15 years ago, and Mitchell Curwen, who recently refurbished it and added some features. ""If you want to see what a bike can do, this is a great place to take it,"" Curwen said as we pedaled up a wash toward the top. Pratt designed the trail to snake through a series of barrel cactuses, which look like stunted pony kegs with 3-inch-long thorns.

I followed a mother of three named Angie Anderson down the Waterfall, an aptly named chunky section that serves as Barrel's crux, if you don't count the jumps below. Some of those jumps dropped blindly off of giant boulders into perfectly sculpted transitions. Others were gaps, including one over a creek. Everything seemed to flow just as it should until we were back at the parking lot.

""Doing Zen and Barrel in the same day is a big day. They're probably our two most technical trails in St. George City,"" Curwen said. ""If you can get out of here without a broken bike part or broken body part, that's a win.""

Victorious, Riga and I returned to St. George later that afternoon to check out the Snake Hollow St. George Bike Park—the newest addition to the area's stable of radness. Built on 80 acres of city-owned land through a collaboration between DMBTA, the Southern Utah Bicycle Alliance and the Washington County Tourism Office, the facility was funded by $1.6 million in tax dollars and was slated to open the month after our visit. But there were already dozens of kids testing it out after school. This winter, city workers and volunteers are planning to add a 5.5-mile NICA racecourse through the lava field on the lot's southern end. According to county tourism director Kevin Lewis, it will be the only year-round bike park in Utah.

The most recent addition to Washington County's singletrack menu arrived two years ago when DMBTA finished a 7-mile intermediate loop on Wire Mesa. In its first year of existence, trail counters recorded 16,000 visitors—or an average of 44 a day. It's close to Gooseberry and Grafton mesas, so you'd expect it to see traffic, but the number still quantified the area's growing renown. (In total, 178,000 people rode BLM trails around Washington County last year, including 30,000 on Gooseberry.)

The numbers are a far cry from when Morgan Harris broached the idea of a Gooseberry trail to the BLM 25 years ago. ""At that first meeting, they said, 'Being that remote, 7-and-a-half miles off the highway, you're probably only going to see 36 riders a month, at most,'"" Harris recalled. Within three years of Gooseberry's trails being open, the local bike shop owners told Harris they'd seen a 60-percent increase in sales. Five years later, when Harris' fork fell apart, Zion Cycles founder Fred Pagles gave him a new Trek Remedy and free service and parts for life. When Harris protested, Pagles said: ""If you hadn't done what you did, I wouldn't have a business.""

There is still a touch of uncertainty about what will happen to unofficial trails on BLM land that have become wildly popular and mapped, like Little Creek and Dig It on Grafton Mesa. A long-in-the-works travel management plan is nearing completion, and locals are optimistic the BLM will bring them into the fold and declare them legal, since closing them would be more complicated and potentially hurt the area's economic growth.

But whatever happens, the local scene is plenty healthy, as evidenced by a recent show of support for Harris after he was diagnosed with gum cancer. In mid-May, Harris underwent surgery to remove a tumor, and doctors removed his fibula from his lower right leg and used it to rebuild his jaw. Locals held a fundraiser to help cover his medical bills, bringing in nearly $25,000. Over the Edge built a new Ibis Mojo HD for Harris to ride into his 80s. At a post-ride barbecue in October, Harris said he still didn't have the leg power to ride technical terrain, as much as he wanted to.

Instead, he had been maintaining trails he built a generation ago. ""I get out there at daylight and get done before it gets too hot,"" he said. ""Me and the dog, Hazel."" His tools were hidden in the bushes as he spoke.

I asked Harris what he thinks of the community that he and his brother helped to create. ""It amazes me what's happened here,"" he said. ""When I was building trail, I never expected any payback. Payback was people having a smile on their face, loving what you built. I can't believe this came out of us wanting to ride a trail on Gooseberry.""

…

RIDE: Although most trails are on MTB Project, for a more localized resource check out swutahtrails.com, a brand-new, one-stop tool for trail descriptions, photos and videos with downloadable maps and GPS navigation. Trails are sorted into geographical zones to showcase the various regions throughout the county.

STAY: You'll find ample lodging options throughout the county via Google. We stayed at a rental house in Sand Hollow Resort, which suited our large group well and was convenient to both Hurricane and St. George. You can also check out Gooseberry Yurts for a more primitive, adventurous option—with four days' worth of riding from your front door. The 20-foot-diameter yurts sleep five to seven adults and cost $150 a night.

EAT: Again, options abound, but you can't go wrong with Lonny Boy's BBQ in Hurricane, George's Corner Restaurant in St. George and the Bit and Spur Restaurant and Saloon in Springdale. Affogato is a worthy coffee shop in St. George, while River Rock Roasting Co., in La Verkin, serves tasty food and everything from coffee to beer on the edge of a canyon carved by the Virgin River.

SHOP: Over the Edge Sports in Hurricane treated our team well, whether that meant providing TLC to the day's testing steeds each evening, sharing local beta on where to ride or leading the way on hard-to-follow loops (OTE also runs a free shop ride every Saturday, which is a great way to see the area's nooks and crannies).

As early as Tuesday, Canadians could hear directly from Jody Wilson-Raybould on whether she was inappropriately pressured as attorney general to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

But beyond the political scandal, consider the failures of the RCMP and federal prosecutors in the case. Since 2012, the RCMP have charged eight people tied to allegations SNC engaged in bribery of foreign officials. Seven of those accused have had their cases tossed out of court due to delays or problems with evidence. RCMP and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada have yet to convict anyone from the company.

Many are asking whether they are really up to the job.

""Canada has a very poor record of enforcement,"" says James Cohen, head of the watchdog group Transparency International Canada. ""Canadian companies who engage in corruption have sadly been playing the odds that they will not get caught.""

The RCMP and PPSC's umbrella case against the company itself, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc and its subsidiaries, could be prosecutors' last hope.

To put it bluntly — they desperately need a win.

Bribing a dictator

SNC-Lavalin's troubles began in 2011, and unravelled like a spy novel.

The company, whose top construction executive for years paid bribes in Libya to win billions in contracts, moved out of the country temporarily when its patron, dictator Moammar Gadhafi, was ousted and killed.

One month later, as Libya burned, authorities in Mexico arrested a group of alleged plotters accused of trying to smuggle one of Gadhafi's sons to a life in hiding. Among those detained — but released — was an SNC money man, Stéphane Roy.

A month after that, a senior SNC-Lavalin employee invited a CBC reporter to a remote ski hill in Quebec. He whispered news of an internal revolt at SNC-Lavalin over allegations the top construction exec for years paid bribes and laundered money for the Gadhafi regime through Swiss banks, all to keep contracts flowing to SNC-Lavalin.

Those stories made headlines, sparked firings, police investigations, and eventually criminal charges.

In April 2012, that executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, was arrested in Switzerland where he was held for two and a half years. He pleaded guilty in Switzerland to bribery and laundering millions to win SNC-Lavalin contracts in Libya.

'We've done nothing wrong'

The company has long maintained that any bribes or kickbacks were the work of rogue employees.

The company's latest CEO Neil Bruce told investors on Friday the company will vigorously defend itself against the charge its international construction arm paid bribes.

""We've done nothing wrong as a company and none of our current employees have done anything wrong,"" Bruce said.

To date, the only conviction of anyone at SNC-Lavalin related to foreign bribery was the guilty plea from Ben Aïssa secured by Switzerland.

In Canada, so far every single charge the RCMP has laid has either not stuck — or not yet been to trial.

This month, a charge of obstruction of justice was thrown out against Sami Bebawi due to court delays.

Bebawi was SNC-Lavalin's top construction executive in the years before Riadh Ben Aïssa. RCMP charged Bebawi in 2014, accusing him of sending a lawyer to visit Ben Aïssa in a Swiss prison to offer $10 million if he covered up Bebawi's involvement in Libya. What Bebawi didn't know is that he'd walked into a sting operation. Ben Aïssa has become a vital co-operating witness for the RCMP.

Bebawi still awaits trial in Montreal on fraud and bribery charges tied to SNC-Lavalin's Libya operations..

Roy, the SNC-Lavalin money man detained briefly in Mexico in 2011, also walked out of court free this month. As vice-president of finance under Ben Aïssa, Roy was charged with fraud and bribery tied to Libya. But last week a judge tossed all charges due to ""unreasonable"" delays by the prosecution.

Bangladesh boondoggle

The RCMP and PPSC suffered similar defeats in its case against employees of SNC-Lavalin International in Bangladesh over the company's failed bid to win a $1.3-billion contract to build the Padma Bridge.

The World Bank eventually debarred SNC-Lavalin from bidding on projects for 10 years.

However, Canada's prosecution of five people over the Bangladesh bridge project, including a low level engineer and two executives, eventually failed.

Watch: SNC and a bridge for Bangladesh

A joint CBC News investigation shows the bribery scandal surrounding Canada’s SNC-Lavalin is even more extensive than first reported, with its own special code involving several foreign countries. 14:55

Charges were dropped against engineer Mohammad Ismail who became a witness, turning over evidence of a widespread system of secret payments used by the SNC-Lavalin division.

The four others were acquitted, after a judge ruled that RCMP wiretap evidence collected by bugging an executive's office was inadmissible.

Complex investigations, changing priorities

Canada has a sparse record of convicting anyone in foreign bribery cases.

To date, the RCMP and PPSC have only ever secured six convictions under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act since its adoption two decades ago.

The RCMP superintendent who led these international investigations says those convictions nonetheless sent a message to corporate Canada.

""The early cases in Canada which resulted in fines to corporations led to compliance regimes being established country-wide by Canadian firms operating globally,"" says Biagio Carrese, a 29-year veteran anti-money laundering investigator with the RCMP.

Notably, he says, the three-year prison term handed down to Nazir Karagar of CryptoMetrics Canada for attempting to bribe government officials in India put Canadian executives on notice.

""The impact was immediate. It set a precedent,"" said Carrese, who has left the RCMP and now works in the private sector.

He declined to comment on the SNC-Lavalin case, but acknowledges foreign bribery cases can fail — or struggle — due to their international scope, legal and technical complexity, and the need for an intense amount of time, resources and special expertise.

RCMP's National Division had 115 dedicated investigators by 2013. A year later, after the Parliament Hill shootings, and the rise of homegrown ISIS sympathizers, many investigators were reassigned to anti-terrorism, depleting resources in the fight against foreign bribery.

""In a world of ever-changing priorities, this can be difficult. I believe this to be true of police and prosecutors,"" Carrese said.

Watch: SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds in front of the Justice Committee

Canada's top civil servant shared some strong words with the Justice Committee regarding the ever-growing SNC-Lavalin scandal. So what should we make of his testimony? And are we any closer to understanding what actually happened? The At Issue panel is back looking for the answers. 12:57

Transparency International, in its 2018 report Exporting Corruption, noted a recent deterioration in enforcement in Canada, noting no new major cases launched in recent years.

Convictions in Canada

While no SNC-Lavalin employee has been convicted of foreign bribery, the company has faced humiliating headlines over corruption here at home.

Sûreté du Québec and provincial prosecutors won convictions against former CEO Pierre Duhaime and his executive vice-president of construction Ben Aïssa over bribes paid to win the $1.3-billion contract to build the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) superhospital.

RCMP is also still investigating SNC-Lavalin over $2.3 million in kickbacks paid to the head of the Federal Bridge Corp. Appointee Michel Fournier (former chief of staff to Jean Chrétien) is serving a five-and-a-half year prison term for accepting payments to Swiss bank accounts coded named ""Zorro"" while doling out bridge contracts.

Today, as politicians and the public debate the fate of SNC-Lavalin, and whether it ought to be offered an out of court deal to resolve the foreign bribery case, the police and prosecutors who toiled for years no doubt have a thirst to see their work put before the courts.

Beyond the law, the politics, the potential impact on this giant company — our public guardians have spent untold millions building a case and to date have little to show for it.","What's at stake for RCMP, prosecutors in the SNC-Lavalin case",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-bribery-snc-lavalin-case-1.5031712

Bennett recently appointed Kim Baird, a consultant and former chief of the Tsawwassen First Nation, as one of two representatives that will be involved in talks with First Nations to revamp policies on comprehensive claims, also known as modern treaties, and self-government.

The Crown-Indigenous Relations (CIRNA) department began rolling out its engagement process for revamping these new policies in January. CIRNA documents, obtained by CBC News, show the department is aiming to have the new policies announced by June 2019.

The effort is part of the Liberal government's attempts to salvage part of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's promise to refashion Canada's relationship with Indigenous Peoples through a legislated framework on Indigenous rights that has been shelved.

CIRNA is also moving on changing policies on how lands are added to reserves and the settling of historical grievances over lost lands and mishandled trust money — known as specific claims.

Bennett appointed Baird alongside Tom Isaac, a prominent Vancouver lawyer with an expertise in Indigenous law who acted as a former B.C. government treaty negotiator and has been a federal ministerial representative on various Indigenous files.

Baird's role in modern treaty settlement raises concern

Neskonlith Indian Band Chief Judy Wilson said concerns with Baird date back to her 2016 appointment by the Liberal government to a three-member National Energy Board environmental review panel for the Trans Mountain pipeline project.

""To me there was a perceived conflict of interest at that time,"" said Wilson. ""Somehow, the government keeps hiring her.""

Baird was involved in a leadership exchange program in 2010 with Ian Anderson, the current CEO of Trans Mountain and the former president of Kinder Morgan Canada.

Baird also lobbied the federal government for Woodfibre LNG in 2015, according to the federal lobbyist registry. Woodfibre LNG is a $1.6 billion LNG export project in B.C. Woodfibre recently signed a $224 million, 40-year deal with the Squamish First Nation.

Wilson said the controversy over her 2016 NEB review panel appointment should have disqualified her from involvement in talks to change modern treaty policy which is about Aboriginal title and lands — two central factors fuelling opposition to the Trans Mountain project.

""Kim Baird is a non-starter,"" said Wilson, whose First Nation sits in B.C.

Wilson said Baird's leadership role with her First Nation when it signed B.C.'s first urban modern treaty in 2009 is also problematic. Wilson said Baird has been appointed to help lead talks to significantly change to the very policy behind the modern treaty signed by her community

""A lot of our communities are non-treaty and some would feel they are being railroaded into some sort of treaty process that is a narrow process because you have a [modern] treaty person rolling out these … policies,"" said Wilson, who is also secretary-treasurer for the Union of BC Indian Chiefs.

""The issue we have with [the treaties] is this narrow process of extinguishment, or modified extinguishment...all of the issues are still the same.""

'Work speaks for itself'

Baird said she was chosen for her experience in the field and she wouldn't be pushing any particular view on any of the First Nations she meets.

""All my work has been in relationship building, helping enable that,"" said Baird, who is a personal friend of Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister currently embroiled in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""I think it's not my personal style to shove a personal model on any community. I can share the perspective of how it works for Tsawwassen and other models...again, I really believe it's up to First Nations.""

Assembly of First Nations Chief Perry Bellegarde has called for a First Nations-led process on changing modern treaty, self-government policies. (CBC)

Baird said her past experience has given her the necessary tools to do the work the minister has appointed her to accomplish.

""I have lots of experience in engaging with First Nations in controversial issues,"" said Baird. ""My work speaks for itself and through my long career I developed lots of relationships with lots of people.""

AFN says process developed 'unilaterally'

Baird's role is to engage with First Nations in B.C., Ontario, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon.

Isaac was mandated to engage with First Nations in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Quebec and the East Coast.

Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde has called on Ottawa to change its modern treaty and self-government policies, but has stressed it needs to be First Nation-led. The AFN has also passed resolutions to this effect.

The AFN said in a statement that the process unveiled by CIRNA was ""unilaterally developed."" The statement said that the AFN was only provided the plan for comment in January.

The AFN statement said that CIRNA's timelines may be too tight. The department wants the engagement process completed by May 2019.

""The AFN will not support a process that is not First Nations led, and that has predetermined outcomes,"" said the statement.

Bennett's office said that department officials requested a proposal on the engagement process from the AFN on Dec. 6, 2018, but only received a response on Feb. 8.

""We are currently working with the AFN to implement their proposal,"" said the statement.",Indigenous Relations minister's choice for modern treaty talks draws fire for Trans Mountain links,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/kim-baird-modern-treaty-talks-1.5030745

That was one of the highlights Monday of testimony by Keith Dodson, co-owner of Texas-based Westney Consulting Group, at the Muskrat Falls inquiry as hearings began for a second week in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.

They assume that what happened to other projects will not happen to them. - Keith Dodson

Westney is an international leader in risk assessment for major projects, and was hired by Nalcor to give advice on the Crown corporation's cost and schedule estimates ahead of final sanctioning of the controversial hydro project in late 2012.

The estimates of a $6.2 billion capital cost and of mid-2017 first power were prepared by SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec-based engineering firm that later fell out of favour with Nalcor as the project ran into trouble.

'Definitely the exception'

Evidence has revealed that both estimates were extremely aggressive, and practically unrealistic, as Nalcor struggled to keep costs as low as possible.

Critics have charged this was part of a strategy by Nalcor to maintain public support for the project, and ensure it remained the least-cost alternative for Newfoundland and Labrador's future electricity needs.

Dodson said Nalcor was advised that labour productivity was ""decreasing significantly"" around world, a trend that began in 2004 as a result of a greater emphasis on safety and changes in the way contractors were doing business.

But Dodson said SNC-Lavalin's team expressed confidence they could buck that trend, based on what he called ""hard data"" from other hydro projects the company was involved with in Eastern Canada.

""There was a project in the U.S at that time that was achieving (productivity) rates that were not far different from what they were proposing. But it was definitely the exception,"" Dodson said of SNC-Lavalin's productivity estimates.

Dodson said there was notable optimism among Nalcor's project team and within SNC-Lavalin.

But, he added, SNC-Lavalin and Astaldi, the Italian company awarded the critical powerhouse contract, ""did not recognize the change in world productivity. There were numerous projects estimated in the same time period that has suffered about the same fate as this project. A billion or two dollars more than the estimate.""

Estimates artificially low

The inquiry has heard evidence about how the number of labour hours required per cubic metre of concrete poured at Muskrat Falls since construction began in late 2013 is practically double what Nalcor had estimated.

That's part of the reason why construction costs have soared by at least $4 billion, and overall costs are now estimated at nearly $13 billion.

But in a further sign that those early estimates were artificially low, Dodson said the actual productivity rate at Muskrat Falls is in line with worldwide trends.

This aerial photo of the Muskrat Falls dam and power generating station on the Churchill River was taken in November 2018. (Nalcor)

""They were basically the rates we were proposing that we were seeing trends around the world,"" Dodson said of performance at Muskrat Falls.

""The rates that were used in the estimate are half the rates of the actual project. But the actual project against the world (is) very good.""

Meanwhile, Dodson said Nalcor also ignored advice that it take a more cautious approach to its cost estimates, a move that would have added hundreds of millions to the total.

""Purely optimism. They assume that what happened to other projects will not happen to them,"" said Dodson.

As Coun. Diane Deans said, it was ""pretty surprising news for a Friday afternoon.""

That's when the city released a complex 113-page document that councillors — and the public — have less than two weeks to absorb before our elected officials vote on the contract on March 6.

Here are four of the most pressing things you need to know about Ottawa's most expensive infrastructure project in history.

The city's director of O-Train planning, Chris Swail, centre, gave a technical briefing on the massive $4.2-billion project last Friday. Councillors have less than two weeks to digest the complex report before voting on it March 6. (Kate Porter/CBC)

1. How we added more than $1.2B to the price

The total cost for LRT Stage 2 has been a bit of a moving target, but last we heard, the estimate for the project — which will add 44 kilometres of track and 24 new stations — was $3.4 billion. It's now $4.66 billion.

What happened?

Two basic things: the city kept increasing the scope of the project, and massive transit projects got more expensive.

First, the city added about $150 million in civics projects — think water pipe replacements — that made sense to do at the same time the light-rail system was being built.

Apparently, we already had the money for this in another envelope, but it still counts toward the total price of this project.

The price tag for the second stage of Ottawa's light rail system has grown by more than a billion dollars. What are councillors making of the news? We ask two of them. 8:47

The city also added more than $310-million worth of extra stuff, such as escalators and washrooms and a garage at Moodie station, for which there was no funding. We thought we could find the money through better design and smarter engineering, but we didn't.

Then there's the additional money in the Trillium Line extension deal that's supposed to save us cash in the long run.

SNC-Lavalin is the city's top choice to extend the north-south line into Riverside South as well as maintain the system for 27 years.

The city was prepared to spend $1.7 billion on both the expansion and maintenance of the line. But SNC-Lavalin apparently submitted a plan that came in at just $1.6 billion, proposing to upgrade the Trillium Line sooner than planned to cut down on future maintenance costs.

But to make those improvements, the city would have to fork over $236 million earlier than planned, which has jacked up the price of the project.

However, the single biggest additional cost comes from the contractors, who are asking for more money because they say they are facing higher capital costs and risks.

Existing projects are taking longer than expected — Rideau Transit Group (RTG) is at least a year behind schedule building the Confederation Line — and companies are bidding more conservatively, offering longer — and perhaps more realistic — timelines.

Consider that for the extension of the Confederation Line to Moodie in the west and Trim Road in the east, as well as a connection to Algonquin College, the city wanted to pay about $2 billion.

But the lowest bid, brought in by top choice East West Connectors, was $2.57 billion.

The city is now planning to borrow an additional $700 million for transit over the next 30 years. (CBC)

2. How — and how much — we're paying

Under the previous plan, the federal, provincial and municipal governments were going to pay about $1.2 billion each for Stage 2 of the LRT. (And the provincial money isn't technically committed yet.)

Now, the city is paying $2.256 billion, almost half the total price tag.

How will we pay for it? Basically, debt. We will borrow $700 million more than anticipated for transit over the next 30 years, for a total of $5 billion.

The additional borrowing will eventually breach the city's self-imposed limit of debt representing 7.5 per cent of revenue. In other words, for every $100 in property taxes you pay, a maximum of $7.50 should go to debt servicing.

If council approves this plan, it will have to change the city's debt policy.

The province sets the maximum debt-to-revenue ratio at 25 per cent, so the city will be well below that mandated threshold. But it still means that, without raising property taxes significantly, it could be difficult for the city to borrow for other capital projects — think affordable housing or local libraries — and still retain the highest credit rating from debt-rating agencies.

Also, the previous 2017 plan for LRT Stage 2 called for a minimum annual increase in the transit levy of 2.5 per cent. It's now proposed to be three per cent.

Upgrading the Trillium Line sooner than planned could save money in the long run, but is adding more than $230 million to the cost of the project. (Krystalle Ramlakhan/CBC)

3. Monthly instead of milestone payments

During the first stage of LRT, the city has made much of the fact of so-called ""milestone payments"" to RTG.

These are giant lump sums handed over to the contractor once it's completed a significant task in the project. The last milestone cheque the city owes RTG is worth about $260 million and will be handed over once RTG actually finishes the Confederation Line.​

That's not the payment system the city is proposing for Stage 2.

The city will still make some lump-sum payments to contractors — and there are still mechanisms to withhold work that's not complete.

But for Stage 2, the city is also proposing to fork over monthly cheques to cover the bulk of that month's construction costs.

It's easy to see why the proponents want this. These transit projects run late and companies are forced to extend their financing at great cost. They want a more reliable cash flow.

But what's in it for the city? Right now, we're hanging onto our money longer. Why would we want to give that up?

4. The deadline is crazy soon

There are dozens of questions that councillors and members of the public need answered before agreeing to spend more than $4 billion of taxpayers' money.

There's also little time.

The report was released Friday, and there's a special council meeting Wednesday where the public can make presentations and councillors can ask questions. Council is set to vote on the project less than two weeks after they laid eyes on the report — and at the same meeting they're also supposed to vote on the 2019 budget!

Time is apparently of the essence, especially for the Trillium Line bid, which expires at the end of March. But if there was such a concern about the schedule, why was this report not released in January and a meeting held last month?

TODAY:

The anti-vaccination movement is spreading worldwide, leading to record-setting numbers in the resurgence of preventable disease.

Electric cars are on the rise, but are the vehicles ready for the mainstream? David Common gets behind the wheel to find out.

Missed The National last night? Watch it here.

The global impact of anti-vaxxers

The growth of Europe's anti-vaccination movement so closely mirrors the rise of its populist parties that a new study recommends that health officials use opinion poll data to predict coming measles outbreaks.

The paper, published Monday in the European Journal of Public Health, plotted past clusters of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease against European Parliament election results and found a strong correlation between votes for anti-establishment movements and anti-vax beliefs.

""The higher the level of populist votes in a country, the greater the proportion of the population that believe vaccines are not effective,"" writes Jonathan Kennedy, a researcher at Queen Mary University of London.

Vaccine hesitancy and political populism, he notes, thrive on similar dynamics: A ""profound distrust in elites and experts.""

Measles in Europe hit a 20-year high in 2018, with 83,000 confirmed cases and 72 deaths, driven by a huge outbreak in Ukraine and sizeable transmission clusters in Serbia, France, Italy and Greece.

Globally, the World Health Organization tracked a 50 per cent spike in the entirely preventable disease, finding protracted and growing outbreaks in all regions of the world.

The WHO estimates that 136,000 people died from measles in 2017 and that the MMR vaccine first introduced in the early 1960s now prevents two to three million deaths annually.

Yet parental fears and misinformation about the inoculations have spread widely via the internet, to the point that the UN agency now lists ""vaccine hesitancy"" among its Top 10 threats to global health in 2019.

The consequences of unchecked outbreaks can be devastating.

More than 900 have died in Madagascar, where measles have sickened 68,000 people since last September.

The Philippines has seen 189 measles deaths so far in 2019, with just short of 11,500 confirmed cases as of late last week. And President Rodrigo Duterte's government is considering implementing a ""no vaccination, no enrolment"" policy for public schools in an effort to bring the disease under control.

But the pain and suffering that the disease still causes in the developing world doesn't seem to make much of an impression in richer nations.

Japan is currently experiencing its worst measles outbreak in more than a decade, with 167 reported cases in the first six weeks of 2019, many of them linked to an anti-vax religious group.

Canada now has 14 confirmed cases for the year — 13 in British Columbia and one in Quebec — and Alberta authorities have issued a health alert after an infected traveller spent 19 hours in the Edmonton area, en route from Vancouver to Inuvik, N.W.T.

And a vacationing French family reintroduced measles to Costa Rica last week via an unvaccinated five-year-old boy — the Central American nation's first case since 2014.

However, there are signs of a growing pushback against the anti-vaccination movement.

On Friday, YouTube stopped placing ads on channels that promote anti-vax content, depriving their owners of revenue as part of a concerted effort to clamp down on ""harmful or dangerous"" views. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the company's decision came after several major brands pulled their ads from the platform over concerns that pedophiles have been using it to lure victims.)

And it appears that Pinterest has also been quietly trying to purge anti-vaccination messages from its sharing and scrapbooking site by disabling related searches.

Overcoming now-entrenched anti-vax fears won't be easy, though.

An Angus Reid opinion survey released last week found 83 per cent of respondents ""wouldn't hesitate"" to vaccinate their own children. But 26 per cent admitted at least some concern about potential side effects. And among those who have children under 12 years of age, 20 per cent said the choice to inoculate or not should be left to parents.

Electric road trip

Reporter David Common and a CBC News crew took an all-electric vehicle on a road trip to Detroit. There were some … challenges.

Even before the U.S. border guards joked about our boxy, battery-powered vehicle, we knew we were in trouble. We'd gone off course, depleting that battery, shortening our range and putting in doubt whether we'd even make it to the Detroit Auto Show.

What began as a strong start for our electric vehicle journey was not ending well.

We were test-driving a Kia Soul, one of the least expensive, purely electric vehicles available today. It has a range of 160 kilometres, although frigid winter temperatures lower that to 120 km or so. Cost to recharge: Under $2, so as long as you do it at home. Paying for chargers at gas stations, community centres, malls and so on cost several times more.

Electric vehicles are increasingly popular, but the infrastructure to support them isn't always convenient. David Common waits for a charge in Sarnia, Ont. (Jill English/CBC)

But for the daily commuter, recharging elsewhere isn't needed. The average Canadian commute is 23 km one way, so even with a stop at the soccer field, the grocery store and day care, our car could easily handle a daily commute.

So what's holding people back from embracing EVs?

Survey after survey report the same four barriers: Entry cost — often $15,000 more than the gas model — is the big one.

The remaining three all have to do with range:

Can the car go as far as I need to, without a recharge?

If I have to recharge, are there enough stations along the way?

How long does it take to recharge?

Our entry-level EV would make up the difference in purchase price over a traditional gasoline-powered car in less than five years of never visiting a gas station. The range questions, though, needed a challenge.

So we headed out from Toronto to Detroit, a 400-kilometre, cross-border journey.

After downloading an app showing charging stations, we had no problem plotting a route — there are hundreds in southern Ontario, though primarily in cities, and fast-chargers can take an EV to full charge in just over a half-hour.

Electric vehicle devotees had drilled into us the need to have a plan for a long trip, along with a backup plan in case a charging station was being used or broken upon our arrival. But we hadn't planned for human error.

The producer, videographer and I got chatting (office gossip, of course), and we missed our turnoff. It only took us about 15 km off our route, but it meant we couldn't make it to our intended charging station. Plan B took effect.

We ended up driving not to Windsor, Ont. — directly across from Detroit — but to Sarnia. And then the charger where we stopped, at a Tim Hortons, was slower than the two others we'd used. A lot slower. It took well over an hour and we didn't even fill up.

Trouble was, we had a meeting at the Detroit Auto Show and now there was no chance of making it.

We reached the border, welcomed by two U.S. border agents who joked about our battery on wheels. Then they spotted the TV equipment and off we went to secondary inspection. I'll spare you the boring bureaucratic details, but suffice to say, those guards drove our car around, then made us go back to Canada and return to the U.S.

It all cost us time and available range.

How do you extend the range in a pinch? Turn off the heat. All of it. Blowers, seat warmers, everything.

It boosted the range by 20 per cent, but meant we were all left freezing in an increasingly frosty car racing to Detroit with the –20 C temperatures seeping in.

Well, we made it. Just. Rolling in on fumes. (If the car had fumes.)

And then we saw it. Our car, but newer, on display at the auto show. And then the revelation: The 2020 model will have the range to make the same journey in one shot.

All a good reminder that many EVs still require planning for trips longer than a commute. But also that the batteries in newer models are getting much better — so you'll be able to leave the heat on while you drive!

Feb 25, 1975: Comparing marijuana and alcohol: a demonstration

""Whatever became of Mary Jane?"" asks Lloyd Robertson, as the ""concern and furor of the late 1960s"" gives way to the mellow mid-70s. As the Senate debates loosening Canada's marijuana laws, CBC's Newsmagazine presents a bold experiment comparing the effects of booze and pot. One group of volunteers pounds Screwdrivers before the cameras, while another smokes joints provided by a woman in a white lab coat. The conclusion? Both groups appear to have a good time.

The Guardian is going to keep me very busy in the next few days; it is Concrete Week, which ""celebrates the aesthetic and social achievements of concrete, while investigating its innumerable harms, to learn what we can all do today to bring about a less grey world."" This is going to be bigger than Shark Week as they start with the innumerable harms, with Jonathan Watts' article Concrete: the most destructive material on Earth. The first paragraph is scary:

In the time it takes you to read this sentence, the global building industry will have poured more than 19,000 bathtubs of concrete. By the time you are halfway through this article, the volume would fill the Albert Hall and spill out into Hyde Park. In a day it would be almost the size of China’s Three Gorges Dam. In a single year, there is enough to patio over every hill, dale, nook and cranny in England.

It gets worse. We are complaining a lot about plastic, but there are only 8 billion tonnes of it since it was invented; that much concrete is made every two years. We have often complained here about the Carbon Dioxide emitted by concrete, but Watts covers all the ancillary issues that don't get noticed as much (although I am proud to say that we have covered most of them on TreeHugger).

There is silicosis from breathing concrete dust.

There are the killer trucks delivering concrete through cities.

There is the sand mining that is ""catastrophic – destroying so many of the world’s beaches and river courses that this form of mining is now increasingly run by organised crime gangs and associated with murderous violence.""

But a very interesting byproduct of concrete is how it affects politics.

The politics of concrete are less divisive, but more corrosive. The main problem here is inertia. Once this material binds politicians, bureaucrats and construction companies, the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge. Party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected, state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth, and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in, staff employed and political influence high.

Watts goes on to talk about Japan, but one need look no farther than Canada, where the government is consumed right now with the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which there are questions of whether Prime Minister Trudeau tried to protect the nation's largest international pourer of concrete. It could bring down the government.

Watts concludes with a quote from Phil Purnell, a professor of materials and structures at Leeds University, who makes a case for concrete: “The raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads, bridges and anything else that needs a foundation.”

But the raw materials are not limitless; we are running out of sand and fresh water. We have to rethink our need for more concrete roads and more underground parking garages and more tall concrete buildings. We have to stop using so much of the stuff.","Is concrete ""the most destructive material on Earth""?",Treehugger.com,https://www.treehugger.com/infrastructure/concrete-most-destructive-material-earth.html

It’s impossible to think of one without thinking of the other.

But is the SNC-Lavalin affair really the straw that broke the camel’s back? Or are there other pressure points that caused the former attorney general to eventually break rank and resign from cabinet? Maybe she will let us in on some of these pressure points when she testifies before the House of Commons justice committee on Tuesday. But it’s not hard to imagine that her two roles as a prominent member of the Trudeau cabinet and a formidable, determined trail blazer when it comes to Indigenous rights were not sitting together comfortably anymore.

This became particularly apparent last Friday when the National Energy Board issued its Reconsideration Report on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion following a ruling by the Federal Court of Appeal last year that the Trudeau cabinet hadn’t fully considered the impact of additional oil tankers on marine mammals, such as killer whales, when it gave the green light. Since the federal government now owns the pipeline and has pledged to see it built, no doubt the NEB recommendations will eventually be accepted. The next step is completion of the consultations with Indigenous communities that would be affected by the proposed project, another bone of contention in the appeal court’s ruling. Amarjeet Sohi, minister of natural resources and point man on the Trans Mountain project, said on Friday that the cabinet could have all the input it needs to make a decision on the pipeline within 90 days. If Wilson-Raybould were still in cabinet, but even as backbench MP, final approval of the pipeline would put her in an untenable position.

As the MP for Vancouver Granville she represents an area that is home to vehement Indigenous and environmental opposition to the pipeline. If the pipeline gets the go-ahead what position would she take? As attorney general she never spoke out strongly for or against the pipeline even though many B.C. Indigenous politicians and activists have vowed that it will never be built.

Article Continued Below

One of Raybould-Wilson’s biggest backers has vowed to kill that pipeline, no matter what. Last month Stewart Phillip, the president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs expressed his bitter disappointment after Wilson-Raybould was transferred from justice to veterans affairs. But he also showered her with praise. “Her greatest strength is her deep sense of integrity and commitment to the people that she has served,” Phillip said during an interview with Aboriginal Peoples Television Network. When the NEB issued its Reconsideration Report, Stewart said it’s “ludicrous” that economic factors are more important than killer whales. It doesn’t appear there would have been be much reconciliation between Stewart and Wilson-Raybould if she were in the cabinet that approved the pipeline. That was certainly the case for some Indigenous groups when the Site C dam in northeastern B.C. was given the go ahead despite opposition by local, provincial and national Indigenous organizations. As a B.C. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations, Wilson-Raybould once opposed construction of the $9 billion dam, the largest industrial project in B.C.’s history. But after she became a Liberal cabinet minister she concurred with both the federal and B.C. governments’ decisions to approve the project. In his testimony to the Commons Justice Committee last week, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick noted that Wilson-Raybould and Crown Indigenous Relations minister Carolyn Bennett have irreconcilable differences over the direction of a promised piece of legislation central to the government's agenda regarding First Nations. Politics is all about compromise. Sometimes a politician has to give in on some issues so as to make strides on others she considers more important. Perhaps Wilson-Raybould felt she was giving more than she was getting when it came to the Indigenous issues she has worked so hard on for most of her career. As we got closer to a final decision on the Trans Mountain pipeline Wilson-Raybould must have been feeling enormous pressure to do the right thing. Maybe too much pressure to bear.

Canadian Dividend All-Stars are companies that have raised dividends for at least five consecutive years.

Bank earnings season is in full swing, and it will be one of the busiest weeks of the year for dividend growth investors. This week, there are eight Canadian Dividend All-Stars scheduled to raise their dividends. Before jumping in to that, there were plenty of fireworks to digest from last week. Of note, all figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.

Last Week - Results

It was a whirlwind last week. First, let’s start with the bad news. SNC Lavalin (SNC, TSX:SNC) slashed its dividend on the back of poor performance, and Magna International's (MGA, TSX:MG) raise was much lower than expected. On the bright side, Gildan Activewear (GIL, TSX:GIL) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY, TSX:RY) came through as expected, while CCL Industries (OTC:CCDBF, TSX:CCL.B) announced a higher-than-expected raise.

EST DGR EST Increase ACTUAL DGR ACTUAL Increase NEW DIV Gildan Activewear 19.67% $0.022 $0.022 19.67% $0.134 CCL Industries 15.38% $0.02 $0.04 30.77% $0.17 SNC Lavalin 4.53$ $0.013 -65.39% 17.39% $0.06 Magna International 18.18% $0.06 $0.035 10.61% $0.365 Royal Bank 4.08% $0.04 $0.04 4.08% $1.02

*Of note, Magna and Gildan pay out their dividend in US funds.

The writing was on the wall for SNC Lavalin. A couple of weeks ago, the company warned that fourth-quarter and year-end results would miss expectations. It was bad. There wasn’t much to like about its quarter, and the company posted a $1.6 billion loss. As such, the company made the wise decision to slash its dividend by 65% to $0.10 per share.

Given the headwinds facing the company, it was not surprising. The company’s 18-year dividend growth streak is at an end.

Although Magna came through with a double-digit raise (10%), it was about half what I was expecting. The company has a targeted payout ratio of approximately 20%. Including its new quarterly dividend of $0.365, Magna’s payout ratio is sitting at a comfortable 17.38%.

It was steady as it goes for Gildan Activewear and Royal Bank of Canada, both of which raised dividends in line with historical averages. Gildan’s 19.67% raise means a new quarterly dividend of $0.134 per share. Royal Bank’s new quarterly dividend is now $1.02 on the back of a 4% raise.

Finally, CCL Industries blew out estimates with a 30.77% raise. Although earnings only grew by about 2% in 2018, the company estimates that it will post strong cash flow growth in 2019. As such, the company raised its dividends by $0.04 for a new quarterly rate of $0.17 per share.

Expected Dividend Raises

Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS, TSX:BNS)

Current Streak: 8 years

8 years Current Yield: 4.43%

4.43% Earnings: Tuesday, February 26

What can investors expect: Bank of Nova Scotia is looking to extend its eight-year dividend growth streak when it reports earnings on Tuesday. Like the majority of Canada’s big banks, it raises dividends twice yearly.

The bank’s last two raises were exactly $0.03 per share, and the two before that were $0.02 per share. Although the pattern might suggest a dividend raise of $0.04 per share, I think it will stick with a $0.03 per share raise. Why? Its payout ratio of 67% is the highest of the bunch, and it is working on some strategic re-structuring.

EST DGR EST INCR EST NEW DIV 3.53% $0.03 $0.88

Innergex Renewable Energy (OTCPK:INGXF, TSX:INE)

Current Streak: 5 years

5 years Current Yield: 4.68%

4.68% Earnings: Thursday, February 28

What can investors expect: Innergex is one of the newest All-Stars, having only been added to the list this year. Since its streak began, it has consistently raised dividends in late February.

Innergex Renewable Energy’s dividend growth rate is nothing to get excited about. It has a consistent history of raising rates by approximately 3%, or $0.005 per share. Given its yield of 4.68% and the high-capex nature of the industry, don’t expect much more from the company. Good yield, low dividend growth.

EST DGR EST INCR EST NEW DIV 2.94% $0.005 $0.175

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM, TSX:CM]

Current Streak: 8 years

8 years Current Yield: 4.71%

4.71% Earnings: Thursday, February 28

What can investors expect: The second of the big five to report next week is Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Much like Bank of Nova Scotia, it raises its dividend twice a year: Once in the first quarter and again in the third.

Canadian Imperial’s last 10 dividend raises have been exactly $0.03 per share. Will it finally deviate from this pattern? Since the company’s payout ratio is at the mid-range of the group and its historical dividend growth rate has dipped below 5%, I am going to go out on a very small limb and say it will.

EST DGR EST INCR EST NEW DIV 2.94% $0.04 $1.30

Equitable Bank (OTC:EQGPF, TSX:EQB)

Current Streak: 8 years

8 years Current Yield: 1.55%

1.55% Earnings: Thursday, February 28

What can investors expect: Equitable Bank is quietly becoming one of the most underestimated dividend growth companies. Although its yield is nothing to get excited about, this alternative lender has been raising dividends at a torrid pace.

It is important to note, that EQ Bank has no discernable pattern. In 2018, it raised dividends three times and had a streak of raising dividends in four consecutive quarters going back to 2017. Although the bank just raised dividends last quarter, it may do so again this week. Of those on the list, EQ Bank is the most likely to not raise dividends.

Should the bank raise dividends, I expect it to continue raising by $0.01 per share, which has been the norm over the past five years.

Parkland Fuel (OTCPK:PKIUF, TSX:PKI)

Current Streak: 6 years

6 years Current Yield: 3.13%

3.13% Earnings: Thursday, February 28

What can investors expect: Parkland Fuel has been on a rapid pace of expansion, buying up whatever it can get its hands on. As such, it has become one of North America’s largest fuel and lubricant distributors. The company pays out its dividend monthly and typically announces its dividend raise along with fourth-quarter and year-end results.

Don’t expect high divided growth from Parkland. This is a high-growth company that invests heavily in acquisitions. So long as it can find takeover opportunities, expect dividend growth to remain in the low single digits.

Stantec Inc. (STN, TSX:STN)

Current Streak: 7 years

7 years Current Yield: 1.71%

1.71% Earnings: Thursday, February 28

What can investors expect: Stantec joins the many All-Stars scheduled to report earnings this coming Thursday. Since its streak began, the company has raised dividends along with fourth-quarter and year-end results.

There is nothing flashy about Stantec. It has a reliable and consistent dividend growth rate around 10%, and there is no reason to expect anything less. Although its current payout ratio is above 100%, on a forward earnings basis it is only 26 per cent.

EST DGR EST INCR EST NEW DIV 10.91% $0.015 $0.1525

Transcontinental Inc. (OTCPK:TCLAF, TSX:TCL.A)

Current Streak: 17 years

17 years Current Yield: 3.92%

3.92% Earnings: Thursday, February 28

What can investors expect: Transcontinental will be looking to extend its dividend streak to 18 years when the company reports earnings on Thursday. It has a reliable history of raising dividends in late February or early March.

Transcontinental’s dividend growth has been on a slow decline. Over the past five years, it has averaged around 7%, but last year’s 5% raise was the lowest in years. The slowing growth is not surprising, as the company operates in a challenging industry. Likewise, even though it has a respectable payout ratio (32%), earnings estimates are for negative growth over the next couple of years.

Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD, TSX:TD)

What can investors expect: Rounding out the banks and the list, Toronto-Dominion will be announcing a dividend raise this coming Thursday. Unlike the rest of its peers, it only raises dividends once a year and does so along with first-quarter results.

TD Bank has the distinction of owning the best dividend growth rate of the Big Five. It also happens to have the lowest payout ratio of the group. As such, there is no reason to expect the company won’t continue to out-raise its peers.
