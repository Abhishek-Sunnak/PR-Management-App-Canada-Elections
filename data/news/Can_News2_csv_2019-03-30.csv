Kristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Jagmeet Singh celebrated his byelection win the same way he rang in winning the NDP leadership race: on a dance floor.

""We danced the night away,"" Singh said Tuesday morning in an interview as his party breathed a collective sigh of relief following a win in the federal riding of Burnaby South.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show he was able to clinch the riding with 39 per cent of the vote.

For Singh, the win means he can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

Singh is now calling on New Democrats to make the most of months leading up to the October election, knowing full well he has a limited amount of time to shine in the Commons with Parliament to rise in June.

The earliest Singh can take his new seat in the House of Commons will be March 18, but he will be in Ottawa Wednesday to lead the party's weekly caucus meeting on Parliament Hill.

""It allows me to ramp up the pressure on Mr. Trudeau, on the Liberal government and allows me to really put into focus the question 'Is this Liberal government more interested in helping their well-connected, powerful friends like SNC-Lavalin,"" he said.

There is no time for Singh to waste, said Mulcair's former principal secretary Karl Belanger, noting the election is just around the corner.

""Now (Singh) has an opportunity to be seen and heard on the same stage as the other main party leaders and it will be up to him to perform and do well and connect with Canadians with a narrative that speaks to their priorities.""

The Liberals and Conservatives were also celebrating byelection wins this week. Conservative Scot Davidson easily won in York-Simcoe in southern Ontario, replacing Peter Van Loan, who held the seat since 2004 before announcing his retirement.

Liberal Rachel Bendayan was the winner in the Montreal seat of Outremont, much to the delight of Liberal cabinet ministers who are declaring the NDP's ""orange wave"" in Quebec dead.

""It's finished,"" said Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne. ""Just look at the results.""

The early Elections Canada data suggests Bendayan won with 40 per cent of the vote followed by the NDP's candidate Julia Sanchez, who had 26 per cent of the vote. The Green party had a third place finish, the Bloc Quebecois were fourth and the Conservatives were fifth.

Outremont was the seat won by Mulcair in a 2007 byelection, a victory that helped the party build support in Quebec and led to the NDP's Quebec breakthrough during the 2011 election. The NDP formed official opposition for the first time that year before falling back to third-party status in 2015.

Singh said it was not a surprise that Outremont was a challenge but he disputed the idea that the orange wave has crested.

""The base that we built in Quebec is alive and well,"" he said, adding that he's planning a visit to the province next week.

Quebec MP Alexandre Boulerice said asserting the NDP is dead in Quebec is ""classic Liberal arrogance.""

He said the NDP is very proud of Singh's victory, noting he is the first racialized federal leader to sit in the House of Commons.

Quebec Conservative MP Gerard Deltell also insisted the NDP is not dead in his province while he stressed no one should be drawing conclusions based on byelection results.

Maxime Bernier, who left the Conservative fold to launch the People's Party of Canada last fall, tweeted on Tuesday to give his assessment of the byelection results, which was the first test for his fledgling political party.

He said he expected his party to fare better in the ridings of York-Simcoe and Outremont, where the candidates earned about two per cent of the vote but adding there were ""great results"" in Burnaby South with nearly 11 per cent of the vote.

The progress is ""overall encouraging"" after five months as a party, Bernier added.

1,Empty,2019-03-01T15:19:33Z,Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau looks vulnerable after his former attorney general alleged that he interfered in the justice system.,"Justin Trudeau’s ship may be sinking, but he’s not changing course.

The Canadian prime minister plowed ahead Thursday after his former attorney general alleged, in explosive testimony aired on national television, that he interfered in the justice system by pressing to end a criminal case against an iconic Quebec construction firm. Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau insisted again his government had every right to consider the job losses that could result from a guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

The scandal has suddenly made Trudeau vulnerable, consuming his Liberals in the run-up to an election in which he’d have otherwise have been the frontrunner. He’s lost his polling lead for the first time since June, and the controversy has undermined his personal brand as a progressive leader who singlehandedly returned his moribund party to power in 2015 on a pledge of change.

“It’s very damaging and it’s very serious,” said Penny Collenette, a University of Ottawa professor who served as director of appointments under a former Liberal prime minister. Every politician wants to protect jobs, she said. “But I think the question that needs to be asked here is: at what cost?”

Trudeau’s fate depends on several factors — including whether cabinet stands by him and the Liberals stay united. Only a handful of lawmakers have voiced any measure of support for Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet last month but remains a Liberal member of parliament. The prime minister hasn’t decided yet whether to force her out of the party’s caucus.

Divided They Fall

Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the center of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis.

“If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,” Nanos said in a telephone interview. “I can’t remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can’t even agree, how is it that they can govern?”

The latest polls already show the Liberals have lost their lead in voting intentions. An aggregate of public opinion surveys maintained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. shows Trudeau’s team with 33.9 percent of the vote, below the Conservatives with 35.8 percent.

What’s hurting the prime minister is the extraordinary spectacle of a former high-ranking member of his government now emerging as its most powerful critic — and his rivals smell blood. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation and wrote the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking an investigation. The police force hasn’t said whether or not it will look into the matter. New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh is demanding a public inquiry.

Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company.

“My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,” Morneau told reporters in Toronto. “I will continue do that. I think that’s critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government.”

Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events. The former attorney general — whose absence from cabinet will be filled in a shuffle Friday, according to CBC — may also end up testifying again.

United So Far

But no current minister has broken ranks. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn’t imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signaled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. “At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,” Freeland said.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the “box of what’s legal” with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions. “We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses.” Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff. “I remain very confident in the work of this government,” Blair said.

Parliament adjourns on Friday for a two-week break, due to return in time for Morneau’s March 19 budget. The path of the scandal could also depend on what Liberal lawmakers hear while away from Ottawa, in their home districts scattered across Canada.

“They’re going to get earfuls,” Collenette said. “If the truth is really two perceptions, then voters will make up their minds. But they need facts.”

View full cov…,"British Prime Minister Theresa May has sown more confusion into the Brexit process by opening the door to delaying Britain’s departure from the European Union without saying how long the extension might last.

On Tuesday, Ms. May said members of Parliament would be able to vote to extend the March 29 deadline for the United Kingdom to leave the EU if she is unable to win parliamentary support for a Brexit deal with the bloc.

Ms. May has been scrambling for weeks to salvage a withdrawal agreement she struck with the EU that has met fierce opposition from within her Conservative Party caucus. On Tuesday, she told the House of Commons that she believed a final deal was still possible before March 29, but she acknowledged that many MPs have become “genuinely worried that time is running out” and that businesses are growing uneasy about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. The EU would have to consent to an extension and Ms. May refused to say how long it might last, indicating only that she’d like any delay to be “as short as possible”.

Story continues below advertisement

The announcement was a reversal for the Prime Minister who had spent months insisting that she would not delay Brexit. That stance had rattled many business leaders who feared the U.K. would crash out of the EU without any arrangements for trade, banking, transportation and many other issues. A government report released after Ms. May spoke confirmed many of those fears by pointing out how unprepared the country was for a no-deal Brexit.

According to the report, only 40,000 of 240,000 businesses have signed up for a special customs number they will need in order to trade with the EU after Brexit. The report also said that a majority of people have no idea they will face new EU customs and immigration controls after Brexit or that they will require an International Driving Permit to drive in the EU. Food imports from the EU could be disrupted, the report noted, and there will be widespread problems for financial service companies, law firms, chemical manufacturers, car makers and transport companies. The government also hasn’t come close to converting 40 EU trade deals into U.K. agreements. Ministers had hoped to have all 40 deals in place by the Brexit deadline, but so far just six have been signed and they don’t include large trading partners such as Canada, Japan or South Korea.

Ms. May has been under increasing pressure to rule out a no-deal Brexit and extend the March 29 deadline. On Tuesday, three junior cabinet ministers said they would resign unless Ms. May rejected leaving without a deal and up to a dozen senior ministers are believed to have also threatened to quit. Ms. May finally bowed to the pressure and agreed to allow MPs to vote on an extension. However, she faced criticism from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who said Ms. May had been ""grotesquely reckless” in her Brexit strategy and was just trying to “run down the clock.”

In her revised timetable, Ms. May is due to present a new Brexit deal to parliament on March 12 and, if it’s rejected, MPs will vote over the next two days on whether to leave the EU without a deal or move to extend the deadline. “Let me be clear, I do not want to see [the deadline] extended,” she told MPs. “Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March.”

EU officials have indicated that any delay beyond the end of June would be difficult because of elections to the European parliament. Those elections are in May and the new parliament convenes on July 2. The U.K. isn’t participating in the elections because the country is supposed to be out of the EU as of March 29. Any extension of that deadline beyond the end of June would mean the U.K. would have to field candidates for the European parliament. “What kind of message would that send to the more than 17 million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now?” Ms. May asked MPs on Tuesday.

It’s also not clear if an extension will make it any easier for Ms. May to get her Brexit deal approved by parliament. The main sticking point remains the so-called backstop, a provision in the withdrawal agreement that guarantees no hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland by ensuring that Northern Ireland remains linked to the EU’s regulations. Many Tory MPs say the backstop will keep the U.K. tied to the EU indefinitely and they wanted it removed or restricted with a time limit. The EU has refused to make any changes to the agreement, arguing the backstop protects assurances made in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence and eliminated border controls.",May leaves opening for Brexit delay if parliament unable to reach deal - The Globe and Mail,The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-may-leaves-opening-for-brexit-delay-if-parliament-unable-to-reach-deal/

President Trump seems to think so. “We’re getting very, very close,” he told a group of governors visiting the White House in February.

Citing “substantial progress” in recent negotiations, Trump postponed a March 1 deadline that would have sharply increased the rate of tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Trump said he hoped a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping, most likely in late March at Mar-a-Lago, would become a “signing summit.”

Trump’s lunge for a deal may be driven in part by the fast-advancing U.S. electoral calendar. As Democrats begin lining up to run against him next year, the President may be hoping to avoid the stock-market gyrations and economic pain an escalating trade war might soon begin to inflict.

He could surely use what he sees as a big political win on China at a time when multiple investigations, increasingly aggressive Democratic lawmakers, his failure to build a border wall and embarrassing public testimony from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen are all clouding his political horizons.

But as with his would-be reset with Russia, Trump can’t change the structural game with China with a single agreement. Although Trump entered office predicting he would improve relations with Moscow, lawmakers of both parties continue to accuse Russia of interference in U.S. elections and various other crimes. Sanctions remain in place and may well expand. Neither Trump’s praise nor congressional punishment has persuaded Russia to change course.

The same goes for China. Trump will doubtless win some concessions from Xi, perhaps expanded access for U.S. companies to the Chinese marketplace, agreements on currency management, more Chinese purchases of American soybeans and promises in principle to address other U.S. demands.

What Trump cannot do is persuade Xi to overhaul China’s broader economic model. The Chinese state will continue to subsidize state-owned companies and privately owned national champions, tilting the global playing field in its favor. It will push forward, by any means necessary, on expanding technological innovation to compete with U.S. and European firms in the most important economic sectors of the 21st century–AI, fintech and consumer electronics, for example. On these subjects, whatever Xi promises Trump or Chinese officials say publicly, they will not compromise.

There are also limits to what Trump can offer to get that deal with Xi. If he signs off on an agreement that removes pressure on Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE, each suspected of undermining U.S. national security, he’ll get pushback from Congress. If he tries to use Meng Wanzhou–the Huawei executive arrested in Canada for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran–as a bargaining chip, he’ll face criticism that he’s meddling in a law-enforcement matter and exceeding his authority.

Even if Trump and Xi cheer markets in March with a broad Mar-a-Lago agreement over coffee and chocolate cake, the damage to relations between the superpower and the rising challenger has already been done. Trust between them now stands at its lowest point in 30 years, and each government will continue a long-term project of making its side less vulnerable to pressure from the other.

In short, the U.S.-China relationship is fundamentally broken, and no politically inspired, vaguely worded compromise will change that.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Veteran NDP MP Nathan Cullen, one of the highest-profile members of the party’s national caucus, announced Friday his exit from federal politics – the latest in a series of New Democrats to rule out seeking re-election in October.

The British Columbia member, who will have served 15 years by the time he departs this fall, played down any suggestion that his decision not to seek re-election is a blow to the party.

Thirteen members of the caucus, which now has 41 MPs, have said they will not seek re-election, raising questions about party leader Jagmeet Singh’s management of the New Democrats, who are facing challenges in such areas as the polls, fundraising and policy.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Cullen, 47, is the second NDP MP from British Columbia to announce his departure this week, following Victoria-area MP Murray Rankin. Earlier on this term, Burnaby-South MP Kennedy Stewart left to run for and win the office of Vancouver mayor and Nanaimo-area MP Sheila Malcolmson was elected an NDP member of the provincial legislature.

But the MP for Skeena-Bulkley Valley said that after 15 years, five elections, a leadership bid in 2011-12 and with two 8½-year-old twin boys appealing for his attention, it was time to leave.

Mr. Cullen has no specific professional plans. Asked whether he would be interested in provincial politics, he said, “I am not ruling it out, but I don’t have that as my plan right now.” The provincial New Democrats govern B.C. under Premier John Horgan.

“When my family and I have been talking, it was just to decide whether we wanted to be in federal politics after October. Yes or no, not conditional on some other opportunity or offer. It was just, ‘Let’s just be clear and clean on this,’ not have something else waiting in the wings.”

Mr. Cullen placed third behind Thomas Mulcair and Brian Topp in the 2012 leadership vote. His roles in Parliament included House leader for the Official Opposition and Opposition finance critic. Following the 2015 election, he was environment critic as well as critic for democratic reform.

He said no one, himself included, is irreplaceable. “I’ve seen irreplaceable people leave, and then they get replaced,” said Mr. Cullen, adding that since he has been musing about his future, prospective NDP candidates have been in touch about vying to represent the party in his riding.

Mr. Cullen said New Democrats have had a good week with Mr. Singh winning a by-election in Burnaby-South and finally gaining a seat in the House of Commons. Mr. Cullen has been supportive of Mr. Singh, who succeeded Thomas Mulcair in 2017. “He is humble enough to know that he has got work to do,” he said.

He said the shine is off the federal Liberals under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau given the scandal surrounding the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair. And he said questions around the issue may even give the party traction in Quebec, the site of the party’s Orange Wave in 2011.

“Context is everything. I don’t want to harp too much on Mr. Trudeau’s troubles, but a sponsorship-like corruption scandal hits a note different in Quebec than in other parts of the country because they have seen this movie before,” he said.

To get ahead, he said the NDP will have to be authentic and “unapologetically progressive” as well as make a blunt appeal to govern Canada.

“The old NDP was about being the conscience of the Parliament, and not happy to lose, but comfortable with the idea of being third,” he said.

He said his biggest takeaway from the 2015 election was that voters were not terrified of an NDP government though they decided otherwise. “Our offer should be to be government, and be unapologetic about it.”

Mr. Cullen said he will inevitably settle in B.C. “Ottawa is fine, but it’s better here,” he said from his riding.",NDP MP Nathan Cullen won't seek re-election this fall - The Globe and Mail,The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-ndp-mp-nathan-cullen-wont-seek-re-election-this-fall/

DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Jagmeet Singh faces the biggest test of his NDP leadership in a by-election on Monday as he vies for a seat in the House of Commons.

The Burnaby South vote in the Vancouver region is one of three by-elections taking place on Monday, with others north of Toronto and in Montreal. The votes come just six months before campaigning is likely to officially begin for the general federal election.

Much is at stake for Mr. Singh, who was elected leader of the NDP in the fall of 2017 on a decisive first-ballot victory. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he loses Burnaby South. Mr. Singh at the time insisted he would lead the NDP this fall regardless of the by-election result. The 40-year-old has struggled at times as party leader: He has been criticized for low poll numbers and poor fundraising.

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s orange wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said on Sunday that a victory in the by-election would be essential to unite the NDP.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh has poured considerable personal energy into the riding, through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past on a federal and provincial level. The B.C. NDP dominated Burnaby when John Horgan was elected in 2017, and on Saturday the Premier on Twitter called on voters to get to the polls to back Mr. Singh.

The Burnaby South contest has been turbulent. The Liberals’ first candidate, Karen Wang, stepped down after a social media post on the social messaging app WeChat that zeroed in on Mr. Singh’s ethnicity and highlighted that she was only candidate of Chinese ethnicity. A recent all-candidates’ debate became heated on issues of race and immigration.

Richard T. Lee is the new Liberal candidate. Jay Shin is running for the Conservatives. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson represents the upstart People’s Party of Canada. The Greens chose not to run a candidate against Mr. Singh.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism last fall for delaying a by-election call after the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart vacated the Burnaby South seat in September to become the mayor of Vancouver.

Mr. Singh said voters are “very disappointed” in Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government.

“It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Story continues below advertisement

Political scientist Richard Johnston at the University of British Columbia said the SNC-Lavalin case could be a “gift” for Mr. Singh, because it could turn some potential Liberal voters to the NDP.

David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said it is unclear whether Mr. Singh should stay on as leader of the NDP if he lost.

“There’s this assumption that if he lost the by-election, he couldn’t show his face in the general election. I don’t think Canadians would really care,” Mr. Moscrop said. “The NDP caucus might see things differently.”

In 2015, the NDP barely won Burnaby South, as the Liberals had a strong showing in the province when Mr. Trudeau swept to power. Mr. Stewart, who had won a close race in Burnaby-Douglas in 2011, won 35.1 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South, ahead of the Liberals’ 33.9 per cent. The margin was 547 votes. The Conservatives had 27.1 per cent of the vote.

The Burnaby-South riding is an amalgam of two older ridings, the southern half of Burnaby-Douglas – where the NDP had a long, but narrow, hold on power federally – and the western half of Burnaby-New Westminster – where the NDP had a long, and mostly dominant, hold on power federally.

Germany's Alternative For Germany (AfD) party (previously) are an insurgent neofascist movement with ties to senior mainstream politicians and the country's super-wealthy would-be oligarchs; the party put on a hard push in the the 2018 Bavarian elections and their meme warfare was full of familiar voter-suppression tactics, from garden-variety disinformation to exhortations to stay home on election day.

Also prominent in the group's messaging: hashtags and tropes from the US far-right conspiracy theory Qanon (previously), an incoherent toxic stew of antisemitism, murder accusations, numerology, Islamophobia, and other pathologies of the moment.

The connection between Qanon and AfD comes from an unreleased report from the London School of Economics-affiliated Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which bills itself as an ""anti-extremist think tank""; some details of the study have been reported in the German and US press.

The researchers traced the inclusion of Qanon-affiliated hashtags in AfD social media, including German translations and adaptations of popular Qanon tags (e.g. #linksliegenlassen, #MerkelMussWeg); as with the US-based Qanon activists, the German Qanon phenomenon was driven by small numbers of incredibly prolific social media users -- not bots (Erin Gallagher's research found that Qanon tweeters posting 500+ messages/day were often ""older retired people with a lot of free time"").

There's evidence that US-based Qanon activists forged alliances with German neofascists; some popular fascist hashtags (""#ChemnitzIstDerAnfang"") originated with US Qanon accounts.

Qanon is becoming a kind of ideological signifier among far-right groups: members of the far-right who have adopted the yellow vest for street demonstrations in Canada and the UK have been spotted decorating the vests with Qanon memes and carrying Qanon-boosting signs. Qanon networks have also been used to boost the virality of racist videos.

I think far-right extremism is the intersection of garden-variety bigotry/xenophobia with economic precarity and a breakdown of the epistemological consensus about what constitutes a reliable indicator that something is true.

Xenophobia and bigotry are always around, but they surge when people feel afraid for their overall economic circumstances, and that surge has been supercharged by decades of both scientific denialism (well-funded campaigns to sow doubt about the motives of climate scientists, doctors who warn of the link between smoking and cancer, etc) and corruption -- for example, anti-vax builds on the assertion that experts have corrupt motives and that regulators are so captured that they let them get away with murder. The thing is, regulators really are that captured.

I can't say for sure that a more equitable economic system -- which would cut off the resources used by corporate influences to distort policy, and by ideological entrepreneurs to push expensive, profitable scientific denial -- would neutralize the far-right, but I think it's worth a try.

The crossover between QAnon and far-right German movements like the Chemnitz riots makes sense. Both movements are aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-refugee. And both make vague gestures toward a right-wing revolution. “At the time I got the impression that some people thought Chemnitz was going to be ‘Germany's great awakening,’” Gallagher said, referencing QAnon’s promise of a “great awakening” in America. It’s a trend she’s previously observed, as America’s alt-right moved on to trolling on behalf of their counterparts in Europe after Trump’s victory in 2016. “I've noticed crossover of US alt-right networks with European alt-right for a long time,” she said. “How QAnon fits into all that is a great question, but the international alt-right coordinated swarms—QAnon related or not—do not surprise me.”

More than a dozen House Republicans joined Democrats in voting to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border. The resolution of disapproval — part of an attempt to block Trump’s plan to divert funding to a border wall without approval from a recalcitrant Congress — passed 245-182. “Is your oath of office to Donald Trump or is it to the Constitution of the United States?” Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Republican colleagues in a speech preceding the vote. Now the resolution must be taken up by the Senate; successful passage might occasion Trump’s first veto. [Emily Cochrane / The New York Times]

During the 2018 midterm elections, the US military blocked internet access to the Russia-backed Internet Research Agency, which was attempting to interfere with the elections. The operation was the first instance of offensive action by US Cyber Command, with help from the National Security Agency, since additional powers were granted the government last year. One source said the military group “basically took the IRA offline.” The Russian agency is funded by a Putin ally, who was among the 16 Russian individuals and companies indicted by a grand jury a year ago as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s continuing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

11,Empty,2019-02-25T12:00:00Z,The nation’s eyes are on B.C. for Monday’s byelections across Canada,"Ballots will be cast in Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Quebec’s Outremont ridings, but no race is being watched more closely than the one in Burnaby South, B.C., where New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh is vying for his first seat in Parliament.

BURNABY, B.C.—A trio of federal byelections on Monday will offer more than just an early glimpse of voters’ dispositions, potentially shaking up the political landscape months before Canadians head to the polls en masse.

“There’s already rumblings that if he loses, it will be difficult for him to stay on as leader — and (it) would probably further undermine the NDP’s electoral prospects going into the federal election after an already underwhelming year.”

“Singh needs to win to consolidate his power as the leader of the party,” explained political scientist David Moscrop, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa.

Burnaby South is a key test of both Singh’s hold on his left-leaning party and the popularity of Maxime Bernier’s new far-right populist party, focused on immigration and carbon taxes.

Burnaby South is historically a diverse, working-class riding. Its median income falls 18 per cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. It was previously an NDP stronghold.

“I think he will win,” said Moscrop. “But he doesn’t have federal experience as MP … Forget forming government: He needs to show he can hold the government accountable, with only months left until the election.”

So it may be Singh’s to lose.

And with Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada running its first big candidate in Burnaby South — former radio host Laura Lynn Tyler Thompson — the election has seen tense all-candidates debates devolve into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism.

“If she can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” Moscrop argued. “This is the perfect time for his party to do well. It’s getting outsized media attention, and they can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate.

“Plus, there’s enough disaffection, not to mention xenophobia, today that could express itself as support.”

Here’s what’s at stake in Burnaby South, what voters are saying their top issues are and why this byelection is being so scrutinized across the country.

Who is running?

Singh, a former Ontario provincial politician and lawyer, is facing off against three rival party hopefuls.

One of those rivals, Thompson of the People’s Party of Canada, has generated considerable controversy by tapping into public anxieties around immigration and refugees.

Also running is another former provincial politician, Richard Lee, with the Liberals. Jay Shin is carrying the flag for the federal Conservative party, mounting concerns over the Liberals’ more than three years in office, expressing particular opposition to certain taxes and drug policies.

There are also two independent candidates running.

What is at stake nationally?

It’s seen as a high-stakes byelection beyond the borders of B.C.’s Lower Mainland mainly because experts say it’s a key test of Singh’s hold on the leadership of his party — which he’s headed since 2017 despite not yet holding a seat in Parliament. Facing the Liberals in Ottawa is seen as essential to his party’s chances, and some have speculated he could face an internal coup if he fails his first ballot-box test.

It also remains to be seen whether Bernier’s right-wing populist party, the People’s Party of Canada, has the kind of broad appeal he claims. Burnaby South is the first chance to test that support in a largely working-class city.

Another dynamic is how well the Liberal brand performs, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general to stop prosecuting Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee and faced cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C.

“Byelections are pretty silly tests of public mood,” Moscrop cautioned, “because they don’t really mimic the conditions of a general election.

“They’re a really strange one-off, or in this case, three. People try to read a lot into them but shouldn’t.”

What is the tone on the campaign trail?

Unusually bitter and divisive for a local riding byelection. Three all-candidates debates in a row have descended into audience members shouting accusations of racism, fascism and extremism against each other and candidates onstage.

The spark has been any conversation about immigration, refugees and people illegally crossing the border into Canada. The subjects have stoked anger at recent Yellow Vests rallies and from the People’s Party of Canada, which alleges all three rival parties are soft on screening people entering the country. The People’s party wants a tighter cap on immigration numbers and more prevention of irregular asylum-seekers.

That’s led to accusations of racism and xenophobia — but some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public safety risk. Meanwhile, the Liberal and NDP candidates have countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group of people.

The People’s party candidate has accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drugs.

The original Liberal candidate in Burnaby South was forced to resign by the party after the Star unearthed online posts in Chinese pointing out that Singh is South Asian.

What do locals say?

Despite Singh’s future hanging in the balance, when the Star hit the suburban city’s streets to find out what regular voters think, locals appeared more focused on anything but the NDP leader’s prospects in Ottawa.

By far, the most commonly cited issue in this byelection was affordable housing, followed by taxes, jobs, the environment and immigration.

Who are Burnaby’s voters?

Burnaby’s demographics are increasingly young and not white, the 2016 census found. Its average age is three years below B.C.’s average, and 69 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority, more than triple Canada’s rate. (The Greater Toronto Area, by comparison, was 51 per cent visible minorities.)

Burnaby South is home to a sizable Chinese-Canadian community, followed in number by Caucasians, South Asians and Filipinos.

In fact, 54 per cent of Burnaby South residents say they are immigrants, according to the 2016 census, compared to the Canada-wide figure of 14 per cent. (Immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area make up 46 per cent of the population.)

It’s also a historically working-class riding, with the median income at just $28,183 per year, 18 per cent less than the national average. Burnaby South’s poverty rates are significantly higher than the national average, with 22 per cent of residents being defined by Statistics Canada as low income, compared to 16 per cent nationally.

How can eligible voters cast their ballots?

Polls are open to any eligible Burnaby South resident from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday. Since not all Burnaby residents are eligible — the city contains multiple federal ridings — you can find out if you can vote, and where, on Elections Canada’s website.

""Today the transition is being blocked by irregular armed groups,"" Guaido explained, ""without those weapons we would have a pacific transition.""

Nationwide protests

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido on Saturday called for nationwide protests next week to support volunteers planning to travel to the border with Colombia to bring in US humanitarian aid.

""Not only will this be happening at the border where the volunteer movement will be, but in cities up and down the country where there will be demonstrations on February 23 for the aid to come in,"" Guaido told thousands of supporters at a public gathering.

Translation: ""Every day we are closer to February 23rd, the day the #Humanitarian Assistance will enter the country. The whole country calls on the military forces to take the side of the people, to let the #Humanitarian Assistance pass because this is also for them, for their families.""

Cada día estamos más cerca del #23F para que la #AyudaHumanitaria entre al país. Todo el país le hace un llamado a la FANB a ponerse del lado del pueblo, a dejar pasar la #AyudaHumanitaria porque esto también es por ellos, por sus familias.

""Was it necessary to intervene militarily in Iraq and divide it and kill millions of its people? I think they also made a mistake when they bombed Libya and killed more than 100,000 civilians. Can these errors be corrected? I also think they have also erred in a destructive policy approach in Syria, and are now making mistakes with Venezuela,"" Maduro told Al Jazeera.

Maduro invites US special envoy, reveals secret meetings

President Nicolas Maduro has invited a US special envoy to come to Venezuela after revealing in an interview with The Associated Press news agency that his foreign minister recently held secret meetings with the US official in New York.

The second of two meetings took place on February 11, four days after the envoy - Elliott Abrams - said the time for dialogue with Maduro's government had long passed.

Even while criticising Trump's confrontational stance toward his socialist government, Maduro said he holds out hope of meeting him to resolve an impasse over his recognition of Guaido.

Maduro said that while in New York, his foreign minister invited Abrams to come to Venezuela ""privately, publicly or secretly.""

""If he wants to meet, just tell me when, where and how and I'll be there,"" Maduro told AP, without providing more details. He said both New York meetings lasted several hours.

There was no immediate comment from Washington.

Maduro said he would not give up power and called the US aid currently sitting on the border with Colombia mere ""crumbs"" following Washington's move to freeze billions of dollars in Venezuela's assets.

He blamed the economic sanctions imposed by the US against Venezuela for the severe food and medicine shortages in his country.

US violating UN charter principles, says Venezuela FM

Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza has announced the formation of a group that believes the UN Charter's commitment to non-interference in another country's affairs is being violated, particularly in the South American nation.

Venezuela official calls US aid a 'spectacle'

Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza says that ""the momentum of the coup that the government of the United States was promoting is over - it didn't happen"".

He told reporters at UN headquarters in New York on Thursday that the US needs to rethink its strategy because ""the loyalty of our armed forces has already been proved"".

Arreaza dismissed a February 23 deadline set by self-declared president Juan Guaido to bring badly needed food and medicine into Venezuela, saying the opposition leader doesn't control a single policeman and ""whatever he says is absolutely absurd"".

He said President Nicolas Maduro controls the government and is the only one who can give deadlines. Maduro is blocking the aid, saying that Venezuelans are not beggars and that the move is part of a US-led coup.

Arreaza called the assistance a ""spectacle that the US is organising"" and denounced US sanctions against Venezuela.

""The US has blocked our economy,"" he said. ""The cost of this blockade is over $30bn - and they are sending this so-called humanitarian aid for $20m. So what is this? I'm choking you, I'm killing you, and then I'm giving you a cookie? So that's a show.""

Maduro, speaking with Lebanese television channel al-Mayadeen TV, said Guaido was seeking to divide the country and convince the Trump administration to launch a foreign intervention.

""If the American empire dares to touch even one palm leaf in our territory, this will turn into a new Vietnam,"" he said.

China denies holding talks with opposition

Beijing refuted a Wall Street Journal report stating it was in talks with Venezuela's opposition leader and self-declared interim president in order to protect its investments in the crisis-hit Latin American country.

""I think that [the journal's] approach is not constructive nor is it professional,"" Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday.

""In fact, the report is false and it is fake news,"" she said, adding that China sought a ""political solution through dialogue and consultation"" to Venezuela's ongoing crisis.

Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza met on Monday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres - their second meeting in a month.

The UN has said it stands ready to ramp up humanitarian aid to Venezuela but requires consent from Maduro's government.

190213060829530

Arreaza told a news conference at UN headquarters, that the US has used aid as a political weapon against Venezuela.

""There isn't a humanitarian crisis. There is an economy that is subject to a blockade,"" he added, arguing that US sanctions were responsible for the economic problems and accusing the US of seeking regime change.

""A government that is threatening you with use of force, with invasion, with a blockade, that gives orders to other countries for them to block you, do they really want to provide you with humanitarian aid?"" said Arreaza.

Russia's Lavrov warns US against using force in Venezuela

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned his US counterpart Mike Pompeo against US interference, including ""use of force"", in Venezuela.

Venezuela opposition: 'Let aid in'

Venezuela's opposition supporters will take to the streets nationwide on Tuesday to keep the heat on an embattled Nicolas Maduro and to demand he allow humanitarian aid into the country where food and medicine shortages are rife.

The rallies will take place nearly three weeks from the day that opposition leader Juan Guaido invoked a constitutional provision to declare himself Venezuela's legitimate president, arguing that Maduro's re-election last year was a sham.

The 35-year-old Guaido is coordinating Western relief efforts, while Maduro, who denies there is a crisis, is blocking supplies from coming in.

""We will return to the streets ... to demand the entry of humanitarian aid that will save the lives of more than 300,000 Venezuelans that today are at risk of dying,"" Guaido said on Twitter late Monday. ""This is a time to unite and fight!""

Opposition supporters at the rally said they are eager to see a change in the country.

""Finally we see a light at the end of the tunnel, I believe that none of the students here has had the facility to study, it has been difficult for everyone, it is a way of manifesting the discontent that we currently live."" Elena Davila, a 21-year-old student, told Al Jazeera.

Maduro denounced attempts to deliver aid as a US-orchestrated show to undermine and overthrow his government. US supplies were among the first delivered to a collection point established in the Colombian border town of Cucuta.

""The Ku Klux Klan governing the White House today wants to take possession of Venezuela,"" Maduro said in an interview with the BBC.

""Venezuela is not a country of famine. In the west, Venezuela's situation is distorted to justify any sort of intervention,"" he said.

Guaido has vowed that the opposition, which he has regalvanised after several years of infighting, will keep protesting to pressure Maduro to step down so new presidential elections can be held.

Doctors demand humanitarian aid be allowed into Venezuela

Venezuelan doctors have called on their nation's military to allow humanitarian aid into the country, the AP news agency reported.

About two dozen doctors held a protest on Sunday in neighbouring Colombia, in front of the entrance to a bridge that has been blocked by the Venezuelan military.

Aid including food and emergency medical supplies provided by the US is sitting in a storage facility near the bridge.

Venezuela's opposition is pledging to get the assistance into the country but President Nicolas Maduro has vowed not to accept it.

Maduro contends the aid delivery is part of a larger US intervention to remove him from power.

Venezuela moves to replace US executives on Citgo board

Venezuela's state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) is taking steps to remove at least two American board members of its US's refining subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum Corp, the Reuters news agency reported, citing people close to the matter.

Citgo is facing unprecedented challenges to its finances and management after the US government last week imposed tough sanctions on PDVSA designed to prevent oil revenue from going to leftist President Nicolas Maduro.

The US and dozens of other nations have refused to recognise Maduro, viewing his re-election last year to another six-year term as fraudulent.

Venezuelan's self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido is setting up bank accounts with US help that would take income accrued by Citgo, Venezuela's top foreign asset, to finance an interim government, Reuters reported.

China calls for peaceful talks

Venezuela should resolve its own matters itself via peaceful talks and China supports the international community's efforts in this regard, the Chinese foreign ministry said.

About 20 European Union nations have aligned with the US in recognising Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president and pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to call a new election.

190205064856707

Offering a counterpoint to Washington's hardline stance, the EU and a group of Latin American governments that have kept a moderate line on Venezuela called for dialogue and fresh elections.

The EU-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela in its inaugural meeting in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo this week said overly forceful intervention could aggravate the crisis.

Responding to that meeting, China's foreign ministry said in a statement late on Friday that China supported the efforts of the international community on the peaceful settlement of the Venezuela issue and hoped all parties would continue to play a constructive role.

""Venezuela's affairs should be resolved by its people within the framework of the constitution and the law through peaceful dialogue and political channels,"" the ministry said.

Volunteers ready US emergency aid

US humanitarian aid destined for Venezuela was being prepared at a warehouse on the Colombian border on Friday, as opposition leader Juan Guaido assured his countrymen that supplies would reach them despite objections from embattled President Nicolas Maduro.

Maduro vows to block 'fake' aid 'spectacle'

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said the US-backed humanitarian aid being stockpiled in the Colombian border city of Cucuta for his country should be distributed to poor Colombians as Venezuelans are not ""beggars"".

190208180029890

The day after trucks carrying medicine and food arrived in Cucuta, Maduro, who has become increasingly isolated internationally, told a news conference that Venezuela did not need the aid that includes supplies provided by the US.

""Venezuela won't allow the spectacle of fake humanitarian aid because we're no-one's beggars,"" Maduro said.

""Venezuela is not suffering the humanitarian crisis fabricated by Washington over the last four years to justify intervening in our country.""

He blamed the shortage of food and medicine on US sanctions, which mostly target regime individuals as well as state oil company PDVSA.



""Liberate the money that has been blocked and sequestered,"" said Maduro. ""This is a macabre game: we squeeze them by the neck and make them ask for crumbs.""



He said the aid offer was ""a message of humiliation for the people.""

At least 14 children die in Venezuelan hospital

A hospital in Venezuela has said 14 children have died this week following an outbreak of amoebiasis, a form of dysentery transmitted by contaminated food or water.

Dozens of other children infected by the disease can not receive adequate treatment due to a lack of medical supplies, employees at the Luis Razetti hospital in the coastal city of Barcelona told Al Jazeera on Thursday.

190208085644270

The staff at the hospital, located 300km east of Caracas, granted Al Jazeera access to the wards because they said they wanted the world to see that they are unequipped to save children's lives.

Marleea Marino lost her two-month-old baby this week as a result of the outbreak, but his body remains in the hospital because she has not been able to get the money needed to buy a coffin.

""There is nothing here, they have no medicine, they don't have food,"" she said. ""And now my son is dead.""

US sends aid to Colombia; Maduro rejects help

The US has sent food and medicine to Colombia's border with Venezuela, US officials said on Tuesday. It is still unclear, however, how the aid will get past the objections of President Nicolas Maduro, who has blocked shipments in the past.

Two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the aid will be staged at the main Colombian-Venezuelan border crossing at Cucuta. One official said more supplies would be staged in Brazil and in the Caribbean.

""I anticipate having perhaps a dozen locations all around Venezuela where such aid will be staged,"" the official said.

UN won't be part of any initiative dealing with Venezuela crisis

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says he has been in contact with supporters of the rival initiatives to deal with the Venezuela crisis and has decided the United Nations won't be part of any of them.

He told reporters on Monday that he took the decision ""in order to give credibility to our continued offer of good offices to the parties to be able at their request to help find a political solution"".

Guterres said he has been following the evolution of the situation in Venezuela with ""a lot of concern"".

The presidents of Mexico and Uruguay have offered to negotiate between socialist President Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido. But Guaido rejected the offer.

Lima group reaffirms support for Guaido

A coalition of Western Hemisphere nations is urging Venezuela's military to allow badly needed food and medicine to enter the country as the bloc pushes for a peaceful transition of power in the South American nation.

The call came Monday from the Lima Group, made up of nearly a dozen conservative Latin American countries and Canada. It has led the push to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader and seeks ways to remove President Maduro.

The coalition met on Monday in Ottawa, Canada and issued a declaration saying Venezuela's soldiers must show loyalty to Guaido. The group also said the United Nations and the international community should be ready to step in with humanitarian assistance for Venezuela.

Further, the bloc dismissed the idea of opening negotiations with Maduro, who has used past talks as a stalling tactic.

Guaido calls for aid conference on Venezuela

Guaido says the opposition will hold an international conference to seek emergency humanitarian assistance at the headquarters of the Organization of American States in Washington, DC.

Carlos Vecchio was recently designated as ambassador to Washington by Guaido.

Dozens of countries have now recognized Guaido as interim president, but many others back Maduro, who holds practical power in the country.

Maduro rejects European demands, US aid

President Nicolas Maduro is again rejecting moves by at least eight European nations recognising opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president.

“I thought hard about what life was going to be like as a private citizen, and I think what I’ve always loved is policy — whether it’s foreign policy or domestic policy, I’ve always loved it, and I always want to have a voice,” Haley told the Washington Post.

Stand for America, a social welfare group that cannot endorse candidates or make political donations, vows to help every American accomplish the “American dream” and claims Americans’ success is “being threatened by socialist schemes of higher taxes, burdensome job-destroying regulations, government-run health care, and unsecure borders.” The group also says numerous rogue regimes internationally are jeopardizing U.S. national security.

""As U.S. Ambassador to the UN, I was able to see firsthand the challenges we face around the globe. Iranian-backed radical Islamic terrorism threatens the lives of innocent Americans,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “Communist China is spreading its influence throughout the world and engaging in unfair and illegal trade practices. North Korea still has nuclear weapons that can hit us. Russia meddles in our elections and invades its neighbors with no regard for their sovereignty. In our own backyard, socialist dictators in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua oppress their own people and support narco-trafficking that invades America.”

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and daughter of immigrants, said her life story is evidence the American dream is still alive, due to “hard work, determination, and the incredible support of the people of South Carolina.”

""My story is proof positive that the American dream is alive and well,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “America’s greatness comes from our freedom and our values and they must be protected for future generations.”

""Even though I have entered private life, I will never stop standing up for America’s freedom and values,” Haley said. “We all have a part to play in keeping our country safe, strong, and prosperous.""

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia. The majority of the organization's member states are backing Guaido.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The latest on Venezuela’s political crisis (all times local):

10:35 p.m.

The U.N. Security Council has scheduled an open meeting Tuesday on the latest events in Venezuela at the request of the United States.

U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo is expected to brief the afternoon meeting.

The Security Council is divided over Venezuela. The U.S. and many Western and Latin American nations back opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president, while Russia, China and other countries support President Nicolas Maduro and oppose any interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs.

The U.S. call for the meeting follows a widely publicized effort by Guaido to deliver humanitarian aid to the economically devastated nation that met strong resistance from security forces loyal to Maduro.

The Trump administration announced new sanctions on Maduro’s allies Monday.

___

4:45 p.m.

Colombia’s foreign minister says Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and his family face “serious and credible” threats on their lives that if carried out would lead to a forceful international response against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Carlos Holmes Trujillo’s accusation came at the conclusion of a Monday meeting of regional diplomats and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to discuss Venezuela’s crisis. He provided no details about the alleged plot against Guaido and his family, saying only that Maduro will be held responsible if any of them are harmed.

The Lima Group of nations and Guaido issued an 18-point declaration Monday in which they reiterate their call on the Venezuelan military to recognize Guaido as their commander in chief. They also ask the International Criminal Court to consider Maduro’s blocking of emergency food and medical supplies a crime against humanity and urge the United Nations to play a bigger role in resolving the crisis.

2:15 p.m.

Brazil’s vice president says his nation will maintain its strategy of avoiding military intervention when it comes to neighboring Venezuela.

Monday’s tweet by Vice President Hamilton Mourao came as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met with regional leaders about Venezuela and said that “all options are on the table.”

Mourao said Brazilian officials “believe in diplomatic and international economic pressure.”

Pence, Mourao and several other top leaders were in the Colombian capital of Bogota for a meeting of the so-called “Lima Group.”

The group is a 14-nation coalition of mostly conservative Latin American nations and Canada that has joined together to pressure President Nicolas Maduro to leave power.

The meeting comes two days after a U.S.-backed effort to deliver humanitarian across the border from Colombia and Brazil ended in violence.

Vice President Mike Pence says the United States is sending another $56 million to neighbors of Venezuela to help them cope with migrants fleeing that nation’s deepening crisis.

Pence said Monday that the United States has already provided more than $139 million in aid to help Venezuela.

He spoke in Colombia’s capital at a meeting of The Lima Group, a coalition of mostly Latin American nations formed to address Venezuela’s turmoil.

Pence also met with opposition congressional leader Juan Guaido, who has declared presidential powers, arguing that the re-election of socialist President Nicolas Maduro was invalid.

Pence said the U.S. has sent five military transport planes with 400 tons of food and medicine to Colombia and Brazil.

Deadly clashes erupted over the weekend when Maduro refused to allow the aid cross, calling it part of a U.S.-led coup.

12:05 p.m.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is asking a coalition of mostly Latin American nations to freeze assets of Venezuela’s state oil company following a weekend of violent clashes over blocked humanitarian aid.

Pence met in Colombia’s capital on Monday with regional leaders in the Lima Group after President Nicolas Maduro’s security forces blocked U.S. aid from crossing Venezuela’s borders.

At least four protesters died while more than 300 were injured in nationwide clashes.

Pence called on regional leaders to freeze PDVSA assets — a measure taken earlier by the U.S.

He repeated President Trump’s threat that “all options are on the table” to push out Maduro, whose re-election the United States and dozens of other countries consider invalid.

Pence says the U.S. is also slapping financial sanctions on officials loyal to Maduro who blocked emergency aid and another in his inner circle.

11:50 a.m.

The United States is imposing new sanctions against allies of President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.

The Treasury Department on Monday announced the measures against four governors: Omar Prieto of Zulia, Ramon Carrizales of Apure, Jorge Garcia Carneiro of Vargas and Rafael Lacava of Carabobo state.

The move blocks them from financial or commercial transactions with U.S. citizens or entities.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said they had blocked humanitarian aid shipments backed by the United States and opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized by some 50 nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader.

___

11:45 a.m.

Germany is calling for greater pressure against the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro to bring about fresh elections.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said Monday that Germany believes “the pressure on Maduro needs to be increased so as to move in the direction of free, fair and democratic presidential elections.”

Adebahr said Germany is consulting with fellow European countries, but would seek to have additional EU sanctions target those close to Maduro “and of course not worsen the dramatic hardship experienced by the citizens of Venezuela.”

Government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer condemned violence at points on the Venezuelan border where opposition figures have been trying to bring in aid shipments.

Demmer said Germany was particularly concerned by “the apparent deployment of militias and groups of thugs to intimidate the population.

10:30 am.

The United States is planning new ways to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to give up power and to provide assistance to the people of the economically devastated South American nation.

Vice President Mike Pence arrived in the Colombian capital on Monday and immediately met with Colombian President Ivan Duque. He’ll also meet with members of a regional coalition and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to discuss the next steps aimed at ousting Maduro.

Pence’s appearance before the Lima Group comes two days after a U.S.-backed effort to deliver humanitarian across the border from Colombia ended in violence.

The gross domestic product (GDP) figure was lower than the 1.0 percent expected by analysts, following 2.0 percent growth in the previous quarter.



This slowing pace closed out the year with a total annualized economic growth rate of 1.8 percent, slightly more than half the previous year’s 3.0 percent and the United States’s 2.9 percent growth in 2018. “The ‘R’ word (for recession) will be on minds as Canada’s economy barely skirted the start of a recession in Q4,” CIBC Capital Markets chief economist Avery Shenfeld said in a research note.



He pointed to a “weak handoff” from December to the new year, that he said will likely prompt the Bank of Canada to back off plans to raise interest rates in the short term. “If not for a huge employment gain in January (+67,000 jobs) we’d be worried about an outright recession, but at this point, its best described as a stalled engine,” Shenfeld concluded.



Either scenario is bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals as they head into elections in October looking to hold onto their parliamentary majority. The Trudeau Liberals’ popularity slipped amid allegations by his former attorney general of political interference in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi’s reign. For the first time, the ruling Liberal Party has found itself trailing the opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer in the most recent public opinion polls.



Statistics Canada said the nation’s slowing economic growth mainly reflected a drop in investment spending and lower exports. Household spending slowed for a second consecutive quarter, with spending on life insurance and financial services up and on motor vehicles down.



Purchases of cannabis — after recreational use was legalized in October — totalled Can$5.9 billion (US$4.5 billion) or 0.5 percent of household spending. Business investment on non-residential structures, and machinery and equipment fell sharply, but that plunge was moderated by an uptick in investment in intellectual property products. The latter was “mainly attributable to mineral exploration and evaluation, which can be influenced by anticipated prices and potential new reserves,” said Statistics Canada.



Exports volumes edged down, led by lower exports of forestry products, building and packaging materials, metal and non-metallic minerals, and energy products. Imports also fell on lower shipments of industrial chemicals, plastic and rubber products, motor vehicles and parts, and metal and non-metallic mineral products. Imports of energy products were flat while aircraft, engines and parts rebounded a whopping 17.1 percent.

The Conservatives have owned this vast riding along Lake Simcoe — which includes Georgina, East Gwillimbury, King, Bradford West Gwillimbury and the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation — dating back five elections. It’s a political juggernaut that, for the past 14 years, has featured Conservative MP Peter Van Loan, a Tory stalwart who triggered Monday’s byelection with his retirement announcement last September. The Tory bid to fill Van Loan’s shoes against a slate of eight contenders from all major federal parties rested with Davidson, a Georgina businessman and political newcomer.

The newly minted party — it launched in September — announced last month that Toronto lawyer Robert Geurts would carry it into its first political contest. “Take a stand, make a difference!” Geurts posted on his Twitter feed Monday. “It’s time to stop the lies and the corruption.” Bernier joined Geurts for a rally in Bradford two weeks ago. The riding’s NDP candidate is community organizer Jessa McLean. In her nomination acceptance speech, McLean pitched an alternative vision to past elected representatives who don’t “reflect who we are, and who appear to be completely out of touch with most peoples’ lived reality,” the Georgina Advocate reported last month. “People are working harder, but are not getting ahead ...

20,Empty,2019-02-27T12:21:00Z,An under-the-hood look at the share price at which Cronos Group would offer intriguing value to investors.,"Marijuana stocks can seemingly do no wrong lately, and it's not hard to see why. Since October, we've seen Canada legalize recreational marijuana, had a handful of U.S. states approve medical or recreational weed during midterm elections in November, witnessed President Trump sign the Farm Bill into law, and heard of rumors that Mexico may choose to legalize recreational marijuana in 2019. Not shockingly, the first-ever marijuana exchange-traded fund in Canada, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, is up more than 50% this year.

But even with rapid global sales growth of up to 38% expected in 2019, not all pot stock valuations make sense. While yours truly has been critical of mid- and large-cap marijuana stock valuations in recent months, no company has stood out as more overvalued recently than Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) -- this year's top-performing pot stock.

However, just because I view Cronos Group as a stock worth avoiding now, it doesn't mean I don't see value in the business or the stock. There is a share price at which I believe Cronos Group becomes attractive to investors. But before I divulge that price point, let me walk you through my thought process from both the buy and sell sides of things.

The Cronos Group buy thesis

Make no mistake about it, the clearest reason to be excited about Cronos Group is the $1.8 billion equity investment from tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO), announced in early December. Altria, which has faced years of declining cigarette demand in the U.S., is looking for ways to reignite growth, without having to continuously raise tobacco prices. By taking a 45% equity stake in Cronos Group, Altria is getting its foot in the door in the high-growth cannabis industry.

Furthermore, Altria's equity stake in Cronos Group, which has yet to close, comes with warrants that could be exercised at a later date. If Altria were to exercise all the warrants it'll be receiving, it could become a majority stakeholder (55%) in Cronos. Given its $3.6 billion market cap, Cronos could easily be gobbled up by Altria and its still-substantial free cash flow. Thus, premium is being paid to the likelihood that Altria will eventually buy the remainder of Cronos Group that it doesn't already own.

On the flip side, once the deal closes, Cronos Group will have north of $1.8 billion in cash on hand to execute on its long-term strategy. No longer having to worry about raising capital, Cronos will be focused on expanding internationally, diversifying its product portfolio to feature high-margin items, and growing its production capacity. This also means that dilution becomes less of a concern, with the company not having to turn to bought-deal offerings to raise capital.

Partnerships are another key selling point for Cronos Group. In September, it and Ginkgo Bioworks entered into a deal that'll cost Cronos up to $100 million. It will, however, give Cronos access to Ginkgo's microorganism development platform. This platform should allow for the creation of yeast strains capable of producing eight types of cannabinoids. These cannabinoids, some of which are rare, could be produced at commercial scale, presumably for a cheaper cost than traditional extraction methods.

Why avoiding Cronos Group makes sense

On the other hand, there are also a number of reasons why this $3.6 billion valuation (soon to be $5.4 billion once the Altria deal closes) makes little sense.

To begin with, Cronos' production isn't all that impressive, relative to its market cap. The top three projected growers -- Aurora Cannabis, Canopy Growth, and Aphria -- are on track for 700,000 kilos, 500,000 kilos, and 255,000 kilos, respectively, at peak production in my estimate. Aurora, Canopy Growth, and Aphria carry respective market caps of $7.2 billion, $15 billion, and $2.4 billion (albeit Aphria has had a crisis of confidence with management of late).

By comparison, Cronos Group should net 70,000 kilos from its joint venture, 40,000 kilos from Peace Naturals, about 7,000 combined kilos from its international grow farms, and some smaller amounts from other grow sites. That's squeezing every last drop of blood from the proverbial turnip for maybe 120,000 kilograms of peak annual production. Investors could purchase about a half dozen other pot stocks that should net between 100,000 kilos and 138,000 kilos at their peak for anywhere from a third to a tenth of Cronos' post-Altria investment market cap (i.e., $5.4 billion).

Cronos Group has also done a pretty poor job of moving into overseas markets like its peers. As we've witnessed from recreationally legal states in the U.S., dried cannabis flower has a tendency to be oversupplied and commoditized over time. By the early part of the next decade, it wouldn't be surprising if domestic Canadian supply far outpaced demand, leading domestic growers to seek foreign outlets to sell their excess supply. Aurora Cannabis is nearing a presence in two dozen countries, whereas Canopy Growth has a presence in more than a dozen foreign markets. As for Cronos, it's made little foreign impression beyond Israel and Australia, which could threaten its margins if dried flower oversupply does hit, as expected.

Lastly, with marijuana now legal to our north, fundamentals and earnings reports actually matter now. Even though Cronos Group is receiving a very welcome cash infusion from Altria, and the duo may work on joint products (pun intended) in the future, the company isn't expected to generate much in the way of profits anytime soon. The four analysts covering Cronos are calling for just CA$0.06 per share (that's six cents in Canadian dollars) for fiscal 2019, and it's unclear if that includes a number of one-time benefits that have been helping pot stocks like Cronos Group. Even assuming Cronos Group is profitable, which is far from a guarantee, its forward price-to-earnings ratio might be north of 400!

Here's the price at which Cronos Group offers real value to investors

Now that you've heard both sides of the argument, I can walk you through the share price at which I feel Cronos Group offers value, which for me is $9 per share. And yes, I'm aware that this is 55% lower than where Cronos is currently trading, which also backs up my thesis of the company as being the most overvalued pot stock.

Just how the heck did I pull $9 out of the hat? Well, on the positive side, I'm factoring in that about a third of the postinvestment market cap of this company will be in cash. Of course, Cronos Group will be actively using this capital to hopefully expand overseas and make complementary acquisitions. Thus, this $1.8 billion in cash might be more like $1 billion in 12 to 18 months.

I'm also counting on Cronos Group to focus on higher-margin products and medical cannabis patients. Its partnership with Ginkgo is a good example of the company aiming for high-margin sales.

Then again, Cronos Group will probably be lucky to turn a profit in 2019, and it's unlikely to even cross $100 million in annual sales until fiscal 2020. That's a lot of premium that investors are giving a company with a triple-digit forward price-to-earnings ratio.

Ultimately, a share price of $9, post-Altria deal closing, assumes a forward cash value of around $1 billion and assigns a value of an additional $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to its 120,000-kilo production, its high-margin cannabinoid output with Ginkgo, and the intangible value that a name like Altria brings to the table. While still not traditionally cheap, a $9 share price would likely give Cronos a PEG ratio less than 2, which could offer modest upside and represent a potentially attractive entry point for investors.",At What Price Is Cronos Group Worth Buying?,Fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/27/at-what-price-is-cronos-group-worth-buying.aspx

WASHINGTON (AP) — Assailed by his ex-lawyer at every turn, President Donald Trump nevertheless claimed a measure of vindication from Michael Cohen's statement that he possessed no direct evidence of collusion with Russia from his time serving the boss. But contrary to Trump's words, Cohen did not exonerate him on the matter in his testimony to lawmakers.

Trump also put the best face on his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, claiming he had a ""really productive time"" in Hanoi, Vietnam, despite the collapse of talks and cancellation of a planned signing agreement. More substantively, he claimed the talks broke down because North Korea insisted on the lifting of all sanctions — an assertion contradicted by the State Department as well as by the North Koreans.

On other recent rhetorical fronts, the president credited his daughter with creating jobs that don't exist and Democrats persisted in their distorted accusation that the Trump administration confined migrant children in cages.

A review:

COHEN TESTIMONY

TRUMP: ""He said no collusion. And I was, you know, a little impressed by that, frankly. Could've — he could've gone all out. He only went about 95 percent instead of 100 percent."" — Hanoi news conference Thursday.

THE FACTS: He takes Cohen's comment too far. Cohen did not clear his former boss on the question of whether his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. In the course of implicating Trump in other alleged criminal activity, Cohen said he did not witness or know directly of collusion ""but I have my suspicions."" He didn't say ""no collusion.""

Cohen told lawmakers: ""So, as I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word 'colluding.' Was there something odd about the back-and-forth praise with President Putin? Yes, but I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. I was not part of the campaign. I don't know the other conversations that Mr. Trump had with other individuals. There is just so many dots that all seem to lead to the same direction.""

And: ""The questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not, and I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions.""

REP. JIM JORDAN, top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee: ""Remember how all this started. The Clinton campaign hired Perkins Coie law firm who hired Glenn Simpson who hired a foreigner, Christopher Steele, who put together the fake dossier that the FBI used to go get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign."" — remarks Wednesday at hearing with Cohen.

THE FACTS: He's repeating a false claim by Trump that special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe is based on a ""fake dossier."" The FBI's investigation actually began months before it received a dossier of anti-Trump research financed by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign. The FBI probe's origins were based on other evidence — not the existence of the dossier, which has not been discredited.

Last year, the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee found the Russia probe was initiated after the FBI received information related to Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, not the dossier. The committee's final report was praised by Trump.

THE FACTS: A senior State Department official said North Korea demanded Trump's support for the lifting of U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed since March 2016 — not other sanctions. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss the private negotiations.

Although North Korea wants all sanctions erased, the official said, Kim was pressing for relief from ones that impede the civilian economy and was not demanding an end to sanctions on armaments. Altogether, Kim was seeking substantial relief, insisting bans be lifted on trade in goods and commodities such as metals, raw materials, luxury items, seafood, coal exports, refined petroleum imports and raw petroleum imports.

The House of Commons scheduled an emergency debate Thursday on the deepening controversy, the most serious faced by Trudeau since assuming office in 2015.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer accused the Liberal prime minister's inner circle of possibly attempting to obstruct justice, in a letter to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Brenda Lucki -- which the RCMP confirmed to AFP it has received.

""The matter at hand appears, on its face, to be a gross violation of the law,"" Scheer wrote.

He pointed to ""explosive testimony"" by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who told the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday that Trudeau's staff and other senior officials applied undue pressure on her to settle a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi's reign.

Wilson-Raybould, after resigning from cabinet, testified that she experienced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" to politically interfere in the prosecution of one of the world's top engineering firms.

She added that she faced ""veiled threats,"" and described the intense pressure on her to comply as ""inappropriate,"" but stopped short of suggesting it was illegal.

In the end, Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

Trudeau has rejected her characterizations of events, saying Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make.""

Thursday morning, dodging calls to resign, he said: ""My team and I have always acted in a professional manner.""

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that's exactly what we've done every step of the way ... in a way that has respected our laws and respects the independence of the judiciary,"" he added.

For weeks, Trudeau's Liberal government has been rocked by the allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper, only eight months before elections.

COSTA MESA, Calif. – A false claim bubbled up from the internet last month that Sen. Kamala Harris, the recently announced presidential candidate, wasn’t eligible for election because she had immigrant parents and spent part of her childhood in Canada. The claim, an echo of the “birther” conspiracy that trailed President Barack Obama, was widely debunked but still addressed seriously by mainstream news pundits, including CNN’s Chris Cuomo.

Even better for Jacob Wohl, the 21-year-old Californian who ignited the Harris birther claim with a tweet, some people actually seemed to accept it as fact.

“The believability stuck at about 15 to 18 percent by my measurement,” Wohl said in an interview shortly afterward, declaring it “not a bad campaign.”

Kamala Harris is NOT eligible to be President. Her father arrived from Jamaica in 1961—mother from India arrived in 1960



Neither parent was a legal resident for 5 years prior to Harris’s birth, a requirement for naturalization

Wohl, a self-professed “political and corporate intel consultant” and supporter of President Donald Trump, is dedicated to plying the malleable fringe of the electorate with dubious claims and disinformation schemes.

Amplifying him in that quest are his links to the world’s loudest Twitter cheerleader, Trump. Wohl’s father, attorney David Wohl, says that as a Trump surrogate he was on calls with the 2016 presidential candidate daily. David Wohl has regularly appeared on cable news networks to promote the president and his policies.

Trump has retweeted Jacob Wohl’s praise – of the president’s economy, or just general “WINNING”-ness that the “left-wing media can’t stand” – at least three times. They appear to have met at least once, as evidenced by a photo of father, son and president together, and the younger Wohl says he has spoken to the president “several” times. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on their relationship.

On Twitter, where he has 186,000 followers and is adept at quickly responding to Trump’s tweets to gain many more eyeballs, Wohl has claimed, without evidence, that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg is secretly dead or in a vegetative state and that pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and media outlets were a left-wing “false flag” operation.

He flew to Minnesota last week to “investigate” the rumor that Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar married her brother, a mission for which he tried to fund-raise $25,000 from his online followers. Wohl’s trip to the heartland devolved into bizarre tweets in which he suggested that Minneapolis was so overrun by Somali jihadists that he had to wear a bulletproof vest and travel with a team of “security professionals.”

In the coming days, I will be traveling to Ilhan Omar's district with @Ali and Laura Loomer to gather evidence of the SHAM MARRIAGE to her brother

🚨FUND THE FIGHT at https://t.co/QkUCkLaox5🚨https://t.co/lhGOJJPsqh — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) February 17, 2019

Wohl’s most prominent gambit was also his most disastrous: an apparent sloppy attempt to accuse Trump's nemesis special counsel Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct days before the midterm elections in November. His actions were referred to the FBI for potential criminal investigation. The woman he named as a credible accuser of the special prosecutor, Carolyne Cass, recently told USA TODAY that Wohl “made it up,” deceived her with a false identity and tried to coerce her to appear at a news conference against her will.

Wohl initially maintained that Cass's allegations were credible. When told that Cass said they were inaccurate, Wohl then claimed that he couldn’t speak about the situation because of a legal non-disclosure agreement with Cass, who denied that such an agreement exists. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on whether the agency was investigating the episode.

Deciphering the Mueller saga is characteristic of how difficult it is to grasp at the truth with Wohl, who represents a political moment in which even the most basic facts are in dispute.

In some ways, Wohl is simply carrying on the dubious American tradition of deceit in politics, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President.” Jamieson described 19th-century political operatives who would secretly buy newspapers to dictate coverage, and the dissemination of false accounts about President Andrew Johnson being a murderer.

The difference now, she said, is that the internet has democratized that deceit. It’s more difficult online to determine the source of a claim, a major factor in deciding whether to believe it. Being repeatedly bombarded with a claim – social media’s specialty –increases its perceived accuracy, even if it’s false and has been publicly debunked. People are more likely to believe a false claim that fits their ideology, and the internet naturally facilitates people like Wohl finding and communicating with like-minded groups.

“It takes a real talent to figure out what kind of deceptions will gain traction,” Jamieson said, and to have both the knowledge of their demographic and technical ability to “figure out what will resonate as opposed to what will be laughed at.”

Wohl disclosed a raft of schemes he says are in the works that he hopes will resonate in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.

He says he plans to create “enormous left-wing online properties” – such as deceptive Facebook and Twitter accounts – ""and use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.” It’s a plot similar to what Mueller has charged in indictments that the Russians crafted in an effort to boost the 2016 campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and hobble Hillary Clinton.

Another stated scheme: seeking to collect damaging information on left-leaning non-profits including Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Right Wing Watch by offering their insiders “moral reconciliation,” and if that doesn’t work, “things of worth” – such as money.

Or perhaps those stated plans themselves are a ruse to fool the mainstream media, which he calls a “band of lying goblins.”

Wohl stressed that the accuracy of the information he spreads is “not the important part.” All that matters is how far those claims travel, and how many people believe them.

Wohl said he yearns for the days – before he was born – when conservatives would join in outrage over a scene in a sitcom and funnel that unity into other pursuits, like support for unchecked military actions. “You think about these incredibly large-scale wars that were just launched without congressional approval, and they were pretty damn good at carrying out the conservative torch, whatever it happened to be at the time,” Wohl said.

In the spread of information, he said, truth is an obsolete concept. “It’s something that can’t be thought about in a linear, binary true-false, facts-non-facts – you can’t do that anymore,” Wohl said. “It’s just not the way it works.”

Packing heat at the hipster coffee shop

Wohl chose to meet at Coffee Nature, probably the closest thing to a hipster coffee shop in his resident Orange County, in a nod to the tweets that gained him fame and derision before he was best known for allegedly trying to catfish the special counsel.

Since last year, Wohl has more than a dozen times claimed on Twitter to have overheard liberals in hipster coffee shops sharing pro-Trump secrets with one another, such as that they were actually overjoyed by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The tweets conjure up the image of Wohl furtively eavesdropping on surrounding patrons from behind the foam of an oat milk cappuccino.

He arrived at the Orange County cafe in a black Corvette with new-car paper license plates and extended a rigid hand but did not shake when a reporter grasped it. Sipping a free cup of ice water, the thin, severe-featured Wohl, who speaks in clipped verbiage, quickly worked into conversation that he was carrying a concealed firearm in response to the “voluminous left-wing threats” he has received.

Wohl explained that he picks on bohemian coffee shops because he sees them as the “Temple Mount” of liberalism and calculated that “if you in any way impugn the sanctity of the hipster coffee shop, it’s going to be something that gets them really charged up.” In describing his methods, Wohl casually explained that he makes it up: “I’ll literally hear one thing and I’ll flip it 180 degrees.”

I was sitting in a hipster coffee shop in Downtown LA this morning and couldn't help but overhear the 6 college age women seated at a table who were clamering with excitement and joy over the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) October 5, 2018

Wohl said he was eager to correct the record on the Mueller episode, in which his apparent efforts to disgrace Trump’s foremost adversary ended up unraveling into one of the weirdest major news stories in a cycle full of them.

It started with emails received by several news outlets in which the sender claimed an intelligence company had tried to pay her to accuse Mueller of sexual misdeeds. A professor produced emails showing that she had also been approached for information by the company. Reporters followed a bizarre online trail to reveal that Wohl was behind the intelligence company, which seemed to be staffed by an office full of imagined employees. Wohl and his partner in the episode, Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, then announced a news conference devolving into farce when a woman who they said was going to make allegations against Mueller didn’t show up.

The result of the Elmore Leonard-esque plot was a media cycle of ridicule for Wohl. One outlet’s headline read: “Fabricated Mueller Smear Appears to Have Come From Comically Inept Far-Right Internet Person.” The special prosecutor’s office broke its customary silence to announce that it had referred the scheme to the FBI for criminal investigation.

Wohl claimed at the coffee shop, however, that a goal of his scheme had been to trick journalists into thinking that he had offered to pay for dirt on Mueller, so he made up a person and sent those allegations to media outlets. On his phone, he scrolled through emails from reporters at major outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and Buzzfeed who had tried to garner more information from a person who he says did not actually exist.

He described these emails-- of reporters doing their due diligence-- as trophies from a logic-stretching plan that had as the ultimate goal getting reporters to go to a news conference at a D.C.-area Holiday Inn. “The real allegations against Mueller would have been ignored … had we not roped the media into attending the press conference,” Wohl said.

Someone inside Mueller’s office likely sent out the hoax email claiming to be a woman offered payment to make an accusation against Mueller!



They know that Mueller’s real victims are coming forward!



Tick tock... — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) October 31, 2018

But those “real allegations” appear to be even more problematic. At the news conference, Wohl distributed a document that was digitally signed, purportedly by the absent accuser Carolyne Cass, in which she said she had been sexually assaulted by Mueller in New York in 2010. In the interview this month, Wohl referred to Cass as a “real accuser” and called her allegations credible.

But when reached by USA TODAY, 34-year-old Carolyne Cass of Los Angeles said Wohl, whom she met on Craigslist, had tricked her by pretending to be an investigator named Matthew Cohen who was trained by Israeli intelligence forces and agreed to help her with “unscrupulous characters ripping me off.”

Cass said she paid the man she knew as Cohen $2,000, for which he did no work but instead offered her the prospect of employment at his intelligence agency and had her speak on the phone to people whose identities she now believes Wohl fabricated.

Cass said it ultimately became clear that Cohen and his associates, imaginary or otherwise, “needed a credible female to put on the line” for false allegations about Mueller. “They made it up,” Cass said of the document accusing Mueller, which was passed around at the news conference. “They wrote it and docu-signed it.”

She claimed Cohen tried to get her to speak at the news conference but she “escaped” and learned only as the scheme exploded that Cohen was in fact Wohl. “He completely lied to me,” Cass said.

Wohl had as recently as this month referred to Cass while speaking in detail about the Mueller episode. But when asked about Cass’s version of events, Wohl said he could not speak further because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with her and “can’t violate any confidences.” Cass said no such agreement existed.

Burkman also refused to discuss his role in the Mueller scheme.

Both Wohl and Cass say they have not been contacted by the FBI. Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg said Wohl’s actions could be construed by a federal prosecutor as wire fraud, obstruction of justice or conspiracy – or as possibly violating various state statutes – but likely fell into a legal “gray zone.”

“The whole thing smacks of illegality and nefariousness and deception, but it still needs to have an anchor in criminal statute,” Weisberg said.

Tax liens and exotic birds

Wohl said he didn’t decide to fully apply his “talents” to politics until the rise of Trump, who he describes as a political soulmate in both ideology and tactics. But he said his political awakening came in 2008, when he was in fifth grade and watched Obama’s inauguration with great trepidation for what it meant for the national debt.

Despite his stated concern for fiscal responsibility, public records suggest that both Jacob and his television pundit father have had their own turbulent financial histories.

A search of television appearances shows that David Wohl – who was admitted to the California bar in 1989 and works largely in criminal defense – has been an analyst on Fox News and other cable stations for more than a decade, and his appearances have shifted from that of a legal expert to a fervent defender of the then-candidate and president.

Like his son, David Wohl has promoted conspiracy theories including that the pipe bombs sent to Democrats and media outlets, for which a Trump supporter in Florida was arrested, were a hoax.

In a brief interview, David Wohl said he had daily conference calls with Trump to hone messaging during the campaign. A spokesman for Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment on the elder Wohl’s role.

A search of public records shows that at least a dozen times since 1995, David Wohl has been the subject of state and federal tax liens in California’s Orange and Riverside Counties. Most recently, the IRS named him and his wife in a property lien for $22,002.31 for back income taxes. Though several of the past liens were marked as released, or paid off, the most recent lien was not shown to have been released.

In divorce filings last year, David Wohl’s wife, Michelle, said that he spends money on guitars, watches, firearms, tickets to concerts and sporting events and a recently purchased “exotic bird"" costing $8,000 to $10,000 while “I struggle to make ends meet and live from paycheck to paycheck.”

David Wohl said he had no knowledge of tax liens against him and called this article a ""hit piece. ... Trump calls you guys out for (stuff) like this.""

He said that he and his wife have since reconciled and that her claims in the divorce were ""extreme exaggerations"" and ""garbage.""

""I don't have my lawyer file documents that are garbage,"" Michelle Wohl said when reached for comment, adding that her filings were under penalty of perjury.

Jacob Wohl’s own history with money got off to a rocky start when, as a teenage hedge fund trader, he was investigated by multiple regulatory bodies in 2016.

The Arizona Corporation Commission and National Futures Association (NFA) investigated allegations including that Wohl and his partner had failed to pay back an investor, did not accurately present the risk of their investments and claimed that they had been in business for 35 years when neither of them had been alive that long.

Wohl father and son teamed up to fend off the regulators. David Wohl said he called the Los Angeles Police Department to report financial investigators for stalking them. Jacob Wohl declared in filings that his treatment by NFA investigators was evidence of the organization’s “broader culture of harassment, stalking and thuggery.”

The Arizona Corporation Commission ordered Wohl to no longer trade securities or provide investment advisory services in the state and to pay just under $33,000 in restitution. The NFA permanently barred Wohl. According to Wohl, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated him and declined to pursue enforcement action. The commission declined to comment.

Wohl said he ultimately sold his half of his financial business to his partner. He maintained that there was “nothing even remotely illegal” about his financial enterprise, saying his father “wasn’t going to let me run a rogue hedge fund.”

As he has in his political schemes, Wohl displayed glee for high stakes, calling his financial career “a good experience” and remarking: “Who gets to go through a SEC investigation at age 18?”

A threat from Avenatti

While describing his recent professional work – a vague resume involving doing “corporate intelligence” for a Los Angeles businessman he won’t name and helping Republican lobbyists “butt out other lobbyists” by gathering information for them – Wohl’s phone began buzzing with the screen reading “Dad.”

He learned in the ensuing phone conversation that Michael Avenatti, the California attorney who has turned his representation of porn star Stormy Daniels into full-time work as a Trump antagonist, had tweeted at Wohl: “I am coming for you.”

Avenatti had been under investigation by Los Angeles authorities for an alleged domestic violence incident and had suggested that Wohl was involved in setting him up. Upon learning that criminal charges would not be forthcoming, Avenatti celebrated with the vengeful tweet.

Wohl responded by retreating to the bathroom of the hipster coffee shop, where he retweeted his father’s message that they would be reporting Avenatti’s threat to the authorities.

It’s not clear why Avenatti has suggested Wohl was involved. In a later interview, Avenatti said he was “not at liberty” to expound on Wohl’s role. Wohl said Avenatti has “accused me of putting a GPS device on his car” and “sending thugs after him to taunt him in public,” both of which he denies.

Avenatti’s response: “I have no idea what this idiot is talking about. This child is so stupid and so hungry for attention that he will say anything.”

Like a drawn-out pro wrestling feud, the duel between Avenatti and Wohl will surely have many chapters, each one more convoluted than the previous. Avenatti vowed that ultimately, Wohl “is going to find himself in a penitentiary somewhere.”

When Wohl came back from the bathroom, he bristled at a reporter’s suggestion that Avenatti – who is prone to melodrama, has scads of detractors and is skilled at intertwining himself in the major events of a bizarre political era – is the closest thing to his foil on the left.

“Kind of,” Wohl protested. “But he’s a loony tune because he’s making provably false accusations.”

In a joint statement yesterday, the international group voiced deep concern: ""In particular, President Al Bashir's recent decisions to declare a national State of Emergency, to appoint military and security members to senior government positions, and to issue emergency orders criminalising peaceful demonstrations and allowing security forces to act with impunity will further erode human rights, governance and effective economic management.""

'Return to military rule'

The statement asserts that ""the return to military rule does not create a conducive environment for a renewed political dialogue or credible elections. We note the ongoing detention of political leaders, activists and journalists, and call upon the Government of Sudan to abide by its public commitments to free them as well as others who have been arbitrarily detained. We also note continuing reports of unacceptable use of live fire, beating of protestors and mistreatment of detainees.""

The statement suggests that ""there remains a clear need for political and economic reform in Sudan that is fully inclusive, and which addresses the legitimate grievances expressed by the protestors. Economic stability cannot be achieved without first reaching political consensus. Political consensus cannot be achieved by imprisoning, shooting, and criminalizing peaceful protesters.""

Troika countries and Canada say they will continue to monitor the situation closely, and to emphasise that ""the government of Sudan's response to these protests and the actions of the military-led government will determine our countries' future engagement"".

Restraint

In a statement in January, the Troika and Canada warned that ""the government of Sudan's actions and decisions over the coming weeks will have an impact on the engagement of our governments and others in the coming months and years,"" and urged the government of Sudan ""to respond to the current challenges by implementing the necessary political reforms, to allow the Sudanese people to exercise their constitutional rights to peacefully express their political, economic and social views freely and without any fear of retaliation or persecution.""

In an earlier statement following the start of the mass protests in December, the Troika expressed ""concern about the violence occurring during recent protests in Sudan, including credible reports of the use of live fire by the government of Sudan and of multiple deaths during several protests.""",Sudan: International Troika Voices Concern Over State of Emergency in Sudan,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201902280675.html

She cited four occasions on which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or senior aides—even Canada’s top civil servant—brought up a forthcoming election (Quebec’s or their own) during a discussion of a potential deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin, which Wilson-Raybould did not support.

From her explosive half-hour opening statement:

Sept. 6, 2018: Ben Chin, chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, to Jessica Prince, Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff

He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this. He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.

Sept. 16: Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques, senior advisors to the Prime Minister, to Jessica Prince

They said that they think we should be able to find a more reasonable resolution here. They told her that SNC’s next board meeting is on Thursday (Sept 20). They also mention the Quebec election context.

Sept. 17: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, to Wilson-Raybould

The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise—the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA—he said ‘there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders’ … ‘they will likely be moving to London if this happens’… ‘and there is an election in Quebec soon’…

At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘and I am an MP in Quebec—the member for Papineau.’

I was quite taken aback. My response—and I remember this vividly—was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye—I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’ The Prime Minister said, ‘No, no, no—we just need to find a solution.’

Oct. 26: Mathieu Bouchard to Jessica Prince

My COS (chief of staff) said that this would obviously be perceived as interference and her boss questioning the DPP’s decision. Mathieu said that if—six months from the election—SNC announces they are moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said “we can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected.

Either scenario is bad news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals as they head into elections in October looking to hold onto their parliamentary majority.

The Trudeau Liberals' popularity slipped amid allegations by his former attorney general of political interference in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi's reign.

For the first time, the ruling Liberal Party has found itself trailing the opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer in the most recent public opinion polls.

Statistics Canada said the nation's slowing economic growth mainly reflected a drop in investment spending and lower exports.

Household spending slowed for a second consecutive quarter, with spending on life insurance and financial services up and on motor vehicles down.

Purchases of cannabis - after recreational use was legalized in October - totalled C$5.9 billion (US$4.5 billion) or 0.5 per cent of household spending.

Business investment on non-residential structures, and machinery and equipment fell sharply, but that plunge was moderated by an uptick in investment in intellectual property products.

The latter was ""mainly attributable to mineral exploration and evaluation, which can be influenced by anticipated prices and potential new reserves"", said Statistics Canada.

Exports volumes edged down, led by lower exports of forestry products, building and packaging materials, metal and non-metallic minerals, and energy products.

Imports also fell on lower shipments of industrial chemicals, plastic and rubber products, motor vehicles and parts, and metal and non-metallic mineral products.

Imports of energy products were flat while aircraft, engines and parts rebounded a whopping 17.1 per cent.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it wants the United Nations Security Council to vote this week on a draft resolution calling for elections in Venezuela and the delivery of humanitarian aid, but the move is likely to be opposed by Russia and other states.

Speaking ahead of a council meeting on Venezuela, the U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, also told reporters Washington would impose more sanctions on ""high-ranking members of the regime and their financial affairs"" this week and next.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country's elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

Earlier this month the United States proposed a draft Security Council resolution, which prompted Russia to propose a rival text that makes no reference to elections or aid. A resolution needs nine votes in favor by the 15-member council and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass.

""I would not like to predict what the Russians are going to do. I think it would be shameful to veto a resolution that calls for more humanitarian aid,"" Abrams told reporters.

The Security Council met on Tuesday at the request of the United States, days after Maduro troops violently drove back U.S.-backed foreign aid convoys from Venezuela's border with Colombia on Saturday, killing two protesters and prompting Guaido to propose that Washington consider ""all options"" to oust Maduro.

Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council that a U.S.-led campaign to oust Maduro had failed. ""That was the last chapter in the coup on Saturday,"" he said. ""Read my lips - it failed. Now is the time for us to return to sanity.""

""FORCE-FEEDING""

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota. Abrams told the Security Council he was concerned for Guaido's safety upon his return to Venezuela.

""What took place on Saturday was reminiscent not of assistance but what is called force-feeding in the United States,"" Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council. ""The U.S. authorities now decided to force feed a whole country.""

Nebenzia also questioned what other countries would have done if confronted with ""an attempted illegal state border crossing for the delivery of unknown cargo.""

""One country even wants to build a huge wall on the border of another country to prevent an illegal border crossing,"" he said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

China said it opposed the use of humanitarian aid for political purposes.

U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo said the world body was concerned by Venezuela's serious humanitarian problems.

""Available information depicts a grim reality with the economy continuing to deteriorate, people dying of preventable causes and leaving the country in search of assistance,"" she told the council.

Abrams denied Russian accusations that the United States is preparing to intervene militarily in Venezuela, but reiterated that Trump has said all options are on the table in dealing with Venezuela.

Abrams said that U.S. policy was ""to use as much diplomatic and economic and political pressure as we can ... to support the Venezuelan people's desire for democracy, that's our policy.

""We call on member states to consider what resources and tools they have to contribute to Venezuelan democracy and pressure the illegitimate Maduro regime to peacefully step down,"" he told the Security Council.

Singh addressed his supporters, saying “My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” and promising to take the issues of Burnaby residents to Ottawa.

Singh said many Canadians are falling behind, despite working hard, and they are starting to become fearful for themselves and their children.

He said some people will use that fear to “point at your neighbours, the people you live with, the people you work with.”

Singh said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was trying to protect his “friends at SNC-Lavalin” and subsidizing big oil. He said Canadians are drowning in debt, as he attacked corporations, saying the Liberals and Conservatives are not helping Canadians.

“Times up,” Singh said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The results

Singh has 38.7 per cent of 20,346 votes counted, enough to be declared the winner.

There are 76,204 registered voters in the riding. 181 of 196 polls have been counted so far, representing 92 per cent of the vote.

Singh was up against Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson.

In the 2015 federal election, the NDP won with 35 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals taking 33.9 per cent, the Conservatives 27.1 per cent, Greens 2.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent for the Libertarian party.

Lee has 26 per cent of the votes counted so far. The right-wing vote appears to be split, with Shin so far holding 22.7 per cent of the vote and Thompson with 10.9 per cent. Thompson is the first candidate seeking a seat for former Conversative Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

“Singh, Singh, Singh!”

Postmedia News reporter Matt Robinson said Singh supporters broke out into spontaneous chants of “Singh, Singh, Singh”, prior to Singh taking the podium at the election night party at the Metrotown Hilton.

Vancouver-Kingsway MP Don Davies has earlier taken the mic with an optimistic: “Welcome to the victory party.”

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said with voters giving Singh the seat, “they’re saying they want a fighter. They’re saying they want someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Jenny Kwan, a former and longtime MLA and now MP in Singh’s party, said “it’s a very exciting night. It’s one we’ve been waiting for for a long time. I know that Jag is so looking forward to going to Ottawa.

“We need a voice in the House of Commons that is on the side of the people and we haven’t had that with the Liberals and not with the Conservatives.”

Second place for Lee

Postmedia reporter Dan Fumano was with supporters of Liberal candidate Lee at the Delta Hotel.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South an the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person” and “I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia.

“His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The Greens did not run a candidate in this byelection in order to improve the chances of an NDP win.

Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart last October, when he was voted in as Vancouver’s mayor.

Quick things to know

• In the 2015 election, the New Democrats beat the Liberals in this riding by just over 500 votes.

• Lee announced he would be running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post.

• Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, was the first candidate to seek a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC. She has been vocal against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) education in B.C.’s education curriculum.

• Green party Leader Elizabeth May had said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

Read Full Article at RT.com","Justin Trudeau has dismissed calls to resign amid explosive allegations from Canada’s ex-attorney general, who testified that the prime minister tried to pressure her to drop a bribery probe into a Quebec-based firm.

Former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould told parliament’s justice committee on Wednesday that senior officials “barraged” her with requests to drop criminal charges against SNC Lavalin, a Canadian engineering company accused of using bribes to secure government contracts in Libya. Wilson-Raybould testified that the intense political pressure included “veiled threats” and even attempts by Trudeau to persuade her to shut down the proceedings in favor of a wrist-slap fine.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort,” she said in her opening statement.

Also on rt.com Trudeau in ethics probe over handling of Libyan contract fraud

The prime minister, Wilson-Raybould claimed, had expressed concern that the probe could endanger jobs in Quebec and asked her to “help out” with the case. In total, the former attorney general recounted 10 meetings and 10 phone calls she had with Trudeau and top government officials urging leniency for the firm.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed her refusal to abandon the prosecution was the reason she was abruptly demoted to the position of veteran affairs minister.

Her testimony has led to calls from Canada’s conservative opposition for Trudeau to step down.

“I was sickened and appalled by [Wilson-Raybould's] story of inappropriate and, frankly, borderline illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest levels of Justin Trudeau's government,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.

Trudeau has dismissed demands for his resignation, insisting that he has “always acted appropriately and professionally.”

The alleged attempt to pressure Wilson-Raybould to drop the case against SNC Lavalin was first reported by the Globe and Mail in early February, creating a major headache for Trudeau’s Liberal Party ahead of federal elections in October.

SNC-Lavalin was accused of issuing $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials in the decade leading up to the NATO-led overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi's government in 2011. The company was also charged with defrauding Libyan companies of about $130 million.

The scandal has shaken Trudeau’s image as a poster boy for progressive government. His support for a controversial pipeline in British Columbia has also left some Canadians questioning Trudeau’s ‘eco-friendly’ credentials.

32,Empty,2019-02-26T04:16:00Z,The byelection has been a test of the NDP’s leadership ahead of the national campaign — but also the appeal of a new far-right populist party.,"BURNABY, B.C.—New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh has won a bitter byelection race in Burnaby South just months before a federal election. He will be the first person of colour to lead a federal party in the House of Commons. With all polls reporting, Singh earned 39 per cent of the vote.

He took to the stage at the Metrotown Hilton and said, “We made history today,” as jubilant supporters chanted “NDP! NDP!” “I want to promise you something. I will be your champion. I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa where I will fight for you in the House of Commons,” he said to roaring cheers. Political scientists say Burnaby South’s unusually divisive byelection has been a test of Singh’s hold on his party, which has campaigned on bread-and-butter issues like housing and health after electing him leader in 2017.

Experts said that even a tenth of Burnaby South’s electorate casting a ballot for People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson would signal an appetite for far-right policies against carbon taxation and at least some forms of immigration. Such arguments had found support even among Burnaby’s sizable minority populations. After the final tally, Lee earned 26 per cent of votes, Shin had 22.5 per cent and Thompson earned 10.6 per cent of votes.

In his concession speech at the Liberal’s election night celebration, Lee asked the more than 200 supporters present to congratulate Singh on his victory. There was no half-hearted applause; the crowd cheered enthusiastically. “We are very fortunate to live in a democratic society in Canada,” Lee said. “Congratulations to Mr. Singh. He has the opportunity to serve the best community in Canada.” But Lee reminded Singh that he must defend his seat when a federal election comes before Oct. 21 — a remark that garnered more cheers from the party faithful. “I and the community expect him to serve with intregity and grace — before running again in Burnaby South in October.” Asked if Lee would carry the Liberal flag in the general election just months away, Lee told the Star, “I plan to.”

As for what kind of campaign voters might expect in October, Lee said the strategy will be “a fair and transparent politics that is positive.” Lee had replaced the original candidate for the Liberals, Karen Wang, who resigned after the Star unearthed her online posts in Chinese making reference to Singh’s ethnicity. The mostly suburban community where the conflict played out is diverse and historically working class, with a median income 18-per-cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. In recent days, all-candidates debates had devolved into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism. Some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public-safety risk connected to immigration. The Liberal and NDP candidates countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group. The tension spread beyond the podium as well. The People’s Party candidate accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drug use. Singh promised to address the uncertainty and fear among his constituency and said he wants to give people hope. Residents of Burnaby South were “left behind” by a housing crisis and the Canadian government purchasing a pipeline they didn’t want, he told reporters on Monday, referring to the Trans Mountain project that runs through the riding.

The federal riding was previously an NDP stronghold. However, in the last 2015 election, former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart squeaked by with a surplus of roughly 600 votes over the Liberals, while the Conservative candidate was a close third. Stewart vacated the seat to become the current mayor of Vancouver. Yearly donations to the federal NDP have tanked from $18.6 million in 2015 to about $5 million last year, according to fundraising returns filed with Elections Canada. The party subsequently mortgaged its Ottawa headquarters — the Jack Layton building — for $12 million. Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair has been critical of Singh, publicly chiding his political acumen and the direction of the party under his leadership. But Jenny Kwan, MP of Vancouver East, said the NDP under Singh’s leadership has resonated with voters dissatisfied with affordability under both the Liberal and Conservative governments. “We need a strong voice in Ottawa — one who can challenge Trudeau and hold him accountable,” she told the Star on Monday. Political observers were keen to watch how the Liberal brand performed in Burnaby South, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop prosecuting engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee to cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C. The PPC has carved out space for itself to the right of the Conservative Party of Canada since Leader Maxime Bernier announced the party’s formation last year. It represents the first real challenge the federal Conservative Party has faced from the right since its own formation in 2003 out of a merger between the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance.

Jagmeet Singh, a practising Sikh, shot to prominence in October 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority leader of a major federal political party in Canada.

At 40, his win in a by-election in a Vancouver suburb on Monday sets the stage for the NDP to steal votes on the left and hurt Liberal hopes of hanging onto their majority in parliament in the upcoming general election.

In the lead up to Monday's special ballot, Singh struggled with low national visibility and insider criticism of his leadership.

Now, with eight months to go before the general election, he will face off almost daily against Trudeau in the House of Commons.

The third-ranked NDP, however, lost another seat in Montreal held by Singh's predecessor to the Liberals.

Meanwhile, the main opposition Tories -- which are neck and neck with the Liberals in recent public opinion polls -- held onto a seat in the Toronto area.

Pundits were watching to see if an upstart People's Party, led by former Tory foreign minister Maxime Bernier, would split away significant votes from the Conservatives on the right -- which would help the Liberals in October.

But it barely registered in all three special ballots held Monday.

The c…","(Bloomberg) -- The spike in tensions between India and Pakistan couldn’t have come at a worse time for assets in the world’s fastest-growing major economy, which is battling headwinds from a rebound in oil prices to the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections.

The rupee has gone from being the best-performing Asian currency last quarter to the worst this year, sovereign bonds are set for a second month of declines and equities have sat out the rally that’s driven Asian stocks to a four-month high.

The nervousness ratcheted up Wednesday after Pakistani fighter jets struck at targets inside Indian-controlled Kashmir, prompting both nations to close down large swathes of airspace as tensions between them reached their highest point since a 1971 war. The conflict came a day after India bombed a major terror camp inside Pakistan.

“Further geopolitical tensions will increase the premium in the rupee assets,” said Eugene Leow, a rates strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “This is already reflected in the increasingly divergent forex and bond performance between the two high-yielders in Asia -- Indonesia and India.”

The rupee lost 0.3 percent to 71.2475 dollar at the close and the yield on most-traded 2028 bonds surged nine basis points to 7.68 percent. The S&P BSE Sensex index of stocks erased almost all of its intraday gain of 1.1 percent to end marginally in the red. Across the border, Pakistan’s main equities gauge fell 0.3 percent to the lowest level since Jan. 7.

The modest reaction prompted some analysts to say that markets are underestimating the impact of a further flare up.

Optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks and the Brexit delay are “distracting traders and investors from the broader point that military escalation between two nuclear powers has huge implications,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.

This week’s skirmish represents the worst escalation since 2001, when the countries moved ballistic missiles and troops to their border following an attack on parliament in New Delhi that was also blamed on Jaish-e-Mohammad. The two nations have fought three major wars since partition and independence in 1947.

“If India responds again there will a problem in the short term,” said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. “This issue may continue to simmer until elections.”

Poll Prospects

Facing a general election due by May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is under pressure after blaming Pakistan for the worst attack on security forces in Kashmir in decades earlier this month. There’s a possibility for this event to unite the nation behind Modi at the polls, which could help support markets, analysts including Saktiandi Supaat at Maybank wrote in a note, advising clients to buy the rupee on declines.

Maybank’s not alone in recommending the buy-the-dips strategy. Global funds bought a net $487.5 million of shares so far this week, taking the month’s purchases to $2.3 billion. That’s set to be the biggest inflow since November 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“India is still a good place to pick good stocks, and yesterday we saw foreigners coming back to buy,” said Sameer Kalra, president at Mumbai-based advisory Target Investing. “There will be short-term pain if this escalates but the outcome of an escalation helps India prove that Pakistan is being used as a terror ground. We remain a buyer.”

The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.

European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.

Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.

That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.

Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.

“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.

An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.

Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.

Colombian president Iván Duque has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.

There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.

“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.

“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”

Before the meeting of the Lima group of Latin American powers and Canada, Pence told Guaidó, attending as Venezuela’s interim president: “We are 100% with you.”

The Lima group also said credible threats have been made against the life of Venezuelan opposition leader Guaidó and his family, adding that President Nicolas Maduro was responsible for Guaido’s safety.",'Maduro must go': Pence bids to ramp up effort to oust Venezuelan leader,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/apos-maduro-must-apos-pence-193214527.html

Why Globalists are Obsessed with Artificial Intelligence

Several readers suggested a recent essay by Brandon Smith: The Real Reason Why Globalists Are So Obsessed With Artificial Intelligence. Here is a key quote:

“The globalists have long held AI as a kind of holy grail in centralization technology. The United Nations has adopted numerous positions and even summits on the issue, including the “AI For Good” summit in Geneva. The UN insinuates that it’s primary interest in AI is in regulation or observation of how it is exploited, but the UN also has clear goals to use AI to its advantage. The use of AI as a means to monitor mass data to better institute “sustainable development” is written clearly in the UN’s agenda.

The IMF is also in on the AI trend, holding global discussions on the uses of AI in economics as well as the effects of algorithms on economic analysis.

The main source for the development of AI has long been DARPA. The military and globalist think tank dumps billions of dollars into the technology, making AI the underlying focus of most of DARPA’s work. AI is not only on the globalist’s radar; they are essentially spearheading the creation and promotion of it.”

And Royal Bank of Canada says the currency may suffer more pain.

The rupee may weaken to 80 per dollar by September as a dovish turn by the central bank lowers the currency’s yield appeal, said Sue Trinh, head of Asia forex strategy at RBC in Hong Kong. The prediction is way more bearish than the 71.25 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and implies a drop of more than 11 percent from current levels.

Reserve Bank of India’s new chief Shaktikanta Das cut interest rates last month to support the economy, and kept the door open for more easing citing growth concerns. Data on Thursday showed expansion in the three months ended December slowed to the weakest pace in five quarters, just as the outlook gets clouded by growing tensions with Pakistan.

“The combination of consumer inflation undershoots and dovish policy bias of Governor Das suggests big rate cuts could be around the corner,” Trinh said. The challenge of funding the widening budget deficit will also weigh on the currency, she said.

The rupee is already the worst performer this year in Asia ex-Japan amid the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen facing a tight contest. This week’s military skirmish with Pakistan added to the anxiety, though the currency did rally hard late Thursday as Pakistan said it will release a captured Indian pilot as a gesture of peace.

“It is not specific to India, but everywhere you look there are potential flashpoints that can flare up at the drop of a dime in the context of slowing global growth, massive levels of debt and increasingly desperate governments,” Trinh said. This risk is being “under-priced” by markets, she said.

The draft resolution is likely to be opposed by Russia, the diplomats said. A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States to pass.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country’s elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

Earlier this month the United States proposed a draft Security Council resolution, which prompted Russia to propose a rival text that makes no reference to elections or aid. A revised U.S. draft, seen by Reuters, was circulated on Wednesday. It was unclear if Russia planned to put its text to a vote as well.

The U.S. draft asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to help ensure there is a free, fair and credible presidential election with international observers. It stresses the need to ensure the safety of all the members of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

The U.S. envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that he was concerned for Guaido’s safety upon his return to Venezuela.

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota.

The United States and dozens of other nations have recognised Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president, but Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA [PDVSA.UL], which provides 90 percent of the country's export revenue.

The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

In Geneva, Venezuela Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, suggested on Wednesday that Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump meet to ""try to find common ground and explain their differences.""

Maduro also ""stands ready for dialogue"" with the Venezuelan opposition, he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Thursday on rival U.S. and Russian draft resolutions on Venezuela, diplomats said, with Washington's proposal calling for free and fair presidential elections and unhindered aid delivery.

The Russian draft text, seen by Reuters, expresses support for a political solution to the crisis and backs the Venezuelan government as the primary coordinator of international assistance efforts in the country.

A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass. Diplomats said the U.S. draft is likely to gain the minimum nine votes to force a likely Russian veto, while the Russian draft is expected to fail without the need for a U.S. veto.

43,Empty,2019-02-26T04:00:54Z,The win returns the riding to its Liberal roots after 11 years under NDP’s Tom Mulcair.,"MONTREAL—The NDP era in Outremont came to a close Monday as voters in this diverse urban riding returned to their long-standing tradition of electing Liberals to the House of Commons. Months after former NDP leader Tom Mulcair resigned the seat he held for 11 years, residents of this central swath of Quebec’s biggest city were on track to be represented again by a Liberal, according to late night results from Elections Canada.

Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer who ran as the “Team Trudeau” candidate here, thanked her family and campaign supporters in a victory speech at a Mile End lounge late Monday night. With all polls reporting, results showed she won just over 40 per cent of votes. The NDP came second with 26 per cent. “This victory wouldn’t be possible without you,” Bendayan said in French. “Today our voices were heard,” she said, stating that voters “spoke loud and proud in favour of Liberal values.”

Outremont is home to some 100,000 Montrealers in a riding that comprises the Côtes-des-Neiges neighbourhood, part of Mile End and portions of downtown Montreal near the centre of the island where the city is located. But while the riding was a Liberal stronghold for most of the 20th century, its more recent history has made it significant for New Democrats as well. Outremont became the party’s symbolic toehold in Quebec, when Mulcair won a 2007 byelection and successfully defended the seat the following year, marking the first time the NDP ever won a riding in the province in a general election.

Three years later, the “orange wave” surge of support in the province lifted the NDP to its best election result ever. Now that Mulcair is retired from political life — almost three years after he was turfed as leader following the party’s 2015 election defeat — local NDP candidate Julia Sanchez hoped to maintain the party’s grip in this diverse central Montreal riding. Polls in the province suggested her main foe in the byelection was Bendayan. A few hours before the polls closed Monday evening, Sanchez canvassed voters at a local metro station, and introduced herself to people in cafes and shops in the riding. “I got into this race because of how hugely important it is — Outremont — for the NDP,” she said. “All of that made it super exciting and important to me ... It’s not just any byelection.” David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said Monday’s result could be a bellwether for the party’s standing in the province, given that it is the first test in “the heart of the rise of the orange wave” since the last federal election. Their performance in Outremont — a multicultural district in the urban heart of Montreal — may signal whether the NDP’s allure to Quebec voters has faded under Jagmeet Singh’s leadership. Monday’s byelection was also the first time voters in Quebec cast ballots since the Bloc Québécois new leader, Yves-François Blanchet, took over last year. Michel Duchesne, an author who is the party’s candidate in Outremont, campaigned for the separatist party on a push to protect Quebec culture in the digital era. His background could help lift the Bloc in a riding that many artists call home, one NDP insider suggested. “If they come third or fourth, that’s a big problem,” Coletto said of the NDP, pointing out that more than a third of the party’s MPs in the Commons are from Quebec. “That’s something they’re going to have to somehow explain.” The Conservative candidate in the race was Jasmine Louras, a University of Ottawa law student. Daniel Green ran for the Green Party and James Seale campaigned for Maxime Bernier’s upstart People’s Party. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Sputnik News

00:43 26.02.2019(updated 01:40 26.02.2019)

The Lima Group on Monday asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to make an assessment of the situation in crisis-torn Venezuela, proposing that Venezuela's partners help organize ""free elections"" in the country.

""We have decided to turn to the International Criminal Court with a request to take into account the grave humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of [Venezuelan President] Nicolas Maduro's regime against civilians and the denial of access to international aid, which is a crime against humanity"", the statement said.

Participants at the Lima Group meeting also stressed that the transition to ""democracy"" must be performed by Venezuelans themselves without the use of force and in line with the country's constitution.

""We call on the countries that continue to maintain partnership relations with Nicolas Maduro's illegitimate regime, to help find solutions that would open the way to a democratic transition and the holding of free, fair, transparent and credible elections"", the statement added.

Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called on the international community to join the Lima Group on the situation in Venezuela.

""It is important to invite more and more members of the international community, those who will participate with us in the expanded dialogue, so that they will join the actions that are made by us as the Lima Group and will support Venezuelans' efforts aimed at restoring democracy and hope"", the foreign minister said Monday.

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia. The majority of the organization's member states are backing Guaido.

Glob…","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is on his way to the House of Commons, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals are poised to make further gains in Quebec and Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives need to keep an eye on Maxime Bernier’s splinter movement, after by-elections Monday that took the political temperature in the country’s three largest provinces.

Mr. Singh won the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South with 39 per cent of the vote. Only a few months ago there were rumours that the NDP was trailing the Liberals in the riding; had he lost, Mr. Singh would have become the answer to an embarrassing trivia question.

But things ultimately went his way. The first nominated Liberal candidate, Karen Wang, was forced to withdraw, after predicting Chinese-Canadian voters would prefer her over a candidate of “Indian origin.” And the furor surrounding the resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould from Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet dissipated whatever wisps of wind remained in Liberal sails.

The Grits took 26 per cent of the vote, Monday, well down from the 34 per cent they garnered in the 2015 election. How much did Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s resignation, and that of principal secretary Gerald Butts, push down the vote? That is a very large question.

The results in Burnaby South were worrying for the Conservatives, as well. At 23 per cent, they were down 4 percentage points from 2015, and the People’s Party, a new populist right-wing party led by the disaffected Tory Mr. Bernier, came in at 11 per cent. Had even some of the People’s Party vote gone to the Conservatives, they would have been in a strong second place, instead of trailing the Liberals.

But the Tories could feel much more reassured by the results in York-Simcoe. The riding, which sits on the northern edge of Greater Toronto, has been reliably Conservative since 2004, and Monday was another solid win.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wins Burnaby South by-election, clearing key hurdle ahead of federal campaign

Conservative Scot Davidson held the vote at 54 per cent, while the Liberal vote slumped from 38 per cent in 2015 to 29 per cent Monday night. Even more encouraging for Mr. Scheer, the People’s Party sat at only 2 per cent, suggesting Mr. Bernier won’t be a factor in the fight for the 905, the large belt of suburban ridings surrounding the city of Toronto, named after its area code. The 905 almost always votes for the party that forms the government.

But there was also good news for the Liberals on Monday night – very good news indeed. The Montreal riding of Outremont had been a Liberal bastion before Thomas Mulcair snatched it away in a 2007 by-election for the New Democrats, foreshadowing the rise of the NDP and the collapse of the Liberals in Quebec.

But the Liberals surged back in Quebec in 2015, and their convincing victory in Outremont on Monday – they had 40 per cent of the vote – means not one of the NDP’s remaining 14 seats in the provinces is safe.

Did allegations of political interference by Mr. Trudeau and his advisers in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin help the Liberal cause in Quebec, where many jobs could be lost if the company suffered, and hurt it in English Canada? Expect a lot of entirely speculative punditry on this in the days ahead.

The Greens polled at 13 per cent in Outremont, half the NDP’s 26 per cent. Make of that what you will.

For the NDP, the news is both bitter and sweet. Sweet: Mr. Singh will finally be in the House of Commons. He will arrive with Justin Trudeau’s government staggering over the SNC-Lavalin affair, giving him a perfect opportunity to reboot his troubled leadership, only eight months before the next election.

Bitter: The New Democrats are no longer in the game in Quebec. The NDP appears destined to become again what it was before: a rump, a third place-place party in English Canada, and soon to be only a memory in Quebec.

Under Jack Layton and Tom Mulcair, New Democrats had hoped for so much more. Monday night’s results suggest that hope is lost.

US broadcaster Univision says its team was briefly detained in the Venezuelan presidential palace where they had been interviewing President Nicolás Maduro.

The incident happened after award-winning journalist Jorge Ramos showed Mr Maduro images of Venezuelans eating from a bin lorry, the network says.

Their equipment was confiscated.

Venezuela's Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez said the government had welcomed hundreds of journalists but it did not support ""cheap shows"".

The team was deported on Tuesday.

Univision, the leading Spanish-language TV network in the US, said the six-member crew had been released after almost three hours but that their recording and personal belongings had not been returned.

Speaking on Univision, Mr Ramos said Mr Maduro ""had not liked"" some of the questions about ""the lack of democracy in Venezuela, torture, political prisoners and the humanitarian crisis"".

""He got up after I showed him videos of young people eating out of a bin lorry,"" he said of the interview at the Miraflores palace in the capital, Caracas.

""What I told Nicolás Maduro is that millions of Venezuelans and many governments around the world don't consider him a legitimate president but a dictator.""

During their detention, Mr Ramos and Univision Vice President María Martínez were kept for ""a few minutes"" in a separate room where the lights were turned off, the broadcaster said.

Mr Ramos, a veteran Mexican-born American journalist, is known for his confrontational style of questioning. In 2015, he was thrown out of a news conference of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Natalie Southwick, Central and South America programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: ""By shutting down an interview and censoring one of Latin America's most high-profile reporters, Nicolás Maduro has demonstrated his fundamental disregard for the press.""

Last month, several local and foreign journalists were briefly detained while working in Caracas. Some ended up being deported.

On Twitter, Mr Rodríguez added: ""Hundreds of journalists have come through Miraflores who have received decent treatment that we always give to those who do journalistic work.""

Earlier, a group of Latin American countries and Canada said Mr Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Meeting in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, the Lima group urged the International Criminal Court to consider whether Venezuela was guilty of crimes against humanity for refusing to allow aid into the country.

At least two people died in Saturday's clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro that blocked the entrance of foreign aid organised by opposition leader and self-declared interim President Juan Guaidó.

Mr Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup.

Following President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration for a disputed second term in January, the speaker of the opposition-dominated parliament, Juan Guaidó declared himself ""interim president"" of the country.

Guaidó was immediately recognised by the US, Canada and a group of Latin American conservative governments, who called upon the Venezuelan military to rise up against Maduro. The UK, France, Spain, Germany and other European countries also recognised Guaidó after Maduro rejected their demand for fresh elections. Paredes, who presented his credentials to President Hage Geingob at State House last week, said the situation is normal, while accusing external forces for attempting to cause political instability in Venezuela.

""If you visit the main cities in Venezuela, you can see people going to work, the kids going to school. Unfortunately, foreign forces are trying to create instability in the country,"" he told New Era and NBC in an interview.

""One of the topics I discussed with President Hage Geingob, who is also the Chairperson of Sadc [Southern African Development Community] was to thank him on behalf of the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the people of Venezuela for his brave and strong support,"" Paredes said.

Last month, Namibia added her voice to growing international concern over the situation in Venezuela, calling on the international community to allow the Venezuelans to resolve their internal issues in an amicable and peaceful manner.

Namibia's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah at the time said the international community should allow the people of Venezuela to resolve their internal issues within the confines of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

""Namibia has been following with great concern the political developments in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The concern is that the political developments are arising from the unwarranted interference in the domestic affairs of Venezuela by foreign powers,"" Nandi-Ndaitwah said.

Paredes noted that Namibia's support is well received by the democratic institutions in Venezuela as it supports the truth, adding Maduro last year was elected with more than 67 percent of the voters in a process where more than a million people participated in the elections.

He said the African Union (AU) also send a delegation who validated the results. Hence, he said the position of the African countries was very important for the true democratic processes and respect of the international law and the United Nations charter. Since Guaidó's declaration, US President Donald Trump's administration has imposed new sanctions on Maduro's government, seized billions-worth of Venezuelan oil-related assets on US soil, and started making barely veiled threats of military intervention.

Paredes admitted that the country is experiencing hyperinflation due to economic blockade and sanctions imposed by unilateral position of the government of the United States.

According to him, the Venezuela economy has lost more than U$30 billion in the last few years. ""So please tell me which country in the world can resist an impact on their economy with such criminal blockade against our financial institutions and oil industry. That is why we are seeing the challenges in our economy. Despite, this situation, our government never stopped providing assistance to the poor people through social programmes in education, health, housing and in other sectors to stabilise our country,"" he noted.

Because of challenges emanating from the hyperinflation, more than three million Venezuelans are said to have fled the country, causing consternation across the continent.

On Saturday, clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns, as government allegedly blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil.

Government troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who attempted to collect and transport the supplies.

Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won a seat in the House of Commons, clearing a critical hurdle for his troubled leadership and triggering the start of an urgent effort to renew his caucus.

In his victory speech, Mr. Singh derided the Liberals and the Conservatives for presiding over a series of governments with a goal of enriching corporations while neglecting ordinary Canadians. He urged his supporters to hang on to the energy that they put into his winning campaign, noting they will need it for the upcoming federal election.

“I know it’s been a long slog, but I hope you have more left in the tank. We have just eight more months to let the people know they can choose a government that stands up for people and not corporations, that doesn’t give handouts to SNC-Lavalin,” Mr. Singh said in reference to the scandal currently enveloping the Liberals.

Mr. Singh secured 39 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22 per cent.

Mr. Singh’s victory will help quell rumblings within his party over his future. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he lost Burnaby South.

The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters − particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

Despite Mr. Singh’s win, the party’s troubles were evident in another by-election result Monday: In a loss heavy with symbolism, the NDP was defeated in the Outremont riding they had held since 2007.

Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding’s polls reporting results, with the NDP’s Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mr. Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 by-election. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

Mr. Mulcair won the riding, but resigned in 2018 almost a year after Mr. Singh became NDP Leader.

Mr. Singh, brushed aside the loss in Outremont, saying the party “always knew” that contest was going to be tough.

But he said he will be heading to Quebec next week to talk about the NDP environment agenda, which he suggested may resonate in the province.

He also said voters in Quebec are as concerned as voters elsewhere in Canada about offshore tax havens, the government purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline and the access corporations like SNC Lavalin have had to the federal government.

“No one believes this is a good way to run a country,” he told a news conference following his victory speech.

Mr. Singh had said he was comfortable not being in Parliament while he worked on managing the party. But his view changed amid the party’s troubles. Earlier this month, the president of the Canadian Labour Congress said the NDP is struggling to reach members of the labour movement and Canadians in general.

Hassan Yussuff told The Canadian Press that Mr. Singh might find a “better groove” if he won a seat in the House of Commons.

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s Orange Wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said Sunday that victory in the by-election would be crucial for Mr. Singh’s efforts to unite the NDP before the federal election in the fall.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh poured considerable personal energy into the riding through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past both federally and provincially.

With a win in hand, Mr. Lavigne said there is a lot of work in a short amount of time before the next federal election. Fundraising will be key, as well as building a team of candidates. Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh will have to “reintroduce himself” to the country and focus on key issues to form the underpinnings of the NDP campaign.

Mr. Singh’s Burnaby South win comes as the Liberals have been under fire over the scandal involving SNC-Lavalin and the cabinet resignation of former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Mr. Singh had called for a public inquiry into the situation.

Burnaby South was one of three by-elections called Jan. 9 by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In addition to Outremont, there was a by-election in York-Simcoe, north of Toronto.

Story continues below advertisement

The seat was left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results to Liberal Shaun Tanaka’s 30 per cent.

In Burnaby South, Mr. Singh overcame challenges from Tory Mr. Shin, a corporate lawyer, and the Liberal Mr. Lee, a former Burnaby member of the provincial legislature representing the BC Liberals.

Mr. Lee replaced daycare operator Karen Wang, who stepped down after her campaign circulated social-media material highlighting Mr. Singh’s ethnic background.

The breakaway People’s Party of Canada, created last summer by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the by-elections and the results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York-Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won nearly 11 per cent of the vote after running on a campaign denounced as anti-immigration by her critics.

Venezuela is currently going through a political crisis. On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other government branches have been refusing to recognize in 2016. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning the May election, which part of the opposition boycotted, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

As Colombia’s foreign minister warned about “credible threats to the life” of Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido, the Trump administration also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro’s “henchmen” to Guaido’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming against the OPEC member.

“In the days ahead … the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

While the day presented a united regional front against Maduro, who is widely accused of coming to power through fraudulent elections, there was no clear sign that the latest measures would succeed in pushing him toward the exit.

‘CREDIBLE THREATS’

On a day that began with Guaido urging “all options” to be considered to remove Maduro, the threat of military intervention seemed if anything weaker after the meeting.

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

Guaido himself could be in danger from the Maduro regime, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said, speaking on behalf of the Lima Group.

“There’s information about serious and credible threats to the life and integrity of Juan Guaido and his family, as well as to his wife’s family. From Bogotá, we want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,”

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

In a joint statement at the close of the meeting, the Lima Group said Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Guaido, recognized by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

But the Lima Group said it “reiterates the conviction that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law,” the statement said.

CALL FOR AMNESTY

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hoped Maduro and those supported by his “corruption and his brutality” will leave Venezuela peacefully.

“We make clear to them that we will support the interim president’s call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,” Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president.

“We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere,” Pence said.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro blocked a convoy of trucks with food and medicines during the weekend. Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup.

At least 167 members of Maduro’s armed forces have deserted since Saturday and more are expected to flee across the border to Colombia.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro’s government last week. Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighboring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has suffered years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros.”

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

The Lima Group said it would ask the International Criminal Court to consider “the serious humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of Nicolas Maduro’s regime against the civilian population, and the denial of access to international assistance.”

According to Canadian media, among other accusations, SNC-Lavalin is under investigation into alleged payments of nearly $48 million to public officials in Libya between 2001-2011 to influence local government decisions.

Canada's opposition leader, heading the Conservative Party, Andrew Scheer called on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign. The scandal around the Trudeau administration has resulted in an uproar among lawmakers who held emergency debates on the situation late Thursday.

The prime minister denied allegations against him, saying that he sought to protect jobs and acted with respect to Canada's laws and institutions. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has supported Trudeau, saying that the prime minister would ""never apply improper pressure"" on an attorney general.

Sputnik has discussed the issue with Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto.

Sputnik: What do you make of the way the way the Trudeau administration’s responded to the situation?

Nelson Wiseman: The Trudeau administration made the error of not being open and transparent about why they did not want a criminal trial against SNC-Lavalin to proceed. What the Liberals want to do is perfectly legal, but they thought the optics about being transparent would hurt them.

They were right. However, subsequent events including Trudeau’s evasive and narrow legalistic pronouncements and the resignation of the minister previously responsible for the SNC-Lavalin file made him look even worse in much of the public’s mind.

He says he did nothing wrong but that his continued presence working for the prime minister would be a distraction from the government’s agenda.

Sputnik: Trudeau has been touted as a ‘progressive’ Prime Minister and has long received positive coverage in mainstream media. What impact could the recent allegations have on his image and his credibility?

Nelson Wiseman: His image and credibility have been shaken.

Sputnik: What consequences can this issue have on the upcoming elections in Canada?

Nelson Wiseman: There is no upside for Trudeau and the Liberal government in this affair. However, the election is still months and months away and there will be a number of factors influencing how people vote, this affair being just one.

You have been the federal leader of the NDP for about a year-and-a-half now, but you haven't held a seat in Parliament until now.

What is it going to mean to the party that you have finally been elected as a member of Parliament?

It gives us a chance to put some more pressure on the Liberal government in Ottawa to answer the question: why is it that they're so concerned with helping the wealthy and powerful, whether it's SNC-Lavalin or pharmaceutical companies or oil and gas?

NDP Leader <a href=""https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@theJagmeetSingh</a> has won a byelection in Burnaby South that put his political career at stake. Do his MPs have confidence in him? <a href=""https://t.co/V5fvEppRl2"">pic.twitter.com/V5fvEppRl2</a> —@CBCEarlyEdition

There's been a lot of talk in this byelection that your position as the leader of the NDP rested on the outcome of the election last night.

Did you feel that way?

I never had any doubts.

We run campaigns in a way [that] we connect directly with the people, and our offer was better than the other parties.

Did you have any worries at all about the confidence that your own MPs had in you as leader of the party without an elected seat?

Well, when it comes to what we care about as New Democrats, every New Democrat is committed to fighting for the people that don't have a voice.

Our job is to take their concerns and their values and what they're worried about to Ottawa and represent them.

And we're all unified on that front.

We're all unified in building a better Canada that invests in housing, that invests in a green economy, that transforms the way we've envisioned things in the past and moves us towards investing in green technology, that creates great jobs and reduces emissions. And also an opportunity to invest in our health-care system, to expand it for medication coverage for all.

The question was: do you believe your MPs have confidence in you?

Absolutely. No question.

You're a new resident of Burnaby. How do you balance your responsibilities as leader of the NDP with representing the concerns of your constituents?

This is the struggle of all MPs: being able to take the concerns of your constituents to Ottawa, but also being able to have time on the ground to hear people's concerns.

I'll be spending my time across Canada but the Lower Mainland is incredibly important to me.

Elections are expensive. The NDP are trailing the Conservative and the Liberals when it comes to fundraising.

How prepared financially is your party to fight an election in October?

Oh, we will be ready to fight a strong election.

Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitari…","Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitarian assistance, leading to increasing speculation about what comes next. Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.

What can be anticipated, however, is that there will be further intensified pressure on the regime, which will squeeze it like the large anacondas that inhabit Venezuelan waters. In addition to efforts to entice regime officials, including the military, to shift their loyalty from Maduro to Guaido, the United States, in coordination with other nations, looks to amplify asset seizure and forfeiture. Collectively, they aim to deny new and cancel existing visas for regime officials and their families, thus forcing departures from the United States, Europe, and Latin American nations that host them, and increase humanitarian assistance. All of these activities will further the goal of turning Maduro into an international pariah, and, it is hoped, create conditions that will ultimately see him turfed from office.

The key is to keep the Maduro regime on the defensive. There are no guarantees, and nobody can say when the dam will ultimately break—or if it will break. Meanwhile, Venezuelans face an unpleasant choice between protesting and exposing themselves to the excesses of the regime, hunkering down, or joining the millions of Venezuelans who have already left their nation behind. It is a tragedy lain squarely at the feet of Chavismo.

A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass. Diplomats said the U.S. draft is likely to gain the minimum nine votes to force a likely Russian veto, while the Russian draft is expected to fail without the need for a U.S. veto.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country’s elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

The U.S. draft resolution, seen by Reuters, asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to help ensure there is a free, fair and credible presidential election with international observers. It stresses the need to ensure the safety of all the members of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

The U.S. envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that he was concerned for Guaido’s safety upon his return to Venezuela.

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota.

The Russian draft resolution expresses concern over threats to use force against Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has all options are on the table in dealing with Venezuela.

The United States and dozens of other nations have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president, but Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, which provides 90 percent of the country’s export revenue.

The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

In Geneva, Venezuela Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, suggested on Wednesday that Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump meet to “try to find common ground and explain their differences.”

Talks between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended today with no agreement on any issue. Kim said that he would continue a moratorium on missile testing and development, but the fate of future negotiations remain very much in doubt. Can the peace process be put back on track?

Thursday's weekly series ""Criminal Injustice"" is about the most egregious conduct of our courts and prosecutors and how justice is denied to so many people in this country. Paul Wright, the founder and executive director of the Human Rights Defense Center and editor of Prison Legal News (PLN), and Kevin Gosztola, a writer for Shadowproof.com and co-host of the podcast Unauthorized Disclosure, join the show.

Michael Cohen, President Trump's longtime personal attorney and fixer, testified on Capitol Hill, saying that the President was a liar, a conman, and a racist, and that those around the President had traded their own integrity for proximity to power. Expectedly, the President exploded on Twitter, despite being busy with his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Cohen is due to report to prison on a myriad of felony charges in the next few weeks, which his opponents cite as reason to disbelieve his testimony. Walter and John speak with Dan Kovalik, a human rights and labor lawyer who is the author of the book ""The Plot to Control the World: How the US Spent Billions to Change the Outcome of Elections Around the World.""

President Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner is finishing up a visit through the Middle East to publicize an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Meanwhile, the United Nations released a report saying that ""the commission found reasonable grounds to believe that… the use of live ammunition by Israeli security forces against demonstrators was unlawful."" Ariel Gold, a peace activist and the national co-director of Code Pink, joins the show.

Veterans for Peace is Thursday's regular segment about the contemporary issues of war and peace that affect veterans, their families, and the country as a whole. Gerry Condon, a Vietnam-era veteran and war resister who refused orders to deploy to Vietnam and lived in exile in Canada and Sweden for 6 years, organizing with other U.S. military deserters and draft resisters against the Vietnam war, and for amnesty for U.S. war resisters, joins the show. He has been a peace and solidarity activist for almost 50 years and has served on the Board of Veterans For Peace for the last 6 years, currently as national president.

A regular Thursday segment deals with the ongoing militarization of space. As the US continues to withdraw from international arms treaties, will the weaponization and militarization of space bring the world closer to catastrophe? Brian and John speak with Prof. Karl Grossman, a full professor of journalism at the State University of New York, College at Old Westbury, the author of six books, and the host of a nationally-aired television program focused on environmental, energy, and space issues.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif resigned earlier this week just hours after meeting with an American peace delegation, apologizing for what he called his shortcomings. But President Hassan Rouhani refused the resignation, and Zarif was back in the office two days later. What was behind the resignation?

View full coverage …,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh urged his caucus on Wednesday to “double down” on their efforts to unseat the Trudeau Liberals in the eight months left to the next election.

An enthusiastic Singh, who hugged, hive-fived and spoke to members of his caucus for the first time Wednesday morning since winning a seat in the riding of Burnaby South, spun a message that the NDP is a party focused on people while the Liberals side with big companies.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show Singh was able to win the B.C. riding with 39 per cent of the vote – a success that means he will now be able to challenge Trudeau in the Commons for the first time since becoming leader in October 2017.

ANALYSIS: A bittersweet byelection night for Singh’s NDP and a warning for Scheer’s Conservatives

“I’ll be fighting for the things that matter to people,” he said to a room of MPs and supporters visibly elated by his recent win. “But I need you all to be a part of this. Together, we can put Canada on a new course.”

Singh said Canadians gave Justin Trudeau a chance, but the prime minister is too busy “doing favours for corporate friends,” alluding to the controversy involving Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

“From changing the law to get powerful executives off the hook, to giving billions in subsidies to the oil and gas (sector), to protecting the profits of pharmaceutical industries while keeping drug prices high,” Singh said.

“It’s clear: Justin Trudeau is not on our side, he’s not on your side – he’s on their’s.”

Since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair, Singh has faced external and internal questions about his effectiveness as the NDP’s popular support and fundraising slid.

Members of his caucus, however, were repeatedly on their feet in celebration of Singh during the part of Wednesday’s meeting opened up to media.

Veteran B.C. MP Nathan Cullen said there was a palpable sense of relief and optimism in the room.

“There’s a feeling that, with the kind of message that we have, the opportunity is there for us,” Cullen said in an interview.

“It is beyond just the symbolism of him winning a seat. This is Canada’s first racialized leader of a federal party. The new face of the NDP is diverse and strong and unapologetically progressive.”

The United States, China and other world powers have urged restraint from the two nations as tensions escalate following tit-for-tat airstrikes in the wake of a suicide car bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb. 14.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for talks.

""History tells us that wars are full of miscalculation. My question is that, given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation,"" Khan said during a brief televised broadcast to the nation. ""We should sit down and talk.""

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India's parliament.

Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute. Thai Airways International announced on Thursday that it had cancelled flights to Pakistan and Europe, which left thousands of passengers stranded in Bangkok.

On Thursday morning troops from India and Pakistan briefly exchanged fire in Poonch, a district in Indian-occupied Kashmir, according to a statement from the Indian army.

""The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defence ministry spokesman.

The firing, that India claims was initiated by Pakistan began just after 0600 local time (0030 GMT), lasted a little over an hour and was significantly less elevated than artillery fire between the two sides on Wednesday. There were no reported casualties in the last clash.

India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families living along its border with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir state, hoping to keep them safe near their homes instead of evacuating them due to artillery firing.

On Wednesday evening India's foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan that it claimed detailed camps of the Paskistan-based militant group that carried out the Feb 14 attack.

The conflict comes at a critical time for Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi, who faces a general election in a matter of months.

Late on Wednesday B.S. Yeddyurappa, the leader of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in the southern state of Karnataka, said India's strike inside Pakistani territory would help the party to win back power in the state - the first such comment from a member of the ruling party.

""This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,"" he told reporters.

""The effect of this will be seen in the elections.""

INTERNATIONAL CONCERN

The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan's leader Khan spoke of ""mending ties"" with India.

The White House urged ""both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to ""prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity"".

Pakistan's envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis.

At the same time, he said the lack of U.S. condemnation of India's strike on Pakistan was ""construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even moreâ€.

China, the European Union and other countries including Iran also called for restraint.

The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and expressed ""deep concern"", China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, which claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack. China is likely to be oppose the move.

FLIGHTS CANCELLED

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan's move, along with all flights to and from the country.

Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.

Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

Flights from the Middle East and India were also affected. Air Canada said on Wednesday it has temporarily suspended service to India.

A Sikh leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) won a by-election to enter the Canadian parliament.

Jagmeet Singh, 40, won the Burnaby South constituency seat in British Columbia (BC) province after defeating Liberal party candidate Tory Shin, a corporate lawyer, and Lee, a former Burnaby member of the provincial legislature representing the BC Liberals, his campaign said.

The by-election was held in three different provinces on Tuesday, with barely eight months left for the federal elections in October, also sealed Mr Singh's position as an undisputed leader of the NDP, the third largest party in the House of Commons.

The other two seats were bagged one each by the ruling Liberals from Ontario province and the main opposition Conservatives from Quebec.

The Scarborough-born Sikh leader, also rated as a rising star in Canadian politics, had a shaky position as the head of the NDP as he was not a Member of Parliament.

Following his win, Mr Singh is now considered as a viable challenge to the main Opposition Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, who is younger to him and streering a progressive alternative on the national stage to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal party.

According to Mr Singh's campaign spokesperson, James Smith, the NDP leader has now redeemed his supremacy in the party.

Affordable housing, pharmacare and meaningful action to combat climate change are his focused areas of work to solve the problems of the people, Singh told his supporters in his victory speech.

Mr Singh maintained that the successive governments of the Liberals and the Conservatives had only enriched corporations while neglecting common Canadians.

""I know it's been a long slog, but I hope you have more left in the tank. We have just eight more months to let the people know they can choose a government that stands up for people and not corporations, that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin,"" Mr Singh said in the context of the ongoing controversy involving SNC-Lavalin.

The NDP victory comes at a time the Liberals are facing the worst crisis involving the SNC-Lavalin bribery scandal, which led to the resignation of the former justice minister attorney general Jody Wilsom-Raybould

According to many experts on the country, the situation has gotten even worse. The most prominent example of this is the case of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who was living in exile and serving as a columnist for the Washington Post when he was murdered in early October 2018 in Istanbul.

Only after weeks of international pressure did Saudi Arabia admit that the murderers were committed by its own secret service. According to American media reports, the CIA is even said to hold evidence that MBS personally ordered the murder of the journalist.

Rainer Sollich, from DW's Middle East Regional Desk

""The Saudi state is dictatorial and oppressive,"" Saudi Prince Khaled bin Farhan Al-Saud, who lives in exile in Germany, told DW's Arabic language program in October 2018. ""The authorities will not tolerate even cautious criticism."" He himself is under police protection.

Freedom for women

Saudi women were also victims of harassment and oppression. Although the leadership in Riyadh officially lifted the ban on driving for women in June 2018 and earned international recognition for it, the action was flanked by the arrest of numerous Saudi Arabian human rights and women's rights activists. At least three of the women arrested have been subjected to electric shocks, lashings and various forms of sexual violence, with claims of torture reported by Human Rights Watch in November 2018.

Violence erupted at the Venezuela-Colombia border over the delivery of humanitarian aid to Venezuela, killing four people and injuring 24 on Feb. 22.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that his “days are numbered,” and Trump officials reiterated that the U.S. is considering all options, including military action, to address Venezuela’s crisis.

Almost 80 percent of Venezuelans disapprove of Maduro, who was reinaugurated for a second six-year term in January after an election widely seen as fraudulent. Since taking power in 2013, he has led Venezuela into a deep economic crisis.

In late January, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared Maduro a “usurper” and swore himself in as the country’s rightful president. More than 50 countries – including the United States, Europe and most of Latin America – want to replace Maduro’s regime with a Guaidó-led government.

Despite near global condemnation of Maduro, any U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be controversial. The United States’ long history of interfering in Latin American politics suggests that its military operations generally usher in dictatorship and civil war – not democracy.

The Cuban-US Cold War

Cuba, the focus of my history research, is a prime example of this pattern.

U.S.-Cuban relations have never recovered from President William McKinley’s intervention in Cuba’s war for independence over a century ago.

Before waging what in the U.S. is known as the Spanish-American War in 1898, McKinley promised that “the people of the island of Cuba” would be “free and independent” from Spain and that his government had no “intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over said Island.”

In the end, however, Cuba’s independence from Spain meant domination by the United States.

For 60 years after the Spanish-American War, the White House made repeated military and diplomatic interventions in Cuba, supporting politicians who protected U.S. economic interests in sugar, utilities, banks or tourism and who backed American foreign policy in the Caribbean.

By 1952, when the U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista overthrew President Carlos Prío Socarrás, Cuba’s government had effectively become protectors of American businesses, according to my research. Batista had a warm relationship with both Washington, D.C. and the American organized crime groups that used to control Havana’s tourist industry.

A communist revolution led by Fidel Castro overthrew Batista’s military junta in 1959. Castro decried the “imperialist government of the United States” for turning Cuba into an “American colony.”

The Kennedy administration’s trade embargo against Cuba and the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion – in which the U.S. military trained Cuban dissidents in an attempt to unseat Castro – only pushed Cuba further into the orbit of Soviet Russia.

For the past six decades, the U.S. and Cuba have remained locked in a Cold War, with a brief thaw under President Barack Obama.

Anti-communist coups

Fearing that communism would spread across the hemisphere, the U.S. government repeatedly interfered in the politics of Latin American nations during the Cold War.

In 1954 the CIA worked with elements of the Guatemalan military to overthrow elected President Jacobo Árbenz, whom U.S. policymakers considered dangerously left-wing. Decades of dictatorship and civil war followed, killing an estimated 200,000 people.

A peace agreement in 1996 restored democracy, but Guatemala has yet to recover economically, politically or psychologically from the bloodshed.

Then there is Chile’s U.S.-supported coup d’etat. In 1973, the U.S. government covertly assisted right-wing elements of the Chilean military in overthrowing the socialist president Salvador Allende.

General Augusto Pinochet took power with the quiet financial and political support of the United States. His dictatorship, which lasted until 1990, killed tens of thousands of Chileans.

The Dominican Republic and Panama

U.S. intervention in Latin America did not start or end with the Cold War.

During World War I, the United States was concerned that Germany could use the Dominican Republic as a base of military operations. So American troops occupied the Caribbean island from 1916 to 1924.

Though the American-led administration improved the finances and infrastructure of the Dominican Republic, it also created the national guard that helped to propel Gen. Rafael Trujillo into power. His 30-year reign was savage.

President George H. W. Bush’s 1989 invasion of Panama is the rare exception when U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs actually created stability.

Most Panamanians appear to have supported the 1989 U.S. military operation to remove the corrupt and brutal military strongman Manuel Noriega.

In the years since, Panama has enjoyed comparatively peaceful elections and transfers of power.

Anti-Americanism in Latin America

On balance, though, U.S. military operations in Latin America have rarely brought democracy.

But they have created strong anti-American sentiment in the region, which leftist leaders from Fidel Castro to Hugo Chávez have adeptly harnessed to vilify their political opponents as mere U.S. puppets.

Support for the U.S. government is lower now than it has been in decades. Just 35 percent of Argentines, 39 percent of Chileans and 45 percent of Venezuelans view the U.S. favorably, according to the Pew Research Center.

President Maduro, too, has used anti-imperialist rhetoric. He denounces U.S. sanctions and other efforts to isolate his regime as a “gringo plot.”

A safer way to restore democracy

This history explains why a U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be viewed with skepticism. Though Maduro is unpopular, 65 percent of Venezuelans oppose any foreign military operation to remove Maduro, according to recent polling.

Rather than plan yet another coup d’etat, I believe U.S. efforts in Venezuela should support the work of the Lima Group, a coalition of 12 Latin American countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil, plus Canada.

The Lima Group has ruled out military force in Venezuela. Its pressure campaign to force him out peacefully has included diplomatically isolating his regime and asking Venezuela’s soldiers to pledge loyalty to Guaidó.

A negotiated settlement leading to Maduro’s voluntary departure from office is their ultimate goal.

Regional diplomacy is much slower than foreign intervention. But it avoids further bloodshed and reduces the role of anti-Americanism in Venezuela’s crisis.

It may also open a new chapter in the history of U.S.-Latin American relations – one in which the U.S. takes its lead from the region, and not the other way around.

Outremont's polls are open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.,"Liberal Rachel Bendayan has won the federal riding of Outremont in Quebec after taking 40 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of polls reporting.

""I will honour your vote by working very hard,"" she said Monday night at Liberal party headquarters in Montreal's Outremont.

She stressed that the Liberals would continue to fight climate change and promote a national housing strategy.

Mélanie Joly, the minister of official languages and La Francophonie, said that despite losing to the NDP in 2015, Bendayan was always a strong candidate who continued working in the riding in the years since.

""We hope this is the end of the Orange Wave in Quebec,"" Joly said Monday night.

The NDP, which had held the riding since 2007, trailed in second place with less than 30 per cent of the votes.

Outremont was one of three ridings where federal byelections took place Monday on a crucial day for Canada's major political parties.

Voter turnout was low, as is typical for a byelection. Less than 20 per cent of the 70,400 registered voters in Outremont cast a ballot.

Political insiders had bet that the Liberals would retake the riding — a welcome boost for the governing party's morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

""Tonight, the people of Outremont and thousands of Canadians voting in these byelections have offered a strong vote of confidence in Justin Trudeau's positive plan to strengthen the middle class,"" said Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Outremont resident, Claudette Dumas Bergen, says the weather was holding her back but she adds “my civic duty came to me and I said I have to go because it’s important!” <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Outremont?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Outremont</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCMontreal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCMontreal</a> <a href=""https://t.co/H6ds1wsZZ4"">pic.twitter.com/H6ds1wsZZ4</a> —@mia_anhoury

Analysts said the Outremont race was a crucial test for the NDP.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Thomas Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection: the Liberals had lost the riding only once, to the Progressive Conservatives in 1988, since 1935.

The so-called Orange Wave followed in 2011 and boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history.

While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

These are the candidates who ran in Outremont and how much of the vote they took by the time 95 per cent of ballots had been counted:

40 per cent: Rachel Bendayan — Liberal Party of Canada.

29 per cent: Julia Sánchez — New Democratic Party.

13 per cent: Daniel Green — Green Party of Canada.

11 per cent: Michel Duchesne — Bloc Québécois.

A Dutch proposal, which earlier won French and German support, was discussed by member states' diplomats in the EU capital on Wednesday (27 February).

'Some [EU] countries say: 'We want to give support, but we want a more neutral name',' Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said in December (Photo: European Council)

The same group, the so-called Working Party on Human Rights, in the EU Council is to hold further talks on 13 March, 27 March, and 10 April.

The new ""EU Human Rights Sanctions Regime"" is to impose asset freezes and visa bans on individual abusers, such as foreign warlords or torturers, no matter where they come from.

They are meant to snap into life more quickly than old-fashioned, country-based sanctions and to end impunity for people who evade criminal justice at home.

The Dutch had hoped to have the measures in place before the European Parliament elections in May, when the EU legislative machine clunks out of gear.

But the proposal must also be finalised by another EU Council group, the so-called Working Party of Foreign Relations Counsellors, and by member states' ambassadors in the Political and Security Committee, before it gets the green light.

For its part, Hungary has questioned whether Europe needed the new-model sanctions and has voiced ""procedural grumblings"", an EU source said.

There were also concerns that Italy's Russia-friendly government might block them if the measures appeared to pose a threat to Russian elites.

The EU takes foreign policy decisions by consensus.

But neither Hungary or Italy have objected to moving ahead at this stage despite those ""grumblings"", the EU source noted.

The Dutch initiative was inspired by the US, which first imposed targeted sanctions on human rights abusers in what it called a ""Magnitsky Act"" in 2012, named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian anti-corruption activist who was killed in 2009.

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the UK, and Canada have also adopted ""Magnitsky Acts"".

They listed Russian officials, who stand accused of embezzling the Russian state, killing the whistleblower, then laundering the money in EU banks and spending it on real estate, yacht charters, and luxury goods.

The Dutch proposal for EU-level measures dropped the reference to the Russian case, favouring a more neutral title, however.

""The 'Magnitsky' laws also cover corruption. This [the proposed EU] human rights regime is not about that. It's purely about human rights,"" a Dutch diplomat told EUobserver on Friday.

But Bill Browder, a British financier who used to employ Magnitsky in Russia and whose subsequent campaign for justice gave birth to the US legislation, countered that line.

""That's not true,"" he told this website.

""The original Magnitsky Act passed by US Congress in 2012 was solely about human rights, and was triggered by the torture and murder of Sergei Magnitsky,"" Browder said.

Redacting Magnitsky name's from the EU bill was an ""appeasement strategy"" toward the Russian regime, he added.",Ball rolling on EU human rights sanctions,Euobserver.com,https://euobserver.com/foreign/144308

Commerce Ministry studies show CPTPP would benefit Thailand, says Auramon Supthaweethum, head of the Trade Negotiations Department. (Post File Photo)

TOKYO: Thailand will apply this month to join the new trans-Pacific free trade agreement, aiming to ensure it is not left behind by its competitors in the vibrant region, according to the country’s trade negotiations chief.

“Thailand is working with the documents for applying to the CPTPP,” said Auramon Supthaweethum, director-general of the Trade Negotiations Department at the Commerce Ministry, referring to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership that entered into force last Dec 30 and currently involves 11 countries.

“We have planned to submit our application for joining the CPTPP before March 24,” she said, referring to the date of the general elections.

Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, who is scheduled to visit Sendai, Hokkaido and Tokyo in the middle of this month, said earlier that he would officially announce the country’s plan to seek CPTPP membership during the trip.

Ms Auramon said a study conducted by her department on the benefits and impacts of CPTPP participation was positive, as were the results of public hearings conducted across the country.

The CPTPP currently comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam, most of which have ratified the agreement.

Several countries besides Thailand have also shown interest in joining the pact and a meeting held Jan 19 in Tokyo to discuss procedures to accept new members concluded that it will be “open to all economies” that can meet its high-standard rules.

Thailand’s application will need to be endorsed by at least half of the current members, Auramon explained. Its entry will then need to be ratified by the newly elected parliament.

According to the department’s study, she said, membership would lead to increased trade and investment for the country, while upgrading regulations and standards. It is also likely to secure Thailand’s position as a major manufacturing base for foreign-affiliated manufacturers.

Thailand is already participating in the Asean Free Trade Area, which includes CPTPP members Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. It also has bilateral FTAs with CPTPP participants Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

The CPTPP covers around 13% of the world’s gross domestic product and provides access to an economic bloc of 500 million people. It is designed to cut tariffs on agricultural and industrial products, ease investment restrictions and enhance intellectual property protection.

Its recent entry into force marked a critical milestone for the 11 countries that sought to save its older version, simply called the TPP, from collapse after US President Donald Trump pulled the world’s largest economy out of it.

TPP negotiations began in 2010 and the current members plus the United States signed an agreement in 2016 while Barack Obama was still president.

After the US pulled out, the remaining countries renamed and signed a revised version that suspended some provisions in the original TPP.",Thailand preparing CPTPP application,Bangkokpost.com,https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1637978/thailand-preparing-cptpp-application
68,Empty,2019-02-27T12:21:00Z,An under-the-hood look at the share price at which Cronos Group would offer intriguing value to investors.,"Marijuana stocks can seemingly do no wrong lately, and it's not hard to see why. Since October, we've seen Canada legalize recreational marijuana, had a handful of U.S. states approve medical or recreational weed during midterm elections in November, witnessed President Trump sign the Farm Bill into law, and heard of rumors that Mexico may choose to legalize recreational marijuana in 2019. Not shockingly, the first-ever marijuana exchange-traded fund in Canada, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, is up more than 50% this year.

But even with rapid global sales growth of up to 38% expected in 2019, not all pot stock valuations make sense. While yours truly has been critical of mid- and large-cap marijuana stock valuations in recent months, no company has stood out as more overvalued recently than Cronos Group (NASDAQ: CRON) -- this year's top-performing pot stock.

However, just because I view Cronos Group as a stock worth avoiding now, it doesn't mean I don't see value in the business or the stock. There is a share price at which I believe Cronos Group becomes attractive to investors. But before I divulge that price point, let me walk you through my thought process from both the buy and sell sides of things.

Dried cannabis buds lying atop a messy pile of cash bills. More

The Cronos Group buy thesis

Make no mistake about it, the clearest reason to be excited about Cronos Group is the $1.8 billion equity investment from tobacco giant Altria (NYSE: MO), announced in early December. Altria, which has faced years of declining cigarette demand in the U.S., is looking for ways to reignite growth, without having to continuously raise tobacco prices. By taking a 45% equity stake in Cronos Group, Altria is getting its foot in the door in the high-growth cannabis industry.

Furthermore, Altria's equity stake in Cronos Group, which has yet to close, comes with warrants that could be exercised at a later date. If Altria were to exercise all the warrants it'll be receiving, it could become a majority stakeholder (55%) in Cronos. Given its $3.6 billion market cap, Cronos could easily be gobbled up by Altria and its still-substantial free cash flow. Thus, premium is being paid to the likelihood that Altria will eventually buy the remainder of Cronos Group that it doesn't already own.

On the flip side, once the deal closes, Cronos Group will have north of $1.8 billion in cash on hand to execute on its long-term strategy. No longer having to worry about raising capital, Cronos will be focused on expanding internationally, diversifying its product portfolio to feature high-margin items, and growing its production capacity. This also means that dilution becomes less of a concern, with the company not having to turn to bought-deal offerings to raise capital.

Partnerships are another key selling point for Cronos Group. In September, it and Ginkgo Bioworks entered into a deal that'll cost Cronos up to $100 million. It will, however, give Cronos access to Ginkgo's microorganism development platform. This platform should allow for the creation of yeast strains capable of producing eight types of cannabinoids. These cannabinoids, some of which are rare, could be produced at commercial scale, presumably for a cheaper cost than traditional extraction methods.

An enthusiastic Singh, who hugged, high-fived and spoke to members of his caucus for the first time Wednesday morning since winning a seat in the riding of Burnaby South, spun a message that the NDP is a party focused on people while the Liberals side with big companies.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show Singh was able to win the B.C. riding with 39 per cent of the vote — a success that means he will now be able to challenge Trudeau in the Commons for the first time since becoming leader in October 2017.

""I'll be fighting for the things that matter to people,"" he said to a room of MPs and supporters visibly elated by his recent win. ""But I need you all to be a part of this. Together, we can put Canada on a new course.""

Singh said Canadians gave Justin Trudeau a chance, but the prime minister is too busy ""doing favours for corporate friends,"" alluding to the controversy involving Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

""From changing the law to get powerful executives off the hook, to giving billions in subsidies to the oil and gas (sector), to protecting the profits of pharmaceutical industries while keeping drug prices high,"" Singh said.

""It's clear: Justin Trudeau is not on our side, he's not on your side — he's on theirs.""

Under pressure

Since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair, Singh has faced external and internal questions about his effectiveness as the NDP's popular support and fundraising slid.

Members of his caucus, however, were repeatedly on their feet in celebration of Singh during the part of Wednesday's meeting opened up to media.

Veteran B.C. MP Nathan Cullen said there was a palpable sense of relief and optimism in the room.

""There's a feeling that, with the kind of message that we have, the opportunity is there for us,"" Cullen said in an interview.

""It is beyond just the symbolism of him winning a seat. This is Canada's first racialized leader of a federal party. The new face of the NDP is diverse and strong and unapologetically progressive.""

For his part, Singh told his caucus he didn't imagine that someone like him could ever run to be prime minister.

""My friends, we just sent a message to a lot of kids out there that yes, yes, they can,"" he said, prompting the room to burst into a round of applause.",Singh urges team to 'double down' in months leading up to October election,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jagmeet-singh-first-caucus-1.5035942

Key Focus Ahead

The German retail sales report at 0700 GMT is expected to kick-in a data-busy EUR calendar today, soon followed by the Swiss retail trade and manufacturing PMI reports at 0730 GMT and 0830 GMT respectively. Also, a raft of final manufacturing PMI reports will be published from across the Euro area economies, starting from 0815 GMT to 0900 GMT. The key highlight in Europe is likely to be the manufacturing PMI from the UK docket due at 0930 GMT and Eurozone flash CPI release at 1000 GMT among other minority reports.

The NA session is equally busy, as the traders see a fresh batch of US economic news, including the core PCE price index and personal spending at 1330 GMT. Parallely, the Canadian Q4 GDP report is slated for release. At 1430-1445 GMT, the Markit manufacturing PMI reports from both the US and Canada will be published. However, the US ISM manufacturing PMI and UoM consumer sentiment data (due at 1500 GMT) will hog the limelight.

The base isn’t stupid, and if they stay home on election day because you’ve disavowed them in the general election campaign then you aren’t going to pick up enough “moderate” voters to make a difference. That so-called strategy has looked more an more bleak for several years. Now the alleged moderates have not only decreased in number but they actually don’t represent any view on the American political landscape. These two graphs are from the Pew Research Center’s report Political Polarization in the American Public.

CREDIT: http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/

Because our “first past the post” system crushes third parties like the bugs that they are, this polarization hasn’t been felt in American politics. But the same thing is happening in Europe and Australia/Oceania where parliamentary systems and you can see the effect.

Writing at the Washington Post, Harry Olsen has an intriguing piece on how centrist, “third way” politics are foundering basically everywhere after this philosophy had been declared victorious a couple of decades ago. The article is titled Don’t fool yourself. The political center won’t recover anytime soon and I don’t think the phenomenon is as surprising as some.

…Globally, the prevailing trend is rising support for anti-immigrant, nationalist populist parties — not a resurgence of the center. That trend is easy to see almost anywhere you look. Estonia holds national elections in a week, and polls show the big winner is likely to be the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, which is set to more than double its share of the vote, becoming the third-largest party in the country. Spain’s Socialist president, Pedro Sánchez, recently called for a snap election after his government failed to pass a budget, but again, polls show an anti-immigrant, nationalist party called Vox will likely gain the most. Vox has skyrocketed in support from less than 1 percent in 2016 to an average of around 11 percent in recent polls. A three-party, center-right coalition including Vox shocked the country by winning the state elections last December in the longtime Socialist bastion of Andalusia. It now looks like that coalition will govern Spain, too. …Italy’s Lega is led by the notorious anti-immigrant and social conservative Matteo Salvini, who has garnered international attention with his opposition to admitting refugees from Muslim Northern Africa. Lega’s support has doubled within a year, from 17 percent in last March’s election to more than 35 percent today, easily making the brash populist the most popular political figure in Italy. …That’s the coalition that currently governs New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, known for her environmental policies and deft use of social media, governs in coalition with the anti-immigrant and nationalist New Zealand First party. Their coalition agreement is opaque on the matter, but annual net migration has declined nearly 30 percent since the coalition took power in 2017. …Quebec elected a center-right government for the first time in decades last year, partially on its promise to reduce immigration to the province by 20 percent. A new political party, the People’s Party of Canada, formed last year with a platform of free-market economic reforms and reducing immigration. It is already receiving more than 2 percent in the polls, and could easily gain more support ahead of this fall’s national election.

What Olsen paints as anti-immigrant is, I think, much more a natural resurgence of nationalism that has been tamped down…tribalism, dontcha know…by would-be elites married to a populism abetted by the breaking of the information monopoly that has large numbers of people looking at the policies promoted by those elites and asking “WTF??” because a blind man could see they do nothing to benefit current or future generations of their nation. Immigration is a lightning rod for this effect because in so many Western nations, the elites either have or have no problem with opening the flood gates to no-skills/low-skills immigrants who either survive on the dole (paid for by the citizen taxpayer) or compete for low-end jobs with disadvantaged citizens and who, either by their own desire or the benighted policies of the host nation, show no desire to assimilate or even pretend to assimilate.

Those bemoaning the loss of a “center” are actually crying over the demise of Failure Theater and the log-rolling and deal-making that benefited only a relatively small number of people to the detriment of most everyone else. They are complaining that the rule by elites is coming to an end now that everywhere people are seeing that what was marketed as “bipartisanship” was actually just a self-serving scam.

This is “how you got Trump” in a nutshell.

As Texas Democrat and populist Jim Hightower was noted for saying, there’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos. The 2016 GOP primary demonstrated that in spades. The closer you were to being a “moderate” the sooner you looked like dead armadillo (Scott Walker, Jeb Bush). The closer your views were to those of the average voter the better your chance of survival. Ted Cruz understood that when he ran this commercial in 2016 highlighting the fact that illegal immigration was only supported by people whose jobs were not put at risk by it:

It will be shocking if the same dynamic doesn’t play out in the Democrat primary for 2020.

Fifty years ago, both US parties commanded a broad consensus opinion on the American Experiment. That consensus has unraveled. The two major parties now have very differing ideas about what the nation should look like and how our economic system should operate. The challenge in 2020 will be to appeal to those common values remaining with sufficient strength to bring along people who might not agree with large parts of your platform. It implies that rather than trying to appeal to moderates, the successful candidate will lock down and motivate their base and build enough common ground with some “moderate” elements to create a winning coalition. Will that common ground be reducing illegal immigration, as it is in Europe? Will it be restricting abortion and limiting the ability of the federal government to meddle in our lives? Or will it be guaranteed free day care, a $15/hour minimum wage and a stipend for those who, according to the Green New Deal, are “unwilling to work?” I really don’t know. Regardless, the unalloyed good here is that both sides are coming to see “moderates” as the feckless and uncertain allies that they are.

The Russian draft text, seen by Reuters, expresses support for a political solution to the crisis and backs the Venezuelan government as the primary coordinator of international assistance efforts in the country.

A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass. Diplomats said the US draft is likely to gain the minimum nine votes to force a likely Russian veto, while the Russian draft is expected to fail without the need for a US veto.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a US-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country’s elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

The US draft resolution, seen by Reuters, asks UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to help ensure there is a free, fair and credible presidential election with international observers. It stresses the need to ensure the safety of all the members of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

The US envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that he was concerned for Guaido’s safety upon his return to Venezuela.

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota.

The Russian draft resolution expresses concern over threats to use force against Venezuela. US President Donald Trump has all options are on the table in dealing with Venezuela.

The United States and dozens of other nations have recognised Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president, but Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, which provides 90% of the country’s export revenue.

The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

In Geneva, Venezuela Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, addressing the UN Human Rights Council, suggested on Wednesday that Maduro and US President Donald Trump meet to “try to find common ground and explain their differences.”

Maduro also “stands ready for dialogue” with the Venezuelan opposition, he said.

74,Empty,2019-02-27T15:17:10Z,The second-in-line to the throne is in Belfast with his wife Kate (pictured today) and will say Britain needs strong leadership during a speech in Belfast tonight in a nod to the current Brexit deadlock.,"Advertisement

The Duke of Cambridge has urged people to 'come together in times of trouble and work for the common good' in a speech echoing the Queen's call for unity on Brexit as he pays a visit to Northern Ireland.

Prince William, 36, praised individuals seeking to work for 'the common good' in a speech delivered in Belfast last night, in what was thought to be a thinly veiled reference to Brexit.

Speaking about the appointment of former Olympian Dame Mary Peters to the Order of the Garter in Belfast, Prince William said: 'Mary Peters is not only one of the United Kingdom's sporting legends, she's also inspired generation after generation to come together in times of trouble and work for the common good - a lesson I hope many of us can learn from.

'So it was fitting today that Her Majesty The Queen has appointed Mary to be a Lady Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter - one of the UK's highest honours.'

The Prince's intervention comes just a month after the Queen highlighted the need for respect and seeking out common ground in an address seen as a veiled reference to the bitterness over Brexit.

Prince William, 36, praised individuals seeking to work for 'the common good' in the speech at the Empire Music Hall

His words will be particularly significant because much of the Brexit tension is over Northern Ireland's border and the backstop demanded by Brussels to keep trade flowing without the need for controls.

The Duke of Cambridge's message at the celebratory dinner in Belfast could also be seen as a prompt to Stormont to resume its work after the power-sharing deal between the DUP and Sinn Fein collapsed two years ago.

The Duke of Cambridge was joined by his wife the Duchess of Cambridge last night at Empire Music Hall.

William and Kate laughed and exchanged jokes as they got behind the bar at the Empire Music Hall.

There were cheers as Kate poured a pint of Harp Ice lager and set her effort on the bar.

The couple are all smiles as they arrive at Belfast's Empire Music Hall.

William then took his turn, saying 'here we go' as he tilted the pint glass. He watched the tap intently before exclaiming 'look at that bad boy' as he admired his work, and added: 'Perfect... good enough for an advert.'

Prince William calls for people to 'work for the common good' The Duke of Cambridge used his speech to make a thinly veiled reference to Brexit as he praised former Olympian Dame Mary Peters will become a Lady Companion of the Order - the oldest and most senior British Order of Chivalry. He said: 'Mary Peters is not only one of the United Kingdom's sporting legends, she's also inspired generation after generation to come together in times of trouble and work for the common good - a lesson I hope many of us can learn from. 'So it was fitting today that Her Majesty The Queen has appointed Mary to be a Lady Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter - one of the UK's highest honours.' In the brief speech he also praised the work of the people at the event. He said: 'From using sport to encourage people to talk openly about mental health to delivering services to children and young people who are at risk of entering care or custody – the work you do transcends community divisions and is helping deliver a brighter future for everybody in Northern Ireland.'

Her Majesty and the rest of the royals are expected to remain politically neutral.

Using barely coded language in a speech to her local Women's Institute in Norfolk, The Queen said in January she preferred 'respecting different points of view'.

Her intervention split opinion with many praising the Queen but others claiming she should not get involved.

She also used her Christmas message to the nation to preach a similar message of unity.

William's hastily-arranged two-day visit to Northern Ireland with his wife Kate comes as MPs argue over the terms of Brexit with just over a month to go until the scheduled departure date.

The royals began their trip with a visit to Windsor Park football stadium to find out about outreach programmes and take part in a game of football with local children.

The tour will include a meeting with a youth charity in the border region of Fermanagh.

Even though the royals tend to steer well clear of politics, their visits are often organised in conjunction with the government to assist Britain's wider political and economic agenda at home and abroad.

The shock result of the 2016 EU membership referendum has forced the royals into diplomatic overdrive.

Not long after the referendum, William toured Canada, then Europe, in what was seen as a bridge-building exercise as Britain looks to retain old alliances with European and build new trade ties with the Commonwealth.

Strategic royal visits have multiplied since then.

But the trip to Northern Ireland, where the IRA fought a bloody campaign against British rule for three decades until 1998, is particularly sensitive.

Since the end of the conflict, residents of the province have become accustomed to a free-flowing border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state.

Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU by 56 percent to 44 percent but the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave.

Should the Queen or Prince William speak out about Brexit? As Head of State The Queen has to remain strictly neutral with respect to all political matters. She is unable to vote or stand for election - as are other senior members of the royal family. But on rare occasions the Queen will use a key speech, such as her Christmas speech, to make more general observations about life in Britain if she think it's important. In the past two months she spoke out twice about respecting opposing views in an obvious nod to the current crisis surrounding Brexit. Prince William's intervention in Northern Ireland - a subtle message about Brexit and Stormont - is also highly significant. The Monarch has several ceremonial and formal roles in relation to the government, including the State Opening of Parliament where she reveals upcoming legilsation. The Queen also has a special relationship with the Prime Minister, retaining the right to appoint and also meeting with him or her on a regular basis. But she is not allowed to push them in any political direction. However, in the past, others have let slip her views on major issues. In 2012 the BBC apologised to her when it said the Queen had voiced concerns to the previous government about the inability of UK authorities to arrest and deport hate preacher Abu Hamza. More recently The Sun defended its own claims that the Queen was pro-Brexit and the BBC claimed that Her Majesty said that Britain should 'just get on with' leaving the European Union at a private lunch.

The future of the border - and in particular how to fulfil British and EU promises to keep it open - has been a flashpoint for Brexit divisions ever since.

There are fears on both sides of the Irish border that any disruption could undermine the peace process.

But many Conservative MPs are refusing to approve the draft Brexit deal on the table because they fear Britain would be trapped in an indefinite 'backstop' arrangement with the EU to keep the border open.

After her deal was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament last month, Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will look for changes to the backstop but has sought to reassure Northern Ireland over its future.

Royals getting involved in politics is extremely rare, but the Prince of Wales has promised he will not 'meddle' in public affairs when he becomes king after a series of high-profile rows.

In 2015 Charles had to defend his decision to write a series of letters to government ministers, some of which are known as the 'black spider' memos, so-called because of his use of black ink and his scrawled handwriting.

A long-running legal battle by Guardian newspaper journalist Rob Evans to secure the release of the documents culminated in the UK's highest court ordering the Government to publish them.

The letters showed the prince had raised issues with ministers on several occasions between September 2004 and March 2005.

He tackled then-prime minister Tony Blair over the lack of resources for the armed forces fighting in Iraq and also wrote to ministers about the benefits of complementary medicine, the need for affordable rural homes and the threat to heritage buildings.

In the same year there was controversy when it emerged Charles had been routinely receiving copies of confidential Cabinet papers for more than 20 years.

The Prince of Wales has long espoused the benefits of homeopathic remedies and complementary medicine – and come under fire from some in the medical profession as a result.

In a private letter to Mr Blair in 2005 he complained that a European Union directive on herbal medicinal products was having a 'deleterious effect' on the UK's complementary medicine sector by 'effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts'.

In 2008 his Duchy Originals firm and British homeopathic manufacturer Nelson launched a range of herbal remedies.

The following year the UK medicines regulator told the firm to change the wording of a campaign promoting two products because their claims were misleading.

In January, using barely coded language in a speech to her local Women's Institute in Norfolk, the Queen said she preferred 'respecting different points of view' and also called for calm

In a major documentary to mark his 70th birthday last year, Prince Charles, the heir to the throne tackled head-on the issue of his controversial lobbying and promised not to 'meddle' when he is king

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.

Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked aid from reaching the crisis-hit country during the weekend.

The United States also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking that body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored to the OPEC member. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA's assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro's ""henchmen"" to Guaido's government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming.

""In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks,"" Pence said. ""We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.""

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the ""massacre"" of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider ""all options"" in ousting Maduro.

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hopes Maduro and those supported by his ""corruption and his brutality"" will leave Venezuela peacefully.

""We make clear to them that we will support the interim president's call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,"" Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region's other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president.

""We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere, and our message today very much was intended to say - to Mexico, to Uruguay, to nations across the eastern Caribbean - that they need to come off the sidelines, they need to take a stand for freedom. Stand with us and with the people of Venezuela,"" said Pence.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela's energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup against Venezuela.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro's government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as ""trochas"" generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as ""trocheros.""

""We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,"" said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. ""We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.""

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Lacava goes by the nickname ""Dracula"" in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos.

The U.S. isn’t a banana republic, but its police apparatus sometimes comes close.

The broadening revelations of the lawless, almost putschist excesses of the Comey-McCabe FBI and elements of the Justice Department and the Brennan-Clapper intelligence services invite serious contemplation of how close the United States came to being a country where regime change might be plausibly and self-righteously attempted by what in undemocratic countries is generally known as the secret police. It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the United States, which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War. That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United Sates is not a “banana republic.” Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about America’s status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95 percent, 97 percent of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers. Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer–client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as media trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland.

Every nomination to the Supreme Court is now a pitched battle replete with paid demonstrators at hearings and extensive campaigns of character assassination, but that court has sat inert as practically all the Bill of Rights’ constitutional assurances of due process, prompt and impartial justice, and the avoidance of capricious prosecutions have been abandoned. It is in this, as other civilized jurisdictions would consider it, tenuous state of the rule of law that the antics of the Comey-McCabe FBI and Brennan-Clapper intelligence direction, and their partisan effort to bend the law to install Hillary Clinton as president and sandbag Donald Trump, should be considered.

Celebrated as Thomas Jefferson rightly is for his seminal role in the creation of the country’s initial texts and its early governance, one achievement for which he has received insufficient credit is the founding of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1802. While this began as a corps of engineers limited to 20 men at first (led by Benjamin Franklin’s nephew, Jonathan Williams), the objective was to assure a non-political class of officers. The focus on engineering was, at this early stage, the young nation’s chief military requirement.

Jefferson’s initiative assured the United States of a nonpolitical military. The country has had twelve presidents who were celebrated combat military officers, from Washington to Eisenhower, including citizen generals such as Jackson, Hayes, and Garfield. And it has had a number of presidents who were distinguished middle or junior officers, including Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George H. W. Bush, and six high-ranking military officers who were unsuccessful presidential candidates, including the first Republican candidate, Colonel John C. Frémont; a general fired by Abraham Lincoln as commander of the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan, who had the effrontery to run against Lincoln in 1864; and a hero POW, John McCain.

The point of this recitation is that none of these people dabbled in politics while they were in the armed forces. The only serious figure who did so was General Douglas MacArthur, who, in response to a freshet of Republican-delegate enthusiasm from a midwestern state while he was preparing to liberate the Philippines, wrote to a supporter for public circulation a letter stating that he would accept the Republican nomination in 1944, but would be unable to campaign (as if his commander-in-chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would tolerate such a thing from a serving theater commander). When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1952, and was asked when he became Republican, he replied: “Today.” No soldier has led Great Britain since Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, except the Duke of Wellington, for two years.

The federal police (FBI) are another matter. The leader of a successful previous organization and of the FBI for a total of 47 years, J. Edgar Hoover, has been strenuously criticized for his unscrupulous political machinations, but he never attempted to influence a presidential election. When the military are depoliticized, the secret police and intelligence services, if not reined in, can be very powerful, in a democratic country as in a dictatorship. In the Soviet Union, the army only briefly was politically influential, under Marshal Zhukhov just after the death of Stalin, while Stalin’s last three secret-police leaders, Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria, were all summarily executed after they had done a great deal of his unimaginable dirty work. Even in revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the greatest police minister in all history, the egregiously cunning Joseph Fouché, who sent the head of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre, to the guillotine at the end of the Reign of Terror, after Robespierre had tried to do the same to him, was sent packing finally, rich but mistrusted and powerless.

American democracy is insuperably strong in the hearts of the people and in 230 years of triumphant survival through a vehement and contentious national history. But the recent fantastic cascade of professions of righteous untouchability from Comey and McCabe and Brennan and Clapper shows that there is no institutional tradition of respect for and deference to the constitutional integrity of the system in the main police and intelligence agencies. Though fired for dishonesty and sent for grand-jury evaluation as a criminal lying to Congress and out of control, Andrew McCabe generally enjoys the support of the Trump-hating media in his book tour, celebrating a lawless disregard for the supremacy of the people under the Constitution. He feared that Trump might be a “Russian asset,” and accordingly set a special counsel with practically unlimited powers, who engaged a fervently partisan Democratic staff, upon him.

Almost the entire legal system of the United States requires radical reform and democratization, and the disarming of a virtually omnipotent prosecutocracy. It is the strength and the weakness of America that it is not really the gentle and kindly country portrayed by Norman Rockwell and Walt Disney. That America exists and is a revered pastoral self-image. But the United States is ultimately a jungle, and jungles are ruled by 30-foot constricting snakes and 600-pound cats, and these are usually the rulers of America, with a varying level of humanization.

The intense struggle for the highest positions in the country is a generally meritocratic struggle, with only rare lapses into mediocrity. The survival and elevation process leaves an inordinate number of severely shattered people. In such a society, the senior police and intelligence apparatus can be dangerous, and in the last few years, it has been. The outcome of the present struggle for power in Washington should include tighter civilian control of these agencies, as in the military, the end of the effort to criminalize policy differences, and the end of the attempted reduction of the drastic remedy of impeachment to a partisan power play to reverse the result of elections. That is essentially what it was in the Nixon and Clinton presidencies and has been since the 2016 election.

""We have been in the middle trying to help them both out.""On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election in a matter of months, told a rally of supporters that India would unite against its enemies.""The world is observing our collective will. It is necessary that we shouldn't do anything that allows our enemy to raise a finger at us,"" he said, in his first remarks since the downing of planes on Wednesday.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for talks between the two nations.Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on Parliament.Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute. Thai Airways International announced on Thursday that it had cancelled flights to Pakistan and Europe, which left thousands of passengers stranded in Bangkok.On Thursday morning troops from India and Pakistan briefly exchanged fire in Poonch.""The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defence ministry spokesman.The firing lasted for a little over an hour beginning at 6am and was significantly less elevated than the artillery fire exchanged by the two sides on Wednesday.Pakistan said the firing began overnight.India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families in Jammu and Kashmir living close to the border, hoping to keep them safe near their homes rather than evacuate them.On Wednesday evening, the foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan which details camps of the Paskistan-based militant group that carried out the February 14 attack.With a general election due by May, an upsurge in nationalism from any conflict with Pakistan could become a key factor, potentially favouring the BJP.Late on Wednesday, BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa said the strike inside Pakistani territory would help the party win back power in the state -- the first such comment from a member of the ruling party.""This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,"" he told reporters. ""The effect of this will be seen in the elections.""The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan's leader Khan spoke of ""mending ties"" with India.The White House urged ""both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.""US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to ""prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity"".Pakistan's envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis.At the same time, he said the lack of US condemnation of India's strike on Pakistan was ""construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more”.China, the European Union and other countries also called for restraint. Japan's foreign minister said on Thursday the country was concerned about the ""deteriorating situation"".The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and expressed ""deep concern"", China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, the group that claimed responsibility for the February 14 attack.

79,Empty,2019-02-26T00:30:27Z,"The US Treasury Department's sanctions are imposed on 4 Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the US.","BOGOTA: The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

As Colombia’s foreign minister warned about “credible threats to the life” of Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido, the Trump administration also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The US Treasury Department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as US Vice-President Mike Pence and Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro’s “henchmen” to Guaido’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming against the OPEC member.

“In the days ahead … the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

While the day presented a united regional front against Maduro, who is widely accused of coming to power through fraudulent elections, there was no clear sign that the latest measures would succeed in pushing him toward the exit.

On a day that began with Guaido urging “all options” to be considered to remove Maduro, the threat of military intervention seemed if anything weaker after the meeting.

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

Guaido himself could be in danger from the Maduro regime, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said, speaking on behalf of the Lima Group.

“There’s information about serious and credible threats to the life and integrity of Juan Guaido and his family, as well as to his wife’s family. From Bogota, we want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,”

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during protests and clashes on Saturday as US-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

In a joint statement at the close of the meeting, the Lima Group said Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

But the Lima Group said it “reiterates the conviction that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law,” the statement said.

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hoped Maduro and those supported by his “corruption and his brutality” will leave Venezuela peacefully.

“We make clear to them that we will support the interim president’s call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,” Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president.

“We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere,” Pence said.

Washington wants the 15-member UN Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro blocked a convoy of trucks with food and medicines during the weekend. Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup.

At least 167 members of Maduro’s armed forces have deserted since Saturday and more are expected to flee across the border to Colombia.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro’s government last week. Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has suffered years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros.”

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

The Lima Group said it would ask the International Criminal Court to consider “the serious humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of Nicolas Maduro’s regime against the civilian population, and the denial of access to international assistance.”

Every one of my elementary school teachers said it: You will be judged by the company you keep. In Donald Trump's case, that company not only includes Michael Cohen and the others who have been indicted or convicted for breaking the occasional law, but even bigger fish: Vladimir Putin of Russia, Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia (MBS) and Kim Jong Un of North Korea. This is Trump's own Axis of Evil.

The original Axis of Evil, an idiotic formulation propounded by George W. Bush in his 2002 State of the Union address, consisted of Iraq and Iran -- who had recently tried to annihilate each other -- and North Korea. Iran's membership remains in good standing, but a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq no longer qualifies. And North Korea's cuddly tyrant has now been embraced by the president as ""my friend."" Trump found him wholly innocent for the death of the American college student Otto Warmbier, who was returned to the U.S. in a vegetative state.

Kim assured Trump he had nothing to do with Warmbier's death, and the president, as he has done with MBS and Putin in similar circumstance, bought it. Kim ""tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word,"" Trump said while in Hanoi for his sit-down last week with the North Korean dictator. It should be pointed out that Kim had his dear uncle executed, maintains a Gulag system similar to Stalin's of old and is his country's absolute ruler. It's hard to believe that an American was imprisoned without Kim getting the memo.

For Trump, there is precedent here. He shrugged off the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives in that nation's Istanbul diplomatic consulate. Repeatedly, Trump insisted that he had given MBS the third degree and that the crown prince, whose close associates the CIA strongly suggested had murdered Khashoggi, was wonderfully alibied. At the moment, there are reports that Saudi-American dual citizen, Walid Fitaihi, was tortured while detained in November 2017. I can save Trump the phone call: MBS knows nothing about this.

Finally, we come to Putin. His regime is accused of numerous human rights violations and the murder of dissidents, both at home and abroad. And yet Trump has nary a word of criticism for the Russian leader. On the contrary, he has slobbered him with praise, not even holding him responsible for interfering in the 2016 elections. Instead, Trump has been harsher on his own intelligence officials, all of whom dusted the elections and found Putin's fingerprints all over it.

""I believe that President Putin really feels, and he feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,"" Trump has said. Case closed.

If you collected the despots Trump has singled out for praise, you would have an international version of the storied Apalachin meeting, the 1957 mobster fest in a once-obscure New York State hamlet. That meeting established without question the existence of the Mafia, which -- pre-Godfather movies -- was doubted by, among others, J. Edgar Hoover. A Trump meeting with his associates would establish his stunning moral and political corruption.

If, on the other hand, you assembled the world leaders he has insulted, you would have an entirely different kind of meeting: Justin Trudeau of Canada, whom he called ""very dishonest and weak""; Theresa May of Great Britain, whom he said is mishandling Brexit and had the effrontery not to follow his advice; and, above all, Angela Merkel of Germany, for whom he has shown unbridled contempt. He criticized her immigration policy and later, in an act of sheer schoolroom disrespect, tossed a handful of Starburst candy at her at a G-7 meeting. ""Don't say I never give you anything,"" he said.

As others have pointed out, Michael Cohen described a Mafia-like organization, built around protecting one man. Cohen alleged lying. He alleged payoff. Cohen alleged a code in which denial meant assent, assent meant denial and the truth was uttered only if some stranger got off the elevator at Trump Tower on the wrong floor.

But while Trump's personal corruption was never in doubt -- ask any New York real estate developer if they would take Trump's check -- his moral complicity in human rights atrocities gives him a breadth and stench that remain both puzzling (what does Putin have on him?) and sickening. I am tempted to say he keeps the wrong company, but Aesop, the Bible and school teachers everywhere know better. He's precisely where he belongs.

“Believe in your dream, work towards it, keep the consistency without any thought of giving up. Deafen your ears and blind your eyes to people’s negativity and put God first.”

These we’re the words of serial entrepreneur, Engr. Alabi Samson Ayobami, Founder/CEO, Starwise Group, in a chat with Vanguard.

It is not all the time we see integrity, brilliance, capacity, and performance all in one person at the same time. The example of Starwise Group CEO is compelling.

Amstel Malta awards Samson Itodo “Young Person of the Year” at Future Awards Africa

This is because an extraordinary entrepreneur in the person of Engr Alabi Samson Ayobami has deployed the magnitude of his integrity, brilliance, and capacity in the conceptualization and execution of the company’s mandate in the world of entertainment and other business circles.

Alabi Samson Ayobami (aka. Rubson) from Ogun state, was born and bred in Kaduna state, Northern Nigeria, but currently resides in Canada. He is a graduate of Civil Engineering from Liaoning University, China.

He is a man of many parts, and in his own words, “I love challenges because those are what make me a God-fearing man.” Mr. Alabi is a fast-rising entrepreneur and founder/CEO of Starwise Group. His diversity and work ethic is an inspiration to many. He got an MBA from the University of South Wales, London and is presently pursuing another Masters in Civil Engineering in Canada.

Samson was influenced by the environment around him before bursting into the entertainment business. He was known in his Secondary school, Airforce Military School, Jos, for his affinity for music and comedy shows.

Getting to China in 2013, Samson realized there were a lot of opportunities and platforms for foreigners in China to feel at home through such entertainment events and shows as they often would have had if they were in there various countries. He is a happy person and wants everyone around him to be happy as well.

He found out early enough that entertainment is one of such things that can make people happy. This earned him, Entrepreneur of the Year award by Toosabi Awards and ‘Face of Foreigners in China’ award all in China. Since then, he and his Starwise Group have held different events in Nigeria and China, keeping up the entertainment spirit and making people happy.

He founded Starwise Group in 2013 after realizing his strong knack for entrepreneurship and providing solutions to the problems around him. The company is a strong image of his personality and according to him, his daily affirmation, “strive to succeed”. He lived by those words each day even before turning it into a brand, which birthed his legally recognized Starwise Group company. Mr. Alabi is Starwsie and believes that he is his own inspiration. Of course, it hasn’t been an easy road for him and the company but with each challenge, the company is elevated to the next level.

Timi Frank to INEC, Police: March words with actions on elections’ day

Turning his vision into reality wasn’t so much of a challenge. He saw it as the beginning of a new chapter that somehow had already been written; in his words, “all that was left was for me to start acting my part”. He persevered through many challenges while setting up Starwise Group but through extra work, effort, consistency and personal inspiration, Mr. Alabi was able to break through and become successful.

“managing hard work and lifestyle isn’t much of a challenge because hard work is my lifestyle”.

There is no doubt that Samson has a restless mind. He is also enamored of adventurism in the quest for innate and profound self-fulfillment. That would explain why he was awarded the Best Treasurer Award by the Association of Nigerian Students in China (ANSIC). Working in harmony with the members of the Starwise team, Samson is strategically poised to deliver wonderful concerts, shows, and events. Starwise has leading its leadership infrastructure, a brilliant, honest and capacitated man who can break the glass ceiling and whose limit is the sky.","Meet Alabi Samson, Founder/CEO Starwise Group",Vanguardngr.com,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/02/meet-alabi-samson-founder-ceo-starwise-group/

US broadcaster Univision says its team was briefly detained in the Venezuelan presidential palace where they had been interviewing President Nicolás Maduro.

The incident happened after award-winning journalist Jorge Ramos showed Mr Maduro images of Venezuelans eating from a bin lorry, the network says.

Their equipment was confiscated.

Venezuela's Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez said the government had welcomed hundreds of journalists but it did not support ""cheap shows"".

The team was deported on Tuesday.

Univision, the leading Spanish-language TV network in the US, said the six-member crew had been released after almost three hours but that their recording and personal belongings had not been returned.

Speaking on Univision, Mr Ramos said Mr Maduro ""had not liked"" some of the questions about ""the lack of democracy in Venezuela, torture, political prisoners and the humanitarian crisis"".

""He got up after I showed him videos of young people eating out of a bin lorry,"" he said of the interview at the Miraflores palace in the capital, Caracas.

""What I told Nicolás Maduro is that millions of Venezuelans and many governments around the world don't consider him a legitimate president but a dictator.""

During their detention, Mr Ramos and Univision Vice President María Martínez were kept for ""a few minutes"" in a separate room where the lights were turned off, the broadcaster said.

Mr Ramos, a veteran Mexican-born American journalist, is known for his confrontational style of questioning. In 2015, he was thrown out of a news conference of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Natalie Southwick, Central and South America programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: ""By shutting down an interview and censoring one of Latin America's most high-profile reporters, Nicolás Maduro has demonstrated his fundamental disregard for the press.""

Last month, several local and foreign journalists were briefly detained while working in Caracas. Some ended up being deported.

On Twitter, Mr Rodríguez added: ""Hundreds of journalists have come through Miraflores who have received decent treatment that we always give to those who do journalistic work.""

Earlier, a group of Latin American countries and Canada said Mr Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Meeting in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, the Lima group urged the International Criminal Court to consider whether Venezuela was guilty of crimes against humanity for refusing to allow aid into the country.

At least two people died in Saturday's clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro that blocked the entrance of foreign aid organised by opposition leader and self-declared interim President Juan Guaidó.

Mr Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup.

Between 2001 and 2011 the Canadian construction and engineering company SNC-Lavalin bribed officials in Libya with tens of millions to get contracts in that country. …,"The Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is finished. A long simmering scandal did him in.

Between 2001 and 2011 the Canadian construction and engineering company SNC-Lavalin bribed officials in Libya with tens of millions to get contracts in that country. In 2015 the company was charged by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. It tried to avoid a trial and argued instead for a negotiated settlement since it had cleaned shop by changing its chief executive officer.

In 2016, SNC-Lavalin admitted that some former executives had illegally arranged donations of more than C$80,000 to Trudeau’s Liberal Party from 2004 to 2011.

The company had revenues of some C$10 billion in 2018. Some 9,000 of its 52,000 employees work in Canada. The headquarter and 3,400 of its employees are in the province of Quebec where the Liberals need to pick up votes in October’s federal election to keep their majority.

It was the task of the Justice Minister and Attorney General, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to decide if the case should go on trial as the law demands, or if it could be settled out of court. A trial would likely end with SNC-Lavalin banned from all public contracts in Canada for 10 years. It would cost jobs and votes. Ship of Fools: How a S... Tucker Carlson Best Price: $3.73 Buy New $6.63 (as of 04:50 EDT - Details)

The company lobbied the Liberal government which brought in a remediation agreement regime in 2018 as part of a massive budget bill.

During the fall of 2018 Trudeau and his allies tried to press the attorney general, a Canadian aboriginal, to overturn the decision of the director of public prosecutions, to apply the new law and to thereby drop the criminal charges against SNC. She would not do that. In January Trudeau fired her from the justice minister and attorney general job and gave her a minor position as veteran’s minister. Under solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences Wilson-Raybould could not speak out about the issue.

On February 7 the scandal leaked from anonymous sources. Five days later Wilson-Raybould resigned as veterans minister. She hired a retired Supreme Court judge as her lawyer, to advise her on what she could say. On February 18 Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s friend and principle secretary, was made the fall guy. He resigned even while he denied that he tried to influence the attorney general. Under pressure, the House of Commons Justice Committee invited Wilson-Raybould to testify. Trudeau had to wave some privilege which allowed her to finally speak out about her time as attorney general.

Yesterday Wilson-Raybould testified.

From her long opening statement:

For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of.

Wilson-Raybould gave all the details: who, when, where and how. There is a paper trail. She made detailed notes of everything that happened.

Pressuring the AG to drop charges can be a offense under Canada’s criminal code (pdf), section 139(2):

Every one who wilfully attempts in any manner other than a manner. described in subsection (1) to obstruct,pervert or defeat the course of justice is guilty of an in-dictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.

Peter Schweizer Best Price: $7.97 Buy New $14.50 (as of 12:25 EDT - Details) During her testimony Wilson-Raybould noted that she was not yet allowed to speak out about what happened after she was fired as attorney general. There is likely more to come from her. She says that she believes that no law was broken but that Trudeau behaved inappropriately. A jury and court may see that differently.

Trudeau responded in a news conference that he “completely disagreed” with Wilson-Raybould’s version of events. He claimed that neither he nor his staff had done anything wrong. The issue is under investigation of the independent ethics commissioner and Trudeau hopes that he will be found not guilty of any wrongdoing.

Even if he did not break any law Trudeau will be unable to escape the storm he is now under. With the case pending it will be difficult for the Liberals to win the October elections. It would be best for the party if Trudeau would step down and let someone else take the lead.

There is potential candidate with more credibility than the former media darling Justin Trudeau ever had.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. We have some great results to report and some equally exciting updates on our business strategies. Since our board approved a $1 billion share repurchase authorization last August, the largest in our company's history, we've used approximately $320 million to buy back 11 million shares or 11% of the total shares outstanding, generating $0.63 of annualized free cash flow per share. At a 5x average free cash flow multiple, that represents approximately $300 million of equity value created.

As you know, local news is one of our most valuable assets and an area that we have made significant investments in over the years, including additional news hours, 24/7 content centers, townhalls and deeper investigative reporting. We continue to be an industry leader with our cutting edge drone journalism, and are proud to announce that our drone program just flew it's 10,000th flight. Through our drone journalism across the country, we've been able to provide our viewers with a unique visual perspective on significant local stories.

The return on our news investments is evident in the almost 350 awards received this past year and in our 2018 political revenue results. Not only did we generate a company record $255 million of political revenues, but we grew our share of the total ad dollar spent.

As we think about the strength of 2018's mid-term elections and a number of candidates already announcing their candidacy for President, we believe the 2020 presidential cycle will result in yet another record breaking political year for us.

While we continue to strengthen our local news offerings, we also have been focused on local sports, entering into a joint venture with the Chicago Cubs and bringing together one of America's most iconic sports franchises with our company's expertise in production, distribution and local sales.

Marquee Sports Network, as the newly created regional sports network will be called, launches in the first quarter of 2020 and represents a new level of premium content for which we can use the many strengths of our organization cultivated over decades of operating broadcast stations.

On the ATSC 3.0 technology front, we had many exciting announcements at CES, along with our partner Saankhya Labs, we showcased the first 3.0 mobile chipset which Samsung Foundry will begin producing in volume this year. What's even more exciting is that this ATSC 3.0 chip is designed for all the mainstream global TV standards, making it a global SKU for OEMs. Meanwhile, we signed a joint venture agreement to work with SK Telecom on the technologies needed for the convergence of next-gen television and 5G wireless. We also announced an MOU with SK Telecom and Harman, world leaders in automotive and infotainment systems, to co-develop an advanced automotive platform based on the ATSC 3.0 broadcast standard.

The new platform will use terrestrial broadcast facilities to allow drivers to experience various in-vehicle services, such as HD terrestrial video broadcast, TV broadcasting, 3D maps, software updates, and vehicle-to-everything certificate management.

Finally, we and Spectrum Co. are in the process of finalizing deployment plans for ATSC 3.0 in 20 to 30 of our markets in 2019. I know many of you are awaiting an update on the status of some of our network affiliation and MVPD agreements. We are pleased to report that we have renewed NBC affiliations in 13 markets and successfully negotiated 26 FOX affiliations, as well as our retransmission renewal of Mediacom. We are reconfirming our guidance for net distribution revenues to be up low teens percents this year and in 2020.

Before I turn it over to Lucy, I think it's important to give you some color around the many initiatives that we are working on, because you'll see those expenses running through our 2019 outlook, and we want to make sure you understand the value proposition. Our initiatives can be broken down into content, distribution and marketing services. On the distribution side, an important company focuses your continued investment in ATSC 3.0, which we believe will transform our industry through added capacity in an over-the-air and 5G hybrid environment. Addressability, interactivity and mobility of our signal. Our content initiative is centered around controlling more of our rights in establishing brands to monetize the content on multiple platforms.

Included here are investments in our emerging networks of Comet, Charge! TBD and Stadium and our newly launched direct-to-consumer offering STIRR. We are also making investments in Tennis Channel securing long-term rights for the WTA and ATP. Tennis Channel will also launch an international consumer offering, which we are targeting for launch later this year. Furthermore, our newly announced RSN with the Cubs which will go live in 2020 will have some minor CapEx and start-up costs this year.

On the marketing side, our media network sales group is making further strides into the $50 billion pool of advertising dollars allocated to cable networks. We continue to launch new digital products, such as Compulse OTT and have several sales initiatives around technology and automation and transforming our sales force from generalists to dedicated category specialists.

At the same time, we are constantly reviewing our initiatives. This quarter, we've launched a cost-cutting program, under which we expect to achieve $20 million in annualized cost savings by ramping down non-performing initiatives and implementing other operating efficiencies.

Our initiatives are bending the curve on advertising growth and helping replace what is lost from fragmentation. We believe that by diversifying our offerings and revenue mix and by being broadly distributed with unique and defensible content, we can create long-term value for our shareholders.

As I mentioned, you'll see these strategic expenses in our 2019 guidance. Absent these initiatives and step-ups and reverse retrans and pro forma for our cost-cutting program, our media expenses are estimated to increase less than 1% for the year.

Now Lucy will take you through the fourth quarter results.

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Chris. Continuing with the positive news, I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our fourth quarter media revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow guidance.

Media revenues for the fourth quarter were $849 million, an increase of 22.5% or $156 million higher than fourth quarter 2017 and exceeding our guidance. For the year, we achieved record-setting media revenues of $2,919 million. Included in our fourth quarter media revenues was $334 million of distribution revenue, an 11% increase over the prior year period. For the year, distribution revenues were $1,299 million, and as guided, we achieved pro forma net retrans growth of low-single-digit percent for the year.

Political revenues in the fourth quarter were a record-setting $150 million versus $16 million in the fourth quarter of last year, a non-election year, and higher than the top-end of our guidance range. Media operating expenses in the fourth quarter, defined as media production and media SG&A expenses, were $475 million, up from the fourth quarter last year on higher reverse retrans fees, the growth initiatives, and compensation and sales commissions on a higher revenue. Our reported media expenses were $11 million unfavorable to our previous guidance, but that was primarily due to exceeding our revenue projections.

Corporate overhead in the quarter was $22 million. Non-media EBITDA was approximately $7 million in the quarter, $13 million better than our prior guidance on higher sales at our antenna company, Dielectric, and timing of ONE Media and R&D expenses that will roll into 2019.

EBITDA in the fourth quarter adjusted for $3 million of legal, regulatory and other nonrecurring costs, was $340 million, up $108 million and exceeding guidance. Net interest expense for the quarter was $49 million and our weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.5%. Equity method and other investments for the quarter were a net expense of $17 million, primarily related to our sustainability initiatives.

Diluted earnings per share on $98 million weighted average common shares was $2.10 in the quarter or $2.13 per share, excluding $0.03 of onetime and nonrecurring costs. Recall, that in 2017 in addition to $24 million of tax reform, bonuses, legal, regulatory and other non-recurring costs we also had $225 million gain related to vacating spectrum in two markets, as well as a non-recurring benefit of $272 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in corporate federal income tax rate.

Excluding these onetime in non-recurring items, the prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share would've been $0.50, as compared to an adjusted $2.13 in the fourth quarter of 2018.

As Chris mentioned, we continue to buy our shares back, repurchasing 6.1 million shares in the fourth quarter. Excluding the $3 million of legal regulatory and other non-recurring costs, we generated $268 million of free cash flow in the quarter and exceeded guidance on the EBITDA beat. $175 million of the free cash flow went to share repurchases, $12 million to debt pay-down, and $19 million to dividend distributions, the dividend rate, which we increased 11% in the fourth quarter.

For the year, free cash flow was a record-setting $730 million. Combined 2017-2018 pro forma cash flow was $1,173 million, beating guidance and representing free cash flow per share of $5.98 on 98 million shares. For 2018-2019, we are raising the low end of our guidance for a new range of $1,150 million to $1,220 million or $6.18 to $6.56 of free cash flow per share on 93 million shares. We are introducing 2019-2020 free cash flow guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion or $6.45 to $6.99 of free cash flow per share on 93 million shares.

Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $27 million, including $9 million for the repack. For full year 2018, non-repack CapEx was $74 million below our guidance of $81 million, with the difference rolling into 2019. In addition, repack CapEx was $31 million for the full year of 2018, compared to our expectation of $37 million also on timing.

For 2019, we expect non-repack CapEx to be $110 million to $120 million, including timing of the 2018 projects, as well as deploying ATSC 3.0 in 20 to 30 markets. Repack CapEx in 2019 is expected to be $140 million, which is expected to be reimbursed by the government.

Cash programming payments during the fourth quarter were $25 million and for the year were $108 million, in line with our prior guidance. We're expecting 2019 film (ph) payments to decline to $95 million.

Net cash taxes paid in the fourth quarter were $11 million, with $10 million related to spectrum sales and therefore not deducted from free cash flow purposes. For 2019 we are estimating cash taxes to be approximately $29 million, with the majority of that relating to the 2018 extension payment. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be 9% for the year.

At December 31, total debt to a $3,892 million, including $21 million of non guaranteed and VIE debt. Cash at December 31st was approximately $1,060 million. In addition, we had $485 million available on our revolver, bringing total liquidity to over $1.5 billion.

Total net leverage through the holding company at quarter end was 3.21x on a trailing eight quarter basis, excluding the VIE non-guaranteed debt and net of cash. The first lien indebtedness ratio on a trailing eight quarters was 1.17x on a covenant of 4.45x. I know I've said this every quarter this past year, but this is now our strongest balance sheet in our company history, and that's even after having repurchased 8% of our total equity in 2018.

As mentioned, we did repurchase 6.1 million shares of that in the fourth quarter and another 3.4 million shares in the first quarter of 2019, representing 11% of total equity repurchased since August 2018. We currently have approximately $767 million remaining on our share authorization.

Now Steve Marks will take you through our operating performance.

Steven M. Marks -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Lucy and good morning everybody. We ended 2018 on a very positive note with the strongest midterm political year in the company's history. We beat both our political and core advertising guidance in the quarter. In fact, despite the political crowd-out effect, the back half of 2018 outperformed better than the first half and the fourth quarter was the strongest of all quarters, with the core advertising down just over 3%.

Political ad revenue in the fourth quarter was $150 million versus $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2 million better than our guidance. For the year, we did over $0.25 billion in midterm political advertising. To put this in perspective, 2018's $255 million just missed beating 2012's $266 million of pro forma Presidential Year dollars and crushed both 2016's $206 million and 2014's $155 million pro forma results. With more than a dozen candidates already campaigning for 2020, we believe there are strong indications that the coming presidential year will be extremely robust and our biggest year ever. Our digital business continues to perform very well with revenues growing 22% in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year. Our Compulse OTT product has been a hit, and one of our fastest-growing digital verticals.

Turning to our outlook for first quarter, we are expecting media revenues to be approximately $667 million to $673 million, up 4% to 5% as compared to first quarter 2018. This assumes $2 million of political revenues versus $7 million last year, and includes $344 million to $347 million in distribution fees versus $314 million last year.

Core advertising revenues in the first quarter, excluding political, are expected to be flattish versus the same period last year. On the expense side, we are forecasting media expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $476 million to $478 million. Pro forma for the cost-cutting program were $482 million to $484 million on a as-reported basis. The majority of the increase versus the first quarter of 2018 is due to reverse retrans and the growth initiatives and added Tennis rights that Chris talked about.

For the year, media expenses are expected to be $1,964 million to $1,967 million. Pro forma for the cost-cutting program were $1,970 million to $1,973 million on a as-reported basis. The year-to-year increase is due primarily to reverse retrans renewals and escalators, and our growth initiatives and rights fees.

These revenue-generating initiatives, including STIRR, launched last month upgrades the content on our multicast channels of Comet and Charge! and TBD, expanding our (ph) digital and content labs to do proof-of-concepts on future content and digital offerings.

Tennis Channel's long-term rights to the WTA and ATP, as well as plans to roll out an international direct-to-consumer tennis product later this year, sales transformation, investments in news and marquee start-up costs. Excluding reverse, the growth initial investments in tennis rights, media expenses are forecasted to increase by less than 1% in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter is expected to be approximately $152 million to $157 million. Pro forma for the cost-cutting program were $146 million to $151 million on an as-reported basis. As a reminder, net retrans for the year is expected to grow low-teen percents.

For the quarter -- for the first quarter, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be $77 million to $82 million pro forma for the cost-cutting program, with $71 million to $76 million on an as-reported basis. As Lucy mentioned, 2018-2019 average free cash flow per share is estimated at $6.37 and for 2019-2020 $6.72 per share.

I know we've provided a lot of numbers to you this morning. So before turning it over to questions, I want to highlight some of the key takeaways.

One, core advertising continued to improve throughout 2018 and we expect it to be up for 2019. Net retrans is expected to grow low-teen percents in each of 2019 and in 2020. The company is undertaking an annualized $20 million cost-cutting program. Free cash flow per share is expected to grow for 2018-2019 and again for 2019-2020. Our credit profile is at (technical difficulty), and our initiatives are bending the advertising growth curve.

And with that I would like to open it up to questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

(Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Aaron Watts with Deutsche Bank.

Aaron Watts -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Hey everyone. Thanks for all the details. I am going to start with a question on core. It sounds like you're seeing kind of a flattish environment in the first quarter. Can you talk about a little bit what you're seeing on the local side versus national? Maybe touch on the auto category as well? And then what gives you confidence you see an improving trajectory, as you move through the year?

Steven M. Marks -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

I want to take you through fourth quarter beginning in November, because it tells a great story ending the year. We were just a pinch shy off flat in November and remember there is -- first week of November, there is political advertising. In December, we were up in core and we were up impressively in December. And when you take a look at the automotive category in 2018, which was clearly down, and fourth quarter, hard to pinpoint because of the crowd-out figure, we did huge money in political in fourth quarter. We're also very encouraged right now in the first quarter with that flattish figure, as automotive continues to be slightly down for us, and I don't think you're going to hear that from most of the calls that you'd be doing after us.

We're doing actually quite well in auto and we believe auto, for 2019, will be in the plus category for us, as will core. So when you take a look at the last two months of 2018, and you take a look at the momentum that we have going into 2019, we're really encouraged with this report. We believe core will be up in 2019. We believe oil will be up in 2019. So again, not sure how much you're going to hear that from others, but that's how we feel right now about our business.

David Smith -- Chairman Of The Board

And as Chris mentioned going from generalist to specialist, we've made a concerted effort to hire folks that are selling to the auto groups to come from the auto industry, especially for tier-3 in our local markets, and that's part of our transformation again, trailing down from generalist to specialist.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I also want to mention one thing, in addition to the automotive category, we should take a look at the services category, and how it has been really robust. For us its the second biggest billing category we have, and there was a ton of money. And it was up in the fourth quarter and it is up really big in first quarter and driving our numbers. So the goods and services category for us is on a low and a very impressive low.

Aaron Watts -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Okay. That's really helpful. Are you seeing any kind of bifurcation between local and national? Or are both trending relatively -- kind of evenly within the context of the guidance you gave?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

They are both trending relatively evenly. Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, has moved to a new agency along with Chevy, and we expect to see quality results from the moves to these new agencies.

Aaron Watts -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

All right great. And maybe one more if I can. For Chris, bigger picture; as you look at the M&A pipeline and opportunities that may be ahead of you for this year, maybe you can just talk about what's in focus for Sinclair on both the station side? I don't know if you can comment on the latest on the regional sports networks or other opportunities you see maybe being out there for the company? Obviously you're sitting on a large cash balance and your leverage is -- as Lucy pointed out, historically low.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing Aaron. So we have participated in the last couple of processes around the TV broadcast side and they both -- net of going for multiples that were well above our price thresholds to other buyers. And so it's certainly nice to see a very robust M&A market for TV broadcast. I think that's going to have a knock-on effect here for the public players, since the private market is very robust, very high multiples being traded out.

And we'll continue to be active looking at future opportunities as they come up. We're just very disciplined right now on our multiples and what we're willing to play, and it just appears that others are willing to stretch more than us on the TV broadcast side.

On the RSN side we are ecstatic about our announcement with the Cubs. We obviously have -- well not obviously, but there has been reports about us having other opportunities in this space. I can't comment specifically on those reports, due to non-disclosure agreements we've signed. But there is a very unique moment in time here in the RSN space that we really like our positioning on.

At the end of the day, these RSNs represent the most watched programs on TV, and they're really super premium content with true scarcity value. You can't create more sports. You can create almost anything more of any other genre, including entertainment programming, as we've seen with the explosion of peak TV on the entertainment side and you can certainly create more news, though it has held up better in terms of scarcity value than entertainment. But the real -- most scarcest content at the end of the day is sports, and it's showing in the ratings. Sports overall has grown in ratings over the last eight years in linear television, and really the only thing that's even close to that is news, in terms of the strength. Everything else has suffered under fragmentation and increased supply.

So we think RSNs are highly complementary. They fit well with what we do on the broadcast side. They play on our strengths on distribution, production and ad sales, and as I said, we're ecstatic with what we've done with the Cubs and that's going to be a great addition for us, and we'll of course be very disciplined on value and look forward to seeing what opportunities may come our way.

Aaron Watts -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Great. Thank you very much.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Aaron.

We'll go next to Steven Cahall of Royal Bank of Canada.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Yeah, thank you. Maybe first if we could just drill down a little bit on your commentary around auto. So I think it's really interesting that you think it'll be up in 2019. I think a lot of forecasters are expecting deliveries to be down. So maybe if you could give us just a little bit more color on what's driving your commentary there? And then I have got a follow up on your share count outlook.

Steven M. Marks -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

I think we got a secret sauce on the automotive category. We've been out hiring people from the space. As our business changes, we have to change with the business. And we are essentially a technology company. We're out there tackling the technology and tackling the technology as it pertains to this category, and we're out hiring people that know the category, and we're hiring them and we're having these people call on the automotive business, and we're seeing the results of it. So it's a different strategy. Instead of hiring people that sell spots, we're hiring people that sell cars, and we're speaking the language better today than we've ever spoken the language, and we're bearing the results.

David Smith -- Chairman Of The Board

So to put it a little succinctly is, we're dealing directly at the tier-3 level, as well as the advertising agency. So we're saturating this category horizontally and vertically.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for that. On the buyback just taking the guidance that you gave for 2019-2020 share count and doing some back of the envelope math, I'm getting to maybe 9%, 10% reduction in the share count. You did a big buyback in Q4. It seems like you have the capacity to go a lot higher than that. I know it's kind of dependent on what comes out on the M&A market. But until we hear something on M&A, how should we think about just really framing what you're going to look to do in the share repurchase market in the near-term? Thank you.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So we have -- since we announced the $1 billion buyback, we've almost done one-third of that in terms of total dollars and we've done so at an average price of around $29. So we're very happy with the results so far. We really took advantage of the weakness in Q1 to buy a lot of shares at a very attractive price. And so going forward, we're going to run it pretty similarly, in terms of looking to have an algorithm or the lower the share price goes the more gets bought. And we of course balance that as we always do with what's in the M&A pipeline. But as Lucy said, we have an incredibly strong balance sheet right now, so we have great flexibility.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

We will move next Dan Kurnos of Benchmark Company.

Daniel Kurnos -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst

Great, thanks. Maybe a little surprised you guys got FOX done so quickly. There was a lot of noise in the market. I don't know if you guys can share how that went, but it sounds like it was maybe smoother than it's been in the past. I don't know if they were asking for day parts or anything else since you guys already reaffirmed your net retrans trends. So any color there would be helpful. And then Chris, just kind of high level, obviously we talked about yesterday to a degree you guys had a lot of big announcements early this year on 3.0. You talked about getting 20 to 30 markets, but how much incremental beyond that are you investing toward monetization? How should we think about timing and timing -- potential timing around monetization, understanding that there's still a long way to go there?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So on FOX, I think maybe there was some noise, but the reality is, we had -- the stations that were renewed, we had effectively negotiated a market rate for only a year prior, or actually even less than a year prior. So they just came up again by virtue of Tribune not closing. So it was a relatively easy renewal, because we were already essentially at market via the previous agreement. So I think it's just sort of people speculating. And as we've always said, we go through this all the time with the networks, and the closer you are to market at the time of renewal, then the easier the discussion. The further away you are, then the harder the discussion. So that's why it got done relatively easily.

And I'm not sure what your comment is on day parts as it relates to the FOX, but nothing changed in terms of our standard deal that we have with them, in terms of what they supply. On 3.0 we had a big CES this year. Saankhya Labs debuted the first mobile chip, which as I mentioned in my comments is a global SKU. We had great meetings with potential OEMs to integrate that shift into a plethora of different products, and so that was very well received. We signed our joint venture with SK Telecom, which will start in earnest this year and start taking technology out of the Korean marketplace and commercializing it here in the U.S. market, which will create the network intelligence which is needed for this industry to operate as one network, as a wireless telecom company would operate. And SK is best-in-class in the world so we're just ecstatic to be officially partnered with them.

And then we also did an MOU with SK and Harman. And if you know anything about Harman, they are basically -- you drive a car, you probably are a Harman customer, and have their speakers and infotainment system in that car. And that's just an MOU at this point. We'll turn that -- we'll do some work and get that into a joint venture, so we can actually get going on an advanced automotive platform with those partners.

So the investment side of all this is not that significant. Of course it does show up in some of our spending this year. But overall, it's not a huge needle mover at this point. Mostly timing effort.

Daniel Kurnos -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst

Thanks.

We will go next to Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.

David Karnovsky -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Hi, this is David Karnovsky on for Alexia. Just on the Marquee Sports Center, I know, tennis doesn't start till 2020, but can you talk at a high level your financial expectations for the JV and how this will get accounted for at Sinclair? And then, what's sort of the potential to create more partnerships like this with other sports teams?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So it will start in 2020 and on an annualized basis, we expect it to contribute about $40 million to $50 million of free cash flow, and it is a model for other partnerships going forward. That's definitely high on our mind, in terms of how we can create additional value. We love partnering directly with the teams and getting alignment of interest there, and in many regards, we're just -- we are a perfect match for any team who wants to do this, and so we'll certainly be looking for other opportunities and there will be some coming up in the years to come. They tend to come up as the contracts expire with the existing distributors. So it's something we're definitely keeping track of and looking forward to.

David Karnovsky -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Okay. And then just at a larger and potentially earlier Democratic primary, how are you thinking about what the political contribution in 2019 might be, relative to past odd years? And then for 2020, please walk us through the various deals, President, Senate, etcetera, that gives you confidence this could be your big year for political? Thanks.

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I'll take the first one. Let me just give you the 2015 and 2017 -- 2015-2017 pro forma numbers. We did about-- a range of about $26 million to $32 million in both of those years, so we would expect that we should at least hit those numbers this year. Now just remember, because the Primaries don't start until the first quarter of 2020, any of that money is really going to be backloaded primarily into the fourth quarter.

Steven M. Marks -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

I will tell you, we like our chances on the political dollars. All you got to do is take a look at what goes on everyday, and to become -- the best TV show on the planet is watching politics. Every other day there's somebody joining the race. It really bodes well for local broadcasters. It's going to be quite a robust, I believe, fourth quarter in spending. And I think 2020, we're not going to be able to get out of the way of the money. It's going to be literally hand over fist. But hard to put a dollar figure on it, but it's going to be enormous.

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So let me frame 2020 for you. If you compare our biggest presidential year, which was 2012 pro forma, we did $266 million that year. So we do expect to beat our biggest presidential year. And remember, there's a lot of big national issues that are out there. We've got a lot of people running already for the Democratic side a year in advance of the first Primary. And then remember, we are in all the key swing states in a big way, as well as we're in a lot of the state capitals.

David Smith -- Chairman Of The Board

It also speaks to our investment in our niche products and the 350 awards that Chris mentioned in the beginning of the call. So we're able to capitalize on those investments into our news hours.

David Karnovsky -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

We'll go next to David Joyce at Evercore.

David Joyce -- Evercore Group LLC -- Analyst

If you could just provide some more color on the advanced advertising initiatives, where are you in the industry on the TIP initiative at this point? And are you going to continue working with the other station partners in the 3.0 rollout in those 20 to 30 markets? Is that part of the agreement for the consortium you're with? And are you using some partners for advertising and for testing as well? Thank you.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So on the TIP initiative, we founded that along with Nexstar and Tribune, it's really going great. We've picked up a lot of momentum. Other broadcasters have joined most recently, NBC, U (ph) and Telemundo joined. And also, we launched the first APIs between broadcasters and vendors for log times and several key vendors implemented those APIs. So the real promise here, is to be able to take the friction out of the system. We've been suffering under a structural problem in this industry, where it just -- the labor cost to buy our stations is way too high and TIP is aimed squarely at that. And it has that objective and it also has the objective of making sure that this is an open system, and we don't have to create a gatekeeper that essentially could charge outsized rents on the industry because that could also be an issue.

So we're very pleased with TIP. We're pleased with how it's grown from the start from three broadcasters to most of the industry at this point to the vendor participation and the progress we're making in terms of getting the APIs implemented.

On 3.0 we are -- we have an initial number of markets, as we mentioned 20 to 30, which have -- we have reached out to other broadcasters or rather Spectrum Co has done that to include as many as possible in those markets to transition, because the more the merrier in terms of doing a transition. Those are -- from a cooperation standpoint are pretty much ready to go. There is some delay coming out of the FCC around just getting the documents if you can believe that, to be able to file properly and move this forward. The FCC, I think will have those ready in Q2, which hopefully that will happen and then we can actually hit our target of rolling those markets out in 2019.

We move next to Zack Silver with B. Riley FBR.

Zack Silver -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. First on the Cubs side JV, just what's different about Marquee versus something like, I guess now, Charter, Sportsnet L.A. which had I think similar publicized trouble getting distribution deals done out of the gate? And then related to that, did you say that you guys are going to consolidate the JV?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I think it is going to end up being consolidated. The number I gave you before the $40 million to $50 million really is sort of a net benefit to us. But it will end up being consolidated, which will make the financials a little bit more complicated. But I want to just -- to give you folks the net benefit to us. And then in terms of comparing and contrasting to Sportsnet L.A., there's really I think three main points that I would highlight there. One is that, there was a very-very high sub-fee ask associated with Sportsnet L.A. that was essentially needed to make the financing work for the purchase of the Dodgers. So it was sort of a leveraged play. We don't have that situation here. We're not buying a team. We are not -- we don't have a huge ask on the table.

And then also the Cubs fan base is incredibly strong. Chicago, is a Cubs town. When you take a look at where they live right now, which is on a multisport RSN, they comprise well over half of the total ratings of that RSN, even though that RSN has four teams in total. So it just gives you an idea of the strength of the Cubs. And then furthermore, the fan base is not as diffused as it is in L.A. for the Dodgers. L.A. is a little bit more of a transient city. And then last but not least, there was no partner involved in L.A. Sportsnet with good distribution relationships. So that -- those are the three things I would highlight as to why this will be different.

Zack Silver -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst

Got it. That's really helpful. And then just one follow-up if I could, sports related I guess. The sports betting category, I think some of your stations are in states where that is now legal. Do you guys -- is that baked into your guidance for core being up this year? And when might we see that becoming a more meaningful part of core advertising?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So it's not baked into our guidance at all. We haven't seen significant dollars -- we already do get dollars from casinos and the like, and it's not a huge category for us, but we do expect that categories to start to grow meaningfully. It just -- it hasn't really lined up on our portfolio yet. The estimates for the industry is, this is going to be an additional $1.5 billion to $2 billion category, which is a huge category for us in addition to what we already get from casinos. It is going to be a cave-by-cave or state-by-state, and the industry is not backing up the truck right now on advertising and just sort of slowly waiting their way in, but we do expect it to be a significant category, as this industry develops.

Zack Silver -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you very much.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Thank you. I am a very lonely White Sox fan, born and bred.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

That's fine. We won't hold anything against you, Marci.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Thank you. So I just want to confirm the FOX deal. That includes the incremental NFL Thursday night, right? You're not paying a separate fee to them for that?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, that's all included.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Okay. And then, it sounds like embedded in your full year free cash flow guide, I know there's a lot of missing pieces that we sort of still need to go up to the revenue line. But from what Steve remarked, it sounds like you expect the core to be up and that's embedded in your guide. Or is the range assuming that it may be down slightly to up slightly?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So in the free cash flow guide for the full year, it assumes that -- in that full range, that the core is up for the year.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Okay, OK. And then Q4 distribution revenue, it came in I think a little bit lower than your guide. Was that a true-up? Or is there something going on with the subs or can you just give a little bit of color?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Marci, there's a few things going on in that number, none of which by themselves are significant in any way. But we had -- there was one MVPD that had promotional discounts roll-off, and that caused their subs to decline, which then in turn causes everybody's subs to decline. There was another MVPD of that had multiple blackouts with other companies and again, as they lost subs, everybody loses them. And so then what happens is, because there is a lag on the reporting of all the sub numbers from these MVPDs, we haven't quite seen where those sub losses -- where they've migrated to and landed. We expect that we will have more intel, as the fourth quarter reports start coming in.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Got it. And then can you remind us what percent of revenue and EBITDA may be attributable to your SLAs?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So we have -- that information is all disclosed in the 10-K, the various financial points of the income statement. And we'll have the 10-K out March 1st.

We'll go next to Kyle Evans with Stephens.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Hi, thanks. A little follow-up on the distribution from 4Q. Could you give sub count for the quarter, 2018, and kind of what's built into your assumption for the guide?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So the sub count, I'll give you off-line. I don't have that here in front of me. But I think what you're trying to get to is really, what did we see in sub count change. So for the year, we saw sub counts decline low single-digit and a lot of that was due to the fourth quarter for the reasons that I just talked about, with the couple of the MVPDs, with the blackouts that they had, with others and promotional discounts roll-offs.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. Will do that offline. On the 2012-2016 numbers that you were talking about for political, how much did presidential ad spend account for as a percent of total in 2012 and 2016?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

That one, we're going to probably have to take offline. That one I don't have it here with me. But we do have it though.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. And then lastly, and I know you probably won't answer this one, but I was wondering if you guys would care to put some size brackets or growth brackets around the Compulse product? Thank you.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We're not going to disclose specifics around products. But it has been our fastest-growing digital vertical. So we are -- the targeted advertising space that will be a core part of ATSC 3.0 and STIRR and a number of our other digital initiatives is proving to be a quite robust market at very high CPM. So I think is the punchline for us. But we're not -- for competitive reasons, not going to disclose the specific number.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you.

We'll go next to Clay Griffin at Deutsche Bank.

Clay Griffin -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Hey guys, good morning. Just a quick one. I just noticed the $140 million of repack CapEx for the year. I'm just curious though, your total CapEx guide, what is -- is there an amount above and beyond the $140 million that's embedded in your full year, that's related to ATSC 3.0? And I guess the question being, as you look out after this transition, what does the outlook look like in terms of capital intensity for the core broadcast business? Thanks.

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So embedded in the non-repack CapEx for 2019, there's about $10 million to $15 million related to the deployment of 3.0 in the 20 to 30 markets that we spoke about. And as I think about 2020 CapEx guide for the full year, non-repack, I think if you're in that sort of $100 million to $110 million range for non-repack CapEx, that should capture all the various items that we're doing.

Clay Griffin -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Okay, great. And then just, In terms of the $115 million in expenses related to revenue-generating initiatives, do you have a comparable number for full year 2018, or is that all incremental?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Can you repeat that one again?

Clay Griffin -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Right. The $115 million of full year media expense related to revenue-generating initiatives, do you have a comparable figure for full year 2018, just so we can see the growth in kind of those initiatives?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. But just give me a minute. I don't know if you have another question that you want to move on to.

Clay Griffin -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple for me; on the RSNs, I'm not sure what you can say on this, but I know you've talked about potentially using a partner, a financial partner in bidding for those channels. What would you say the probability of that is today versus using your own balance sheet?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Look, I think for lots of different reasons, I'm not going to handicap that for you. But it is certainly a possibility and part of active discussions.

Davis Hebert -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay. And then secondly, I apologize if I missed it. But Lucy, do you have any sort of guidelines of year end net leverage, knowing that M&A could obviously impact that? But just curious if you had any number there?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So net leverage, we would expect to be a little bit lower than where we ended 2018. So it's still with a three handle on it. But a little bit lower.

Davis Hebert -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

And that's net leverage, correct? On a LAQ (ph) basis?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

The United States, Chin…","NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday (Feb 28) there would be some ""reasonably decent news"" on the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan, a day after the two nuclear powers both downed enemy jets and Pakistan captured an Indian pilot.

The pilot, identified by Islamabad as Wing Commander Abhi Nandan, became the human face of the latest flare-up following the release of videos showing him being captured and later held in custody.

""We are willing to return the captured Indian pilot if it leads to de-escalation,"" Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told Geo TV.

Qureshi also said the Saudi foreign minister was expected to visit Pakistan with a special message from Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who visited both Pakistan and India earlier this month.



Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has already called for talks with India to prevent the risk of a ""miscalculation"" between their nuclear-armed militaries.

The Pakistani foreign minister's remarks came shortly after Trump said he expected ""reasonably decent news"" regarding the conflict between India and Pakistan.

The US, China and other world powers have urged restraint from the two nations as tensions escalate following tit-for-tat airstrikes in the wake of a suicide car bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb 14.

Indian and Pakistani troops traded fire along the contested border in Kashmir on Thursday, but speaking at a press conference, Trump said the US had been mediating between the two sides.

""They have been going at it and we have been involved in trying to have them stop,"" Trump said in Hanoi, where he was attending a summit with North Korea's leader.

""We have been in the middle trying to help them both out.""

Earlier on Thursday, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election in a matter of months, told a rally of supporters that India would unite against its enemies.

""The world is observing our collective will. It is necessary that we shouldn't do anything that allows our enemy to raise a finger at us,"" he said, in his first remarks since the downing of planes on Wednesday.

FIRING CONTINUES

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India's parliament.

Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute. Thai Airways International announced on Thursday that it had cancelled flights to Pakistan and Europe, which left thousands of passengers stranded in Bangkok.

As Trump was speaking, India said that Pakistan had fired mortars into Indian-occuptied territory at around 1pm (0730 GMT).

Troops from India and Pakistan also exchanged fire for over an hour in the Poonch district at 6 a.m., according to a statement from the Indian army.

""The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defence ministry spokesman.

The firing was significantly less elevated than the artillery fire exchanged by the two sides on Wednesday.

Pakistan said the firing began overnight.

""The firing continued in intervals throughout the night. It was moderate,"" said Shaukat Yusufzai, an administration official in the Pakistan-controlled part of Poonch.

One man was hospitalised after being hit by shrapnel, he added.

India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families in Jammu and Kashmir state living close to the border, hoping to keep them safe near their homes rather than evacuate them.

On Wednesday evening India's foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan that it claimed detailed camps of the Paskistan-based militant group that carried out the Feb 14 attack.

With a general election due in India by May, an upsurge in nationalism from any conflict with Pakistan could become a key factor, potentially favoring Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Late on Wednesday B S Yeddyurappa, a BJP leader in the southern state of Karnataka, said India's strike inside Pakistani territory would help the party to win back power in the state - the first such comment from a member of the ruling party.

""This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,"" he told reporters. ""The effect of this will be seen in the elections.""

INTERNATIONAL CONCERN

The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan's leader Khan spoke of ""mending ties"" with India.

The White House urged ""both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to ""prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity"".

Pakistan's envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis.

At the same time, he said the lack of U.S. condemnation of India's strike on Pakistan was ""construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more”.

China, the European Union and other countries also called for restraint. Japan's foreign minister said on Thursday the country was concerned about the ""deteriorating situation"".

The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Qureshi and expressed ""deep concern"", China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, the group that claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack. China is likely to be oppose the move.



FLIGHTS CANCELLED

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan's move, along with all flights to and from the country.

Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.



Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

He’s been somewhat pushed off the stage by Emmanuel Macron in recent years, but following his Liberal Party’s stunning election victory in 2015, he was on top of the world. He’s also made a habit of verbally crossing swords with President Trump from time to time, just to keep his liberal bona fides in proper order. His approval ratings in the Great White North have traditionally been well above water.

That may be coming to an end, however. Canada’s next federal elections are coming up in October of this year and almost all the news for Trudeau has been bad lately. While it hasn’t surfaced on American cable news networks very often, the Prime Minister is in hot water over an emerging corruption scandal that has opponents calling for his resignation. It’s alleged that Trudeau pressured his former Attorney General to drop corruption charges against a major construction company and quietly pursue a settlement agreement instead.

All bets are now off about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s political survival. An ethics scandal has plunged Canada’s government into disarray, with the prime minister himself facing unprecedented political peril. A flood of new details allege Trudeau and several senior government officials repeatedly pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large construction company and reach a settlement agreement. Trudeau’s political opponents sent police a letter Thursday requesting an investigation and called for Trudeau’s resignation. “He can no longer, and in good standing with a clear conscience, lead this nation,” said Conservative Andrew Scheer, who hopes to replace Trudeau.

This may sound like small potatoes compared to the regular cornucopia of scandals we get in the United States, but the details are fairly stunning. When the allegation of interfering with the Attorney General’s office first emerged, Trudeau’s team flatly denied there had been any such involvement. But this week, the former Attorney General in question, Jody Wilson-Raybould, provided testimony and notes from meetings and phone calls detailing the conversations she’d had with the Prime Minister’s staff and even Trudeau himself.

Compounding matters is the fact that the company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major employer in Quebec where Trudeau is a member of Parliament. The AG testified that Trudeau himself had reminded her that there was an election coming up in Quebec and this would look very bad. Wilson-Raybould was then demoted by the PM and replaced by a new official from Trudeau’s home province.

All of this adds up to a story that’s taking much of the bloom off of Trudeau’s rose. The polling was already showing him in a tight race before the AG’s testimony and now it’s shaping up to be even worse. We should also keep in mind that the Canadians haven’t traditionally been shy about swapping out the party in power. Prior to the Liberal Party’s sweeping victory in 2015, the Conservative Party held a solid majority of their own following the 2011 elections under Stephen Harper. And the way things are going, the Conservatives may be on the rise once again.",Justin Trudeaus Days As PM of Canada May Be Numbered,Freerepublic.com,https://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3731473/posts

The post Pakistan set to send IAF pilot Abhinandan Vartaman back to India amid Donald Trump’s claims…,"New Delhi/Islamabad: Pakistan said on Thursday that it was considering returning a captured Indian pilot, as US president Donald Trump said American mediation was helping to defuse a crisis between the two nuclear powers a day after both downed enemy jets.

The pilot, reportedly identified by Islamabad as Wing Commander Abhinandan Vartaman, became the human face of the latest flare-up following the release of videos showing him being captured and later held in custody.

“We are willing to return the captured Indian pilot if it leads to de-escalation,” Qureshi told Geo TV. He also said the Saudi foreign minister was expected to visit Pakistan with a special message from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who visited both Pakistan and India earlier this month.

Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan has already called for talks with India to prevent the risk of a “miscalculation” between their nuclear-armed militaries.

The Pakistani foreign minister’s remarks came shortly after Trump said he expected “reasonably decent news” regarding the conflict between India and Pakistan.

The US, China and other world powers have urged restraint from the two nations as tensions escalate following tit-for-tat airstrikes in the wake of a suicide car bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on 14 February.

Indian and Pakistani troops traded fire along the contested border in Kashmir on Thursday, but speaking at a press conference, Trump said the US had been mediating between the two sides. “They have been going at it and we have been involved in trying to have them stop,” Trump said in Hanoi, where he was attending a summit with North Korea’s leader. “We have been in the middle trying to help them both out.”

Earlier on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a rally of supporters that India would unite against its enemies. “The world is observing our collective will. It is necessary that we shouldn’t do anything that allows our enemy to raise a finger at us,” he said, in his first remarks since the downing of planes on Wednesday.

Firing continues

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India’s parliament.

Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute. Thai Airways International announced on Thursday that it had cancelled flights to Pakistan and Europe, which left thousands of passengers stranded in Bangkok. As Trump was speaking, India said that Pakistan had fired mortars into Indian-occupied territory at around 1 pm.

Troops from India and Pakistan also exchanged fire for over an hour in the Poonch district at 6 am, according to a statement from the Indian army. “The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,” said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defence ministry spokesman.

The firing was significantly less elevated than the artillery fire exchanged by the two sides on Wednesday. Pakistan said the firing began overnight. “The firing continued in intervals throughout the night. It was moderate,” said Shaukat Yusufzai, an administration official in the Pakistan-controlled part of Poonch.

One man was hospitalised after being hit by shrapnel, he added.

India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families in Jammu and Kashmir state living close to the border, hoping to keep them safe near their homes rather than evacuate them.

On Wednesday evening India’s foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan that it claimed detailed camps of the Pakistan-based militant group that carried out the 14 February attack.

With a general election due in India by May, an upsurge in nationalism from any conflict with Pakistan could become a key factor, potentially favouring Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Late on Wednesday, Karnataka BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa, said India’s strike inside Pakistani territory would help the party to win back power in the state — the first such comment from a member of the ruling party. “This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,” he told reporters. “The effect of this will be seen in the elections.”

International concern

The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan’s leader Khan spoke of “mending ties” with India.

The White House urged “both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to “prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity”.

Pakistan’s envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis. At the same time, he said the lack of US condemnation of India’s strike on Pakistan was “construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more”.

China, the European Union and other countries also called for restraint. Japan’s foreign minister said on Thursday the country was concerned about the “deteriorating situation”.

The Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and expressed “deep concern”, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, the group that claimed responsibility for the 14 February attack. China is likely to oppose the move.

Flights cancelled

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan’s move, along with all flights to and from the country. Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.

Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

Flights from West Asia and India were also affected. Air Canada said on Wednesday it has temporarily suspended service to India.

The post H1B spouses’ H4 work permits are being walked off the cli…,"New York: The Donald Trump government’s process of slow-walking H1B spouses' H4 visa work permit off the cliff is on its last mile and anxiety is peaking across the community of H1B spouses in the United States. The proposed rule to do away with H4 work permits (which came into effect in Barack Obama's second term) was sent to the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review last week. Headlines like ""Game over for H4EAD"" are floating around as families are torn between decisions about work and life in the US and the endless skewering.

""The squeeze is real and it's very effective from the administration's point of view. H1B extensions are getting very hard. Our families are getting hit. Spouses are upset that they may be denied working rights and to top to all, recruiters are going cold when they hear the word H1B. It's coming at us from all sides and frankly, we can't take it any more"", an ex-H1B worker who has moved to Canada barely a month ago, told Firstpost, in a phone conversation.

The H4 EAD is a work permit for spouses of H1B workers who have been approved for green cards and are yet to get those in hand. The Trump administration first announced its intent to scrap the H4 EAD in early 2017. The pushback against these work permits predates the Trump era and takes the form of a lawsuit launched against the program within days of its announcement by the Barack Obama government in 2015.

Charts extrapolating how quickly or slowly the H4 revocation could happen speak to the many pressures working on legal immigrant spouses over a prolonged period of many years now of which the last 2 years have been the most fraught.

""Let’s do everything collectively in our power to prevent the revocation of H-4 EAD"", says Cyrus Mehta, a high name recognition immigration attorney based in New York.

In government filings, the proposed changes are listed as “economically significant” and with “international impact”. At least 45% of all pending rule changes are in the “proposed rule” stage. You can see the high level overview here. If OMB moves at top speed and wraps up comments period within 30 days, we are looking at Spring 2019 when the comments review may begin. On the same sliding scale, a slower pace could push it all out by a few months. Either way, a constant gnawing remains for H1B families.

Once OMB reviews the proposed rule, it will be published in the Federal Register and opened for comments - the typical rubric for rule changes. Those who are following this can check for DHS pending rules and look for 1615-AC15. The same link also summarises the 'official' DHS lens on the issue.

Framed against the backdrop of the wider political scene in the country, the brief history of the H4 EAD in the Trump era fits neatly within the US president’s all-base, all-the-time strategy. But, like anything else, the White House’s chief occupant is the final wild card in this game and could always (in theory) step off the gas at any time. The motivations to soften the blow could come from multiple flanks and are emergent in nature, not all of which are overt at this moment.

At this time, the biggest of the #MAGA themed decisions - Trump's emergency declaration - is also on thin ice. Nearly two dozen former Republican members of Congress are urging GOP lawmakers to reject President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Whichever way that goes, it's an anthem for shifting sands and chaos well into the 2020 campaign season and all the way till the November 2020 elections.

Anirban Das, who came to the US on an F1 student visa to study for an Engineering Master's degree and has been a leading advocate for skilled immigrants here, explains how the numbers stack up, in a tweet: “As per USCIS stats, 100k #H4EAD are issued, out of which 30k were renewals. Which means only 70K are original applicants. USCIS has no idea how many are ACTUALLY working. US labor force is approx. 155 million. And they want to pull out 70k people from the workforce?”

This is how DHS explains the upside for citizens: “DHS anticipates that there would be two primary impacts that DHS can estimate and quantify: the cost-savings accruing to forgone future filings by certain H-4 dependent spouses, and labor turnover costs that employers of H-4 workers could incur when their employees’ EADs are terminated. Some U.S. workers would benefit from this proposed rule by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold, as the proposed rule would no longer allow H-4 workers to enter the labor market early.”

Das, quoted above, refutes that idea as a “lump of labor” theory. ""USCIS claims #H4EAD takes away American jobs. If an #H4EAD takes a job, it means a corresponding job loss for a citizen. This is ""lump of labor"" fallacy. No. of jobs in US economy are not set in stone. Studies show when more people join workforce, more jobs are created"".

Prominent US politicians have been at the forefront of the pushback; now even more so. Kamala Harris, the Indian American running for 2020 has called the effort “outrageous”. She tweeted that it “will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers. I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal & will continue to fight this.”

Officials are silent on the fine print. What wasn’t clear earlier remains that way. We don’t know whether the proposed rule change will have retrospective effect or not. If say, an H1B spouse has an H4 EAD that is stamped till 2021 and the rule changes this year, does it mean the H4EAD holder must stop work for pay immediately? The lion’s share of H4 EADs are held by Indians, mostly women. A small percentage of H4 visa holders are men.

The closest we have come to an official/ bureaucratic view on this are USCIS chief Francis Cissna's quotes to Bloomberg Law. Cissna said there are “very good reasons why you might want to have H-1B spouses be able to work,” and that many of those spouses are “very highly skilled.” “If the spouse can’t work, that might prevent that person from wanting to come over or stay,” but that’s something Congress should fix, he told reporter Laura D Francis.

“The reason why we’re proposing rescinding it is not because we don’t desire these people to have employment authorization...It’s because, amongst other reasons, it doesn’t appear to have been the intent of Congress to grant them work authorization,” Cissna said, in the same Bloomberg interview.

The replies on this Twitter thread below give us a good sense of how many directions the H4 or even the H1B debate can take when it goes beyond the legal framework and instead becomes a flashpoint between a dominant group and a new subculture that gains currency in an economy, like the H1B has come to be understood over three decades of its presence in the US.

93,Empty,2019-02-26T12:00:52Z,"Jared Kushner reveals vague details of his administration's perennially approaching peace plan, which political rivals use as an opportunity for infighting","1. Not-so friendly fire: US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law/senior adviser Jared Kusher has revealed details of his country’s perennially approaching peace plan, though Israel’s top two dailies focus more on the right-wing infighting the vague outline has caused.

New Right co-chair Naftali Bennett — whose party is polling just above the electoral threshold — picks a fight with the big tuna, Likud, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s party will cave to pressure from the Americans and invite the “disastrous” reality of a Palestinian state

Bennett goes full-on alarmist in an interview with Israel Radio, asserting that only the New Right will be able to prevent “the deaths of thousands of Israelis,” which he suggested would be the result of Trump’s “Deal of the Century.” He was comparing the current peace proposal to the Oslo Accords of the mid-90s which were followed by the deadly Second Intifada.

While the Likud party does indeed respond to its right-wing rival, it focuses less on its anti-Palestinian state credentials and more on chastising Bennett for friendly fire within the right-wing camp after he had promised to play nice:

“When Bennett and Shaked established the New Right they said they were doing it in order to pull votes from Lapid and Gantz to enlarge the right-wing bloc, and that they wouldn’t subject us to friendly fire. Now they are making false charges against Likud with the goal of pulling votes from Likud, which will bring about the rise of the left-wing government of Lapid and Gantz, whose party will be bigger than Likud.”

2. State-minus? As for the peace plan itself, Kushner tells Sky News Arabic that it will offer “realistic solutions for the issues of 2019” and will require a unified Palestinian leadership in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

While the PA has been barely talking to Hamas as of late, let alone the White House, Kushner likely was able to unify rival Palestinian factions over his failure to mention a sovereign Palestinian state in the Sky New interview.

Analysis on the plan is limited but Yedioth’s Sever Plotzker makes clear that he’s not buying any of it, calling the initiative “another doomed statement by an American president who can’t control his mouth.”

Plotzker points to previous Trump initiatives that were introduced with gusto, but have since not gone exactly as planned: the cancellation of trade deals with Canada and the EU, the quick and complete pullout of US forces from Syria, and the “big, beautiful” Mexico border wall.

He argues that Kushner’s belief in “economic peace” places him squarely in a camp with Netanyahu and a minority of late former prime ministers (he cites Shamir and Meir) who argue that Israel can still thrive despite its military control over the Palestinians.

3. Skin in the game: Hebrew media basks in the glory of Sunday night’s Oscar win for Israeli filmmaker Guy Nattiv and his short film “Skin,” which was awarded after papers already had gone to press the day prior.

Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up

Israel Hayom quotes President Reuven Rivlin characterizing the victory as “a gift for our children.”

Nattiv tells the Hebrew daily, “My grandparents were Holocaust survivors and this film is Israeli every way; it educates against racism.” To be clear, the 20-minute movie, about a gang war that breaks out in a small town after a black man smiles at a white child, was shot in the US.

Reviewing “Skin,” Yedioth’s Benjamin Tobias says, “It flows, it ignites, it leaves you with a pit in your stomach, but it mainly shows what talented people have grown out of the Israeli film industry in the last twenty years — the same industry that so many people in Israel insist on correcting or canceling.”

Yedioth points out that Nattiv is just the second Israeli filmmaker to win an Oscar. He shares the rare honor with Moshe Mizrachi, who won an Oscar in 1977 for his movie “Madame Rosa.”

4. Don’t let the door hit you on your way out: Most of the Israeli press does not seem interested in shedding a tear in its reporting of Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s abrupt resignation.

Yedioth refers to Zarif as “the smiles diplomat” and says he will now be able to return to Tehran University where he can teach international relations courses based on all that he learned during his time in the US.

“Zarif is gone. Good riddance,” Netanyahu tweets of the lead negotiator of Iran’s landmark 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers that he had bitterly opposed. “As long as I am here, Iran will never acquire nuclear weapons,”

But Haaretz’s Tzvi Barel calls the resignation a “gift” to hardliners in Iran, with whom Zarif sparred more often than not in his push for the nuclear deal.

Barel says Zarif was the first domino to fall as a result of Iranian frustration with the country’s spiraling economy following the renewal of American sanctions. Whether the resignation will stop the bleeding of President Hassan Rouhani’s administration remains to be seen, but Barel predicts Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will use the opportunity to appoint someone of his own choosing, ensuring greater influence in foreign policy matters moving forward.

5. He loves you, he loves you not: The brouhaha surrounding the entry of the long-tabooed party of Kahanists into the political arena appears to show no signs of letting up, with New Right co-leader Naftali Bennett telling Israel Radio that the Otzma Yehudit party is beyond the pale.

“I do not accept their positions at all. People who see (Jewish supremacist Meir) Kahane as a model are not fit to sit in the Knesset.”

But Bezalel Smotrich, whose Jewish Home party merged with Otzma Yehudit at the prime minister’s behest, is having none of Bennett’s criticism and tweets an article from earlier this month in which the New Right leader called the far-right alliance “essential.”

When Bennett and Shaked left the Jewish Home, they argued that their new party would allow the right-wing bloc to expand, with them attracting more secular voters, leaving the national religious party more free to go after the hardline Orthodox Israelis supportive of Otzma Yehudit.

6. Enemies at both gates: Haaretz leads its front page with a report quoting senior Palestinian officials in the West Bank and Gaza who warn that a confrontation with the Jewish state will ensue if the Israeli government does not take steps to ease pressure on the Palestinian leadership.

Senior Palestinian officials tell Haaretz’s Jacki Khoury that Israeli cuts in PA tax revenues in an effort to cease Ramallah’s payments to the families of security prisoners are turning the West Bank into a pressure cooker.

“Nobody knows when the camel’s back will break but all the elements required for an explosion already exist, and (the Israelis) are constantly adding oil to the fire,” Kadura Fares says.

A Hamas official tells Khoury that while the terror group is not interested in a confrontation with Israel at the moment — an evergreen line recycled by both Israelis and Palestinians — an Israeli strike on Gaza could lead to a dangerous renewal of violence

7. Before, during and after: New allegations are made against alleged sexual predator Malka Leifer. The 51-year-old has made headlines as she faces extradition to Australia, where she is charged with 74 counts of sexual abuse. Earlier this year, a man in the Emmanuel settlement, where she lived after fleeing from Melbourne, accused Leifer of trying to molest his daughter. Now, two woman have come forward saying the former principal made inappropriate advances to them when she taught at Bnei Brak before moving to Australia.

“She would take me for private conversation, one on one… down in the bomb shelter. We would sit there and she would stroke my leg,” the woman, who declined to disclose her identity, tells the Kan public broadcaster.

ToI confirms that there is a second former student of Leifer’s from her time in Bnei Brak who has accused the former principal of having made inappropriate sexual advances to her nearly two decades ago.

A former education official in Bnei Brak said she believed that rather than reporting her, community leaders sent Leifer to Australia after they learned of her transgressions.

8. So long, we hardly knew you?: The Central Elections Committee informs Labor’s shiny new ex-general Tal Russo that he may not be eligible to run, given a recent position he took on in the IDF reserves after his active duty was finished, which calls into question whether he completed his legally required post-army “cooling off” period before entering politics.",Give peace a chance? 8 things to know for February 26,Timesofisrael.com,https://www.timesofisrael.com/give-peace-a-chance-8-things-to-know-for-february-26/

It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the United States, which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War. That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United Sates is not a “banana republic.” Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about America’s status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95 percent, 97 percent of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers. Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer–client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as media trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland.

Every nomination to the Supreme Court is now a pitched battle replete with paid demonstrators at hearings and extensive campaigns of character assassination, but that court has sat inert as practically all the Bill of Rights’ constitutional assurances of due process, prompt and impartial justice, and the avoidance of capricious prosecutions have been abandoned. It is in this, as other civilized jurisdictions would consider it, tenuous state of the rule of law that the antics of the Comey-McCabe FBI and Brennan-Clapper intelligence direction, and their partisan effort to bend the law to install Hillary Clinton as president and sandbag Donald Trump, should be considered.

Celebrated as Thomas Jefferson rightly is for his seminal role in the creation of the country’s initial texts and its early governance, one achievement for which he has received insufficient credit is the founding of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1802. While this began as a corps of engineers limited to 20 men at first (led by Benjamin Franklin’s nephew, Jonathan Williams), the objective was to assure a non-political class of officers. The focus on engineering was, at this early stage, the young nation’s chief military requirement.

Jefferson’s initiative assured the United States of a nonpolitical military. The country has had twelve presidents who were celebrated combat military officers, from Washington to Eisenhower, including citizen generals such as Jackson, Hayes, and Garfield. And it has had a number of presidents who were distinguished middle or junior officers, including Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George H. W. Bush, and six high-ranking military officers who were unsuccessful presidential candidates, including the first Republican candidate, Colonel John C. Frémont; a general fired by Abraham Lincoln as commander of the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan, who had the effrontery to run against Lincoln in 1864; and a hero POW, John McCain.

The point of this recitation is that none of these people dabbled in politics while they were in the armed forces. The only serious figure who did so was General Douglas MacArthur, who, in response to a freshet of Republican-delegate enthusiasm from a midwestern state while he was preparing to liberate the Philippines, wrote to a supporter for public circulation a letter stating that he would accept the Republican nomination in 1944, but would be unable to campaign (as if his commander-in-chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would tolerate such a thing from a serving theater commander). When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1952, and was asked when he became Republican, he replied: “Today.” No soldier has led Great Britain since Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, except the Duke of Wellington, for two years.",G-Men Out of Control,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/g-men-control-160222663.html

The citizens of Caracas face unpleasant choices.

What’s Next for Venezuela?

Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitarian assistance, leading to increasing speculation about what comes next. Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.",What’s Next for Venezuela?,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/next-venezuela-144400468.html

Feb. 28, 2019, 7:54 PM GMT By Ken Dilanian

WASHINGTON — The Iranian-backed hackers who stole personal data on Australian lawmakers earlier this year are the same group that attacked the British Parliament in 2017, according to new research by a cybersecurity firm that sheds light on Iran's campaign of cyberespionage against its adversaries.

A report by Los Angeles-based Resecurity, obtained exclusively by NBC News, says the Feb. 8 hack of the Australian Parliament ""is a part of a multi-year cyberespionage campaign"" by an Iranian-backed hacking group they call Iridium.

""This actor targets sensitive government, diplomatic and military resources"" in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S., the firm says.

Australia has not formally attributed the attack to Iran, but the Iran connection was first reported this month by The Wall Street Journal.

The BBC attributed the 2017 British parliament attack to Iran, but Resecurity for the first time connected the two events, said Charles Yoo, Resecurity's president.

Using brute force attacks that guessed passwords, the hackers obtained thousands of records from both parliaments containing names, email addresses, birthdates and other information on lawmakers and their staff.

""We don't believe they are really trying to influence elections but we know that they are collecting so-called strategic intelligence,"" Yoo said.

Resecurity obtained some of the data stolen in the hacks and showed it to NBC News.

In the 2017 U.K. attack, the email accounts of 90 Parliament members were compromised.

The same Iranian-backed group compromised a database belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party of London, Resecurity says.

U.S. officials say Iranian cyber-spying is a growing concern. Earlier this month, federal prosecutors charged former U.S. counterintelligence agent Monica Elfriede Witt with espionage on behalf of Iran. They also charged four Iranians — Behzad Mesri, Mojtaba Masoumpour, Hossein Parva, and Mohamad Paryar — with allegedly using information she had provided to help them target her former colleagues and conduct other cyberespionage. Witt is believed to be in Iran.

Mesri had previously been charged in 2017 with hacking HBO's computer network, stealing unaired episodes of hit shows and demanding millions in Bitcoin as ransom.","Iran-backed hackers hit both UK, Australian parliaments, says report",NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/iran-backed-hackers-hit-both-uk-australian-parliaments-says-report-n977651

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Wednesday said that U.S. territory was constantly being used to launch cyber attacks against Russia, but said it was unable to confirm a U.S. media report that the U.S. military had disrupted the internet access of a Russian troll farm.

The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the U.S. military had disrupted the internet access of a Russian troll farm accused of trying to influence American voters on Nov. 6, 2018, the day of the congressional elections.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters he did not know how much truth there was to that media report.

Furthermore, large enterprise and government customers can enjoy early access to the latest security features offered by Microsoft. Few of them are enabling two-factor authentication, implementing access controls and installing updates.

AccountGuard has gained huge popularity in a short span of time, following its release last year. It is available to the users in Canada, the U.S., UK, and Ireland. Office 365 users can use it free of cost.

Microsoft also revealed that the service would be available to other European countries in the next few months.

Attackers made their first move

As we all know, the 2017 French Presidential Elections were reportedly influenced by cyber attacks. Moreover, European leaders are currently fearing that history is about to repeat itself. They might manipulate video and audio recording using ‘deep fake’ techniques.

The content is manipulated in a way that makes someone says something that he/she has never said or done before.

It seems like hackers have already made their first move as they tried to access 104 accounts that belong to users from different democratic institutions. These users are mainly located in France, Belgium, Serbia, Germany, Romania, and Poland.

As a matter of fact, Microsoft is aiming to protect customers and secure their systems by notifying the organizations regarding recent attempts.

The attackers followed the same technique that was used last year during U.S. mid-terms. They spoofed legitimate looking email addresses and created malicious URLs in order to get access to employee credentials and inject malware.

However, it is just a matter of time to see the history repeat itself. Do you see that prediction turning in to reality?

Scheer told reporters Wednesday that Trudeau has ""lost the moral authority to govern"" and called on the RCMP to open an investigation into the controversy.

The Conservative leader said he was ""sickened and appalled"" by Jody Wilson-Raybould's testimony before the justice committee, which detailed the political interference she claimed to have experienced as the former attorney general.

Watch: Wilson-Raybould says she faced pressure, 'veiled threats' over SNC-Lavalin

In more than three hours of testimony, Wilson-Raybould alleged that she faced ""consistent and sustained pressure"" for four months from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada's top public servant and the finance minister's office to halt the criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould told MPs was repeatedly pressed to overturn a decision not to negotiate a remediation agreement, also known as a deferred prosecution agreement, with SNC-Lavalin. Such a deal would have allowed the company, facing fraud and bribery charges from its dealings in Libya, to avoid a trial that could damage the company and spur layoffs.

Scheer said it is clear now that Wilson-Raybould was being bullied to ""bend the law"" for a well-connected corporation. He accused Trudeau of allowing a ""systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office"" and said the episode marked the final stages of his government.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""That is why I'm calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and resign.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh did not echo Scheer's call for the prime minister's resignation. He said the testimony heard at justice committee reaffirms his party's call for an independent inquiry.

""He may need to resign because of this,"" Singh said.

Wilson-Raybould testified that between Sept. 4 and Dec. 19, there were at least 10 different phone calls and 10 meetings about the SNC-Lavalin case between her or key members of her staff and 11 people in the Prime Minister's Office and other departments. Emails and text messages were also exchanged, she added.

Wilson-Raybould said that in a meeting with Trudeau on Sept. 17, the prime minister said SNC-Lavalin could cut many jobs and possibly move from Montreal without a remediation deal. She said Trudeau also stressed there was a provincial election in Quebec at the time and that he was an MP for the Quebec riding of Papineau.

Wilson-Raybould said she was ""taken aback"" and asked the prime minister if he was politically interfering in her independent role and decision as the attorney general, and that she would ""strongly advise"" against that.

""The prime minister said, 'No, no, no, we just need to find a solution,'"" she said.

The Canadian Press Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould appears at the House of Commons Justice Committee on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Feb. 27, 2019.

She also accused Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick of issuing ""veiled threats"" during a phone call on Dec. 19, in which she alleges he referenced how Trudeau wanted to know why a remediation deal wasn't being pursued. Wilson-Raybould said Wernick told her Trudeau would ""find a way to get it done one way or another.""

In a January cabinet shuffle, Wilson-Raybould was demoted to veterans affairs minister and replaced as attorney general and justice minister by David Lametti. She resigned from cabinet earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould also testified the pressure she felt did not cross the line, in her opinion, from ""inappropriate"" to illegal.

PM 'completely disagrees' with Wilson-Raybould's account

Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau said he ""completely disagrees"" with his former attorney general's version of events.

""Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We,of course, had discussions of the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possibly impact on pensions,"" he said in reference to SNC-Lavalin's woes.

""My job as prime minister has always been to stand up for Canadians and Canadian workers.""

Trudeau distanced himself from Wilson-Raybould's claim that he politically interfered in the prosecution case against SNC-Lavalin. He said the decision about a deferred prosecution agreement related to Quebec company ""was Ms. Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone.""

""I strongly maintain as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" the prime minister said.

Ryan Remiorz/CP Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at a media availability in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019.

He responded to Scheer's call for his resignation by mentioning the upcoming election, saying Canadians will have a ""clear choice"" to make in a few months. He pointed to his government's economic record as a reason for Canadians to re-elect a Liberal government.

The Conservative party, Trudeau said, remains ""the party of Stephen Harper that continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues.""

Trudeau sidestepped a question when asked if he would allow Wilson-Raybould, currently the MP for Vancouver Granville, to run under the Liberal banner this fall. He said that he has yet to listen to the entirety of his former attorney general's testimony.

""I will do that before making any further decisions,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould asked if she has confidence in PM

Wilson-Raybould, meanwhile, will likely face questions about whether she can stay in the Liberal caucus in light of her explosive testimony.

At the committee, Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault asked his caucus colleague if she still has confidence in the prime minister.

""I'm not going to get into any conversations about why I resigned other than to say this. I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the cabinet table,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

A new poll puts Andrew Scheer's Conservatives seven points ahead of the Liberals, gaining the favour of 38 per cent of voters, putting them in majority government territory, compared to 31 per cent for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's party, according to an Angus Reid Institute report.

The majority of Canadians, 66 per cent, believe the SNC-Lavalin affair points to a deeper scandal in the Prime Minister's Office, the poll found. And two-thirds of Canadians believe SNC-Lavalin should be prosecuted, potentially resulting in a 10-year ban on the Quebec-based engineering company receiving public contracts.

Trudeau has faced ongoing political backlash for his role in the SNC-Lavalin affair since late last week, when the online poll was conducted. Sixty per cent of Canadians have an unfavourable opinion of him and over the last month, 59 per cent of respondents said their opinion of Trudeau has worsened.

But it appears no party leader is particularly popular. Fifty-four per cent of Canadians think Scheer is unfavourable, and 64 per cent think the NDP's Jagmeet Singh is unfavourable. It is standard for party leaders not to be very well known or popular until weeks before the election, Kurl said.

Over the past month, how Canadians view Scheer and Singh has not drastically changed — 55 per cent and 64 per cent of respondents, respectively, feel the same way about each leader.

""What we see now is Scheer has been able to make swings that hit Trudeau but that hasn't translated to his own gains,"" Kurl said. ""Six months is eons in an election, and the question becomes can Scheer translate the general anger and dissatisfaction towards Trudeau into successfully offering himself up as an alternative to the prime minister-ship?""

Highlights

Free to speak for the first time about the SNC-Lavalin affair, Jody Wilson-Raybould delivered dramatic testimony in Ottawa on Wednesday, alleging “inappropriate” and sustained pressure from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his office to save the engineering firm from a trial that could damage the Liberals’ political future in Quebec.

In her lengthy opening statement and three hours of questioning by the House justice committee, she gave a detailed timeline of contentious conversations between her, her staff, the Prime Minister’s Office and other officials. In some of those exchanges, she says she faced “veiled threats” that an SNC trial would allow the firm’s headquarters to leave Quebec, costing thousands of jobs.

Afterward, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – who left Ottawa for Montreal shortly before the testimony began – faced calls from the opposition to resign or face a public inquiry. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wrote to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki asking for an investigation, citing a provision of the Criminal Code making it illegal to “provoke a state of fear” to impede the criminal justice system.

Mr. Trudeau said Wednesday that he “completely disagreed” with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s version of events and denied any wrongdoing. Asked about the issue again on Thursday, Mr. Trudeau said neither he nor the RCMP had contacted him about SNC.

What we knew before Wednesday

On Feb. 7, The Globe and Mail reported for the first time that Jody Wilson-Raybould had faced pressure in her previous job as justice minister to intervene in the federal corruption case against SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec engineering firm accused of bribing Libyan officials to win construction contracts. That first Globe report was based on information from confidential sources, who said the Prime Minister’s Office sought to avoid a costly trial last fall by reaching an out-of-court settlement with SNC. But Ms. Wilson-Raybould refused. Months later, she was shuffled into the Veterans Affairs portfolio.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denied he had “directed” Ms. Wilson-Raybould on the matter, but dodged questions on whether he had pressed her. He later acknowledged that they had discussed SNC’s case, and that when she asked in September whether he was ordering her to make a particular decision, he told her no. But Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who quit as veterans minister on Feb. 12, didn’t have a chance to tell her side of the story because she said she was bound by solicitor-client privilege. Mr. Trudeau partly waived that privilege on Feb. 25, but only for matters relating to her time as justice minister. That set the stage for Wednesday’s hearings at the House justice committee, which is looking into the SNC issue in general.

‘Veiled threats’ to 'politically interfere’

Open this photo in gallery Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to supporters in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019. Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press

In her opening statement, which ran more than 5,000 words, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described “consistent and sustained” political pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top officials urging her to settle the SNC case quietly by urging the Director of Public Prosecutions to reach a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, so that SNC could admit wrongdoing and pay compensation without a more costly trial:

Story continues below advertisement

For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance.

On several occasions, she says, “veiled threats” were invoked that SNC would move its head office out of Quebec if its legal woes continued, losing thousands of jobs in the province. She cited several times when Mr. Trudeau or other officials brought up the then-upcoming Quebec provincial election, which the provincial Liberals ultimately lost on Oct. 1 to the Coalition Avenir Québec.

Here’s what she said about one such meeting, where she spoke with Mr. Trudeau and Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, on Sept. 17. At this point, the Director of Public Prosecutions had already informed SNC that there would be no DPA, according to court documents obtained by The Globe:

The Prime Minister asks me to help out – to find a solution here for SNC – citing that if there was no DPA there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal. In response, I explained to him the law ... I told him that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP.

... At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

The names named

Michael Wernick

Michael Wernick is head of the Privy Council Office, a wing of the public service that supports the PMO and cabinet. He was present at Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s Sept. 17 meeting with Mr. Trudeau. She describes him supporting Mr. Trudeau’s argument that job losses in Quebec were a sufficient reason to intervene in the SNC case:

Then to my surprise – the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA – he said “there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders” ... “they will likely be moving to London if this happens” ... “and there is an election in Quebec soon” ...

On Dec. 19, after more conversations between Mr. Wernick and her staff, Ms. Wilson-Raybould had a phone call with him:

The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. He said “I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.” I warned the Clerk that we were treading on dangerous ground here – and I issued a stern warning because as the AG, I cannot act in a manner and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent, I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. And all of this screams of that.

Gerald Butts and Katie Telford

Gerald Butts, the Prime Minister’s best friend, spent more than three years at his side as principal secretary. But on Feb. 18 he quit, saying the accusations of PMO meddling were a distraction from the government’s work. That left Katie Telford, Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff, as the most senior person in the PMO.

In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described both of them playing a key role in the SNC discussions. On Dec. 18, she says he challenged her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, to get an external legal opinion of the DPP’s decision not to reach a DPA:

Gerry said “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do! Don’t care about the PPSC’s independence. Katie was like “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.” … They kept being like “we aren’t lawyers, but there has to be some solution here”.’

Bill Morneau

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony also added some new characters to the SNC drama: Bill Morneau, the Finance Minister, and his chief of staff Ben Chin. Ms. Prince talked with Mr. Chin on Sept. 6, two days after SNC was notified there would be no DPA. He, too, pressed on the issue of jobs and the Quebec election:

He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this. He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.

David Lametti

When Ms. Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of her job in January, Mr. Trudeau chose MP David Lametti to replace her as justice minister. Days before the shuffle, discussions were set in motion to make the SNC file a priority for Mr. Lametti, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said, citing directives given to the deputy justice minister by Mr. Wernick:

My former Deputy Minister is called by the Clerk and told that the shuffle is happening, and that she will be getting a new Minister. As part of this conversation, the Clerk tells the Deputy that one of the first conversations that the new Minister will be expected to have with the PM will be on SNC Lavalin. In other words, that the new Minister will need to be prepared to speak to the PM on this file. The Deputy recounts this to my Chief of Staff who tells me about the comment.

The spectre of Nixon

One of the biggest corruption scandals in U.S. history, Watergate, got an unexpected cameo in Wednesday’s hearings when Ms. Wilson-Raybould mentioned the Saturday Night Massacre, when president Richard Nixon’s attorney-general quit in 1973 rather than fire the Watergate special prosecutor. She brought up the comparison in her Dec. 19 conversation with Mr. Wernick, when he pressed her again on reaching a settlement with SNC:

The Clerk acknowledged that, but said that the PM does not have the power to do what he wants… all the tools are in my hands, he said. I said that I was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre – but that I was confident that I had given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. The Clerk said that he was worried about a collision because the PM is pretty firm about this…He told me that he had seen the PM a few hours ago and that this is really important to him.

Here’s a primer from The Globe’s Washington correspondent, Adrian Morrow, on the legacy of Mr. Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre.

What wasn’t said

For all her candour on Wednesday, Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s reprieve from solicitor-client privilege only went so far. Mr. Trudeau’s order-in-council only covered her time as justice minister, so her timeline of events ends with her exit from the job. Ahead of her testimony, she wrote to the justice committee’s chair, Anthony Housefather, saying she was disappointed that she couldn’t address events after that:

[The order-in-council] addresses only my time as attorney-general of Canada and therefore does nothing to release me from any restrictions that apply to communications while I served as minister of veterans affairs and in relation to my resignation from that post or my presentation to cabinet after I had resigned.

How Trudeau responded

Open this photo in gallery Mr. Trudeau speaks at a media availability in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019. Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press

Mr. Trudeau wasn’t in Ottawa during Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s committee hearing, instead going to Montreal soon after an appearance in Question Period. Afterward, Mr. Trudeau told a late news conference that he “completely disagreed” with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s version of events, that neither he nor his staff had done anything wrong and that he had faith in an investigation of the matter by the Ethics Commissioner. Asked if he would resign, he said Canadians would get a choice in October’s federal election about who should lead the nation.

How the opposition responded

After Wednesday’s hearing, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Mr. Trudeau had lost moral authority to govern and should step down. On Thursday he wrote to the head of the RCMP asking for an investigation. Meanwhile, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for a public inquiry and condemned the Prime Minister for appearing to side with “rich corporations who need favours.”

How Indigenous people responded

Ms. Wilson-Raybould – whose traditional name, Puglaas, means “a woman born to noble people” in the Kwak’wala language – is descended from the Musgamagw Tsawataineuk and Laich-Kwil-Tach peoples of British Columbia. When she got the justice minister job in 2015, she was the first Indigenous woman to hold the post, and identified with a traditional role – Hiligaxste, or One Who Corrects the Chiefs’ Path – in her career as a lawyer and politician. She acknowledged that cultural heritage again in the conclusion to her Wednesday testimony:

I come from a long line of matriarchs and I am a truth teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our Big House – this is who I am and who I will always be. Gilakas’la / Thank you.

Afterward, Indigenous leaders across the country expressed support for her and anger at the Trudeau government. Here’s what Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs said:

It makes one more angry about how terribly she was treated, how she was coerced, how she was browbeaten. But at the same time, we’re elated that she’s been vindicated and has had an opportunity to speak her truth.

The Quebec Court of Appeal has upheld a landmark judgment that ordered three tobacco companies to pay billions of dollars in damages to Quebec smokers.

Imperial Tobacco, JTI-Macdonald and Rothmans-Benson & Hedges had appealed a ruling that found the companies chose profits over the health of their customers.

Philippe Trudel, a lawyer for smokers who brought the class action, called today's appellate court decision a complete victory and excellent news for victims.

In June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan ordered the companies to make payments of more than $15-billion to smokers who either fell ill or were addicted. At the time, the ruling was believed to be the biggest class action award in Canadian history.

One lawsuit was started by people who were addicted to cigarettes and couldn't quit, and the second was brought by those who had suffered from cancer or emphysema.

Some 76 witnesses testified at the Superior Court trial and nearly 43,000 documents were deposited as evidence, including internal tobacco company documents that showed smokers didn't know or understand the risks associated with cigarettes.

The three cigarette companies argued their customers knew the risks of smoking. Moreover, the firms claimed their products were sold legally under strict regulation by the federal government.

Trudel estimated that after the appeal ruling, the total damages owed by the companies would be more than $17-billion.

""It is excellent news for victims who have been waiting for this day for a long time. We're very happy with the result, clearly,"" he said.

Quebec's highest court, which began hearing the appeal in 2016, struck down almost all of the tobacco companies' grounds for appeal and upheld the judge's decision.

The court did find the judge erred in several minor aspects, including how the interest was calculated. Trudel called the change a ""technicality"" that would have little effect on the overall damages.

""Out of all the billions, I don't think they'll call it a victory,"" he said. ""But we call it a total victory on all fronts.""",Big Tobacco to pay billions - Canada News - Castanet.net,Castanet.net,https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/250512/Big-Tobacco-to-pay-billions

In her testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, the former justice minister and attorney-general said she was “hounded” to negotiate a settlement with SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec-based engineering giant facing charges of fraud and corruption.

Mostly freed by an order-in-council from the confines of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence, Ms. Wilson-Raybould laid out a cast of characters that she said were involved in the controversy between September and December of last year.

“These events involved 11 people – excluding myself and my political staff – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance,” she told the committee. “This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails and text messages.”

The Globe and Mail confirmed the names with her office and takes a closer look at the 11 people – who they are and what Ms. Wilson-Raybould said in her testimony about their alleged involvement.

Justin Trudeau: Prime Minister of Canada

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing his largest scandal since taking office in 2015. In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she had a meeting with the Prime Minister on Sept. 17 regarding another matter.

But, she said he raised the SNC-Lavalin issue “immediately,” asking her to find a solution for the company, repeatedly citing risks of job losses and that the engineering firm would move its headquarters away from Montreal. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she had decided not to issue a directive to the director of public prosecutions in this case, as it was not appropriate.

She said Mr. Trudeau then stressed that there is a provincial election in Quebec and said he is an MP in the province. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she outright asked if he was politically interfering with her role and decision as attorney-general, to which he replied, “No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.”

In a December conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said Mr. Wernick repeatedly invoked the Prime Minister’s name, saying Mr. Trudeau was concerned. To her, these amounted to “veiled threats.”

On Jan. 7, the Prime Minister informed Ms. Wilson-Raybould that she was being shuffled to minister of veterans affairs; she said she believed the reason was because of the SNC case. In response to her testimony, Mr. Trudeau said he disagreed with her characterization of events and that he and his staff acted appropriately in the matter.

Bill Morneau: Minister of Finance

Minister of Finance Bill Morneau was an experienced businessman and a political newcomer when he successfully ran as a Liberal candidate for the Toronto Centre riding in 2015. Mr. Morneau came under scrutiny after The Globe reported in October of 2017 that he had not placed his substantial personal holdings into a blind trust, an approach the Prime Minister had held up as the gold standard for avoiding conflicts of interest. Mr. Morneau said he was not doing anything against the rules, but subsequently said he would sell his shares in his family’s human-resources firm and put other assets in a blind trust.

In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said Mr. Morneau raised concerns about potential job losses should SNC-Lavalin not receive a deferred prosecution agreement, describing a conversation she had with Mr. Morneau on Sept. 19 in the House of Commons.

“He again stressed the need to save jobs, and I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to top – that they were inappropriate,” she said. “They did not stop,” she said, adding that her chief of staff subsequently received calls from Ben Chin and Justin To, both from the Minister of Finance’s office, regarding SNC-Lavalin and deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs).

On Thursday, Mr. Morneau denied doing anything improper, saying it was “entirely appropriate” for his staff to speak with the Justice Minister’s staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ben Chin: Chief of staff to the Minister of Finance

Ben Chin began his career as a broadcast journalist, moving to politics in 2005 as a communications adviser to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. He unsuccessfully ran for the Ontario Liberals in the Toronto-Danforth by-election in 2006. Mr. Chin was vice-president of communications for the Ontario Power Authority between 2009 and 2011, and in 2013 was called to testify before a provincial legislative committee looking into a decision by the government to cancel plans to build two gas-fired power plants before the 2011 election.

Mr. Chin served as communications director for former B.C. Liberal premier Christy Clark from December, 2012, until July, 2017, later that year moving to federal politics as a senior adviser to Mr. Morneau. In May of 2018, he became the minister’s chief of staff. Lobbying records show SNC-Lavalin representatives met with Mr. Morneau and Mr. Chin on Sept. 18, to discuss subjects including “justice and law enforcement.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s statement said one of the first communications she had about a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin came on Sept. 6, when Mr. Chin told her chief of staff that if the company did not get a DPA, “they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen.”

In another reference to Mr. Chin, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described a follow-up conversation between him and a member of her staff on Sept. 11, in which she says Mr. Chin noted that “SNC’s legal counsel was Frank Iacobucci, and further detailed what the terms were that SNC was prepared to agree to – stating that they viewed this as a negotiation.”

Mathieu Bouchard: Senior adviser, Prime Minister’s Office

Mathieu Bouchard is a senior adviser to the Prime Minister, with a particular focus on Quebec and legal issues. Prior to joining the PMO in November of 2015, he was a lawyer with Montreal firm Irving Mitchell Kalichman LLP, where he worked in corporate and civil litigation as well as human-rights law.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony had numerous references to SNC-related communications with Mr. Bouchard. She said her then-chief of staff, Jessica Prince, had a phone call with Mr. Bouchard and Elder Marques, also from the PMO, on Sept. 16.

In this call, they said her office should get external advice on the SNC-Lavalin matter and they mentioned the context of a Quebec election. On Sept. 19, they had another call with Ms. Prince, in which they suggested an “informal reach out” to the director of public prosecutions. Ms. Prince said Ms. Wilson-Raybould was not comfortable with that and this likely constituted political interference.

On Oct. 18, Mr. Bouchard called Ms. Prince and asked that the Attorney-General consider seeking an external legal opinion on the prosecutor’s decision not to offer a deferred prosecution agreement. Mr. Bouchard repeated this request to Ms. Prince on Oct. 26. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said he told Ms. Prince that there could be negative consequences should SNC-Lavalin announce it is moving its headquarters out of Canada.

“We can have the best policy in the world, but we need to get re-elected,” he allegedly said. On Nov. 22, Ms. Wilson-Raybould met with Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Marques. She said it was a lengthy meeting where Mr. Bouchard said Ms. Wilson-Raybould needed to find a solution, even though she said she had already made up her mind not to intervene.

Amy Archer: Policy adviser, Prime Minister’s Office

Amy Archer has a BA in political studies from Queen’s University and a law degree from the University of Western Ontario, according to her LinkedIn profile. The profile says she articled at McCarthy Tétrault and worked there as a litigation associate for two years, then moved to a job at Lerners LLP.

She became a senior adviser to Ontario’s government House leader in 2014. From there, she took a post as senior policy adviser with the attorney-general of Ontario in 2017. She went on to become a policy adviser in the PMO, joining several other former Ontario Liberal staffers who found jobs on Parliament Hill after the Progressive Conservatives won the June provincial election.

In Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s opening statement, she says she got a note from her staff on Sept. 7 on the role of the attorney-general; she said the note was shared with Elder Marques and Ms. Archer.

Michael Wernick: Clerk of the Privy Council Office

A 61-year-old career civil servant, Michael Wernick ascended through the bureaucracy to the top job of Clerk of the Privy Council in 2016. In the role, he is tasked with helping to implement the vision of the government of the day. Mr. Wernick testified before the justice committee on Feb. 21, where he maintained that Ms. Wilson-Raybould – whom he described as a partner, ally and friend – was not subjected to “inappropriate pressure.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould detailed several occasions when she spoke with Mr. Wernick about the SNC-Lavalin matter. She said she met with the Prime Minister and Mr. Wernick on Sept. 17 on an unrelated issue, but that Mr. Trudeau immediately brought up the SNC-Lavalin case, flagging the potential economic consequences if there is no deferred prosecution agreement.

“Then, to my surprise, the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA,” Ms. Wilson-Raybould told MPs, adding that Mr. Wernick referred to a coming SNC-Lavalin board meeting and an election in Quebec. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said that at meeting two days later, the Clerk brought up potential job losses.

On Dec. 19, Mr. Wernick called Ms. Wilson-Raybould and told her the Prime Minister is “quite determined, quite firm” on the SNC-Lavalin matter, according to her testimony. “He said: ‘I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another,’” she said.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said that on Jan. 11, Mr. Wernick told her deputy minister that a cabinet shuffle is happening and that the SNC-Lavalin matter will be one of the priorities for the new minister.

Elder Marques: Senior adviser, Prime Minister’s Office

Elder Marques is a former top commercial litigator and trial lawyer from McCarthy Tétrault. Mr. Marques, who once served as the law clerk to now-retired Supreme Court chief justice Beverley McLachlin, joined the Liberal government in 2016 as chief of staff to Minister of Innovation Navdeep Bains.

In 2017, he became a senior adviser in the PMO and was named by The Hill Times as one of the 15 most influential unelected people in federal government. Since 2017, SNC-Lavalin lobbied federal officials – including Mr. Marques – a total of more than 50 times on the topic of “justice” and “law enforcement,” according to the federal lobbyists registry.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said that on Sept. 16, her then-chief of staff, Ms. Prince, had a call with Mr. Marques and Mr. Bouchard, another senior PMO adviser.

Story continues below advertisement

“They said that they think we should be able to find a more reasonable resolution here,” Ms. Wilson-Raybould testified, adding that the two mentioned the coming SNC-Lavalin board meeting and the Quebec election. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said they asked Ms. Prince if the office was open to suggesting to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada that it get outside advice. The men told Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff that “they didn’t want to cross any lines.”

In a Sept. 19 call with Ms. Prince, Mr. Marques and Mr. Bouchard raised the idea of “an informal reach-out” to the director of public prosecutions, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said. They asked if it would still constitute political interference if Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s staff or her deputy minister reached out to the director, she said.

On Nov. 22, after Ms. Wilson-Raybould had told various officials that SNC-Lavalin would not be getting a DPA, she had a “quite long” meeting with Mr. Marques and Mr. Bouchard, she said. They “continued to plead their case,” she said.

Gerald Butts, former principal secretary to the Prime Minister

Gerald Butts and Mr. Trudeau have a long history. They met as university students when they were both English majors at McGill University. Mr. Butts, a two-time university debating champion, was a top adviser to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty and formerly the CEO of the World Wildlife Fund’s Canadian office.

He was principal secretary to Prime Minister Trudeau – and one of the PM’s most trusted advisers – from 2015 until his abrupt resignation on Feb. 18. In his letter of resignation, he said any accusation that he put pressure on Ms. Wilson-Raybould is “simply not true.”

In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she met with Mr. Butts on Dec. 5, a meeting in which she says she stressed that she had made up her mind on SNC-Lavalin and that further engagements were inappropriate; he said he needed her to find a solution. According to Ms. Wilson-Raybould, he said the statute involved in the matter was one passed under the previous Harper administration and that he did not like the law.

On Dec. 18, Mr. Butts and Katie Telford, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, met with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, where they again asked for a solution. In a text conversation, her chief of staff cited Mr. Butts as saying “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” On Thursday, Mr. Butts said he asked the Justice committee that he be allowed to testify.

Justin To: Director of policy and deputy chief of staff to the Minister of Finance

Justin To is director of policy and deputy chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, a department where he has worked since September, 2017. Before that, he was a deputy director of policy along with finance and economic adviser to Prime Minister Trudeau; he also worked as a senior policy adviser to the former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff.

According to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, her chief of staff spoke with Mr. To and Mr. Morneau’s chief of staff on Sept. 20, in their capacity as members of the Finance Minister’s office, about SNC and deferred prosecution agreements. This occurred the day after she said she had told the Finance Minister that engagements on the matter from his office were inappropriate and needed to stop.

Katie Telford: Chief of staff to the Prime Minister

Katie Telford cut her teeth in the Ontario Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty, where she quickly rose through the ranks and served as chief of staff to then-education minister Gerard Kennedy. She managed Mr. Kennedy’s unsuccessful 2006 federal leadership bid, served as deputy chief of staff to former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion and was a senior consultant at the lobbying firm StrategyCorp.

Ms. Telford managed Mr. Trudeau’s winning bid for party leadership in 2012-13, and served as national campaign director in the 2015 federal election that brought Mr. Trudeau to power. Ms. Telford, who cemented her relationship with Mr. Butts when the two were at Queen’s Park, became Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff and a central figure in the PMO.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould testified that on Dec. 18, her then-chief of staff, Ms. Prince, was “urgently summoned” to meet with Ms. Telford and Mr. Butts to discuss SNC-Lavalin. She described this meeting as part of the “final escalation in efforts by the PMO to interfere in this matter.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould read from text messages exchanged with Ms. Prince after the meeting, in which Ms. Prince said the PMO officials wanted Ms. Wilson-Raybould to seek outside counsel on whether she should review the SNC-Lavalin decision and recounted Ms. Telford as saying “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

According to Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Ms. Prince says in the text messages that Ms. Telford believed outside advice would “give us cover in the business community and legal community.” Ms. Telford also offered to line up “all kinds of people to write opeds saying that what [Ms. Wilson-Raybould] is doing is proper.”

Nathalie Drouin: Deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney-general

Nathalie Drouin was previously deputy attorney-general for the Quebec government, and has been a member of the Quebec Bar since 1992. Before joining government, Ms. Drouin held senior positions in Quebec’s Autorité des marchés financiers, which regulates the financial sector in the province. She was named deputy minister of justice and deputy attorney-general of Canada in June of 2017. She had previously served as senior associate deputy minister at the justice department.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould testified that on Sept. 7, her then-deputy minister said her department was working on the issue and provided a list of what some options would be – for example, “informally call [director of public prosecutions] Kathleen Roussel, set up an external review of their decision, etc.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould said that on Sept. 16, her chief of staff had a conversation about SNC-Lavalin with Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Marques, from the PMO.

“They said they understand that there are limits on what can be done, and that they can’t direct, but that they hear that our Deputy Minister (of Justice) thinks we can get the PPSC to say, ‘We think we should get some outside advice on this,’” Ms. Wilson-Raybould said.

She also said she had a number of discussions with her deputy in which she raised concerns about the “appropriateness of communications” they were receiving from outside the department, and concerns about some of the options she was suggesting.

106,Empty,2019-02-28T14:49:47Z,His former attorney general detailed a campaign by Trudeau's office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.,"Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister’s office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation — and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”

She met Butts in December in Ottawa, and was already frustrated by what she called “the barrage of people hounding me and my staff.” She pushed back. “I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC, as I had made up my mind and that the engagements were inappropriate.”

She read a text-message conversation with her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, who was relaying a conversation with Butts and Telford. Wilson-Raybould said Prince was told by Butts “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” She said Prince told her Telford said: “We don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who is Trudeau’s top rival, demanded the prime minister step down over the revelations. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the third-place New Democratic Party, called for a full public inquiry.

Wilson-Raybould was ultimately moved in a cabinet shuffle last month, before the scandal broke. Trudeau at first sought to downplay it by saying Wilson-Raybould’s presence in cabinet should speak for itself. She resigned the next day.

To be sure, she said she didn’t believe Trudeau or his aides broke the law, but that their interventions were inappropriate. Wilson-Raybould also said no one ever flatly directed her to intervene. Trudeau has echoed that. The former attorney general said she didn’t think it was inappropriate to discuss the potential of job losses early on, but became inappropriate to continually do it, and to raise the political ramifications of the situation.

SNC-Lavalin has said it’s no longer focused on getting a remediation agreement, but instead on fighting the case. It’s also facing legal proceedings that allege it delayed disclosing that it would not get an offer of a deferred prosecution agreement, from Sept. 4 to Oct. 10. SNC-Lavalin said Wednesday the prosecutor’s “final decision” was only made Oct. 9.

107,Empty,2019-02-26T09:00:00Z,The fledgling People's Party of Canada got off to an uneven start in its first electoral test Monday in a trio of federal byelections.,"The fledgling People's Party of Canada got off to an uneven start in its first electoral test Monday in a trio of federal byelections.

The party, founded last fall by former Conservative leadership contender Maxime Bernier, captured some 11 per cent of the vote in the Vancouver-area riding of Burnaby South but failed to make much of a splash among voters in the rural Ontario riding of York—Simcoe or the urban Montreal-area riding of Outremont where the party had less than 2 per cent of the final tally.

Bernier tweeted early Tuesday that the poor Ontario and Quebec numbers were ""disappointing"" and said he ""expected more"" from those ridings while praising the more favourable Burnaby result as ""great.""

""Our party was born only 5 months ago!"" Bernier wrote. ""This is only the beginning of our journey. We are in it for the long haul ... Let's work even harder now to find the best candidates and be ready for the general election.""

3/ We are addressing crucial issues the other parties won’t touch.<br><br>We have the clearest principles and the best platform. <br><br>There is no alternative. <br><br>CANADA NEEDS US.<br><br>Let’s work even harder now to find the best candidates and be ready for the general election. —@MaximeBernier

Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, a former Christian talk show host who had some name recognition before launching her candidacy, was tapped by Bernier to represent the People's Party in Burnaby South. She delivered the best result of the night for the new political outfit.

While she was a source of controversy because of some past remarks, Thompson peeled away enough votes from the more established parties to place fourth overall.

Thompson, whose slogan was of ""Canada for Canadians,"" ran a decidedly populist campaign for Parliament. Thompson has said her base was heavily comprised of evangelical Chinese-Canadian churchgoers in the diverse B.C. riding.

The comparatively strong showing by Thompson — in a riding ultimately won by NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — appeared to cut in to the Conservative party's results in that riding.

Conservative Burnaby candidate, Jay Shin, captured about 23 per cent of the vote — five points less than what the previous Conservative candidate there managed to achieve in the 2015 federal election. Shin placed third behind Singh and Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee.

In central Canada, meanwhile, the People's Party proved to be a marginal political force.

For example, in York—Simcoe, Ont., People's Party candidate Robert Geurts, a criminal defence lawyer, placed a distant sixth out of nine candidates.

Geurts, best known for his past role as a prosecutor during the Paul Bernardo trial, was even outpaced by Dorian Baxter a candidate for the minor centre-right PC Party, an entity with a name similar to the now-defunct Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

Scot Davidson ultimately held the rural seat for the Conservative party with a 20-point margin over Liberal Shaun Tanaka.

Fewer than 20 per cent of registered voters in York—Simcoe bothered to vote in Monday's contest.

Even before the results were finalized, Bernier tweeted Monday that volunteers should be proud of what they accomplished so soon after the party was founded.

""The hundreds of volunteers who helped our candidates in Burnaby South, York–Simcoe and Outremont can be proud of what they achieved. They blazed a trail that thousands of others will follow across the country in October,"" he said.

In Outremont, People's Party candidate James Seale, a Canadian Army veteran, also failed to post a result better than 2 per cent of the vote.

Seale was a member of the armed forces for more than 30 years, and served overseas stints in Israel, Germany, Haiti and Bosnia before later becoming a military instructor and civil servant.

He said he was attracted to the party because of Bernier's promise to increase investment in Canada's defence.

While Bernier's party disappointed in the Quebec riding, Green party candidate Daniel Green placed third — among the party's best ever showing in la belle province.

Green, the deputy leader of the Green Party of Canada, posted better numbers than Bloc Québécois candidate Michel Duchesne and Conservative candidate Jasmine Louras who placed fourth and fifth respectively in the riding that was last held by former NDP leader Tom Mulcair.

""The GPC has always been underestimated. But just watch us in October,"" Green tweeted Monday in reference to the forthcoming federal election.

While Mulcair won the riding by more than 11 points in the 2015 federal election, Liberal Rachel Bendayan easily captured the seat Monday outpacing NDP candidate Julia Sánchez by more than 15 points.",People's Party posts mixed-bag results after its first byelection test,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/people-s-party-mixed-bag-results-1.5033489

Now he’s trying to contain damage from his former justice minister’s accusations of improper pressure in a criminal case.,"OTTAWA — If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had any thought that a burgeoning political scandal could be quietly contained, that hope vanished on Thursday, as Canadians dissected the explosive testimony from his former justice minister before a parliamentary committee.

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a minister strafe her own government like this,” said Andrew MacDougall, who was the spokesman for Stephen Harper, the Conservative prime minister Mr. Trudeau replaced in 2015. “It just reinforces people’s perception that all politicians are kind of bent.”

During nearly four hours of testimony before the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday evening, the former minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, repeatedly contradicted and undermined Mr. Trudeau’s assertions that neither he nor his staff acted improperly in trying to settle a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin, a multinational construction and engineering company based in Montreal.

[Latest update: Trudeau promised a fresh approach to politics. Now he’s embroiled in scandal.]

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister. “He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister. Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

110,Empty,2019-02-27T11:00:00Z,It depends on the spectrum that voters use to assess his candidacy.,"Now consider a third framework for analyzing U.S. politics: a spectrum that runs from “most establishment” on one end to “most anti-establishment” on the other. For some Democrats, it will seem obvious that Sanders inhabits the latter pole, back on the left flank of the Democratic field, where he is seeking to rein in billionaires, corporations, and a hawkish military-industrial complex, via a mass movement funded by small donations from a big donor pool. Some of his supporters perceive him as the only credible reformist outsider.

But other Democrats more prone to judging individuals based on their immutable traits see Sanders as yet another old, straight, cisgender white man seeking an office held by similarly privileged sorts for most of U.S. history.

That renders him more “establishment” in their view than a black woman like Kamala Harris, who represents progress in terms of diversity and representation, even if she substantively exacerbated the injustices that the carceral state inflicts on the wrongly accused, arguably harming people at the bottom of socioeconomic and racial hierarchies more than any other candidate.

In sum, one cannot draw any easy conclusions about how Democrats will understand Sanders’s candidacy—or assess his chances of beating President Donald Trump—merely by knowing whether they want a more centrist or leftist party.

While I’m an independent, not a Democrat, I don’t know where I personally stand on Sanders. Perhaps my uncertainty can further illuminate relevant complications.

I value Sanders’s opposition to corporate rent-seeking, his anti-war credentials, and his universalist approach to our wonderfully diverse democracy, while I dislike the ideological socialism that caused a younger, hopefully more naive Sanders to praise murderous regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua and to spin Sandinista bread lines as a sign of economic health, as Michael Moynihan documents. (“Vermont could set an example to the rest of the nation similar to the type of example Nicaragua is setting for the rest of Latin America,” Sanders once declared.)

The most indefensible of his bygone comments didn’t stop me from preferring an older, hopefully wiser Sanders to Hillary Clinton in 2016—the least defensible parts of her record included support for catastrophic wars in Iraq and Libya. While the next president will be unnervingly free to start wars of choice abroad without securing the lawfully required permission from Congress, he or she has no chance of imposing anything close to “democratic socialism.”

Still, I want to see Sanders grapple with the occasions when he has prioritized his commitment to socialism above his commitment to civil liberties. And I want him pressed on what Kmele Foster smartly flagged as the most interesting line in the speech when he announced his 2020 candidacy: “We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world,” Sanders declared in order to highlight the unacceptability of U.S. failures to provide for the least well-off.",Is Bernie Sanders a Leftist or a Moderate?,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/sanders-democrats/583519/

According to Thompson, the populist party has mobilized the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote.","BURNABY—When Ivan Pak went to Maxime Bernier’s first rally in Vancouver last November, he says he was “inspired” by the new party leader’s clear platform and policy commitments. That’s the kind of leader Canada needs, he told Star Vancouver.

Maxime Bernier, leader of the new People’s Party of Canada, meets supporters on Thursday at an event prior to Monday’s federal byelection in Burnaby, B.C. ( Jesse Winter / Star Metro )

Bernier announced the “death of political correctness” via a Tweet last fall to his then 65,000 followers and launched the People’s Party of Canada, which has been gaining rapid traction. Widely viewed as aiming further right of the Conservative party, the PPC has been criticized for being anti-immigrant and espousing anti-globalist values and rhetoric. But Pak, a first-generation immigrant from China, dispels those critiques as myths. “Some people accuse the PPC of being a white people’s party of Canada, but for myself ... I learned to speak English here. I’ve been here 22 years,” he said on Thursday, holding up PPC signs waiting for Bernier to make his first appearance in Burnaby South since Monday’s byelection was called in the riding.

“PPC welcomes people like me to be part of their party as long as we share the same Canadian values.” But experts say core Canadian values are now divided and there’s very little common ground. Michael Valpy is a senior fellow in public policy at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and a former Globe and Mail journalist who has been tracking the rise of ordered populism in Canada — or what economists refer to as “drawbridge-up” thinking.

Nathaniel Allen, who supports the People's Party of Canada, drove from Mission, B.C., to attend a campaign event in Burnaby on Thursday. Allen, a former member of the BC Liberals, says he was disillusioned with politics for years until Maxime Bernier's party came along. ( Jesse Winter / Star Vancouver )

Its proponents are often hostile toward immigration, deeply pessimistic about their economic future, mostly male and mainly white, he said. At Bernier’s event on Thursday in Burnaby South, this demographic was also present. Nathaniel Allen, 30, told the Star he was a BC Liberal — the provincial party widely known to embrace conservative policies — 12 years ago until he lost interest. It wasn’t until the PPC came along that he found himself civically engaged.

“It just felt like the most pragmatic decision I could make,” he explained. Read more:

How Canadian populism is playing out in the Burnaby South byelection Burnaby South People’s Party of Canada candidate alleges Conservative Party is ‘smearing’ her Liberal candidate’s WeChat post draws criticism for singling out race of byelection opponent Jagmeet Singh A Star investigation found that far-right supporters have called on their members to infiltrate the PPC, whether the party is willing or not. As the extreme right has done elsewhere, they hope to move on a new party, bit by bit, to bring the political extreme toward the mainstream. Meanwhile, the yellow vest faction — which started as a labour movement in France but has expanded in Canada beyond economic concerns, delving into anti-globalism, nationalism, anti-government sentiment and xenophobia — looks like it’s here to stay. Bernier was there to greet the United We Roll convoy when it arrived in Ottawa last Tuesday. The former federal Conservative cabinet minister, standing beside a man in a yellow vest, told the crowd he was there to promote Canadian unity. Canadians are increasingly opposed to more immigration — and it remains to be seen how that will play out in October’s federal election, Valpy said. Anti-immigrant sentiments often depend on the makeup of neighbourhoods, he added, pointing to the suburban area surrounding Toronto, known as the 905 because of its area code, which is “quite strongly” anti-immigrant despite not being a white majority community. That’s because if communities are homogenous — for instance, predominantly white, brown or Asian — anti-immigrant views can emerge. However, Valpy said, if neighbourhoods are mixed, anti-immigrant views are unlikely. “Ethnic attachment is declining and has declined quite rapidly,” he explained in an interview, citing data from Ottawa-based pollster EKOS Research Associates. “It’s no longer important to us that all our friends are all white, or we live in a brown community.” Valpy said unless there is some shift in inequality or people’s sense that progress is lost, ordered populism is here for the long haul. According to Ivan Pak and the PPC, the principles guiding Canadian values are freedom, personal responsibility, respect and fairness. Pak was a vocal opponent of the provincial education inclusion program for sexual identity and gender fluidity. He ran unsuccessfully on that platform for school trustee in Richmond in last fall’s municipal election. As president of the PPC Richmond Centre EDA, he isn’t eligible to vote in Monday’s byelection. The PPC has promised to lower taxes, abolish corporate welfare and stop supply management. On Thursday, Bernier also said he would privatize Canada Post and abolish the CRTC. The party has formed electoral district associations in all of Canada’s 338 ridings and Bernier has said he will run a full slate of candidates in October’s general election.

Pak said he was no longer keen on the Conservatives because the party has a “lack of leadership ability” (referring to its leader, Andrew Scheer) and “no clean platform.” He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “When you ask a question in the House of Commons, he never answers it. Is the question period just a joke? It looks like drama,” he said. “Our country is in debt and that debt has to be paid somehow. It will be my children and grandchildren suffering.” Pak was one of many other Chinese-Canadians greeting Bernier when he visited his Burnaby South byelection candidate — and one of his first picks under the new PPC banner — Laura-Lynn Thompson. She is a former Christian radio host, anti-abortion activist and a vocal opponent of B.C.’s student education plan on sexual orientation and gender fluidity, with ties to several community churches. Thompson told the Star last week she’s been able to mobilize the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote — and those ties may explain why. During each byelection debate, Thompson directly appealed to prevalent anxieties in the riding about public safety as she repeatedly brought up the case of Marrisa Shen, a 13-year-old girl killed in a Burnaby South park in July 2017. A Syrian refugee has been charged with murder in her death.

Meanwhile, several PPC supporters at the event on Thursday told the Star they were “sick” of identity politics at play in Canada. Sherolinnah Eang said she became a full-fledged PPC supporter after hearing the messaging about “family values and free speech.” “This is the first time I’ve come out for something like this, and I’ve lived in Canada for 45 years,” she said. Burnaby has four distinct town “centres,” a long working-class history and a population density triple that of the region. Its demographics are increasingly young and non-white, according to the 2016 census, and the average age is several years below B.C.’s average, while 64 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority. On Thursday, Bernier argued diversity is not Canada’s strength — it’s unity. Asked how that message would land in such an ethnically diverse riding, he responded: “Yes, but they are Canadians first.” The response prompted cheers from PPC supporters, with several shouting: “I’m an immigrant.” Thompson, who uttered “Canadians first” at every byelection debate, will face off against federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — vying for his first seat in the House of Commons — Liberal Richard Lee, Conservative Jay Shin and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood on Monday in Burnaby South. Byelections will also be held that day in York—Simcoe, Ont. and in Outremont, Que. David Moscrop, author of the new book Too Dumb for Democracy? Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones, and a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Ottawa’s communications department, told the Star that while feelings of anti-globalism and xenophobia have always existed, they haven’t always had an electoral home. Moscrop said this is the perfect time for the PPC to do well because it can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate. And there’s enough disaffection, which could express itself as support for the right-wing party. “This party didn’t even exist 15 minutes ago, so if (Laura-Lynn Thompson) can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more likely PPC voters than would self-report ... because sometimes people won’t admit something to a pollster. But behind the privacy of the voting screen? Many may mark an X for that candidate.” Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food, culture and policy.

The remarks by Jody Wilson-Raybould, made during almost four hours of sometimes dramatic testimony to the House of Commons justice committee, deepened the worst crisis of Trudeau’s tenure months before an October election.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

“I therefore completely disagree with (Wilson-Raybould’s) characterization of events,” he added, brushing off a demand from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer that he step down.

The case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“This pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she said, adding that some officials had made veiled threats unless she cooperated.

The head of the federal civil service, she said, told her that Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

Wilson-Raybould said those exchanges prompted her to think of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when the U.S. attorney general and his top deputy quit rather than obey an order from President Richard Nixon to fire an investigator probing the Watergate scandal.

She added, however, under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly demoted in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

‘NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION’

SNC-Lavalin was seeking a so-called deferred prosecution agreement to allow the firm to escape with a fine. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial but decided against it. A trial is pending for the company.

SNC-Lavalin has said it had sought to avoid a trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing had left the company and it had overhauled its ethics and compliance systems.

SNC-Lavalin is based in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Wilson-Raybould said officials cited the danger that the firm might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

She cited several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau as among those weighing in. A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould said that during a Sept. 17 meeting with Trudeau, he asked her “to find a solution” for SNC-Lavalin.

“I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role? ... I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said: ‘No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.’”

Trudeau told the news conference that “our government will always focus on jobs” and said officials had discussed the implications of SNC-Lavalin cutting its workforce.

Wilson-Raybould said that in mid-December, her chief of staff expressed concerns about possible political interference during a chat with Butts.

Citing her chief of staff’s account of the exchange, Wilson-Raybould quoted Butts as saying: “There is no solution here that does not involve some interference.”","Ex-Canada minister to discuss ethics issues, may not tell all",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QG2Q3

Two United Steelworkers Union (USW) locals issued a news release Wednesday saying some steelworkers went to Bratina's Ottawa office to talk about worker benefits and pensions.

They say, in a letter sent to Bratina, that he shouted ""f--k the steelworkers"" and ""f--k those Stelco pensioners"" before ""demanding they leave [his] office"" and ""violently"" slamming the door behind them.

The union is demanding an apology from Bratina, a former mayor of Hamilton.

The Hamilton East-Stoney Creek MP didn't address the specific details, but he acknowledged the Tuesday meeting was tense.

In an emailed statement, Bratina said he met with the Canadian Labour Congress Tuesday, including members of the steelworker locals.

""During the course of this meeting, the conversation became personal,"" said Bratina, who chairs an all-party steel caucus.

""It was clear that a productive conversation was not going to take place and I ended the meeting. As they were leaving, I assured them that we would continue to work hard for steelworkers and their employers despite this meeting.""

USW Local 1005 president Gary Howe said the members questioned Bratina about bankruptcy and insolvency laws.

""When they asked him why he hasn't kept his promise to advocate on behalf of Hamilton steelworkers to get the laws changed, he lost his temper and started shouting obscenities and saying very nasty things about steelworkers,"" Howe said in a news release.

Tony Ciaramella, president of Local 5328, said in the release that the steelworkers asked ""a legitimate question.""

""Not once has he stood in the house and said anything about changing the laws and protecting current or retired steelworkers,"" Ciaramella said.

​In an email, Howe and Ciaramella demand that Bratina ""do the right thing and publicly apologize immediately and unreservedly.""

Current and retired steelworkers have faced a wave of uncertainty in recent years. That wave has included recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in the U.S. that had some fearing for their jobs. In 2016, U.S. Steel Canada went into Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) protection, and steelworker pensioners' health-care benefits were temporarily paused.

Bratina, like other Hamilton MPs, campaigned on helping steelworkers, and has attended rallies both as an MP and when he was mayor of Hamilton.

Bratina said in the email that he respects unions, which ""play a key role in upholding the rights and protections of Canadian workers.""

""Canada's labour movement has led the way on work-life balance, safe working conditions and employment equity and diversity. Our government shares many of the same values and beliefs as the labour movement, and we need to continue working together to build on the success of the past three years.""

Scott Duvall, NDP MP for Hamilton Mountain, also serves on the all-party steel caucus. He's also a retired steelworker who recently introduced Bill 384, which would see pensioners become secure creditors when a company liquidates.

Duvall said news of the clash between Bratina and the steelworkers rippled through a Canadian Labour Congress social he attended.

""When I heard it, I was shocked,"" he said.

Duvall served on Hamilton city council when Bratina was mayor, he said, and ""he's had a few outbursts before.""

David Sweet, Conservative MP for Flamborough-Glanbrook, is vice-chair of the caucus.

He agrees more needs to be done for steelworkers and pensioners, although he wants to see a ""full hearing"" into the three acts that impact pensions.

He declined to comment on the incident. ""I'll let Mr. Bratina defend himself on that.""

The truth about Styrofoam

Is the right to repair ready for prime time?

(Michaela Rehle/Reuters)

When Michael Coteau's daughter dropped his Samsung Galaxy S8 this past fall, cracking it all over, the Ontario Liberal MPP kept using it for a while.

""But then it started irritating my ear, because the glass was kind of breaking apart,"" he said.

It's greener to repair such a device than recycle it and buy a new one — Nicole Mortillaro has pointed out how environmentally damaging it is to manufacture mobile devices. Recycling and disposal is also energy intensive, and many parts end up in the landfill.

But as CBC reported last fall, manufacturers often make it expensive and difficult to get devices repaired. They force customers to use ""authorized"" shops that often charge more than it would cost to buy a new device, restrict access to spare parts and manuals or even use software to render devices unusable if they've undergone ""unauthorized"" repair.

Coteau wanted to repair his Samsung, but given the aforementioned challenges, he ended up replacing it with a new phone. ""It's a waste,"" he said. ""It was a working device.""

These repair issues don't apply just to mobile devices, but increasingly to vehicles and smart appliances, from TVs to washing machines.

The good news is governments are starting to fight back with ""right to repair"" legislation. Last week, Coteau introduced a private member's bill amending Ontario's Consumer Protection Act that represents the first right to repair legislation ever proposed in Canada.

The bill would force brands to:

Provide consumers or electronics repair shops with replacement parts, software and tools for diagnosing, maintaining or repairing their products, for a fair price.

Provide electronic documents such as repair manuals for free.

Reset any electronic security that may disable the device during diagnosis, maintenance or repair.

Coteau said the goal is to reduce environmental waste, allow repairs to be made locally and encourage innovation.

The ""right to repair"" movement is picking up around the world for different kinds of products. Similar legislation for electronics is being considered in 18 U.S. states. A bill passed in Massachusetts in 2012 after a public referendum already requires car manufacturers to provide documents to allow anyone to repair their vehicles.

The U.S. also modified rules last fall allowing consumers to legally hack software in their devices as needed for repair and maintenance. In Europe, proposed right to repair legislation covers appliances such as fridges and washing machines.

Because Coteau isn't a member of Ontario's ruling party, his private member's bill may be stuck in debate for awhile.

In the meantime, here's some good news: ""Dumb"" devices — i.e. gadgets that don't contain a computer chip, like radios or blenders — can often be fixed for free at volunteer-run ""repair cafes"" across the country.

Meet a 12-year-old Canadian climate striker

(Andrew Gage)

If you've been following the news at all, you've likely heard about the youth-led protests worldwide in favour of greater climate action. The best-known participant is Sweden's Greta Thunberg, who has been skipping school every Friday since August to ""strike for climate."" The forthright 16-year-old, who has chastised adults at both the COP24 climate conference in December and the World Economic Forum in January, has inspired many young people — including 12-year-old Rebecca Wolf Gage (above).

Wolf Gage attends Shoreline Community Middle School in Victoria, and on the first Friday of every month, she and other students leave class and march down to the mayor's office to discuss local green initiatives.

What first inspired you to become involved in raising awareness of climate change?

My dad is very environmental, and he taught me about climate change from a young age. He inspires me almost every day, but didn't tell me to take on activism. Greta Thunberg also inspires me so much. If you have time to watch her interviews, please do. They are amazing! When I was five, I decided to support the Green Party even though my parents usually voted for a different party. That was when I realized that I was an environmental activist.

What has been the reaction of your teachers?

My teachers aren't supportive of me striking, but they're not unsympathetic. I have heard that some of the other strikers have less sympathetic teachers, and I'm lucky to have good ones at Shoreline Community Middle School.

Do you think your fellow students understand the importance of stopping climate change?

I find that most of my classmates either don't think that climate change is a big deal, or don't think there's any way to stop it. But I have a lot of friends who I strike with that are as passionate as I am about stopping climate change.

What sorts of climate-friendly ideas have you pitched to the mayor?

We started meeting with the mayor two months ago. Lisa Helps is the best mayor I've ever met around environmental issues. Many of us have addressed the CRD [Capital Regional District] board, where they announced the climate emergency resolution, brought forward by Mayor Helps. We have also set a goal of getting free bus passes for kids 18 and under throughout the CRD.

What are you planning in the coming months to keep this issue on people's minds?

For the coming months, we're going to try to advertise the climate strike as much as possible. On May 3, it's a huge national climate strike. In the summer, we are thinking about holding an environmental summer camp for youth to come learn about climate change and the climate strike. We have done a one-day enviro school before, and it was a success.

If you could do one thing to take this fight to the next level, what would it be?

If I could convince the Canadian government to set high climate targets and actually meet them, my dream would have come true. I think for now, an easier thing to do is to get 1,000 climate strikers in Victoria.

The Big Picture: Tidal power

In seeking ways to generate electricity, jurisdictions around the world inevitably look at their natural endowments. For countries with especially choppy waters, that has included tidal power, which exploits the kinetic energy of changing tides. Here's a look at the biggest tidal power projects in the world.

(CBC)

What's on your mind?

Nicole Mortillaro's story last week on OOM, a Canadian company that has created a standalone, off-grid power unit for large buildings, stirred a lot of interest — both positive and negative.

One reader wrote in to say, ""I started to get a little concerned when I learned that it takes companies off the grid, which in Ontario largely provides energy from clean sources, and will be providing electricity from natural gas.""

Another reader had this suggestion: ""The country does not need OOM or anything else. What it needs is reliable electricity hidden underground!"" The idea of burying power lines has been bandied about for a while — with the acknowledgement that it is a very expensive undertaking.

Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web

A new study suggests that the expansion of our urban environment is leading more animals to ingest ""human food,"" which is affecting their biology and behaviour. One example: Some bears are hibernating for shorter periods.

Canadian political watchers know that the popularity of the federal NDP has been flagging, notably in Quebec. This column suggests that in order to win back a large number of (environmentally minded) Quebecers, Jagmeet Singh's party should propose a Canadian version of the Green New Deal.

One big takeaway from this week: Government policies to reduce carbon emissions work. That was the finding of a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, which revealed that between 2005 and 2015, CO2 levels in 18 countries (including many European countries and the U.S. — but not Canada) declined.

In what seems like poetic environmental justice, a research team led by RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, has figured out a carbon capture process that sucks CO2 out of the air and turns it into … coal.



Styrofoam and the environment: It's complicated

(Emily Chung/CBC)

Amid all the recent talk of banning plastic, many environmentally conscious consumers wonder: What about Styrofoam?

Also known as plastic foam, the scientific term for it is expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), and it can be found in everything from takeout containers to helmets to car bumpers.

The worldwide production capacity of polystyrene in 2016 was 14.7 million tonnes, according to industry group Plastics Insight. It is estimated that 80 per cent of Canada's foam packaging ends up in the garbage, contributing to the eight million tonnes of plastic annually discarded in oceans.

According to Science Learning Hub, it can take up to 500 years for one foam cup to break down.

Indianapolis-based plastic manufacturing expert Kelvin Okamato points out that there are two common versions of polystyrene: expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) and extruded polystyrene foam (XPS). EPS is used to create foam cups and takeout containers, whereas XPS is used to make packing material as well as insulation board for buildings.

The main reason polystyrene is so ubiquitous is that it is lightweight, rigid, versatile and able to withstand dramatic temperature changes. According to a 2016 study, 40 per cent of polystyrene is made for the food packaging industry — and EPS foam containers in the industry are at an all-time high.

Food Safety Magazine has noted that polystyrene foam trays are economically beneficial because they are cheap to produce and dispose of, and the fact that they're single-use helps with food safety.

While styrofoam has long seemed like an environmental villain, a recent European-based study found that manufacturing EPS containers has a lower environmental impact — minimal material and electricity requirements for manufacture — than two other common takeaway containers, which are made of aluminum and polypropylene.

Alberta-based manufacturing expert Odessa Ingarfield said the main problem is that polystyrene isn't manufactured to be recycled. In many places around the globe, polystyrene is difficult to recycle because its petroleum base is hard to break down, while the lightweight and clunky shape makes it expensive to transport.

So much of it gets thrown out.

""Designers now are asked to design a product, but not the recyclability of that product,"" said Ingarfield.

She believes that rather than banning EPS production, companies should be finding a way to repurpose it through a closed-loop recycling process, where waste is collected, processed and recycled back to its original material, or a two-stage processing facility.

Okamato and Ingarfield both believe changes to consumer behaviour will improve the environmental impact of polystyrene, and plastics more generally.

""If you want to use plastics, then make sure you know what you are using it for,"" said Ingarfield. ""If you plan on leaving [the item] behind to degrade, then don't use plastics.""

The former federal justice minister told the Commons justice committee yesterday that she faced ""veiled threats"" from the Prime Minister's Office this fall to ensure the Montreal-based company avoided prosecution on bribery and corruption charges.

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould said officials repeatedly invoked potential job losses, and the context of the recent Quebec election, as reasons for offering a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Premier François Legault, whose Coalition Avenir Québec party swept to power in that election, reiterated Thursday his support for an out-of-court settlement.

Legault campaigned on a promise to do more to keep Quebec companies from leaving the province. Since the election, he has said repeatedly that a protracted court case could make SNC-Lavalin vulnerable to a foreign takeover.

""There was already a risk. Is the risk heightened now? Yes,"" Legault told reporters in Quebec City. ""The company currently has no controlling shareholder.""

But Legault's own justice minister, former anti-corruption prosecutor Sonia Lebel, said her main concern was Wilson-Raybould's allegations of political interference.

""If what was said is true, it's troubling because we have to put our institutions [first], to protect them, and make sure there is no undue pressure,"" Lebel said.

""What is troubling is that it may have happened.""

Lebel pledged to never interfere with the decisions of the provincial prosecutors working under her. Court documents indicate they too could be called upon soon to decide whether to prosecute SNC-Lavalin.

The RCMP is working with the Quebec Crown in an ongoing investigation into a bribery scandal at the Federal Bridge Corporation.

Michel Fournier, the former head of the bridge corporation, pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped SNC-Lavalin secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge.

""I have no intention whatsoever to intervene in this matter,"" Lebel said. ""The rule of law is very important and we all live under it.""

'Why should I not believe her​?'

Wilson-Raybould's testimony also elicited mixed reactions on the other side of the aisle. At least two Liberal MNAs pointed out that the federal Liberal Party is a separate entity from its provincial namesake.

""Why should I not believe her,"" said Marwah Rizqy, who represents the Montreal riding of Saint-Laurent and who ran unsuccessfully for the federal Liberals in the 2015 election.

""If she said she faced pressure, then now the prime minister of Canada has to answer for that.""

Her colleague Gaétan Barrette, though, sounded more sympathetic to Justin Trudeau's position.

""I can say one thing: If I would have been in his place, the issue of maintaining those jobs would have been very significant for me,"" said Barrette, a cabinet minister in the last Liberal government.

He also pointed out that Wilson-Raybould herself said nothing illegal had been done, a detail he felt was being lost amid the controversy.

In a statement posted to Twitter, the member for Whitby, Ont., explained she had informed the prime minister and party whip of her ""tremendously difficult"" decision on Feb. 12.

She also stressed that her choice wasn't related to the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair and the testimony of her caucus colleague Jody Wilson-Raybould, who this week described interference by the prime minister and high-level government officials over her decision not to offer a deferred prosecution deal to the Quebec company.

She added she had immense respect for the former justice minister and attorney general and that would never change. The MP had commented several times on Twitter in support of Wilson-Raybould during the unfolding events surrounding her resignation from cabinet.

""Factors influencing this decision started long before Feb.12,"" the statement says. ""It is a personal decision, based on a number of factors.""

Caesar-Chavannes said her mind had been made up for months, dating back to before she decided not to continue as a parliamentary secretary in September.

She thanked her colleagues on both sides of the aisle for continuing to ""fight the good fight"" for Canadians.

Understanding some might be upset by her decision to step back from federal politics, she encouraged others —especially those who feel underrepresented — to run for public office.

""I will continue to push boundaries, dismantle the status quo and break glass ceilings, and I hope you will expect no less from me.""

Caesar-Chavannes had been a strong advocate for fighting the stigma around mental health. She was open about her own struggles with depression.

Twitter stand-off with Maxime Bernier

She also was known for calling out people for offensive remarks, including now-leader of the People's Party of Canada Maxime Bernier.

For months, the two were locked in a social media battle about identity politics.

In the spring of 2018, Bernier tweeted that Caesar-Chavannes believes ""the world revolves around"" her ""skin colour."" That was in response to Caesar-Chavannes chiding him in an interview with the Globe and Mail.

The feud began in March, when Bernier criticized the Liberal government's promotion of funding for ""racialized Canadians"" and said he thought the goal of anti-racism policy was to create a ""colour-blind"" society.

Caesar-Chavannes fired back, suggesting Bernier ""do some research ... as to why stating colour blindness as a defence actually contributes to racism.""

""Please check your privilege and be quiet,"" she added — provoking Bernier to invoke ""free speech.""

Elected in 2015, she served as the parliamentary secretary to the prime minister and to the minister of international development.

Trudeau, who disputed Wilson-Raybould’s allegations and rejected an opposition call that he resign, got the support on Thursday of a top ally inside his Cabinet, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside his Liberal Party to oust him over the scandal.

SNC-Lavalin has about 9,000 employees in Canada, including about 3,400 in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in a federal election this October to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Here are some key facts about the case and the company at the center of the controversy.

WHAT IS SNC-LAVALIN’S INVOLVEMENT?

Montreal-based construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada with bribing Libyan officials to influence the awarding of contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The company had tried unsuccessfully to avoid trial, arguing instead for a negotiated settlement since it had cleaned shop by changing executives and overhauling its ethics and compliance systems in recent years. The preliminary hearings in the case are ongoing, SNC-Lavalin spokeswoman Daniela Pizzuto said on Thursday.

Neil Bruce, who took over as SNC-Lavalin’s chief executive in 2015 and led its C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) acquisition of British engineering and consultancy WS Atkins two years later, said the firm had done “nothing wrong” in the political crisis. and that “we have never asked for charges to be dropped.”

WHAT IS AT STAKE?

Canadian government officials said they were concerned about the potential for job losses, especially in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec.

“The consequences for the economy are always very important and my staff are always talking to other people in government to ensure that we consider the need to protect jobs,” Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters on Thursday.

Wilson-Raybould told a hearing on Wednesday that officials in the offices of Trudeau and Morneau had cited the risk of SNC-Lavalin cutting jobs or moving its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty. The company faces being barred from bidding on Canadian contracts for 10 years.

In 2016, SNC-Lavalin admitted that some former executives had illegally arranged donations of more than C$80,000 to the Liberals from 2004 to 2011.

The company is also facing pressures on its bottom line as an August 2018 dispute between Canada and Saudi Arabia weighs on its contracts in the Middle East kingdom. SNC-Lavalin also wrote down C$1.2 billion in oil and gas assets, which resulted in a C$1.6 billion fourth-quarter loss.

COMPANY SNAPSHOT

The company generated total revenue of C$10 billion ($7.6 billion) in 2018. About 10 percent of total revenues came from Saudi Arabia. It employed 52,435 at the end of December, with over 15 percent working in Saudi Arabia.

As of year’s end 2018, SNC-Lavalin reported a total backlog of C$14.9 billion and had $634.1 million of cash and cash equivalents.",Factbox: Political storm engulfing Canada's Trudeau puts SNC-Lavalin in focus,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-factbox-idUSKCN1QH2ZT
118,Empty,2019-02-26T09:00:00Z,"Scheer ought to have made a distinction between his support for Canadian oil workers, and support for the racism and violence that has been associated with United We Roll.","Many of the participants in last week's United We Roll convoy said they were there to unite Canadians around a pipeline. Others had more specific goals: to see the Liberal government cancel bills C-69 and C-48, which critics charge will act as enormous industry obstacles.

But as several observers noted watching the convoy make its way to Ottawa from Alberta, United We Roll had also become a space for far-right groups to spew racism and xenophobia. Signs denouncing open borders, protesting Canada signing on to the global migration pact and accusing the prime minister of treason hung alongside signs supporting pipelines. Some convoy participants wore hats that said ""Make Canada Great Again,"" a nod to U.S. President Donald Trump's slogan that has become associated with denigrating Mexicans, asylum seekers and banning Muslims from entering the U.S.

Because the convoy has become affiliated with such unsettling rhetoric, unwavering support from high-profile Conservative politicians — such as Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who addressed the group last week — is troubling, and could potentially hurt the party's chances in the upcoming fall election.

Tapping into frustration

It's clear why Conservative politicians would want to support the rally. With seemingly endless controversy swirling around Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his role in pressuring (or not) former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould over SNC-Lavalin, the Conservatives surely want to seize the opportunity to marry new political scandal with longstanding frustration over pipeline inertia. And with Maxime Bernier trying to make inroads with the further right areas of the party's base, Conservatives need to show unwavering support for western Canada, pipelines and the oil and gas industry.

But Scheer ought to have made a distinction between his support for Canadian oil workers, and support for the racism and violence that has been associated with United We Roll. Conservative Senator David Tkachuk even told the crowd to ""roll over"" Liberals across the country, and he has since refused to apologize.

The rally has also been associated with Yellow Vests Canada, a group whose Facebook page is rife with racist and xenophobic views, particularly towards Muslims and immigrants. In fact, the United We Roll convoy was originally named the Yellow Vest Convoy, but was changed due to the obviously problematic association.

Members of the Yellow Vests Canada Facebook group have advocated for MP Iqra Khalid to be deported, called visible minorities sub-human and scum, and made death threats against the prime minister. Despite that, United We Roll lead organizer Glen Carritt implied that everyone would be welcome to attend (""It doesn't matter — you can wear a yellow vest, or blue coveralls or black hardhat or suit and tie,"" he said) and Yellow Vest organizer Mark Friesen was indeed in attendance.

One of the speakers at the rally was Faith Goldy, who was fired from Rebel Media after appearing on a neo-Nazi podcast, and who regularly bemoans the erosion of ""white identity."" Scheer spoke on the same platform that she did, ignoring what should be a toxic association.

On Tuesday a convoy of trucks arrived in Ottawa. The rolling protest is driven by Canadians who want pipelines, hate carbon taxes and are calling for more help for the Alberta economy. But there is another element: some in the group have also been protesting immigration and using hateful, racist, language. Today on Front Burner, CBC's David Common and Rosemary Barton explain the complicated politics around this protest. 25:58

With recent polls showing the Conservatives are in a position to form government, the party needs to start clarifying what, exactly, it stands for.

Before the last federal election in 2015, Conservatives were riding high in the polls and a renewed government was within reach. But in late September and early October, the Conservatives doubled-down on their previous decision to ban the niqab in citizenship ceremonies and pledged to implement a tip line for ""barbaric cultural practices."" Almost a week after this announcement, Conservatives declined in the polls and never recovered.

The unwillingness to address — or even acknowledge — these racist and xenophobic undercurrents in United We Roll plays right into progressive messaging that the party is too cozy with the far-right. It also puts the party at risk of alienating centrists in swing ridings who would otherwise be open to voting for Conservatives, but are hesitant to align themselves with a party that refuses to even acknowledge (never mind denounce) hateful views.

Scheer could have spoken at the United We Roll rally by telling protestors he supports their efforts with regards to the oil and gas industry, while simultaneously chastising the bigoted rhetoric. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)

It could also point to an absence of political courage. During the presidential election in 2008, Republican John McCain defended Barack Obama against racist questions from audience members during a town hall event. Scheer could just as easily have spoken at the United We Roll rally by telling protestors he supports their efforts with regards to the oil and gas industry, while simultaneously chastising the racist and xenophobic rhetoric that was circulating.

Instead, Scheer simply stated: ""We're standing with you.""

That made it easy for critics to paint Conservatives as bowing to pressures of the far-right. The question for Canadians now becomes, are the Conservatives out of touch, or willfully ignoring this rhetoric? And if elected prime minister, would Scheer remain silent if people continue to publicly spew this hate?

The Conservatives' failure to draw a line in the sand between legitimate grievances about the oil and gas industry and illegitimate grievances about immigrants, Muslims and minorities will ultimately hamper the party's ability to reconnect with voters in diverse urban and suburban communities across the country. Voters they will desperately need to win October's election.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The leader of Canada's main opposition party demanded on Wednesday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quit after a former justice minister said government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major firm avoid a bribery trial.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

""In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau's principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Opinion polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election in October.

Ex-justice minister and ex-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould called it ""incredibly inappropriate"" but said she didn't think it was illegal because she wasn't instructed to seek a settlement. She said 11 people tried to interfere in her prosecutorial discretion including Trudeau.

In a meeting with Trudeau, the prime minister raised the issue and asked her to ""help out"" with the case, she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she asked Trudeau if he was politically interfering with her role as attorney general and told him she would strongly advise against it.

""No, no, no. We just need to find a solution,"" she said Trudeau responded.

She said Trudeau told her that if Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin didn't get a deferred prosecution there would be jobs lost and the company would move its headquarters from Montreal to London and noted he was a lawmaker from Quebec. Wilson-Raybould said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by members of the government.

Trudeau disputed her view of events.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, and therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events,"" he said at a news conference.

Trudeau said the decision on whether to forgo prosecution and enter a plea agreement with the company was hers and hers alone.

He also welcomed the investigation of the ethics commissioner while he rejected calls by the leader of the opposition Conservative Party to resign, saying Canadians will have a choice later this year in parliamentary elections.

""My job as prime minister is to stand up for jobs. I have done that and will continue to do that. That is a fundamental role of a Canadian prime minister,"" Trudeau said.

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer also said police should investigate and called Trudeau a disgraced prime minister. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition NDP, said there should be a public inquiry but stopped short of calling for Trudeau to step down.

""He may need to resign because of this,"" he said. ""What we heard today was explosive.""

Trudeau's government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 that Trudeau or his staff pressured her to try to avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya. Critics say that would be improper political meddling in a legal case.

""For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she told a Parliament justice committee.

The scandal has been a significant blow to Trudeau, who is facing an election this year.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's closet adviser, resigned last week but denied that he or anyone else pressured Wilson-Raybould. Michael Wernick, the top civil servant in the government, has also said that no inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12 as veteran affairs minister but gave no reasons. She had been unexpectedly demoted from justice minister last month, and was furious, releasing a 2,000-word statement after that.

""I was concerned I was shuffled because of a decision I would not take with SNC, I raised those concerns with the PM,"" she said. ""Those concerns were denied.""

Wilson-Raybould compared the situation to President Richard Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre"" firing of the independent special prosecutor overseeing the Watergate investigation in 1973.

The Globe and Mail's report this month said Trudeau's office pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The agreement would have allowed the company to pay reparations but avoid a criminal trial on charges of corruption and bribery.

With the sound defeat of his five opponents, the New Democratic Party leader put to rest murmurs within his party that a defeat at the polls could throw the NDP into a leadership crisis scant months from the next federal election.

“My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” Singh told jubilant supporters at a Hilton hotel in Burnaby during his victory speech.

“Guess what? We just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can.”

Singh, a former lawyer who had served as a provincial politician in Ontario, became the first member of a visible minority to lead a national political party in Canada when he won the NDP leadership in 2017, but Monday’s byelection gives him his first seat in the House of Commons.

Singh’s victory was marred by the NDP’s loss in Outremont, the Montreal riding that served as a launching pad for the orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

Lawyer Rachel Bendayan reclaimed the riding for the Liberals with 42 per cent of the vote, even as the governing party struggles with the fallout from allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt criminal proceedings against Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

In a third byelection Monday, the Conservatives handily hung on to the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, which had been held since 2004 by former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan. Scot Davidson took 53 per cent of the vote for the Tories, well ahead of Liberal Shaun Tanaka with 30 per cent.

Singh jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, finishing with about 39 per cent of the vote, beating Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee who finished second with about 26 per cent. Conservative Jay Shin finished in third place with roughly 23 per cent, while Laura-Lynn Thompson finished fourth with about 11 per cent, running with the People’s Party of Canada, the nascent party launched last year by failed federal Conservative leadership candidate Maxime Bernier. A pair of independent candidates, Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, rounded out the ballot.

Singh thanked his competitors for contributing to the democratic process.

Lee, speaking after his concession speech, said he didn’t think the SNC-Lavalin controversy had a major impact on the Burnaby byelection.

“I didn’t hear anything (about SNC-Lavalin) on the doorsteps,” Lee said. “All we heard was the local issues, and transportation, and how to support our young people so they can stay and work in our community. Those are the local issues, I believe, that are in people’s minds.”

Lee was a longtime MLA representing Burnaby North for the B.C. Liberals for four consecutive terms until he was defeated soundly in the 2017 provincial election, by the NDP’s Janet Routledge. He took over as the Liberal candidate from day-care operator and political hopeful Karen Wang, who bowed out after writing an online post that singled out Singh’s ethnicity.

Stakes were high for Singh and the NDP. Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said in a television interview on CTV last month that it would be “extremely difficult” for Singh to stay on as leader if he lost in Burnaby.

The Burnaby South seat had been vacated by former MP and now Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart. Stewart told Postmedia last Friday that he had been out door-knocking with Singh last week, and “it felt really good on the ground.”

“I feel good that he’ll win there, and I think having him in the House of Commons will be not just good for the NDP but good for the country,” Stewart said.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South and the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person.”

“I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia. “His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The by-election fell as the federal Liberals are dealing with fallout from a scandal around allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office may have inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. After the controversy, Wilson-Raybould resigned her position in cabinet, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned his position.

Singh referenced oil and gas extraction, pharmaceutical profits and the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal in his victory speech. “People should be angry,” he said.

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said voters who put Singh in office “were saying they want a fighter … someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Justin Trudeau's right-hand-man says the prime minister did nothing improper as a deepening political crisis threatens the government's re-election chances. Here's what you need to know.

In a nutshell

Mr Trudeau has been accused of pressuring his former attorney general to cut a deal with a company facing corruption charges - and retaliating when she refused to play ball.

The revelations could cost Trudeau the October general election, some pundits say.

The former AG, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and his staff spent months trying to convince her that taking the company to trial would cost Canadians jobs, and their party votes.

She also says she was subject to ""veiled threats"", which she believes were made good when she was shuffled out of her department.

Now another minister, Jane Philpott, has quit saying it was ""untenable"" for her to continue due to ""serious concerns"" raised by the case.

But Gerald Butts, Mr Trudeau's former principal secretary, says there was no political pressure - only concerns for how the prosecution could affect local economies.

Who are the players?

The spurned ex-minister: Jody Wilson-Raybould was Canada's attorney general and justice minister. Unlike in the UK, the two roles are held by the same person.

She was also Canada's first indigenous justice minister and worked on a number of pieces of landmark legislation, including legalising cannabis and assisted dying.

In January, she was shuffled from the justice department to the department of veterans' affairs - a move many saw as a demotion.

The corporation: SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company faces fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was in power.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The PM: Justin Trudeau is Canada's prime minister. He won a majority government in 2015 on a platform of transparency, gender equality and a commitment to reconciliation with Canada's indigenous peoples.

He faces a federal election in October 2019.

The Trudeau ally who quit: Jane Philpott is described as one of his most trusted ministers.

But her resignation statement explaining why she was quitting as Treasury Board president could not have been more pointed.

Citing the SNC-Lavallin affair, she said: ""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Trudeau's right-hand man: Gerald Butts has been described as the ""most important Liberal in Canada today"" whose last name is not ""Trudeau"". But all that changed in February, when Mr Butts resigned amid rumours he had pressured the justice minister to cut a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

Mr Butts is one of Mr Trudeau's closest allies, and the two have been friends since their university days in Montreal.

He is credited with helping Mr Trudeau win the Liberal party leadership in 2013 and was a key architect in the Liberal party's sweeping 2015 electoral victory.

Why would Trudeau care about SNC-Lavalin?

SNC-Lavalin is based in Quebec, a swing province that has long been viewed as essential ground for the Liberal Party to win during an election - which is coming up in October.

When the Liberals win Quebec, they often win a majority of seats in parliament. When they lose, they lose badly.

At the time that Wilson-Raybould says she was being pressured to cut a deal, Quebec was also in the middle of a heated provincial election that eventually led to the ousting of Quebec Liberal premier Philippe Couillard.

Wilson-Raybould says the federal Liberal Party kept raising the Quebec election as one of the reasons why she should consider cutting a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

What does Trudeau say?

Trudeau has denied wrongdoing and says any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with her ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

What could the fallout be?

Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerald Butts has already resigned.

Many speculate that other top officials that Wilson-Raybould named may follow.

Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating Wilson-Raybould's accusations to see if any conflict-of-interest rules were broken. For her part, Wilson-Raybould says she believes no laws were broken, but that the prime minister's office acted improperly.

But the real question is what this could mean for Trudeau and his election in the fall.

Conservative leader of the opposition Andrew Scheer has already called for Trudeau's resignation, saying he no longer has the ""moral authority"" to lead.

That seems unlikely, but what is likely - at least according to columnist Chantal Hebert and other political pundits - is that ""the Liberals will likely go in the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin albatross still hanging around their party's neck"".",Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould: The scandal that could unseat Canada's PM - BBC News,Bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47408239

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

""In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau's principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Opinion polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election in October.

126,Empty,2019-02-28T14:42:26Z,Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday about political interference for SNC-Lavalin.,"OTTAWA — Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday that she was told to interfere in the prosecution of Quebec contractor, SNC-Lavalin. The Official Opposition says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has no option but to resign.

The political interference from the Prime Minister’s Office was apparently all about getting corruption charges against the company deferred in order to shore up Liberal Party support in the province of Quebec.

“For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin,” Wilson-Raybould told the committee. (RELATED: Trudeau Principal Secretary Gerald Butts Resigns In Wake Of Judicial Scandal)

Trudeau also participated in this “sustained effort,” according to Wilson-Raybould, and at one point he directly implied that Wilson-Raybould should consider the party’s political fortunes in Quebec. She described the incident when “the prime minister jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.'”

The former attorney general and justice minister says she was “taken aback” by the comment and posed “a direct question while looking him in the eye.”

“I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the attorney general? I would strongly advise against it.'”

Trudeau’s response appeared to be both a denial and an affirmation: “The prime minister said, ‘No, no, no – we just need to find a solution.'”

Official Opposition Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is demanding that Trudeau resign for political interference and says the Royal Canadian Mounted Police must investigate Wilson-Raybould’s enormous claims. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Scheer said Trudeau has no moral authority to govern Canada. (RELATED: Former Canadian AG Jody Wilson-Raybould Quits As Trudeau Embroiled In Growing Scandal)

“I was sickened and appalled by [Wilson-Raybould’s] story of inappropriate and, frankly, borderline illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest levels of Justin Trudeau’s government,” he said.

Trudeau said Wednesday he won’t resign and has essentially dismissed his former minister’s testimony as a fabrication.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” he said during an event in Montreal late Wednesday. “And therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events.”

While media continued to demand answers throughout Wednesday afternoon, the Liberal government tried to avoid the story. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale announced on Twitter that the federal government would be pardoning Canadians who had been charged with possession of marijuana before the drug was legalized.

Later today, I will give notice to introduce a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis. — Ralph Goodale (@RalphGoodale) February 27, 2019

Wilson-Raybould’s revolt is unprecedented in a Liberal Party that has dominated the Canadian political landscape for over a century by keeping caucus malcontents silent and demanding its Members of Parliament (MP) speak in unison. Suspicions that something was amiss in the Trudeau government were aroused when Trudeau demoted Wilson-Raybould from attorney general to Veterans Affairs minister last month following a cabinet shuffle.

The former minister will continue to sit as a Liberal MP for the time being. Wilson-Raybould, who is aboriginal, was seen as an example of Trudeau’s efforts to reach “reconciliation” with Canada’s First Nations.

Justin Trudeau's ship may be sinking, but he's not changing course.

The Canadian prime minister plowed ahead Thursday after his former attorney general alleged, in explosive testimony aired on national television, that he interfered in the justice system by pressing to end a criminal case against an iconic Quebec construction firm.

Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau insisted again his government had every right to consider the job losses that could result from a guilty verdict for SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

The scandal has suddenly made Trudeau vulnerable, consuming his Liberals in the run-up to an election in which he'd have otherwise have been the frontrunner.

He's lost his polling lead for the first time since June, and the controversy has undermined his personal brand as a progressive leader who single-handedly returned his moribund party to power in 2015 on a pledge of change.

""It's very damaging and it's very serious,"" said Penny Collenette, a University of Ottawa professor who served as director of appointments under a former Liberal prime minister. Every politician wants to protect jobs, she said.

""But I think the question that needs to be asked here is: at what cost?""

Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press via AP Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to supporters in February, 2019.

Trudeau's fate depends on several factors - including whether cabinet stands by him and the Liberals stay united. Only a handful of lawmakers have voiced any measure of support for Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit the Cabinet last month but remains a Liberal member of parliament. The prime minister hasn't decided yet whether to force her out of the party's caucus.

Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the center of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis.

""If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,"" Nanos said in a telephone interview.

""I can't remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can't even agree, how is it that they can govern?""

The latest polls already show the Liberals have lost their lead in voting intentions.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP Jody Wilson-Raybould speaks with the media after appearing in front of the Justice committee in Ottawa in February, 2019.

An aggregate of public opinion surveys maintained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp shows Trudeau's team with 33.9 per cent of the vote, below the Conservatives with 35.8 per cent.

What's hurting the prime minister is the extraordinary spectacle of a former high-ranking member of his government now emerging as its most powerful critic - and his rivals smell blood.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau's resignation and wrote the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking an investigation. The police force hasn't said whether or not it will look into the matter. New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh is demanding a public inquiry.

Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company.

""My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,"" Morneau told reporters in Toronto.

""I will continue do that. I think that's critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government.""

Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is embraced by former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould after delivering a speech on the recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights in February, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events. The former attorney general -- whose absence from cabinet will be filled in a shuffle Friday, according to CBC - may also end up testifying again.

But no current minister has broken ranks. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn't imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signaled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. ""At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,"" Freeland said.

Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the ""box of what's legal"" with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions.

""We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses.""

Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff.

""I remain very confident in the work of this government,"" Blair said.

Parliament adjourns on Friday for a two-week break, due to return in time for Morneau's March 19 budget. The path of the scandal could also depend on what Liberal lawmakers hear while away from Ottawa, in their home districts scattered across Canada.

""They're going to get earfuls,"" Collenette said. ""If the truth is really two perceptions, then voters will make up their minds. But they need facts.""",Justin Trudeau's party still backs him after bombshell testimony,Stuff.co.nz,https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/110978900/justin-trudeaus-party-still-backs-him-after-bombshell-testimony

Trudeau moved long-serving Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay to the veterans affairs portfolio to replace Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit on Feb 12 after less than a month in the job.

Wilson-Raybould testified on Wednesday that when she was justice minister last year, officials in the Liberal government leaned on her to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

Her remarks prompted the leader of the official opposition Conservative Party to demand Trudeau's resignation. Polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of a federal election set for this October.

Trudeau, who denies there was any wrongdoing, broke with tradition and did not take questions from reporters after the shuffle, which saw International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau replace MacAulay at agriculture.

Women's Minister Maryam Monsef took on the international development portfolio in addition to her current job.

130,Empty,2019-03-02T11:00:59Z,'The need for loyalty to the leader … at some point has to be sacrificed for what the individual believes is morally right.',"When Vancouver Granville MP Jody Wilson-Raybould levelled damning accusations at some of her Liberal colleagues in Ottawa this week, she joined a time-honoured list of maverick politicians from B.C. who have publicly challenged their leaders — and, in doing so, risked their political futures.

“I have huge respect for the way she conducted herself as a neutral attorney general,” said Brian Smith, who 30 years ago took a similar path, resigning as B.C.’s attorney-general over allegations of interference from the premier’s office.

“I know how she felt, because she gave up the job that she loved most, being attorney general. And it is a terrible emotional shock.”

In explosive testimony this week, Wilson-Raybould said she was fired as attorney-general in January because she refused to give in to “political interference” in a court case against construction giant SNC Lavalin, a large employer. Although she still sits as a Liberal MP, she broke from party ranks and accused 11 officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, Privy Council Office and Finance Department of trying to sway her decision as the country’s top lawyer.

In B.C., where politics is at times defined as a blood sport for the often-feisty dramatics at the legislature in Victoria, other politicians have taken similar stands that captured headlines. For some, the fallout killed their political careers, while others rose up from the political ashes to find success again as elected officials.

Perhaps the most parallel story to Wilson-Raybould’s took place in 1988, when Smith suddenly resigned, alleging he had confrontations with Socred premier Bill Vander Zalm’s office over two cases. Like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who denies any wrongdoing in the Wilson-Raybould affair, Vander Zalm insisted in 1988 he had not tried to interfere with Smith’s job.

Smith, though, argues both he and Wilson-Raybould took principled stands: “It’s pretty tough to uphold the neutrality of criminal investigations against the push of politicians. And the two come into a clash from time to time. And she was caught in an impossible vise.”

A former provincial Liberal cabinet minister, Bill Bennett, launched a similar fight in 2010 when, just after being fired as energy minister, he famously called then-premier Gordon Campbell a bully who was ruining their party by not stepping down as leader.

“The need for loyalty to the leader, the need for loyalty to the party, at some point has to be sacrificed for what the individual believes is morally right. And obviously that is the place (Wilson-Raybould) got to. And it’s a horrible place to be in,” Bennett recalled today. “It’s absolutely a no-win situation other than the person who does it knows in their heart it is the right thing to do.”

This phenomenon of outspoken B.C. politicians has crossed all party lines. Joy MacPhail, who had been the NDP’s finance minister, quit premier Glen Clark’s cabinet in July 1999, and would later say it was because Clark’s government had lost the trust of British Columbians. “I did this to save my party,” MacPhail said then.

B.C. has historically had a two-party system — typically a right-leaning free-enterprise party and the left-leaning NDP — which has led to polarization here, unlike in provinces with three dominant parties, said a University of B.C. political scientist, Gerald Baier.

“Because of (B.C.’s) polarization, it leads to rough and tumble politics, without much middle ground to fight over. That might mean that we have more characters and tolerance for people who are colourful because they can get away with it,” he said.

When B.C. politicians go to Ottawa, they can “bristle” at the way things are done in the more traditional central-Canada system, Baier said, recalling NDP MP Jim Fulton slapping a dead salmon on prime minister Brian Mulroney’s House of Commons desk during a 1985 debate about the sockeye fishery in B.C.

“Prime ministers always want to have a regionally representative cabinet, they work hard to have voices from different parts of the country. But the understanding is that the economic driver and the population driver is at the centre of the country — and the centre will win,” Baier said.

One of the reasons behind Wilson-Raybould’s willingness to provide her bombshell testimony this week may be linked to the long-standing belief in Indigenous circles that leaders are obligated to speak truth to power, said University of Victoria political scientist Jamie Lawson.

While other parts of the country have also created unique political figures, B.C. has bucked the Central Canada trend of “soft-spoken, diplomatic Lester Pearson”-type leaders, he added.

“We are certainly a province that is proud of that. It is kind of part of the self-identity of the place, and one of the consequences is people can come into leadership with the reputation of being mavericks. That’s something that goes right back to pre-Confederation times. It’s not every province that has a guy who calls himself Amor De Cosmos,” Lawson said in reference to B.C.’s renegade premier of 1872, who legally changed his name from the more bland William Smith.

Here is a look at some of our other political dissidents:

1952: W.A.C. Bennett

W.A.C. Bennett, a businessman from Kelowna, was elected to the provincial legislature as a Conservative in 1941, but twice his bids to lead the ruling party were rejected. Disgruntled, he resigned to sit as an independent in 1951, and then joined the Social Credit Party, which made a surprise breakthrough, forming government the next year.

Bennett was chosen to lead the party, and became the longest serving premier in B.C. history, from 1952 to 1972.

“Campaigning on a shrewd populist platform of fiscal restraint, fervent free enterprise, anti-socialist zeal, western chauvinism and unrepentant Ottawa-bashing, he developed a chameleon-like ability to adapt policy to either and sometimes both sides of any contentious issue,” Vancouver Sun columnist Stephen Hume wrote about Bennett.

“Bennett — journalist Bruce Hutchison described his ‘fixed neon smile, the bustling salesman’s assurance, the relentless torrent of speech’ as representing a revolution in provincial political style — spent his time in power remaking B.C.,” Hume wrote.

Bennett, who died in 1979, was known as Wacky to friends and foes.

1988: Brian Smith

B.C.’s first attorney-general to resign over differences with the premier was Sir Richard McBride, who left James Dunsmuir’s government in 1901.

Smith quoted McBride in his resignation speech in 1988, saying: “When Richard McBride resigned on a point of principle in the Dunsmuir administration in 1901, his father said: ‘My boy, resign everything but your honour.’… I am resigning as an act of honour.”

At the time, Smith complained Vander Zalm had a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the need for an independent attorney-general in relation to two cases he was handling, including a legal investigation into one of the premier’s close friends.

“I had all kinds of threats around me that I should back off that investigation, but I didn’t. And as soon as that investigation was finished, I stood up in the house and resigned,” Smith recalled today. “It was a terrible thing to have to give up the job you loved.”

He remained in the Socred caucus for more than a year, secretly trying to convince enough backbenchers to leave as independents so they could force Vander Zalm out and reform the party. The ploy didn’t work, and Smith left politics to become the chair of CN Rail.

Smith believes Wilson-Raybould will be given a rough ride if she tries to remain in the Liberal caucus, and predicts she has a bright future as a significant leader — but perhaps not one involving politics. “She is principled, and she ain’t no pushover. That is what the Trudeau government found out to their surprise.”

1988: Grace McCarthy

“Amazing Grace” McCarthy was the backbone of the Social Credit Party for decades, and became Canada’s first female deputy premier. But McCarthy publicly broke with then-premier Vander Zalm in 1988, alleging political interference by the premier and his principal secretary in the sale of the Expo lands in Vancouver.

McCarthy quit her post as economic development minister as soon as the bidding was complete and set about trying to bring down Vander Zalm before he could fatally damage the party. She urged other cabinet ministers to resign as a way to weaken the premier.

McCarthy coined the term “independent Socred” as a way to distance herself from the party, while staying close enough to take the reins if the opportunity presented itself. When Vander Zalm finally self-immolated in a scandal in 1991, McCarthy ran for the party leadership but was narrowly defeated by Rita Johnston.

A Vancouver park commissioner in the early 1960s, McCarthy had been recruited to provincial politics by W.A.C. Bennett, who was keen to encourage female leaders.

“At a time when female leaders were hard to find in Canadian politics, Grace McCarthy was an agent of change,” said former premier Christy Clark when McCarthy died in 2017. “When she was first elected, women could not even apply for mortgages without a male guarantor — until she worked with the provincial and federal governments to fix it.”

1991: Gordon Wilson

Gordon Wilson was a master at changing his political spots, serving as leader of the Liberal party for six years, as a cabinet minister for the New Democrats, and the creator of a now-defunct new party.

Today, Wilson declines to discuss his own past, but notes B.C. has several leaders, including Bennett, Vander Zalm and Dave Barrett, who built support for this province by picking fights with Ottawa.

“If I were to use a Western analogy, because of the polarized left-versus-right extremes in B.C., it is as if the majority of British Columbians are caught between two gunslingers on the main street of Dodge,” he told The Vancouver Sun. “As spectators, we try to speak truth to power before the gunfighter who is fastest to the draw slays the other and governs from the saloon.”

Wilson assumed leadership of a moribund Liberal party in 1987, with no elected members in the legislature. Nonetheless, he secured a spot in the 1991 campaign leadership debate and rocketed the party to prominence with one of the greatest sound bites in B.C. history.

As Social Credit premier Rita Johnston and NDP leader Mike Harcourt squabbled during the televised debate, Wilson interjected, “Here’s a classic example of why nothing ever gets done in the province of British Columbia.”

The Liberals elected 17 MLAs in 1991, placing second and effectively ending the Social Credit Party’s 39-year reign as the dominant political force in B.C. Despite his surprising success, his time as party leader would end two years later when his extramarital affair with Liberal MLA Judi Tyabji was revealed.

Wilson would be deposed by Gordon Campbell, and he and Tyabji would form their own party, the Progressive Democratic Alliance. Wilson was re-elected in 1996 as the only MLA of the party.

Three years into his term, Wilson crossed the floor to join the New Democrats as a cabinet minister and assumed the finance portfolio after the resignation of Joy MacPhail. When Glen Clark resigned in a scandal, Wilson took a run at the leadership of the NDP, but quickly aborted that mission.

He returned to the Liberal fold in 2016, when then-Premier Christy Clark rewarded him with a $150,000-a-year contract to promote opportunities for B.C. businesses in the liquefied natural gas industry.

1999: Joy MacPhail

Joy MacPhail resigned from her post as B.C.’s finance minister in 1999, when party leader and premier Glen Clark had become politically radioactive. Even when Clark himself resigned over his handling of a friend’s casino licence, MacPhail’s path to redemption was far from clear.

She cited “personal reasons” for quitting, in part because Clark’s hold on the party was so strong he could easily have shut her out even in his own disgrace. While she avoided direct confrontation at the time, she would later blast Clark’s ruinous style of governing.

“I do not believe in confrontation as a standard way of doing business,” she said at the time. “The old way of doing things under a Glen Clark government was to pick favourites and thereby create losers. … People have rejected that method of governing and that way of doing things. We must change.”

MacPhail would later abandon her own bid for the party leadership to back Ujjal Dosanjh in order to keep Gordon Wilson — Clark’s chosen successor — from gaining control. Dosanjh brought MacPhail back to cabinet as labour minister the next year, but that government was short-lived.

In 2001, the New Democrats were swept from office, leaving MacPhail with one of just two NDP ridings in the entire province. She served her final term as the party’s de facto leader in the legislature.

MacPhail, chair of the ICBC board of directors, was not available Friday for comment.

2010: Bill Bennett

When Bennett left Gordon Campbell’s Liberal cabinet in 2010, he made the rare move of airing the party’s dirty laundry in public, alleging there was “almost a battered wife syndrome inside our caucus.” Taking that stand put him “in a very dark place,” but he strongly believed Campbell, who was in his third term as premier, should step down to save the party, which had slumped in the polls.

Bennett rose again in the Liberal ranks when Christy Clark took over the party the following year, but he still wears the scars from speaking out.

“In party politics, the pre-eminent value is loyalty to the leader. There are still many many people in British Columbia who hate my guts, because I set that one aside one time and chose to do something that I thought as an individual was right,” added Bennett, who hopes Wilson-Raybould’s career is not ruined by taking a stand.

“I hope Jody Wilson-Raybould doesn’t feel like she is done yet either … She is at the beginning of what should be a stellar career and a career that’s important to Canada.”

Bennett believes the federal Liberals would be “crazy” to not let Wilson-Raybould run again under their banner.

2012: John van Dongen

John van Dongen, a one-time Liberal solicitor-general, shocked British Columbia in 2012 when he defected to the tiny B.C. Conservative party, and on his way across the floor blasted premier Christy Clark and his former Liberal colleagues with a long shopping list of ethical violations.

“What I believe people expect from political leadership are core values that include integrity and a genuine commitment to public service,” he said at the time.

Van Dongen was incensed when the Liberals wrote off $6 million in legal fees racked up by the Liberal aides accused in the Basi-Virk corruption trial ignited by the bargain-priced sale of B.C. Rail.

“Every week, constituents question government actions and issues that I am not able to defend,” he said.

His former colleagues in the Liberal caucus were quick to savage Van Dongen as self-serving, nasty and self-aggrandizing.

His tenure with the Conservatives lasted only a few months and he soon lost his seat altogether while running as an independent.

Postmedia could not reach Van Dongen for this story, but the person who was elected in his former riding in 2017, Darryl Plecas, has high praise for the man.

“He was so trying to do the right thing. And he just got beaten up by the system,” Plecas said. “I had so much respect for John.”

2017: Darryl Plecas

Plecas is the most modern example of a maverick B.C. politician. Elected as a Liberal in Abbotsford South, he was booted from the party after taking the speaker’s job, which effectively allowed the NDP and Greens to form government and relegated the Liberals to opposition.

Plecas defended the move as “the right thing to do.”

He has gone on to ruffle more Liberal feathers, releasing a bombshell report in January that alleges massive misuse of taxpayer dollars by the legislature’s two top officials, mainly while the Liberals were in power.

Plecas, who does not think he will run again in the next election, said he knew when he took the speaker’s job he would be “pummelled” by his Liberal colleagues, but was guided by his “moral compass” — as he believes Wilson-Raybould is.

“I say three cheers for her. However difficult it might have been doing what I was doing, it’s a thousand times more difficult for her. She would have known all along that you do not do that without a consequence. That is the way the system works. You will be punished. But I’m sure for her there must be an enormous sense of peace,” he said.

“To see her have the courage to stand up and do what she did, I think let her be a lesson for all Canadians.”

131,Empty,2019-03-02T00:16:06Z,'It certainly has the makings of something that could do significant damage to the Liberal’s re-election prospects',"Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s stunning testimony on Wednesday appeared to deal some serious damage to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government, but federal Liberals in B.C. say they’ll stay the course.

Gabe Garfinkel, the director of the Liberal Party of Canada in B.C., said he has been focused on listening to what grassroots Liberals have to say about Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, and encouraging their feedback and ideas.

“This open dialogue has been important and will ultimately help us work toward our common goal of maintaining the Liberal government’s progress on housing affordability, creating jobs and protecting the environment,” Garfinkel wrote in a text message to Postmedia News.

“It’s also been important to Liberals across British Columbia for Jody Wilson-Raybould to speak openly at the justice committee, and supporters here were pleased she had the opportunity to do so.”

“The Vancouver Granville Liberal Riding Association stands in full support of our MP Jody Wilson-Raybould, and her important work for our community, region and Canada,” said association chair Claire Marshall.

Tamara Taggart, a former CTV news anchor, said she is still seeking the federal Liberal nomination for the Vancouver Kingsway riding, held by the NDP’s Don Davies since 2008.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony has not made her reconsider carrying the party’s banner, she said.

“I think that Jody Wilson-Raybould is an amazing woman and I look up to her,” Taggart said.

“I have deep respect for her and I have deep respect for the prime minister, and that’s all I can really say, because I just watched it like every other Canadian did.”

But David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said the Liberals will now have a tough time selling their “Sunny Ways” slogan, should they plan to use it again for the Oct. 21 election.

‘Fairly or unfairly, it (the party’s alleged conduct) certainly undermines claims to be a great champion and defender of feminism,” he said.

“That might not be an entirely fair point because you might say, look at Jane Philpott, look at Catherine McKenna, look at Kristy Duncan … there are plenty of strong women in the cabinet who have an influence. But that doesn’t mean people won’t make that argument.”

Moscrop said the Liberals have also undermined their position as a party which champions reconciliation and supports Indigenous people.

“That’s the price you pay when you try to forefront an Indigenous woman as being core to your brand and then throw her under the bus,” he said.

Moscrop said it is too early to get a good sense of what past Liberal voters will do at the polls this fall. There’s still the potential for more information to come and for resignations, and it’s unclear how long the scandal will drag on.

“But, put it this way, it certainly has the makings of something that could do significant damage to the Liberals’ re-election prospects,” he said.

Updated

Swathed in a purple dressing gown, the elderly woman sits alone at the dining room table, her gaze fixed into the distance.

Key points: The image has been used by both Labor and the Liberals in political campaigns

The photo was taken 10 years ago in the United States

The photo is a widely used stock image of a generic elderly woman

One hand rests on her furrowed brow. In the other, she holds a sheet of paper — the type that looks to be bearing bad news.

The photograph is a powerful visual metaphor that speaks to the precarious nature of life facing her generation: failing health, financial hardship and social isolation.

Which is why in the decade since it was first taken, this $40 photo of the lady in the purple dressing gown has become a familiar stock image of choice for many journalists, marketers, advertisers and political parties.

And over the past few years, she has featured regularly in campaign material for both Labor and the Liberals before graduating to become a key visual motif of Liberal Party's ""retiree tax"" campaign targeting Labor's proposed franking credit reforms.

Same woman, same pose

The Labor Party used the image in Facebook campaigns in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to attack then prime minister Tony Abbott over his government's aged pension reforms.

In August 2018, Labor used the same photo of the woman to shame the Morrison Government over its provision of home care assistance for ageing Australians.

But the Liberal Party has also been an enthusiastic user of the photo, adopting the woman as the ""poster granny"" for its campaign against the Labor Party's franking credit reforms.

In May 2018, the Tasmanian Liberals featured the photo in a Facebook post having a go at ""Labor's Granny Tax"".

A month later, the photo made a cameo in a Liberal Party YouTube video titled ""Labor's Taxes: The Bill Australia Can't Afford"".

The video warned that a Shorten Labor government would ""take more than $200 billion from the pockets of Australians"" in the form of new or higher taxes.

Same woman, same pose, but now being deployed by both the Liberals and Labor for different causes.

From Facebook to billboards

Towards the end of 2018, she appeared on the Liberal Party's website as the face behind a petition form and, in January, cropped up in a number of Facebook posts made by Liberal MPs calling out ""Labor's unfair retiree tax"".

Last week, the campaign went up another notch. A post by Liberal National Party MP Luke Howarth, who currently holds the marginal seat of Petrie in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, shows the photograph on a roadside advertising billboard.

And later in the week, Liberal MPs and candidates were re-posting and re-tweeting a new variation of the social media campaign with the same familiar face in the background.

But there's more to the history of the woman in the purple dressing gown.

In an era of never-ending news cycles and the infinite opportunities afforded by social media, it's becoming increasingly hard to keep track of who uses what and when.

Which is why it probably went unnoticed that the same stock image of the lady in the purple dressing gown was used in a 2012 Obama campaign video taking down the Republican health care policy.

Convenience versus authenticity

Titled ""An elderly lady sat looking stressed reading bills"", the photo is one of a set available for purchase for $39.60 (including GST) from the leading stock image providers.

If you have been targeted by unusual political messages in the lead up to the federal election, show us what you're seeing. Email hiddencampaign@abc.net.au

Over the years the same image has also been used by many organisations including a Washington DC public policy institute, a South Florida debt advisory service, a charity for retired Delta Airlines employees, the Irish branch of the Society of St Vincent de Paul, a New York state medical billing company, an Oklahoma law firm and a home care service provider in Philadelphia.

The photo has likewise illustrated stories about retirement and healthcare in numerous news websites including Network 10, financial news site CNBC, Britain's Daily Express, Radio Canada International, Germany's Die Welt and Connecticut's New Haven Register.

According to a signed release form supplied by stock image provider iStockphoto, the woman who posed for the photographs lived in the town of Sandy in Utah and sat for the shoot on September 25, 2009.

At the time of the photo shoot, the woman — whose name was redacted from the form — was 72-years-old.

Todd Keith, a photographer from Salt Lake City who took the photo, said he believed his model was a US citizen who has since passed away.

Using stock images in political advertising is not without risks. It involves a trade-off between convenience and authenticity.

As the backlash over the recent case of the ""fake retiree"" and the 2016 ""fake tradie"" incident shows, there can be blowback when corners are cut.

""It is common for political parties of all persuasions to use stock images in their communications,"" a spokesman for the Liberal Party said, providing examples of some of the Labor Party's recent use of stock photos.

The Labor Party has also been approached for comment.

Even though he makes part of his living from stock photography, Mr Keith was firmly of the view that political parties should steer clear of them.

""It's not at all representative,"" he said. ""These [models] could be anybody, or have any political beliefs.""

That view is endorsed by Dee Madigan, the executive creative director of advertising firm Campaign Edge.

""It's surprising that they would do that,"" she said. ""Why not just spend a little bit more on a proper photograph. Otherwise, this becomes the story, as it will. Then it's an own goal.""

Ms Madigan, who has worked on campaigns for Labor in the past, says that her creative team now avoids using stock photos and even actors in political advertising.

""Which is really hard because real people are terrible at playing real people.""

133,Empty,2019-02-28T22:47:49Z,The lifestyle guru will use her knowledge “on the subject of living” to create a line of pet-safe CBD products.,"A decade ago, Martha Stewart probably wasn’t the first person you envisioned when you thought about taking a bong rip, unless, say, the bong was fashioned from a hollowed-out decorative gourd. But on Thursday, we learned that the lifestyle guru is taking the next logical step in her friendship with Snoop Dogg—which involves a cooking show the two host together that gave us the line, “Snoop’s Cornish game hens were the best ever”—and getting into the increasingly lucrative weed business.

CNBC reports that Stewart has signed on as an adviser to Canopy Growth, one of the largest marijuana producers in the world, to develop a line of C.B.D. products for animals. (Stewart’s own pets, which are often featured on her Instagram account, include Chow Chows, French bulldogs, Persian cats, a Fell pony, and Friesian horses.) “I am delighted to establish this partnership with Canopy Growth and share with them the knowledge I have gained after years of experience in the subject of living,” Stewart said in a statement. “I’m especially looking forward to our first collaboration together, which will offer sensible products for people’s beloved pets.” While Stewart says she herself doesn’t smoke, she has no problem with others smoking around her, which makes sense considering she’s just joined a pot company. “So someone smokes marijuana? Big deal! People smoke cigarettes and die from cancer,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “I haven’t heard of anybody dying from cannabis. I’m quite egalitarian and liberal when it comes to stuff like that.”

Canopy—whose subsidiary, Tweed, unveiled a partnership with Snoop Dogg in 2016 that included a brand of weed called “Leafs by Snoop”—was founded in 2013 and received a major boost last year with the decision by Canada to legalize recreational pot, leading to such demand that there were supply shortages across the country. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, it said it sold 10,102 kilograms (10.1 tons) of pot and pot equivalents from October through December, boosting revenue by 282 percent, so you can understand why Stewart would want to get a piece of that! In a statement, Canopy Chairman and co-C.E.O. Bruce Linton said he was excited to bring in a host of new customers through a household name like Stewart’s, who could be viewed as a gateway drug. “As soon as you hear the name Martha, you know exactly who we’re talking about,” Linton said. “Martha is one of a kind and I am so excited to be able to work alongside this icon to sharpen our C.B.D. product offerings across categories from human to animal.”

Larry Kudlow: forget what you’ve heard, trade talks with China are going great

Yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer appeared before Congress and uttered the words, regarding the trade war with China that has cost U.S. exporters $40 billion: “Let me be clear, much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and, more importantly, after it is reached, if one is reached.” In other words: slow your roll, Donald Trump. But according to National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, who has the distinction of never being right, Lighthizer is just being a stick in the mud:

“Last week was fantastic,” Kudlow told CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. “We’re making great headway on nontariff barriers and tariffs regarding various commodities such as soybeans and energy and beef. We have mechanisms with regard to enforcement, which is—I think—unparalleled.”

And at least one person believes him!

In recent decades, Russian and Chinese conglomerates have gained ever more global economic influence, making them powerful foreign-policy tools for their respective governments. But now Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are learning that they are the tools.

NEW YORK – Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have each championed a model of authoritarian capitalism (call it “development with a dictator’s face”). But what neither leader seems to have anticipated is that the Russian and Chinese commercial sectors are becoming political forces in their own right, increasingly bringing pressure to bear on policymaking.

Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next

Over the past two decades, Russian and Chinese multinational corporations – many of them awash in cash – have become powerful foreign-policy tools for their respective regimes. But they were once seen as modernizing forces that would help open up business and society alike. With energy giants like Gazprom and Rosneft promising to bring commercial values to backward Russia and the newly independent former Soviet states, Anatoly Chubais, a key architect of Russia’s privatization program, touted them as the vanguard of a new “liberal empire.” (Insofar as these firms also bound the former Soviet republics closer to Russia, so much the better.)

Likewise, in China during the presidencies of Jiang Zemin (1993-2003) and Hu Jintao (2003-2013), the rise of banks like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China, and of energy and heavy-industry firms like Sinopec, Sinochem, and the China Railway Construction Corporation, were seen as harbingers of modernization. Yet today, no one could mistake these firms for the equivalent of an ExxonMobil or a Microsoft. With top executives often parachuting directly into the boardroom from high political office, Chinese mega-corporations have long represented a merger of business and the state.

Moreover, as Gazprom, Rosneft, and the Chinese technology giants ZTE and Huawei have grown more essential to their respective governments, business and state interests have become even harder to disentangle. In the interest of their “national champions,” both the Russian and Chinese governments now seem to be pursuing policies they might not have chosen otherwise.

This dynamic is clearly on display in Venezuela. Through its affiliation with Venezuela’s state oil monopoly, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Rosneft has funneled upward of $17 billion in loans to the Chavist regime over the past decade. Meanwhile, Rosneft gained three million tons of oil in 2017 from its operations in Venezuela; more generally Russia has invested in many Venezuelan industries, from banking to bus assembly. At the same time, Venezuela has been one of the largest buyers of Russian weapons among Latin American countries.

Owing to these debts and other economic ties, Putin has little choice but to back the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro’s crumbling regime, even as public support in Russia for the Kremlin’s foreign interventions declines. Rosneft’s interests in Venezuela are simply too deep for it to withdraw, especially now that Western sanctions have crippled the firm’s ability to secure financing in international markets.

Russia’s support for Maduro does not rise to the same level as its commitments in Syria, where its relationship with the Assad family goes back decades. Rather, its continued engagement in Venezuela reflects a cold, hard business calculation. According to Reuters, private security contractors with close ties to the Kremlin have been sent to defend Maduro. At the same time, there have been unverified (but plausible) reports of Russian planes departing Venezuela with shipments of gold, as payment for the country’s debts. Putin knows that if National Assembly President Juan Guaidó takes power, those who stood with Maduro will likely be ousted, and Russia’s privileged access to Venezuela’s oil fields revoked.

In monetary terms, Maduro’s fall could mean even larger losses for China, which has investments in Venezuela estimated to be worth around $60 billion – at least three times more than Russia’s. Like Russia, China got into bed with the Venezuelan regime in the 2000s, when the country was flourishing under former President Hugo Chávez. While China secured a sorely needed source of oil for its fast-growing economy, Chávez was able to reduce Venezuela’s reliance on the US as one of its leading export markets. In the meantime, Chinese tech giants have aided the Maduro regime in its domestic surveillance efforts, and (like Russia) China has sold Venezuela expensive weapons.

Still, should Maduro fall, China may be less exposed than Russia. The Chinese have been careful to cultivate contacts among various elements of Venezuelan society, including the opposition. And while China still supports Maduro officially, it has not followed Russia in accusing the US of an attempted coup.

This suggests that China wants to avoid the kind of radical steps that Russia is taking. The Kremlin is now actively competing with the US to influence the course of events in Venezuela, and has described the US attempt to deliver humanitarian aid across the Colombia-Venezuela border as a ruse to smuggle in weapons for the opposition.

China’s moderate behavior no doubt owes something to its ongoing trade negotiations with the US. Before extending his deadline for imposing higher tariffs on Chinese imports, US President Donald Trump indicated that Huawei and ZTE might be included in a final Sino-American trade deal. That would certainly please Xi, whose paramount interest is to protect both firms’ economic might.

With the ability to bar US companies from selling crucial inputs to Chinese firms, the Trump administration could inflict serious harm on both ZTE and Huawei. Huawei already stands accused of conspiring to violate US sanctions on Iran, leading to the arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada this past December. And ZTE has pled guilty to similar charges, paying penalties of $1.4 billion in 2017.

At the end of the day, Venezuela can’t hold a candle to the strategic importance of these two firms. And for the Kremlin, the calculus is the same: the prerogatives of business define the national interest. But, perhaps to Putin’s chagrin, in Venezuela that calculus has produced the opposite outcome.",Wag the Dictator,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/russia-china-multinationals-setting-policy-by-nina-l--khrushcheva-2019-02

She argues it amounted to interfer…","(Bloomberg) -- Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister’s office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada -- particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

Protecting Jobs

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

Inner Circle

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation -- and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

London Calling

Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Trudeau.

“Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,” she said.

Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, who on Wednesday called on Trudeau to quit, formally asked the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to probe the matter. Scheer said in a letter that it was illegal “to attempt to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.”

Wilson-Raybould, who complained about pressure from Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s then-principal secretary, said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws. Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.

Butts, who quit earlier this month while proclaiming his innocence, asked on Thursday to speak to the justice committee to address Wilson-Raybould’s remarks.

One top Liberal official said there was no talk for now of a challenge to Trudeau’s leadership. In the Canadian political system, party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Trudeau would be lengthy.

But another senior Liberal Party member said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Trudeau’s team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and that the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

“The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,” said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

MAJOR EMPLOYER

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials said media coverage of the affair in Quebec had been generally favorable.

Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that “Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that’s exactly what we have done ... we’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws”.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau in September over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould said she made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Wilson-Raybould said staff working for Finance Minister Bill Morneau had continued to press her to help the firm even after she asked them to stop.

Morneau told reporters that his officials had not behaved inappropriately and like Trudeau, stressed the importance of protecting jobs.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.","Top ally supports embattled Canada PM, easing pressure for now",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QH215

Popular Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that “the prime minister would never apply improper pressure” and expressed “100 percent faith” in him.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied meddling, saying it was “entirely appropriate” for his staff to talk with the justice minister’s staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ex-Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified Wednesday that Trudeau, his staff and other officials imposed inappropriate pressure on her to avoid criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin in a case involving allegations of corruption in Libya. She said they pushed for an agreement that would let the company pay reparations but avoid a conviction.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said that was appropriate.

“Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs,” Trudeau said Thursday. “That’s exactly what we have done every step of the way.

“We have also done it in a way that has respected our laws and respected the independence of the judiciary,” he added. “There are no doubt disagreements in perspective on this but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing in a way that respects and defends our institutions.”

Morneau said he never raised issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said she had “approached me in the House of Commons to inform me that my staff was speaking to her staff, which I think is entirely appropriate.”

Wilson-Raybould herself said she didn’t think the pressure had been illegal; she had not directly instructed to avoid prosecuting.

But she said Trudeau warned that a prosecution would drive the company and its jobs out of Canada, and she said she was “barraged” and subjected to “hounding” by Trudeau and senior members of his government, including Morneau and his chief of staff.

The opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Trudeau to resign, and Wilson-Raybould’s testimony to Parliament has increased the uproar against Trudeau, who is facing an election this fall. Trudeau has already lost his closet adviser, Gerald Butts, who resigned last week. Butts denied he or anyone in Trudeau’s office pressured Wilson-Raybould and he is now asking Parliament’s justice committee to testify.

“I believe my evidence will be of assistance,” Butts said in a statement.

Wilson-Raybould, who had already been demoted to veterans’ affairs minister in January, resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12.

The latest Angus Reid Institute poll shows the Liberals falling behind the Conservatives in popular support, the PM’s approval rating dipping to Trump territory and Canadians engaging on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

According to the poll released Tuesday, Canadians are more engaged on this issue than on NAFTA talks, on China, even the Me Too movement. The poll shows that 66% agree with the statement that “There is a deeper scandal in the Prime Minister’s Office and more information will emerge.”

That view goes across the country and across all age groups, something that should frighten the Liberal campaign team.

Already the party is down in voter support, the poll showing that the Conservatives are ahead by seven points.

When asked “who they would support if an election were held tomorrow,” 38% said the Conservatives, 31% the Liberals and 14% the NDP.

The Trudeau Liberals are down in support across the country while Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives are on the rise.

The Angus Reid survey, which was conducted between Feb. 21-24, shows the Conservatives leading in every region but Quebec and Atlantic Canada.

In Quebec, the Liberals and Conservatives are tied at 24% support.

The only region the Liberals still hold a lead is in Atlantic Canada.

It’s a far cry from Trudeaumania and proof that the PM and his party are in trouble over their handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

This is the fourth poll showing the Conservatives ahead since the story broke.

The scandal isn’t just hitting the Liberal Party’s numbers, it is hurting Trudeau’s reputation, as well. Asked if their opinion of the PM has worsened, improved or stayed the same in the past month, 59% of Canadians said worsened.

Justin Trudeau’s approval rating sits at just 40%.

Seems trash talking the woman who used to be your attorney general for almost three weeks while preventing her from speaking turns Canadians off.

Trudeau may need yet another communications strategy.

And as the PM stands up in the House of Commons day after day saying that he did nothing wrong and is only supporting “good jobs” at SNC-Lavalin, he is showing that he is offside with the view of most Canadians.

Asked if the company should be prosecuted on the bribery and corruption charges they are facing, 63% said they agreed with the statement that, “ SNC-Lavalin should be fully prosecuted under the Criminal Code.”

Even in the company’s home province of Quebec, voters are split with 49% saying prosecute even if it means a 10-year ban on federal contracts and 51% saying the company should be allowed a remediation agreement.

On Wednesday, Jody Wilson-Raybould will speak to the House of Commons justice committee. If you’ve read the headlines, then you have likely heard that Trudeau says he has waived privilege and the former attorney general is free to speak.

How much she says could alter Trudeau’s fortunes in the future.

If she is upfront and forthcoming with Canadians, then the next poll could show even worse numbers for the Trudeau government.

But it is what it is.

While Singh easily trounced his rivals in the Feb. 25 Burnaby South by-election, he did so by winning only 39 per cent of the ballots cast by the 30 per cent of voters who bothered to show up. More precisely, he’s off to Ottawa thanks to only 8,848 of the 76,204 people on the riding’s voter registry.

This is not what you’d call the most glorious beginning of the NDP’s long march to the federal polls in October. Nine out of 10 NDP riding associations across the country don’t even have a declared candidate yet. Of the 338 MPs in the House, only 41 are New Democrats and 13 of them have already announced they won’t be running again. More dropouts are expected. Meanwhile, the party’s finances are a shambles—the NDP pulled in $1.97 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, the poorest haul since 2011.

So it will be a while yet before we know what Singh’s version of the NDP will look like, and what it will be about exactly, beyond the broad policy strokes that tend to situate the party quite reliably between Justin Trudeau’s Liberals and Elizabeth May’s Greens.

Further than that, all that can be said is that it’s Singh’s party now. And Singh might just have what it takes to make life miserable for Trudeau’s battered Liberals, especially now, on account of a stunning stroke of luck in Singh’s favour. While Singh was campaigning in Burnaby South, the SNC-Lavalin story was making a wreckage of Trudeau’s assiduously cultivated brand: Canada’s magnificently progressive, feminist Prime Minister, the champion of Indigenous rights, the Davos hero on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. And from the outset, Singh was itching to challenge Trudeau’s brand by seeing him and raising him.

If Trudeau was young—he’s 47—Singh was younger—he’s 40. If Trudeau was progressive in the fashionable “woke” mode, Singh was the real article—a natty, bicycle-riding, full-bearded Sikh, a crusading lawyer, and now the first person from what Statistics Canada calls a visible minority to lead a federal political party. Trudeau has his stylish socks, but Singh has his colourful turbans. He’s edgier. And he’s a better dancer, especially when it comes to bhangra.

But is this really what the NDP is supposed to be about?

It wasn’t that long ago that the NDP had a much clearer sense of what it was there for, what it stood for, and who it spoke for. It was a socialist party, or at the very least a social-democratic party, and it was rooted in the working class and in the labour movement. It arose from the social-gospel churches of the Prairies. It extended its reach into the great social justice struggles of 20th century. But then came the 21st century and the debilitating incoherence that ran straight across the “left” following the al-Qaeda attacks of 9-11. Meanwhile, the old industrial working class withered in the maelstrom of globalization and free trade. And then came the rise of identity politics.

New Democrats thought they’d finally hit the right notes with Jack Layton, who won the job of Official Opposition leader for the first time in the party’s history. But the fluke at the root of his success was conveniently overlooked: it was the collapse of the Bloc Québécois. More than half of the NDP’s 103-member parliamentary caucus came from Quebec ridings that had never voted NDP.

By the 2015 election, after a decade of Stephen Harper, voters wanted a change, and they wanted it fast. Along came the dashing Trudeau, who swept into power after outflanking Thomas Mulcair’s budget-balancing NDP from the left.

Mulcair was ignominiously ousted at the NDP’s April 2016 national convention in Edmonton, owing mainly to getting caught in the middle of an identity crisis that pitted ultra-green Leap Manifesto enthusiasts in one corner against Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s pragmatists in the other. The party was rudderless and adrift until the federal NDP convention of October 2017, when Singh won the leadership race on the first ballot.

In the early innings, his performance wasn’t promising. The awkwardness began with a strangely evasive interview he gave to the CBC’s Terry Milewski. Singh couldn’t bring himself to denounce fringe extremists in certain Sikh temples who continue to lionize Talwinder Singh Parmar, the terrorist mastermind of the 1985 Air India bombing. Singh later insinuated that Milewski’s questioning was racist. It took him weeks to back down and properly distance himself from Parmar’s admirers.

Then there was the time Singh asserted that judges appointed to the Supreme Court needn’t be required to speak French so long as they can speak an Indigenous language, and was forced to reverse himself after learning the NDP’s policy on Supreme Court appointments.

More recently, Singh found himself publicly at odds with NDP foreign affairs critic Hélène Laverdière and caucus chair Matthew Dubé on whether Juan Guaidó should be recognized as Venezuela’s interim president. It was another case of not knowing, apparently, what his own party’s position was on a subject of immediate concern in Parliament.

Several MPs had made it clearly but quietly known that Singh had to get himself a Commons seat, and that if he failed, he’d be pressured to resign as leader. So it was welcome news when the Trudeau government finally got around to declaring a by-election date for Burnaby South. Singh finally had his chance to run for the House of Commons.

Burnaby South wasn’t going to be a slam dunk, but the NDP had the upper hand, and it expended a great effort to get Singh elected. Singh’s campaign was short on detail and issues (housing, the environment, health care) and long on principles and rhetoric. But it was also something of a rerun of his leadership campaign, with its emphasis on Singh’s background and identity—the struggles of his immigrant parents, the bullying he put up with as a child, and his own up-by-the-bootstraps story of growing up in Newfoundland, Scarborough and Windsor.

This is all fair enough, and it might make an impression in Quebec, where voters are burdened by a weird aversion to religious symbols like turbans. But there was nothing novel in Burnaby about Singh’s candidacy as a person of colour. In 1972, the voters of what was then a mostly white, working-class constituency—Burnaby–Edmonds—elected the NDP’s Rosemary Brown as their MLA. Brown was the first Black woman elected to a Canadian legislature. In 1975, Brown ran for the leadership of the NDP, coming in a close second behind Ed Broadbent.

In Burnaby South, it’s practically impossible to not be a member of a minority group. Census Canada reports that 38.7 of the riding’s residents identify as being of Chinese origin, 32.2 per cent say they’re of European extraction, and the final 29.1 per cent identify as South Asian, Filipino, Korean, Black, West Asian and so on. Neither will Singh be particularly remarkable in Parliament as a turbaned Sikh. In 2015, 20 Sikhs were elected to the House of Commons.

During the by-election campaign, “race” erupted in nasty ways, twice, but neither occasion turned to Singh’s disadvantage.

Liberal candidate Karen Wang caused an uproar when it was revealed that she’d posted on the Chinese social media network WeChat that she was the candidate to back because she was Chinese and therefore had a head start on Singh, who she identified as being “of Indian descent.” Liberal headquarters ended up replacing her with Richard T. Lee, a longtime B.C. MLA whose associations with former B.C. premier Christy Clark’s government probably didn’t do him any favours. Lee came in second, trailing Singh by nearly 3,000 votes.

The second incident occurred at an all-candidates meeting, when Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson of Maxime Bernier’s right-wing People’s Party raised the lighting-rod subject of the murder of Burnaby teenager Marrisa Shen. A Syrian refugee has been charged with her murder. Thompson used the case to raise alarms about proper refugee “vetting.” There was a lot of shouting.

Thompson’s entourage throughout the by-election campaign did not consist of the stereotypical white yobs who like to shout about refugees. They were mostly Chinese-Canadians.

Much of Thompson’s 2,242 vote tally may or may not have bled away from Conservative third-place finisher Jay Shin (5,147 votes), and Singh is fortunate that Green Leader Elizabeth May invoked a traditional “leader’s courtesy” and declined to run a candidate against him.

Singh’s profile likely gave him an edge in the race, but he isn’t even the first NDP leader to launch his federal career in a Burnaby by-election. That title goes to Tommy Douglas, the Saskatchewan premier and leader of the NDP’s pioneering predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, back in 1962. As leader of the NDP, Douglas won three elections in a row in the riding of Burnaby–Coquitlam.

Going back further, Burnaby was also once the home of the Army of the Common Good, a radical workers’ co-operative during the 1930s that ran its own stores, farms and logging operations. It even printed its own currency, known formally as labour units, but usually called “lulus.” At the time, one of the army’s closest allies was Burnaby’s mayor, the crusading socialist William Pritchard, one of seven men convicted for sedition in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919.

Nobody saw it coming when the SNC-Lavalin volcano erupted underneath Trudeau’s Liberals, and a great many voters might decide to give Singh’s New Democrats a try when October comes around. Or Singh might just put his foot in something, leaving the Liberals safe from harm. Or the liberal-left vote might split sideways to the electoral advantage of Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives, leaving everybody to lament about vote-splitting.

Here is Scheer’s full statement.

Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done. That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation – if it has not already done so—into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former Attorney General detailed in her testimony.

The testimony Canadians have just heard from the former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a Prime Minister who has lost the moral authority to govern. A Prime Minister who allows his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A Prime Minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the Government of Canada begins. And a Prime Minister who has allowed a systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office and those of his most senior cabinet and public service colleagues.

I listened carefully to the testimony of the former Attorney General, and like Canadians, I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate, and frankly illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government. All to let a Liberal-connected corporation off the hook on corruption charges.

Before Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Canadians knew Justin Trudeau had engineered an unwanted, sustained, and co-ordinated attempt to get Ms. Wilson-Raybould to change her mind and stop the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin. Today, thanks to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, we now know just how intense those efforts were: ten meetings and ten phone calls involving eleven senior government officials relentlessly targeting Ms. Wilson-Raybould over a four month period—with the sole objective of bullying her into bending the law to benefit a well-connected corporation.

The details are as shocking as they are corrupt: multiple veiled threats to her job if she didn’t bow to their demands. Urgings to consider the consequences on election results and shareholder value above judicial due process. And reminders from Justin Trudeau to his Attorney General about his own electoral prospects should she allow SNC-Lavalin’s trial to proceed.

As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends.

Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.

The NDP leader is running for a seat in the House of Commons in Burnaby South, one of three federal ridings holding byelections today.

Many New Democrats believe it’s a do-or-die contest – that Singh cannot lead his party in this fall’s general election if he can’t get himself a seat in Parliament.

Singh is hoping a victory tonight will give him much-needed visibility in the Commons in the run-up to the national vote in October, and put to rest grumbling within the NDP about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

But Singh’s problems go well beyond his lack of visibility on the main stage of federal politics. The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters – particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which has infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While many NDP eyes will be glued to Burnaby South tonight, an arguably better gauge of the party’s election-year viability will be going on in Outremont – the Montreal riding vacated last summer by Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the so-called orange wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

The betting among political insiders is that the Liberals will retake Outremont, which would be a welcome boost for the governing party’s morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy – and a particularly bitter loss for the NDP. The symbolism of losing their erstwhile beachhead would only reinforce polls suggesting New Democrats are in danger of being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

But the blow would be softened, at least, if Singh is able to capture Burnaby South.

It’s no sure thing. The B.C. riding is not a natural home for Singh, who formerly represented Brampton in the Ontario legislature. Nor is it a safe NDP riding: New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, who resigned to become mayor of Vancouver, took the riding in 2015 with just over 600 votes more than his Liberal opponent, with the Conservative candidate not far behind.

While the byelection is thought to be a three-way race, being a party leader should give Singh an edge. The fact that the Green party has chosen not to run a candidate should also help.

Moreover, the Liberals did themselves no favours by dumping their original candidate amid controversy over her suggestion that Singh being of “Indian descent” could help her win. The current Liberal contender, Richard T. Lee, could face headwinds of a different kind, created by the ongoing furor over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – who represents a nearby Vancouver riding – to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

While Americans were transfixed on Wednesday with the salacious, but not legally damning, testimony of Michael Cohen before Congress, a bombshell went off in the Canadian Parliament. Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould testified before the House Justice Committee alleging that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his administration pressured her in “inappropriate” ways to reach a settlement with an engineering company that has been charged with crimes.

The company, SNC-Lavalin, is facing charges that it sent bribes to Libya, then under the rule of Gadhafi, in defiance of Canadian law. If found guilty, the Quebec-based company will face severe sanctions, including a ban on working with the Canadian government. This would be a severe economic blow, especially in Trudeau’s home province of Quebec.

According to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, she faced “consistent and sustained,” efforts by the Trudeau administration, as well as “veiled threats,” in an attempt to influence her decision regarding Lavalin. Under Canadian law, this type of attempt at political influence is at best inappropriate, and at worst illegal.

Unlike the slow moving investigation into Trump, the Trudeau scandal has unfurled remarkably quickly. On February 7, the Globe and Mail ran a story citing anonymous sources that suggested inappropriate political meddling had occurred. In her testimony yesterday, Wilson-Raybould discussed meetings with Trudeau and others from late last year. Trudeau says he disagrees with her assessment that the meetings were not appropriate.

In January, Wilson-Raybould was relieved of her duties as attorney general and given a lesser cabinet position. Then this month, she suddenly stepped down from the cabinet entirely. Also stepping down was Gerald Butts, a long time Trudeau political adviser heavily involved with Lavalin situation.

Yesterday’s testimony from one of his former cabinet ministers and a member of his own party has flung the Trudeau administration into a full-fledged crisis. With a general election looming in October, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer said that Trudeau has “lost the moral authority to lead,” and should resign.

The crux of the case––and perhaps the key to Trudeau’s future––is whether the discussions with Wilson-Raybould were simply a good faith effort to make her aware of the economic and political implications of the Lavalin case, or a more nefarious effort to put a thumb on the scale of justice.

For her part, the former attorney general said that the pressure was maintained even after she had made clear that she had made a decision not to cut a deal with Lavalin. In addition, some observers view her demotion in January as a punishment for having defied the administration’s wishes.

With an election this year, members of the Liberal Party will have to decide if Trudeau can weather these harsh allegations and successfully lead them to victory. For now, Trudeau insists he did nothing wrong and that he will be exonerated by the ethics committee. But even in the best-case scenario for him, in which his administration’s pressure on the justice ministry was legal and ethical, it still represents a broad overreach into what is supposed to be an independent agency.

Justin Trudeau is often viewed in both Canada and The United States as a kind of anti-Trump. Young, nice looking, liberal, the son of a former prime minister, and sufficiently woke in all the right ways, he has a hero status for some. It is remarkable that all of a sudden it is Trudeau, not Trump, who may be taken down by corruption.

It’s a good reminder that Donald Trump didn’t invent corruption or the breaking of political norms––such things predate him by a few centuries. That a “nice guy,” like Trudeau engaged in corruption will surprise many, but perhaps it shouldn’t. Abuse of government power has never been limited to the crude.

It will be an astounding irony if just as the Mueller probe returns a report with no smoking gun, Trump’s adversary in Canada is engulfed in a damaging scandal. It will be another example of something that “wasn’t supposed to go that way.” But here we are. Over two years after investigations into Trump began there has still been no finding of wrongdoing by him. Just three weeks into the Lavalin scandal, Trudeau has been badly damaged.

Whether Trudeau’s leadership survives this scandal or not, it is yet another reminder that things are not always what they seem.

A conservative nonprofit, led by the former head of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, found that the ambitious climate change plan's federal jobs guarantee alone would cost an estimated $6.8 trillion at best.

The American Action Forum determined that a pledge to create 20 million jobs, directly and indirectly through the overhaul, could have a price tag as high as $44.6 trillion, however.

The American Action Forum determined that a pledge to create 20 million jobs, directly and indirectly, through the overhaul could have a price tag as high as $44.6 trillion

Universal health care alone would carry a $36 trillion price tag, the researchers said, although their study admits that it is impossible to come up with a true estimate based on the published Green New Deal framework

Universal health care alone would carry a $36 trillion price tag, the researchers said, although their study admits that it is impossible to come up with a true estimate based on the published Green New Deal framework.

Even without a Medicare-for-All provision or a federal jobs guarantee, the study finds that a 'Low-carbon Electricity Grid' would cost roughly $5.4 trillion and a 'Net Zero Emissions Transportation System' would range from $1.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion in taxpayer costs.

Add on 'Guaranteed Green Housing' at an estimated $1.6 trillion to $4.2 trillion, and the Green New Deal would still tack on $12.3 to the federal budget between 2020 and 2029, the researchers said.

A 'Food Security' promise would cost a mere $1.5 billion, or $10 per household, making it the only promise of the progressive plan that wouldn't cost taxpayers thousands annually.

The Green New Deal's costs have become a major point of contention as Democrats backing the resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey have had to square their support for document that seeks to slow global warming with reality.

Few have been able to say how they'd pay for it, aside from rolling back the GOP tax cut on corporations. Democrats have also said they'd raise taxes on ultra-wealthy Americans.

The deal states plainly: 'We will need revenues between $700 billion to $1 trillion annually for the Green New Deal. $400 billion will be for the public jobs programs. Estimates for the transition to 100% clean energy start at $200 billion a year.'

Their estimate of $10 trillion a year tracks with American Action Forum's baseline, but only when the jobs provision and universal healthcare is not included.

The Green New Deal itself promises to take reallocate money from the Pentagon's hefty annual budget. It also proposes a carbon tax of $20 per ton that it claims would raise $120 billion a year, as well as a tax hike on the rich.

Green New Deal backers also believe health care costs will be decreased by $3 trillion when fossil fuels are retired.

'Using renewable energy instead of coal and gas will mean health care costs will go down because the foundations of a green economy – clean energy, healthy food, pollution prevention, and active transportation – are also the foundations of human health,' the deal's website says.

'The Green New Deal pays for itself through the prevention of chronic disease, which consumes a staggering 75% of $3 trillion in annual health care costs. All in all, this is an investment in our future that will pay off enormously as we build healthy, just, sustainable communities.'

While it promises to 'end unemployment in America once and for all by guaranteeing a job at a living wage for every American willing and able to work,' it does not say how it would pay for the salaries associated with the federal jobs it would be creating.

The provision merely states: 'A Full Employment Program will create up to 20 million jobs, both directly and indirectly, by implementing a nationally-funded, locally-controlled, direct employment initiative replacing unemployment offices with local employment offices.

'The government will be the employer of last resort, offering jobs meeting community-identified needs in the public and non-profit sectors to take up any slack in private for-profit sector employment.'

Jobs will primarily be introduced in the sustainable energy and energy efficiency retrofitting sectors, with mass transit, sustainable organic agriculture, clean manufacturing, infrastructure, and public services like education and child care services creating new opportunities, too.

While the Green New Deal doesn't explicitly lay out plans for a Medicare-for-All type program, it is adjacent to the liberal climate change wish list that dips into health care.

It would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, according to another study released over the summer by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

Green New Deal co-author Ed Markey said Tuesday that it's clear that McConnell is trying to 'score political points' off his climate change resolution

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that he'll force Democrats to vote on the Green New Deal before the long, August recess. The move will force them to put their support for the plan on the record.

'The only thing I would ask is if this is such a popular thing to do and so necessary, why would one to dodge the vote. This is an opportunity to go on record,' McConnell said Tuesday during a news conference. 'It's a debate we'll have in all likelihood sometime before the August break.'

Some Democratic senators such as Dianne Feinstein of California and Patty Murray of Washington have said they will vote present on the bill.

Murray accused McConnell of playing political games with the bill on Tuesday.

'I think it's very clear that this is a topic that people around the country are excited about,' she told DailyMail.com. 'Mitch is only bringing it up for political purposes. And I'm happy to vote present.'

Asked if she thought the resolution could pass, she said: 'He's not trying to make it pass, and I would ask what are Republicans doing to really deal with climate change.'

Markey, the co-author of the Senate resolution, also slammed McConnell's tactics.

'It's all Mitch McConnell, putting things on the floor, to divide Democrats. He promised he wouldn't put anything on the floor that President Trump wouldn't sign, he's already going back on his word.'

McConnell made those comments in the context of the government shutdown and a various spending bills that could pass the Senate but would be rejected by President Trump.

The Democratic senator said nonetheless that when it comes to the Green New Deal, it's clear that McConnell is trying to 'score political points' off the climate change resolution.

'He doesn't have any interest in moving anything legislative. It's just all theatrics for McConnell,' he charged.

Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris dismissed the trillions of dollars liberal programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-All could cost taxpayers

Democratic presidential contenders have all lined up to support the deal, including Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris.

Appearing on Fox News' 'Special Report' on Monday evening, Gillibrand, a New York senator with an exploratory committee, compared the proposal to John F. Kennedy's plans to send a man to the moon in 10 years.

'It will be a measure of our innovation, our entrepreneurialism, our excellence. Why not say to the American people, ""Global climate change is not only real, but the urgency of this moment requires a call to action to all of America’s engineers, all of our entrepreneurs, all of our innovators to ... solve the problems together?"" ' she said.

Gillibrand called climate change the 'the greatest threat to humanity we have' in in the interview.

California senator and Democratic presidential candidate Harris dismissed the trillions of dollars that the liberal program could cost taxpayers on Sunday, saying it wasn't about the amount of money spent but the investment.

'One of the things that I admire and respect is the measurement that is captured in three letters, ROI. What's the return on the investment?' she told CNN's 'Inside Politics' program. 'People in the private sector understand this really well. It's not about a cost. It's about an investment.'

Asked if the country could afford such costly programs like Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal, Harris told CNN: 'Of course, we can afford it.'

The California senator said there were practical ways of implementing such policies.

'There's no question we have to be practical. But being practical also recognizes that climate change is an existential threat to us as human beings.

'Being practical recognizes that greenhouse gas emissions are threatening our air and threatening the planet, and that it is well within our capacity as human beings to change our behaviors in a way that we can reduce its effects. That's practical,' she said.",Green New Deal could cost $93 trillion over a decade when employment and health care are included,Daily Mail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6747001/Green-New-Deal-cost-93-trillion-decade-employment-health-care-included.html

Notley was in Ottawa Thursday giving the Senate her take on Bill C-69, the Impact Assessment Act, which overhauls the way energy projects are assessed for their effects on the environment as well as contributions to the country’s social and economic well-being.

When Environment Minister Catherine McKenna introduced the legislation a year ago, she said it was designed to attract new investment by giving the industry certainty about the criteria by which their proposed projects would be assessed and set timelines for reviews.

Notley says the bill does the opposite.

“I will give (the Liberal government) credit for stepping in to buy Trans Mountain, but I also think there is a high level of investor uncertainty that exists right now in the way in which it’s written,” she said in a press conference after the committee meeting.

“We cannot allow that uncertainty to continue. You can’t build trust by saying, ‘Trust us.’ You build trust by providing clarity.”

Other provincial governments of different political stripes have joined Notley in calls for changes to the bill before it becomes law.

On Thursday, the Senate committee studying the bill heard requests from Newfoundland Premier Dwight Ball and Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre. Ontario Energy Minister Greg Rickford presented to the Senate’s energy committee earlier this week.

Ball agreed with Notley that scrapping C-69 is not the way to go, but asked for amendments to exempt offshore oil exploration. He said the bill will drive capital investments elsewhere, to places where production doesn’t have the same environmental protections as Canada does.

Rickford told the committee C-69, as written, would make building new or replacing existing pipelines “impossible” and fears it will impede Ontario’s nuclear energy policies.

The federal government hasn’t yet published a list of project types that would be affected by the legislation.

The House of Commons made more than 130 amendments before it landed in the Senate. Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, told the committee last week the changes from MPs made the bill more complicated and provided less clarity.

McMillan said the long, drawn-out legal challenges that have delayed the Trans Mountain pipeline will be the norm if the bill passes as-is. In particular, there is too much discretion given to cabinet to interfere in a project’s approval, he said.

McKenna’s spokeswoman Sabrina Kim said in a statement Thursday the government is open to considering additional amendments. She blames the environmental assessment policies of the former Conservatives for the legal challenges delaying energy projects, and said the Liberals are keen to ensure the system protects the environment while still getting Canadian resources to market.

Among the amendments Notley wants to see are a hard two-year deadline for the assessment and review process. She noted the proposal to expand Trans Mountain, which would triple an existing pipeline’s capacity between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C., was first brought forward in 2013 and remains mired in legal battles.

Notley also wants most new Alberta energy projects, including in-situ oilsands developments and petrochemical refineries, exempted from the bill because of existing provincial review processes and her government’s climate-change policies.

She said the Alberta government has attracted $12 billion in investments for petrochemical and upgrading facilities. “We don’t want to see that caught up in duplicative regimes that scare away investors we’ve worked so hard to attract,” she said.

Notley told senators Alberta’s struggle to get its oil to market has become a national unity issue, noting her government forced oil companies in the fall to cut production because of a collapse in oil prices.

“Over in the Maritimes they are importing Saudi oil. Here in Ontario you are importing American oil, both at world prices, and meanwhile in Alberta we are cutting production,” she said. “I told (the Senate) very clearly this is not how you build a country.”

The proposed Energy East pipeline that would have carried Alberta crude to eastern Canadian refineries was abandoned in 2017 with TransCanada citing market changes and uncertainty created by federal government policies.

Notley said if C-69 passes, it will certainly discourage anyone from trying to get that pipeline back underway.","Makes no sense for Ottawa to buy pipeline, then pass Bill C-69, Notley tells Senate - Calgary Herald",Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/notley-says-new-energy-assessment-bill-conflicts-with-purchase-of-pipeline

The post Canadian PM Justin Trudeau facing calls to resign because of a political influence scandal appeared first on Hot Air.","While everyone in the U.S. was watching the Cohen testimony Wednesday, some even more dramatic testimony was happening in Canada. Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould testified that she had faced a sustained, political pressure campaign from the Prime Minister and others acting on his behalf to intervene in the prosecution of a Quebec-based engineering company called SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould, her Deputy AG, and her Chief of Staff were contacted approximately 20 times (half in person, half by phone) over a period of four months to demand that she intervene in the case and allow for a deferred prosecution agreement which would essentially allow SNC to pay its way out of legal trouble. During many of those discussions, it became very clear the motive for the demands was nakedly political. The company had threatened to pack up its Montreal headquarters and move to London, potentially creating a job-losing spectacle just weeks before an election. The Prime Minister was worried his party would suffer unless the company was given a pass.

On Feb. 7, the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould had been subject to a pressure campaign by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has been slowly admitting to more and more contact with AG Wilson-Raybould on the matter but she was not able to say anything because the conversations were covered by “solicitor-client privilege.” But under public pressure, PM Trudeau waived that privilege and so yesterday Wilson-Raybould gave a lengthy statement detailing the pressure campaign followed by three hours of questioning.

Wilson-Raybould’s recounting of every contact made with her about the SNC-Lavalin case is too long to excerpt in full, but here is her own summary from the start of her testimony:

For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of. Within these conversations, there were express statements regarding the necessity for interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential for consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC. These conversations culminated on December 19, 2018, with a phone conversation I had with the Clerk of the Privy Council – a conversation for which I will provide some significant detail. A few weeks later, on January 7, 2019, I was informed by the Prime Minister that I was being shuffled out of the role of Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada.

On Sep. 4, 2018 Wilson-Raybould was informed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, that there would be no deferred prosecution agreement in the SNC-Lavalin case. Two days later, the AG’s office began getting calls from other elements within the government asking that Wilson-Raybould intercede. On Sep. 17th Wilson-Raybould was scheduled to have a meeting with PM Trudeau on an unrelated issue. However, as soon as she entered his office he began talking about SNC-Lavalin:

The Prime Minister asks me to help out – to find a solution here for SNC – citing that if there was no DPA there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal. In response, I explained to him the law and what I have the ability to do and not do under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act around issuing Directives or Assuming Conduct of Prosecutions. I told him that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP. In response the PM further reiterated his concerns. I then explained how this came about and that I had received the section 13 note from the DPP earlier in September and that I had considered the matter very closely. I further stated that I was very clear on my role as the AG – and I am not prepared to issue a directive in this case – that it was not appropriate. The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise – the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA – he said “there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders” … “they will likely be moving to London if this happens”… “and there is an election in Quebec soon”… At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau”. I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

That’s really a good summary of how the entire campaign went. People kept calling and claiming there had to be some “solution” while simultaneously pretending they were not involved in a pressure campaign to arrange politically motivated justice. On December 18th, Wilson-Raybould’s Chief of Staff was summoned for a meeting with Trudeau’s principal secretary, i.e. his top political adviser, Gerald Butts. After the meeting, the Chief of Staff texted a summary of what happened to Wilson-Raybould:

Basically, they want a solution. Nothing new. They want external counsel retained to give you an opinion on whether you can review the DPP’s decision here and whether you should in this case. … I told them that would be interference. Gerry said “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do!

Last Monday, as the scandal was spreading, Gerald Butts resigned. From the NY Times:

In a statement announcing his departure, Gerald Butts, who has been a close friend of Mr. Trudeau’s since their university days, linked his leaving to the allegations that he, the prime minister and others improperly pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, when she was the justice minister and attorney general, to quash the criminal prosecution of a major Canadian engineering and construction company. Mr. Butts repeatedly denied in his resignation letter that any such action took place. “Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the attorney general is simply not true,” Mr. Butts wrote. “But the fact is that this accusation exists. It cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the prime minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.”

Those denials ring pretty hollow in light of the text messages and other contemporaneous accounts which Wilson-Raybould made of the interference campaign. The final act of this disgrace came on January 7, 2019 when, having not succumbed to the pressure, Wilson-Raybould was abruptly removed from her job by the PM:

On January 7, I received a call from the PM and was informed I was being shuffled out of my role as MOJAG. I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case. On January 11, 2019 – the Friday before the shuffle. My former Deputy Minister is called by the Clerk and told that the shuffle is happening, and that she will be getting a new Minister. As part of this conversation, the Clerk tells the Deputy that one of the first conversations that the new Minister will be expected to have with the PM will be on SNC Lavalin. In other words, that the new Minister will need to be prepared to speak to the PM on this file.

Could it be any more blatant? Yesterday, Paul Wells wrote a scathing opinion piece for Macleans about the scandal:

What the former attorney general described tonight is a sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along. If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification? If a Clerk of the Privy Council can claim with a straight face that ten calls and meetings with the attorney general, during which massive job loss, an angry PM and a lost election are threatened, don’t constitute interference, then what on earth would interference look like?

In the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, opposition leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to resign from office: “Like many of you I listened carefully to the testimony of the former attorney general and like many of you I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate and, frankly, bordering on illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government, all to let a Liberal-connected corporation off the hook on serious corruption charges.”

But just this morning Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland went on CBC and said: “I have 100 percent faith in the prime minister.” So it looks like the liberals are not going to call for Trudeau’s ouster and are instead going to stick with the claim that this political pressure campaign was not a political pressure campaign.

In February 1989, audiences saw, for the first time, a young Keanu Reeves lean close to a young Alex Winter and declare, “Strange things are afoot at the Circle-K.”

It was a critical moment, not only in the plot of Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, but in pop culture. As the movie posters had it, history was about to be rewritten by two guys who couldn’t spell. It was a goofy movie, and most of the critics didn’t get it. Teenagers did, though. For those of us who were young in 1989, Bill and Ted gave us exactly the time travel movie we needed.

Now they might be able to do it again.

A new Bill and Ted movie is in pre-production. There are reasons to be circumspect; people have been talking about a new Bill and Ted movie for years. And the franchise that followed Excellent Adventure—a second movie, animated series, video games—was uneven, to put it charitably.

It’s worth remembering, too, that the original movie has serious problems. There’s a homophobic slur played for humor, most of the female characters exist solely to satisfy a really gross male gaze, and the historical figures whose perspectives on modern life form the film’s MacGuffin are nearly uniformly white and male. To rewatch Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure is to smile, to groan, and to cringe.

But the movie did one thing very right: it made a time-travel movie about how history can be shaped by joy and friendship. And it made it at precisely the right moment.

Time travel as a genre is about cause and consequence, about the constant of change. It’s about how we got here, as individuals and as a civilization, and where we want to go. “We have to ask these questions, don’t we?” James Gleick writes in Time Travel: A History. “Is the world we have the only world possible? Could everything have turned out differently?”

In the mid-1980s, time-travel movies tended to be informed by regret, fear and nostalgia. In the United States, this was a period bookended by a recession and a stock market crash. Scientists had just confirmed that acid rain was a serious threat. Christopher Hitchens railed in The Nation in 1985 about “the rulers of our world, who subject us to lectures about the need to oppose terrorism while they prepare, daily and hourly, for the annihilation of us all.”

Yeah, it was a cheerful age.

In 1984’s Terminator, we learned that the future was trying to kill us. The following year, the past tried to take a piece of us too.

Back to the Future was the first time-travel movie I saw, and as fun as it was, it was also terrifying. There’s a minor chord running through it, from the gun-toting terrorists in the van, to the family photograph from which Marty McFly slowly disappears. Back to the Future was literally about the existential horror of living in a world determined by Baby Boomers’ choices. It was, in other words, peak 1985.

Then in 1986, we got Peggy Sue Got Married, about a woman who is transported back to 1960 to come to terms with her life choices. Again.

“Regret is the time traveler’s energy bar,” writes Gleick. And in the mid-1980s, there seemed to be no shortage of things to regret.

But by the end of that decade, something had shifted. There were signs that apartheid’s days were numbered in South Africa, perestroika was underway in the Soviet Union, and the Berlin Wall was soon to come down. People were using the phrase “new world order” without irony.

“What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War,” wrote Francis Fukuyama in 1989, “or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.”

The end of history.

Into that moment stepped Bill S. Preston, Esq. (Winter) and Ted “Theodore” Logan (Reeves), two high-school kids in San Dimas, California, who are about to fail their history presentation. If they do, Ted’s father will send him away to military school, which means the two will never learn to play their guitars.

This matters, it turns out. Bill and Ted are about to learn that we humans can dare to ask for more than survival. The future can be awesome, with a little help from the past.

Time Travel: A History is a book mainly composed of questions and narrative told at a distance, but on one point, Gleick takes a stand. He discusses Ray Bradbury’s “A Sound of Thunder” and Isaac Asimov’s The End of Eternity and declares: “Bradbury was right and Asimov was wrong. If history is a dynamical system, it’s surely non-linear, and the butterfly effect must obtain. At some places, some times, a slight divergence can transform history… Nodal points must exist, just not necessarily where we think.”

Strange things are afoot at the Circle-K.

Bill and Ted are definitely not Great Men of history. But they matter. A man named Rufus (George Carlin) tells them that a future utopia is founded on the music of their band, Wyld Stallyns. If Ted goes to military school, none of that can happen. So they have to kick ass on their history presentation.

Which they do, of course, in charmingly earnest fashion.

The reviewers were confused. “The stars themselves are frisky and companionable, like unkempt ponies,” wrote Hal Hinson in the Washington Post. “If ignorance is bliss, these are the most blissed-out kids ever. But because the characters they’re playing and the lingo they spout are already out of date, the timing of the picture seems out of whack. It’s peddling last year’s hip.”

I was a 12-year-old living in rural Manitoba and I didn’t know last year’s hip from a flying phone booth. Like all my friends, I incorporated “whoa” and “dude” and “excellent” into my vocabulary. The movie taught kids how to navigate the 1990s.

And it helped audiences prepare for the comedy of the 1990s. The series of Wayne’s World sketches on Saturday Night Live, also featuring a couple of earnest and clueless dudes who say, “party on” a lot, began the day after Bill and Ted hit theaters (although the Wayne character had actually debuted on Canadian television in 1987).

It didn’t matter what the critics thought of these kinds of characters. We were young at the end of history. We wanted to believe we weren’t trapped. We wanted joy. And we wanted to be excellent to each other.

And now here we are, looking back at the putative end of history three decades later, looking into a future in which the consequences of climate change are and will be devastating, and that’s only the beginning of our worries. Could 50-something Bill and 50-something Ted bring us a movie with hope for the future and affection for past? A movie about time travel that celebrates friendship and goodwill—and that manages to do it without the toxic masculinity this time?

Or will it be an insipid nostalgia piece, a return to time travel as the genre of regret?

I’ll be first in line to find out.

Now that the NDP leader will have a seat in Parliament, can he still turn around the party's fortunes before this year's federal election?","With his win in the federal byelection in Burnaby South, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has an opportunity to put to rest some of his doubters both outside the NDP and, more importantly, within. Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This byelection win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the NDP shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the NDP’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal NDP came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the NDP persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the byelection, the NDP would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the NDP in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, NDP fundraising —already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election —continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the NDP out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this byelection win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the byelection was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the NDP announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the NDP. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the NDP can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the NDP in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the NDP to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilized members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this byelection win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.",Byelection win offers Singh an opportunity to reset his leadership,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/byelection-win-offers-singh-an-opportunity-to-reset-his-leadership-112500

The post NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh cruises to victory in Burnaby South byelecti…","Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will now be known as Member of Parliament Jagmeet Singh after winning the hard-fought, and at times ugly, Burnaby South byelection on Monday night.

Will he one day be known as Prime Minister Singh after this fall’s federal election?

Singh got the first part out of the way, winning the byelection with 8,800 votes, or 39 per cent of the vote.

Liberal candidate Richard Lee (who replaced candidate Karen Wang partway through the campaign) came second with 5,930 votes, or 26 per cent of the vote.

Conservative candidate Jay Shin placed third with 5,133 votes, or about 22.5 per cent of the vote.

People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson did better than some people expected with 2,420, about 10.6 per cent of the vote.

Independents Terry Grimwood had 1.1 per cent of the vote and Valentine Wu 0.7 per cent.

Overall voter turnout was just 30 per cent.

Singh took the stage and thanked the other candidates for their contribution to the democratic process. He also thanked the party’s volunteers and supporters.

“I am humbled by your belief in me,” he said.

“I will be your champion,” Singh also said. “I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa. I will fight for you in the House of Commons.”

Singh, the first visible minority leader of a major federal party, said that when he was growing up, he never imagined seeing someone who looked like him running to be the prime minister of Canada.

“We just showed a lot of kids out there that yes we can,” he said, borrowing a slogan from former U.S. President Barack Obama.

The campaign was marred by shouting matches at campaign debates over such issues as immigration and refugees. There was also plenty of questionable campaign material distributed by some candidates during the past few weeks.

Before results rolled in, Vancouver East MP Jenny Kwan said she was confident Singh would serve Burnaby South well and boost the party’s fortunes.

“Jagmeet has made a decision,” Kwan told the NOW. “He’s chosen Burnaby South as his home. He’s moved his family here. Absolutely, I believe he can represent the people of Burnaby South and bring their issues forward. He’s been out in those doorsteps every single night, talking to people about what matters to them, what’s concerning to them and to ensure that there voice is going to be heard.”

Kwan continued: “I’ve been out door-knocking with Jagmeet in the rain, in the sun, in the snow and so I’m very optimistic about tonight and I’m super, super excited to have Jagmeet in the House of Commons with the NDP caucus.”

Burnaby Mayor Mike Hurley said he was excited to the city represented by a party leader. He said he hopes Singh can help bring much-needed federal housing funds to Burnaby.

The night also saw the nascent People’s Party of Canada receive approximately 11 per cent of the vote. The local candidate, Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, repeatedly brought up the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen during the election as a reason to screen refugees more stringently.

(The man accused in the murder is a Syrian refugee who has yet to have his charges tested in court.)

Hurley said he thinks the PPC tapped into “fear and misunderstanding in the community.”

At a hearing of the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould described a “consistent and sustained effort” to prevent construction giant SNC-Lavalin from being prosecuted in a bribery case. The former justice minister accused senior ranks of the federal government, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of targeting her with “veiled threats” as they tried to interfere.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation, while Green party Leader Elizabeth May and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said they want a public inquiry into the allegations. Trudeau said Wednesday evening that he “completely” disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of the events.

While Wilson-Raybould’s fellow Liberal members of parliament deferred to Trudeau, others said they believed her and offered her praise.

“I think she’s a hero,” said Peter Julian, NDP MP for New Westminster–Burnaby.

Julian said he was dismayed by Trudeau and his government’s alleged conduct, and said he believes Wilson-Raybould lost her job as justice minister as a direct result of her standing up for the integrity of Canada’s court system.

“I think she’s very courageous,” Julian said. “Pressure was put on her. She talked about veiled threats and consequences being repeatedly expressed to her.”

The testimony itself was unlike anything he has seen in his decades in Canadian politics, he added.

“I think it should raise flags for all Canadians about how this prime minister and how this government deals with fundamental issues of principals and our court system, and all the principals that, I think, for so many Canadians they hold dear,” he said.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

Dan Albas, Conservative MP for Central Okanagan–Similkameen–Nicola, said he found Wilson-Raybould’s testimony detailed, specific and explosive. He was stunned when she described the pressure she had been put under.

“The prime minister, by the very act of the allegations and subsequent coverup, has lost the moral authority to lead this country,” Albas said.

“It’s the right of every Canadian to have equality under the law and Mr. Trudeau, by trying to grant a favour to friends in this company, jeopardized that by intervening in what is supposed to be an independent prosecution.”

Albas said Wilson-Raybould was in a cabinet position for good reason, and took the role seriously under intense pressure.

“The litany of people that put pressure on her is breathtaking, based on her testimony,” said Jenny Kwan, NDP MP for Vancouver East. “The prime minister maintained and continues to maintain that there was no inappropriate pressure put on Ms. Wilson-Raybould but clearly, based on her account, the pressure was there to see.”

Kwan, whose riding borders Wilson-Raybould’s in Vancouver Granville, said she often sees the former justice minister at public events. She admires the courage it has taken her to testify, she said.

“I’ve always had a lot of respect for Ms. Wilson-Raybould, even though we are on different sides of the political spectrum,” Kwan said. “This situation really has just reinforced that for me.”

Green Leader May, who is MP for Saanich–Gulf Islands, said that while Wilson-Raybould was constrained in what she could say by solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentially requirements, “she was entirely credible, she was so impressive and displayed such integrity.”

Wilson-Raybould made it clear that she had been subjected to a pattern of inappropriate pressure from politicians and, what May found most shocking, from the civil service, she said.

“What Jody Wilson-Raybould revealed today, Canadians would be forgiven for having this shake their confidence in our institutions,” May said. “To serve the interests of SNC-Lavalin over the interests of Canadians institutions and our constitution is deeply, deeply troubling.”

Mira Oreck, director of stakeholder relations for B.C. Premier John Horgan, ran against Wilson-Raybould in the Vancouver Granville riding in 2015. She declined to be interviewed but said she stood by a message she posted Wednesday on Twitter.

“The calm, strength and clarity of @Puglaas in this testimony is stunning and inspiring,” Oreck wrote, referring to Wilson-Raybould’s Twitter handle, Puglaas, which means “woman born to noble people” in the Kwak’wala language.

Wednesday morning at Wilson-Raybould’s Vancouver constituency office, staff didn’t want to comment ahead of her testimony but said they planned to watch it live in the office’s small lobby.

Dozens of passersby, asked whether they were following the testimony, said they were not keeping a close eye on federal politics. Some said they were preoccupied by events in the U.S., particularly the bombshell testimony of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer.

But a few said they either looked forward to reviewing Wilson-Raybould’s testimony later in the day, or had been tuning into broadcasts as often as possible.

“I was so impressed,” said Alan Rees, 77, of Richmond. “If anybody wants to know why there is such a disdain for politicians, I think this illustrated it. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen any politician open up honestly, show integrity, tell the truth, without any fear. A lifelong conservative may just change his mind.”

Rees lamented that any action on her testimony might be delayed by the federal election on Oct. 21, 2019. But how it is handled will show to the world what democracy means in Canada, he added.

“What should happen is a few people should be smacked on the knuckles and maybe fined, and perhaps even go to jail,” he said.

Scott Girling, 57, from South Surrey, said he was disappointed with the federal government, its “silence” and Trudeau’s attitude toward the situation.

“I just wanted her to be able to tell her story, tell the truth, whatever that is,” he said. “I’m sure people will be scrambling to try to save their name or the jobs, or save face for the particular party that they’re with.”

Barbara Onneken, 62, from Maple Ridge, said she wasn’t surprised by what Wilson-Raybould said in her testimony.

“We expected that and we’re really happy that she did get to speak, because it is her right to speak,” she said.

“He (Trudeau) needs to come clean.”

The Vancouver Granville Liberal riding association could not be reached for comment.

University of the Fraser Valley political scientist Hamish Telford told Postmedia News that he watched Wilson-Raybould’s testimony in class with students.

“My students thought that this would be damaging to the prime minister. That it’s hard to deny that there was a far amount of pressure being applied.”

Telford said Wilson-Raybould had indicated she would run again in her riding of Vancouver Granville in the October election.

“We think as a Liberal, but we aren’t entirely sure about that,” he said.

He said that the one important thing that Wilson-Raybould did not reveal was why it was decided in September that that the bribery charges against SNC Lavalin should go to criminal prosecution and not be dealt with through a remediation process as the prime minister apparently wanted.

Meanwhile, Premier Rachel Notley goes to Ottawa to convince senators that an entirely different bill is ruinous to western oil, gas and other resources.

On vivid display is the Trudeau government’s fierce loyalty to Quebec, and its destructive paternalism toward the West’s interests.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould riveted the nation on Wednesday with her tale of improper pressure to drop charges against SNC-Lavalin.

As that was happening, Montreal’s La Presse broke news of SNC-Lavalin apparently paying $30,000 in 2008 for “sexual services” for the son of the former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

He was visiting Canada hoping to improve his English, apparently starting with “yes, yes!”

On Thursday, Notley was desperately trying to persuade senators to radically improve Bill C-69.

It was left to two women, both lawyers, to make calm and reasonable cases for fair law wisely applied.

The Liberals wanted Wilson-Raybould to bend the law so that SNC-Lavalin wouldn’t face criminal trial for charges of bribery and fraud in Libya.

Notley is trying to save the country from a law which is either astonishingly sloppy, or actively designed to drive Alberta’s main industry out of business.

Only days ago, we might have suspected simple incompetence. Now the sleaze of the SNC-Lavalin case suggests something more cunning and intentional.

It’s not as if Bill C-69 is anything new. It has passed five votes in the Commons and the Senate since last February. Even the dimmest Liberal legislator had time to see its dire implications.

But they keep on passing that thing.

Second Commons reading was March 19 last year. Then came third reading on June 20.

Off to the Senate it went, for passage on first reading the same day, and second reading Dec. 12.

It’s now one vote call from utter disaster.

Related

Several provinces have sent urgent submissions to Ottawa, warning that the bill will delay projects endlessly while giving all the say to objectors, and no credit at all to positive economic impacts and job creation of any project.

The bill as it stands is a power grab of Canada’s resource sector by Catherine McKenna’s environment and climate change department. Unusually, it was sponsored by her, not the natural resources minister.

C-69 also challenges provincial ownership and development of natural resources, a constitutional guarantee.

The feds could step into Alberta, for instance, and re-regulate a refinery project or local pipeline already studied and approved by the province.

One of Notley’s arguments Thursday was that Ottawa should leave projects within a province to provincial regulators.

She pointed out, for possibly the 1,000th time, that Alberta has strict regulation and also a vigorous environmental and climate plan.

The premier got friendly attention from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia senators. Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball shared many of her concerns.

And everybody wonders, why would Ottawa want to regulate all these things?

The week’s events suggest what Notley clearly suspects: it’s all about control that would eventually be used to wind down oil and gas as a major national industry.

She demands a clear legal statement of what Bill C-69 would regulate, and what it would not. She says the minister should only be able to add a project to the review list if it clearly involved federal jurisdiction.

Federal officials have provided assurances all this will be done.

But Notley saved her best line for last:

“You’re not going to build trust in industry by saying ‘trust us.’ And there’s a lot of ‘trust us’ in the current version (of C-69).”

She wants the issues made clear in law. That would be better, although the Liberals have already shown what happens when they don’t like a clear law.

Trust them? This week, who could?

Trade

“Cautious optimism in Beijing for US-China trade deal” [South China Morning Post]. “China’s senior diplomat Wang Yi said on Monday that the latest round of trade talks with the US had provided “positive prospects” on Sino-American ties and the global economy, as state media reacted with cautious optimism. The talks between chief negotiators in Washington, described by Wang at a Beijing event as “achieving concrete progress”, yielded an immediate delay to US President Donald Trump’s planned extra tariffs on Chinese imports. Commentaries from top Communist Party mouthpieces like newspaper﻿ People’s Daily and state news agency Xinhua said that the just-concluded round of talks in Washington sent a cautiously positive sign for a settlement to the friction between the world’s two biggest economies, but also cautioned that any final deal would face criticism both within China and the US.”

“Trump delays tariff hike initially scheduled for March” [Supply Chain Dive]. “Tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China will remain at the current level of 10% for the time being, after President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday evening he would delay the scheduled increase to 25%. He did not specify the future date until which the tariff hike might be delayed…. The tweets from Trump come in contrast to Lighthizer’s repeated message that March 1 is a ‘hard deadline’ for the U.S. and China to hammer out a deal. The USTR had not released a statement on the tariff delay as of press time.”

“Wary of Trump’s Approach, Governors Seek to Forge Own Trade Agreements” [Governing]. “As the Trump administration seeks to renegotiate trade deals with countries around the world, governors have been stepping up their own efforts to promote their states abroad, acting as salesmen and women for home-state companies and trying to bring in foreign investment. Appearances by foreign leaders have become almost a standing feature of National Governors Association events. At the NGA’s winter meeting in Washington this weekend, governors met with provincial counterparts and trade officials from Canada, Mexico and Japan.”

Trump: “Trump’s Secret to Victory in 2020: Hispanic Voters” [Politico]. “Many expected Hispanics to vote overwhelmingly against Trump in 2016. A Latino Decisions poll conducted just before the 2016 presidential election found Trump had the support of just 18 percent of Hispanics. But the actual figure was 28 percent, which—given Trump’s incendiary rhetoric about immigrants—some analysts and pundits refused to believe from exit polls until further studies confirmed it… A party that has staked its future on a belief that America’s demographic picture is changing decidedly in its favor could find itself losing to a man whose politics of fear should be driving precisely those voters into the Democrats’ waiting arms…. A party that has staked its future on a belief that America’s demographic picture is changing decidedly in its favor could find itself losing to a man whose politics of fear should be driving precisely those voters into the Democrats’ waiting arms.” • It’s occurred to me that the Venezuelan flap is more about irrendentist Latinx votes in Florida 2020 than anything else; remember that Florida Democrat fossil Donna Shalala, and the Democrats, tried to outdo Trump with anti-Maduro rhetoric (in effect giving him the green light) way back in January.

Elizabeth Warren said Friday evening that Native Americans should be “part of the conversation” on reparations, showing a willingness to expand the debate over whether minority groups that have faced discrimination should be financially compensated by the federal government. Warren is one of four Democratic presidential hopefuls who have said in recent days that they are open to providing some type of reparations to African Americans who are descendants of people who were enslaved in the United States, although they have offered varying levels of details about how the goal would be achieved.” Sanders (1): There is still lingering bitterness among some HRC supporters from 2016; questions about his age and the practicality-or even wisdom-of his ideas. But, as he showed tonight, Bernie’s a feisty old bird, who isn’t going away. — David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) February 26, 2019 The responses are quite something, but (perhaps because) Axelrod is doing a very gentle form of reality therapy… Sanders (2): “Wait, are you saying that CNN stacked the audience?” (unrolled Twitter thread) [@FaerieWhings (ST)]. Some kind soul investigated the bios of CNN’s questioners: “Tara Ebersol, former biology professor. Let see just how complete that information is. Her LinkedIn… ‘Chair, Baltimore County Democratic Party.'” • It does seem to me that CNN should have disclosed affiliations like that. Since Sanders has to run the gauntlet of the institutional Democrat Party, this doesn’t bother me all that much — so far as I can tell, they didn’t lay a glove on him — but the pretense that these are ordinary citizens should really be discarded. Sanders should really be running his own town halls, and selecting questioners using some form of sortition (you’d have to give the questioners time to prepare and a chance to refuse; not all like to speak in public). I bet the questions would be more interesting, too. Sanders (3): “Bernie Sanders Raises $10 Million in Less Than a Week” [New York Times]. “By Monday, after less than a week as a presidential candidate, Mr. Sanders has collected $10 million from 359,914 donors, campaign officials said. But perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders.” • Hopefully all those email addresses aren’t, er, burners… Sanders (4): “Manafort Argues for Lighter Sentence; Sanders Town Hall; Biden Running out of Time; Trump Shows Strength in Polls” [CNN]. “perhaps the most surprising statistic, on the first day of his campaign, 12,000 of those donors were Republicans. And, keep in mind, the Sanders 2020 campaign, Alisyn, now only one week old.” • Presumably the sort of suburban Republican to which the DCCC hopes to appeal?





Realignment and Legitimacy

“Getting Past the Door: How We Moved from Canvassing to Organizing Buildings” (PDF) [Metro DC DSA]. “For the past 18 months, volunteers from the Stomp Out Slumlords project have crisscrossed the District of Columbia, finding tenants facing eviction and talking to them about how they can defend themselves. We’ve knocked the doors of nearly 8,000 tenants being sued for eviction, we’ve spent hundreds of person-hours talking to tenants at landlord-tenant court, we’ve gotten to know militant tenants and worked alongside them to organize in their buildings. In the course of this work, we’ve learned a great deal about the dynamics of eviction and tenant struggle, and we’ve been forced to reevaluate core tenets of our project’s original strategy. We have struggled to execute the plan we started out with, but we have succeeded beyond our expectations in areas of work we had not planned to take on.” • This gives me hope for DSA. Imagine starting out with a theory of change, and then adjusting your theory based on experience! “Political science teachers explain why more than half of Americans would fail a civics test and why that’s not the end of the world” [Chicago Tribune (JB)]. “The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation surveyed 41,000 Americans with basic questions about American history and government and only 40 percent passed. In Illinois, more than half failed, according to the foundation. Shameful? Or a reflection of how complex our government can be and how civics education often misses the mark?” • Broken by design, as programmers say. “New Virginia poll: Northam approval weak, but Virginians not demanding his resignation” [Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball]. “A new University of Virginia Center for Politics/Ipsos poll of Virginia adults shows Gov. Ralph Northam (D) with weak approval numbers, but Virginians surveyed are not demanding his resignation and do not favor the state legislature removing him through impeachment. Meanwhile, a plurality of respondents say Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) should resign, but another quarter say he should not and a third are not sure what he should do, and the public is ambivalent on impeachment. Attorney General Mark Herring (D) seems the best-positioned of all three to remain in office, with less than one in five respondents believing he should resign or be impeached.” “Few Americans Want Open Borders— Democrats Included” [Medium]. “Trump repeatedly claims that Democrats “want open borders.” But nobody in leadership on the left promotes open borders. Nobody. Let’s clarify: not one or two people. Zero percent of the elected leadership of Democrats or independents have suggested the U.S. should have open borders. And there’s certainly no policy of open borders embraced by the Democratic Party.” • Well, the Identitarian Industrial Complex, deeply integrated into the dense tangle of NGOs that also comprises the Democrat party, as well as some segments of the press, does. (It does seem odd that nobody in the Open Borders crowd is calling for Maduro to open the Venezuelan border to Bolton and Abrams. Perhaps borders are good for something after all?) UPDATE Sortition?!

Housing Starts, December 2018: “Housing starts proved unexpectedly weak in December and will pull back residential investment in Thursday’s GDP report” [Econoday]. “Today’s report, a one that is truly mixed, points to trouble for immediate economic data — particularly fourth-quarter GDP — but also to building strength in coming data based on the strong showing for permits.” And but: “Comments on December Housing Starts” [Calculated Risk]. “Even with the year end weakness, total starts were up 3.6% in 2018 compared to 2017. The weakness at the end of 2018 has been blamed on higher mortgage rates (that have since come down to around 4.5%), the stock market volatility (since stabilized), trade and immigration policies (impacting foreign buyers), and the partial government shutdown (started in December, but mostly in January). My sense is starts will pick up in Q1 compared to Q4 2018.” And: “S and P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20 City Home Price Index December 2018 Year-over-Year Growth Unchanged” [Econintersect]. “I continue to see this a situation of supply and demand. It is the affordability of the homes which is becoming an issue for the lower segments of consumers.”

S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, December 2018: “Like FHFA’s report issued this morning, Case-Shiller’s 20-city index is showing slowing rates of home-price appreciation” [Econoday]. “Case-Shiller data continue to show trouble for once high-flying names on the West Coast including San Francisco which has now posted three sharp monthly declines in a row…. Case-Shiller data continue to show trouble for once high-flying names on the West Coast including San Francisco which has now posted three sharp monthly declines in a row.” • I hate the whole concept of houses as wealth.

FHFA House Price Index, December 2018: “Sellers were looking uneasy late last year based on this morning’s home price data” [Econoday]. “Total year-on-year prices slowed to 5.6 percent growth which actually isn’t bad at all in a low inflation, low wage growth economy. But the pace is definitely slowing.”

Shipping: “Study: e-commerce trends are shrinking average length of truck trips” [DC Velocity]. “Emerging e-commerce shopping trends are changing the face of the trucking industry, with the growth of last-mile delivery cutting the average trucker’s trip length by 37 percent since 2000, according to an industry study released today. Just as the average trucking haul distance has shrunk, the number of truck trips and urban vehicle miles traveled have increased for much of the same 19-year period, thanks to an increase in more regionalized retail supply chains and the proliferation of urban last-mile deliveries.”

The Bezzle: “Let it go: Frozen Elizabeth Holmes wanders the snowy streets of NYC looking for a cab after ditching the private jets and personal drivers following the collapse of her billion-dollar Theranos blood testing empire” [Daily Mail] “It was a shocking sight to behold as Holmes desperately attempted to hail a cab while lugging her own suitcase…. She was seen exiting The Mark at around 4:30pm, where rooms start at just under $1,000 per night.” • Looks like she’s got some money stashed away somewhere….

The Bezzle: “Confessions of a location data exec: ‘It’s a Ponzi scheme'” [Digiday]. “I met with a programmatic leader at one of the agency networks recently who asked my firm to help him verify the location data in the bid stream because they believe up to 80 percent or more of the lat-long data available there is fake. No one has stopped to think about where that data has come from and why a publisher would choose to sell it all to a vendor who is going to build a business on top of their data. What’s actually happening is these ad tech vendors are trying to pad out the limited data they already own with other data sets from competitive vendors or other unknown sources. Most reputable publishers would rather use their data across their own business than sell it to ad tech vendors, as the revenue potential is greater against their own content.” • it would be pretty ironic if we destroyed the Fourth Amendment and the very notion of privacy, all to enable a Silicon Valley scam.

The Bezzle: “SEC wants Tesla CEO Elon Musk held in contempt for tweeting” [Associated Press]. “[T]he Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal court in New York to hold Musk in contempt for violating a $40 million settlement he begrudgingly reached with the U.S. stock market’s chief regulatory agency five months ago. Allegations that Musk broke the agreement by tweeting without company approval could renew a debate about whether he has become too reckless to continue as Tesla’s CEO…. Contempt charges are typically brought against individuals who defy a court order. The SEC settlement was approved by a judge last fall, exposing Musk to potential fines or even jail time if he is found to be in contempt. ‘He is looking like a repeat offender and a bad actor,’ said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. ‘The SEC is taking action because it has a responsibility to protect the interests of consumers, investors and the public.'” • Repeat offender? Silicon Valley squillionaire? What?

Tech: “The Value Chain Constraint” [Stratechery]. “It is understandable why the Internet giants in particular move into seemingly adjacent territories: the growth imperative is strong, both for financial and strategic reasons, and the technology seems easy enough, particularly given the resources these companies bring to bear. And yet, the truth is that those massive resources do not stem, at least in the long run, from technical excellence, but rather integration in specific value chains that produces positive feedback loops and outsize profits…. It follows, then, that without that integration, the positive feedback loops quickly disappear, along with the profits, which is the exact pattern we see again and again. Microsoft spent billions on phones and consumer Internet services, Amazon spent billions on Whole Foods, Google has spent billions on not just Google Cloud but a whole host of initiatives that have nothing to do with Search, Facebook has spent billions on Watch and VR, and now Apple is getting in the game with billions spent on Video, and the expected outcome of all these should be that they will fail… What does work are (1) forward and backwards integrations into the value chain and (2) acquisitions. This makes sense: further integrations simply absorb more of the value chain, while acquisitions acquire not simply technology but businesses that are built from the ground-up for different value chains. And, by extension, if society at large wants to limit just how large these companies can be, limiting these two strategies is the obvious place to start.” • Hmm. Maybe I should have filed this under concentration.

UPDATE Tech: “Facebook as an American geopolitical weapon” [Surveillance Valley]. “As I explain in my book, Facebook (and American Internet companies in general) have always been an instrument of American power. Yet for years, the company had tried to sell itself as a totally neutral platform devoid of any national and geopolitical interests. And for a while it succeeded. But these days it doesn’t try to hide it anymore. After 2016, the mask has come off. Facebook now openly functions like an extension of American imperial power. What made this so obvious was the glaring double standard that’s guiding Facebook’s takedown of Maffick. On prodding from a U.S. government-funded thinktank, it suddenly demanded transparency for Pages run by a media company funded by Russia (and then shut them down with no warning). Yet Facebook continues to allow the U.S. government and powerful U.S. corporations to operate their Pages without hinderance — even when these Pages are obviously set up by lobby groups and government initiatives to covertly manipulate people and influence democracy.” • Kinda like Google News using Polygraph.info, jointly sponsored by state organs Radio Free Europe and Voice of America, as a fact checker. It’s right out in the open, isn’t it?

Tech: “Algorithmic Justice Could Clear 250,000 Convictions in California” [Artificial Lawyer]. “‘California has decriminalized recreational cannabis use, but a marijuana conviction continues to serve as a barrier to employment, housing, student loans and more. Lack of access to employment and housing are two primary drivers of recidivism, so until we clear these records it’s government that is effectively holding these people back and impeding public safety. I’m hopeful that this partnership will inspire many prosecutors who have cited resource constraints to join this common sense effort and provide this relief,’ [District Attorney George Gascón] added. And, Jennifer Pahlka, Founder and Executive Director, Code for America, said: ‘At Code for America, we believe government can work dramatically better than it does today, and the criminal justice system is one of the areas where we are most failing the American people. By reimagining existing government systems through technology and user-centred design, we can help governments rethink incarceration, reduce recidivism, and restore opportunity.'” • The project automated filling out forms only (which I suppose is “justice”). Maybe this is OK?

About Page [Youth Climate Strike]. Our Mission: “We, the youth of America, are striking because decades of inaction has left us with just 11 years to change the trajectory of the worst effects of climate change, according to the Oct 2018 UN IPCC Report. We are striking because our world leaders have yet to acknowledge, prioritize, or properly address our climate crisis. We are striking because marginalized communities across our nation —especially communities of color, disabled communities, and low- income communities— are already disproportionately impacted by climate change. We are striking because if the social order is disrupted by our refusal to attend school, then the system is forced to face the climate crisis and enact change. With our futures at stake, we call for radical legislative action to combat climate change and its countless detrimental effects on the American people. We are striking for the Green New Deal, for a fair and just transition to a 100% renewable economy, and for ending the creation of additional fossil fuel infrastructure. Additionally, we believe the climate crisis should be declared a national emergency because we are running out of time.” • Today is my day to be nice, but I’ll point out that these demands, too, do not put greenhouse gas reductions against policy proposals. (Yes, the numbers can be ballpark figures at most, but plenty of good projects go ahead on that basis.)

“Judge OKs $120 Million Deal Over Massive Methane Leak” [Courthouse News]. “A state court judge in Los Angeles approved a deal Monday in which Southern California Gas Company will pay $120 million to state and local agencies over the 2015 Aliso Canyon methane gas blowout that forced thousands of residents to flee their homes…. A portion of the $120 million agreement will go toward capturing methane expelled by dairy farms as mitigation of what was released during the blowout, but Earthjustice and other environmental groups argue this gives SoCal Gas a chance to take credit for reduction efforts that are paid in part by state funding.” • Seems low.

“The Water Resource Right Outside the Window” [Governing]. “Landscape irrigation is estimated to account for almost one-third of residential water use — nearly nine billion gallons a day. And as much as half of the water used outdoors is wasted due to evaporation, inefficient equipment and overwatering… Local decision-makers may wonder if residents are truly ready to alter their landscapes. Our survey of more than 3,000 North American homeowners indicates that the time is ripe to promote a new landscape ideal. While beauty and appearance was the most important aspect of their landscapes, nearly half of respondents also wanted their landscapes to be water-conscious. And contrary to popular belief, for most people a beautiful outdoor space doesn’t always conjure up visions of endless expanses of thirsty grass. More homeowners desired trees, flowers and functional spaces for entertaining.” • Also pollinators?

Health Care

“Underwood worries about debt as she considers universal healthcare” [Daily Herald (JB)]. “Underwood answered several health care questions by an audience that seemed largely in favor of universal health care. The problem, Underwood said, is universal health care means something different to almost everyone she speaks to. Some people want Medicare for everyone 55 and older, or 40 and older, or even from birth” • So liberal Democrats leverage the brand confusion they themselves created. More: “Underwood explained she’s especially mindful of the costs given the growing federal debt. ‘This tax plan put us in the hole read bad,’ she said. ‘It is unsustainable. This level of deficit spending is one that should make us pause. To be honest, part of the challenge in our ability to do our jobs is finding these pay-fors. My commitment is to put forward policies that don’t make the situation worse.'” • Sigh…

We do need to reduce the cost growth in these areas so they are accessible to everyone.” • “Accessible.”

“The ‘Hidden Mechanisms’ That Help Those Born Rich to Excel in Elite Jobs” (interview) [The Atlantic]. “I think the image that we have—or the ideology, if you want to be political about it—is once you’re 18 or so, you make your own way and your class origin is not an important part of how your career goes from there. But what my co-author Sam and I found was, that’s not at all true. In the book, we talked about people pursuing acting, which is a very contingent, hard path to pursue. Most people, when they start, aren’t making most of their money from acting, and so people who are able to rely on their parents to help them are much more able to pursue acting fully, because they don’t have to worry about maintaining a regular, full-time job just to eat and live.” • Another Friends subtweet?

“Different Kinds Of Loneliness – Having Poor Quality Relationships Is Associated With Greater Distress Than Having Too Few” [ResearchGate]. “The first class – which they called “low loneliness” – was characterised by low scores on both types of loneliness, social and emotional. Just over half the participants fell into this category. The second class – “social loneliness” – making up 8.2 per cent of the sample, comprised people low on emotional loneliness, but high on social loneliness. The third class – “emotional loneliness” – made up just over a quarter of the total sample and was characterised by the opposite pattern of high emotional loneliness but low levels of social loneliness. People in the fourth and final “social and emotional loneliness” class, accounting for 12.4 per cent of the sample, scored high for both types of loneliness. The researchers found a clear gradient of psychological distress across the classes. People in the low loneliness class were, predictably, least distressed, followed by people in the “social loneliness” class, then the “emotional loneliness” class, and finally the “social and emotional loneliness” class. In fact, people in both these last two classes had levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and negative psychological wellbeing that were reflective of a psychiatric disorder.” • Another Friends subtweet?

152,Empty,2019-02-28T23:02:32Z,"An online petition is suggesting that the state of Montana should be sold to Canada for US$1 trillion, but we're not buying it. The post Most Canadians don’t want to spend $1 trillion to buy U.S. state of Montana appeared first on Vancouver Is Awesome.","We have all been exposed to online petitions in the past few years, but one that caught the eye of the media on both sides of the 49th parallel this month was unique. Someone identified as Ian Hammond is suggesting that the state of Montana should be sold to Canada for US$1 trillion.

The petition alleges that the money that Canada would pay for what is colloquially known as Big Sky Country would be used to eliminate America’s national debt. While US$1 trillion is a considerable amount of money, the United States would be required to sell 21 more states at the same price to actually erase its national debt, calculated late last year a US$21.97 trillion.

In any case, the idea has provided plenty of fodder for the media. At the time of this writing, more than 16,000 people have added their names to the petition. Research Co. asked Canadians about it last week. Across the country, a majority of respondents (56%) disagreed with the notion of purchasing Montana, but almost three in 10 (28%) were ready to welcome an American state into Confederation.

Canadian men are more likely to support the purchase than women (32% to 24% respectively). On a regional basis, residents of Alberta boasted the highest level of support for a “Canadian Montana” at 37%, followed closely by Saskatchewan and Manitoba at 34%.

There was little fluctuation across party lines, with very similar proportions of Canadians who voted Conservative (30%), Liberal (28%) and New Democratic (26%) in the 2015 federal election saying Canada should buy Montana.

The biggest variation is observed on age. Just 21% of Canadians aged 55 and over and 28% of those aged 35-to-54 would consent to the Montana purchase. But the proportion jumps dramatically among those aged 18 to 34 to 41%.

Montana borders three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Its main economic activities are agriculture and ranching, which may suggest a perfect extension of Alberta into the south. However, Montana is landlocked, so its acquisition would not facilitate the process of getting Alberta’s oil to Asian markets, unless a pipeline somehow turned westward into Idaho and Oregon.

In some respects, Canada would be adding a distinctly multicultural province. Montana’s state motto, “Oro y Plata,” (“Silver and Gold”) is the only one in the entire United States to be penned in Spanish, instead of the most habitual Latin or English. The motto also enshrines the importance of mining, at a time when resource development projects have become more controversial than ever in Western Canada.

Montana’s state animal is the grizzly bear, the same species that was recently protected by the British Columbia government in the form of an extremely popular ban on trophy hunting. If Montana became a province, Canada would get a piece of the coveted Yellowstone National Park, as well as the second-largest ski resort in the United States – Big Sky.

There are also implications in the world of sport. Welcoming Montana into Confederation might help bring about tax incentives to refurbish the Centennial Ice Arena in Billings, in the hopes of bringing an eighth National Hockey League (NHL) team to Canada. Montana’s residents pay no sales tax, but that would change after the purchase. This should prompt the ownership group to christen the NHL franchise as the “GST Billings.”

The population of Montana is similar to those of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so both should serve as starting points to figure out how to establish a legislature for the newest Canadian province. Saskatchewan’s legislative assembly has 61 seats, and Manitoba’s has 57. Let’s split the difference and award Montana a legislature with 59 members.

At this time, Montana has 100 members in the state House of Representatives and 50 in the state Senate. A process of primaries would reduce those 150 state lawmakers to 59, and a test would transfer existing Democrats and Republicans into Canada’s more traditional political parties.

Montana’s three representatives in the U.S. Congress – two senators and one congressman—would be immediately appointed to the Canadian Senate. If we allocate Montana the same six seats that other western provinces have in the Red Chamber, that leaves us with three vacancies.

Let’s take two nominees from the realm of entertainment. Missoula-born filmmaker David Lynch and actor Dana Carvey would be wonderful additions to the upper house. We could even find a way for Mike Myers to preside their citizenship ceremony.

The final Senate nominee from Montana is Phil Jackson, who coached teams to 11 National Basketball Association titles. We not only gain a capable negotiator, but an ideal option to coach Canada’s basketball team in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics.

Unfortunately, Canadians rejected the purchase by a two-to-one margin. But we still can ponder what could be.",Most Canadians don’t want to spend $1 trillion to buy U.S. state of Montana,Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/28/canadians-dont-want-1trillion-purchase-montana-us-state/
153,Empty,2019-03-01T00:21:56Z,Dual loyalty. The post Ilhan Omar: Let’s talk about the influence in this country that says allegiance to a foreign country is okay appeared first on Hot Air.,"It is next-level demagoguery to suggest that accusations of anti-semitism by your critics are a matter of anti-Muslim bias and then, in almost the same breath, wheeze in an obvious allusion to Israel that “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”

Which influence is she thinking of? A shadowy, rootless, cosmopolitan influence, I’m guessing.

Rep. Omar elaborated that when she hears her Jewish constituents offer criticisms of Palestinians, she doesn’t automatically equate them as Islamophobic but is “fearful” that people are painting her as anti-Semitic because she is a Muslim. Omar continued, “What I’m fearful of — because Rashida and I are Muslim — that a lot of our Jewish colleagues, a lot of our constituents, a lot of our allies, go to thinking that everything we say about Israel to be anti-Semitic because we are Muslim,” she explained. “To me, it’s something that becomes designed to end the debate because you get in this space of – yes, I know what intolerance looks like and I’m sensitive when someone says, ‘The words you used Ilhan, are resemblance of intolerance.’ And I am cautious of that and I feel pained by that. But it’s almost as if, every single time we say something regardless of what it is we say…we get to be labeled something. And that ends the discussion. Because we end up defending that and nobody ever gets to have the broader debate of what is happening with Palestine.” “So for me, I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country,” Rep. Omar exclaimed, seeming to suggest, as Tlaib had in a tweet of her own, dual loyalty among a particular group of Americans. Loud rounds of applause and shouts of affirmation punctuated the event’s heavy focus on Israel.

Philip Klein knows a dual-loyalty smear aimed at Jews — sorry, at AIPAC — when he hears it. So does liberal Jonathan Chait:

Accusing Jews of “allegiance to a foreign country” is a historically classic way of delegitimizing their participation in the political system. Whether or not the foreign policy agenda endorsed by American supporters of Israel is wise or humane, it is a legitimate expression of their political rights as American citizens. To believe in a strong American alliance with Israel (or Canada, or the United Kingdom, or any other country) is not the same thing as giving one’s allegiance to that country. Omar is directly invoking the hoary myth of dual loyalty, in which the Americanness of Jews is inherently suspect, and their political participation must be contingent upon proving their patriotism.

“Whatever presumption of good faith she deserved last time should be gone now,” says Chait, referring to the uproar a few weeks ago after Omar tweeted that the GOP’s criticism of her over Israel was “all about the Benjamins” that had been paid to Republicans by AIPAC. She apologized “unequivocally” for that after her own leadership, led by Nancy Pelosi, accused her of using “anti-semitic tropes.” And yet, according to the same story excerpted above, when someone in the crowd last night shouted “It is about the Benjamins” to laugher and applause, “Reps. Omar and [Rashida] Tlaib both smiled along furtively.”

So how sorry is she?

I don’t know what Pelosi can do here even if she wants to do something, which she probably doesn’t. Clearly she’s not all that bothered by Omar’s musings; if she were, she wouldn’t have posed with her for that new “Rolling Stone” cover. And certainly she doesn’t want to be locked in a running battle over anti-semitism with one of the few Muslims in Congress and the only one who wears a hijab. It’s terrible press for the party and it’s apt to further embitter the dispute between the pro-Israel Democratic leadership and the anti-Israel progressive base. She’s going to look the other way whenever she can. Omar tweeting for all the world to see about AIPAC and “the Benjamins” was something that couldn’t be ignored. Omar rambling at some rando event about “allegiance to a foreign country” that only a bunch of righties plus Chait seem to care about? Forget it. Didn’t see the clip, Pelosi will tell reporters if she’s asked, before hurrying along to her next meeting.

What this is all building to is Omar not only speaking at the Dem convention next year but getting a standing ovation when she does. Watch and see.

Oh, she also did a little light shilling for Nicolas Maduro at this same event, because why should someone with garbage views on Jewish loyalty not have garbage views on all sorts of things?

154,Empty,2019-02-25T11:00:00Z,There’s a high level of optimism in all camps about Monday's federal byelection in which five candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new MP for the York-Simcoe riding.,"Monday's byelection in the York-Simcoe riding will see the People's Party of Canada (PPC) and Conservatives squaring off in a Tory-held riding for the very first time.

Nine candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new federal Member of Parliament for the riding and all eyes will be on the PPC to see how many votes they take away from the Conservatives, and whether it would be enough to tip the riding toward the Liberals or NDP.

Van Loan, a member of the Conservative Party, announced his retirement in September after 14 years as the representative of the riding — long considered a Tory stronghold.

Scot Davidson, the new Conservative Party candidate, said he's feeling confident.

""This is really a referendum on the Liberal government,"" said Davidson, a local entrepreneur from the town of Georgina.

Today, byelections will be held in ridings across the country including York–Simcoe in Ontario, Outremont in Quebec and Burnaby South in B.C. (CBC)

The York-Simcoe riding was one of three federal byelections called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Jan. 9.

Davidson has positioned himself as a businessman looking to apply his skills in helping industries grow, with a keen interest in supporting agriculture.

""Let's face it, this riding being so close to Toronto is a place where farmers themselves want to expand and look at even food processing. It's something that I can bring to the table and help facilitate,"" Davidson said.

He says he's not worried about being new to politics but rather sees it as an asset, insisting that he has ""young legs, I'm ready to run.""

Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka went head-to-head against Van Loan in the last federal election but fell short.

This time, the mother of two says she's back and has a better chance than ever.

""We increased the Liberal voter turnout by 400 per cent,"" she told CBC News, referring to the last federal election.

""When I asked the family whether I should take this on again because it's a big ask of the entire family, the boys said to me, 'You totally should, because this time you're going to win.'""

Shaun Tanaka is hopeful the headway she made in 2015's federal election will result in a Liberal upset this time around. (CBC)

Tanaka said she isn't worried about the SNC Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the prime minister.

""I am really focused on York-Simcoe, because that's where I'm running. And I'm not hearing it at the doors,"" she said.

""What I'm hearing at the doors [is] that it's hard to raise a family. I'm hearing at the doors that they are concerned about the health of Lake Simcoe,"" said Tanaka, adding that ""I want to be that voice in Ottawa.""

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she can be the voice of the local working class who are struggling. (Jessa McLean)

NDP candidate Jessa McLean says she's the voice of the working class.

""We have a lot of precariously employed people,"" she said. ""Our job market is, either you're commuting [to the city] for a half decent paying job or you're staying here and earning very little.""

She's a community organizer in the region and a champion of the ""$15 and Fairness"" campaign to push the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

""Our housing rates have gone up the most in terms of Ontario,"" she said.

""Rentals are up 56 per cent while our wages are only up 11 per cent.""

People's Party of Canada debut

This byelection is also the PPC's debut at the polls, and an out-of-towner — ex-Toronto prosecutor Robert Geurts — is its candidate.

""The project right now is to get the word out. We are a national party,"" he said.

Robert Geurts of the People's Party of Canada says a lot of this campaign has to do with spreading the word of the new party's existence. (CBC News)

Ex-conservative MP Maxime Bernier founded the party after losing the federal Conservative leadership nod to Andrew Scheer.

""Scot Davidson has no plan really to change anything. He's going to stick to Mr. Scheer's plan,"" said Geurts, explaining their focus on courting millennial voters.

""That generation is so bright, and so exciting. [They] haven't been corrupted yet,"" he said.

""That's where I think Bernier has sort of said, 'Listen, our platform is unfinished because there's some really exciting things we can do if we don't burden ourselves with the old baggage of before.""'

Monday's byelection comes three months after municipal elections and six months before the federal election in October.

REUTERS/Chris Wattie

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday shuffled his cabinet for the second time in six weeks in response to a crisis caused by the resignation of a minister who then alleged inappropriate conduct by officials.

Trudeau moved long-serving Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay to the veterans affairs portfolio to replace Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit on Feb. 12 after less than a month in the job.

Wilson-Raybould testified on Wednesday that when she was justice minister last year, officials in the Liberal government leaned on her to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

Her remarks prompted the leader of the official opposition Conservative Party to demand Trudeau’s resignation. Polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of a federal election set for this October.

Trudeau, who denies there was any wrongdoing, broke with tradition and did not take questions from reporters after the shuffle, which saw International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau replace MacAulay at agriculture.

Women’s Minister Maryam Monsef took on the international development portfolio in addition to her current job.",Canada PM shuffles cabinet for second time in six weeks amid crisis,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QI54N

While no destination is a complete utopia void of microaggressions or where the black experience exists in a vacuum, there are many places where black travelers have felt especially comfortable exploring, and others that are particularly exciting for black travelers this year. We tapped some of our favorite black travel bloggers and influencers to find out their favorite destinations of 2019. So whether you’re going abroad for the first time or you’re a seasoned traveler, here are six of the best places for black travelers to visit this year.

1. Ghana

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Afrochella (@afrochella) on Jan 7, 2019 at 2:46am PST

It’s been 400 years since the first slave ships departed from the shores of West Africa before arriving in the Americas. Ghanaian politicians have long been advocates of the pan-African movement. So in 2019, Ghana is welcoming people of African descent to visit with the promise of easier visa applications and a year-long calendar of culturally immersive events. As many are traveling to the country this year to connect with their ancestral roots, there has never been a better time for black travelers to visit Ghana.

First-time visitors should start their travels in the capital city, Accra. The city itself is a fusion of historical sights and modern culture. Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park is a popular attraction to visit as it’s where the life of Ghana’s first president — a revered pan-Africanist — is celebrated. Nights in Accra are best spent dining al fresco or vibing to Afrobeats at the city’s many rooftop bars.

Rooftop parties aren’t the only thing to look forward to when visiting Ghana this year. 2019 will see a huge amount of cultural events happening to surround the Year of Return festivities. Many organized tour groups will be traveling to the country to celebrate, including the popular New Year’s Eve party in Ghana. Afrochella, the black millennial music festival, and PANAFEST, a festival celebrating the resilience and achievements of African people, should also not be missed.

After exploring Accra, travelers should get out of the capital city to see another side of Ghana. From Accra, it’s relatively easy to explore other parts of the country. A three-hour drive outside of the capital city takes travelers looking to connect with their ancestral roots to former slave dungeon, Elmina Castle. Ironically, these not-so-castle-like quarters housed enslaved Africans during what was the last stop for many before the tumultuous journey known as the middle passage or transatlantic slave trade. Also, in the region is Cape Coast, another former slave house, and Kakum National Park, an oasis in the middle of the rainforest famous known for its 350-meter-high canopy walkway.

With an exciting lineup of cultural events, important historical sites, and the welcoming spirit of the Ghanaian people, we have to believe President Akufo-Addo when he said “the time is right” for people of African descent to return home to Ghana this year.

2. Montreal, Canada

If you’ve been dreaming of going to Paris and haven’t made the leap yet, try Montreal instead. It’s the perfect destination for black East Coasters wanting to experience a new culture without the long flight or the microaggressions that often come when traveling while black around Europe.

“Montreal always gives me a little bit of everything that I need for a quick getaway. It has the beauty and charm of Paris but with less visible anti-black microaggressions than French society,” said Nasir Fleming, travel writer and content manager at Shut Up and Go.

With the highest number of restaurants per capita in Canada, the city is full of culinary delights. Using downtown as a starting point, foodies should eat their way through the city tasting classic dishes like poutine, a Fairmount bagel, or a smoked meat sandwich. If you’re craving some soul food, Nasir said, “It [Montreal] has prominent Caribbean and North African communities, so when strolling through the city, you’ll easily find a Haitian or a Moroccan restaurant to give you some spice in your life.”

Black African and Caribbean culture has a strong presence in Montreal. Every April Vues d’Afrique holds the Pan-Africa International Film Festival — a celebration of African and Creole culture through film. Music lovers should plan to visit in June for the annual Montreal Jazz Festival featuring famous black jazz artists like Dianne Reeves and Buddy Guy.

“[I’m not saying] that Montreal is the ultimate holy land for black people, but it’s a nice way to get away from the messiness of the states when you’re on a budget,” explained Nasir.

Many also come to Montreal for its arts scene and abundance of parks. If you’re on a budget but still need your art fix, Montreal’s Museum of Fine Arts is free for everyone under 30. And every year on a Sunday in May, over 30 museums open their doors for free on Montreal Museums Day. Montreal is proof that you don’t need to travel far to experience an interesting culture. What’s more, if you can get your cultural fix without having to carry around the heavy feelings that sometimes come with traveling while black in Europe, it’s a win-win.

3. Senegal

Senegal, the coastal West African country known for its beautiful beaches and hospitable culture is an ideal destination for black travelers. Jakiya Brown, traveler and Senegal expat said, “The culture, vibrancy, and teranga (meaning Senegalese hospitality in the local language, Wolof) is the perfect combination, especially for people of the diaspora.”

Dakar is a thriving city with art, fresh seafood, and paradise-like beaches. The city is known as the art epicenter of West Africa. The largest and oldest contemporary art show in Africa, Dakar Biennale, is held every two years and attracts visitors from all over the world. Not to mention, there are dozens of art galleries throughout the city where black travelers can purchase locally made African art.

Seafood lovers will not be disappointed in Dakar. A lot of its best dishes include freshly caught fish because the city is full of traditional Senegalese fish markets. Ceebu jën (thieboudienne in French), Senegal’s national dish, is made from fish, rice, and tomato sauce. Black Americans with southern roots might recognize the dish as it closely resembles Southern red rice, which is popular in states like Georgia and South Carolina.

Black travelers visiting Senegal may want to pay a visit to the quiet island of Gorée. The tiny island just off the coast of Dakar is dotted with pastel-painted homes which mask its horrific past. Millions of enslaved Africans passed through the island before being shipped to the Americas. Black travelers wanting to connect with their ancestors should visit the House of Slaves (Maison des Esclaves). “Senegal makes for one unforgettable cultural experience, especially for black travelers, that will make you want to return “home” again and again,” said Jakiya.

If it’s Caribbean food, water adventures, and Creole culture that you want, look no further than Belize. Solo world travel blogger Ciara Johnson, of Hey Ciara, said, “Black travelers should consider visiting Caye Caulker. It’s a tiny island full of character off the coast of Belize.”

The allure of the small coastal island is its relaxing feel, crystal blue water, and afro-Belizean influences. It’s easy to get to Caye Caulker from the main island of Belize City. Take a one hour ferry from Belize City with Ocean Ferry Breeze or if you prefer to fly, a regional carrier, Maya Air, flies to the island in 25 minutes. You won’t have a hard time winding down here — its tourism slogan is “Go Slow” — with an endless amount of water activities and food that is sure to give you the itis. Water sports here include jet skiing, cliff jumping, diving, and kayaking. For a taste of traditional Afro-Belizean food, indulge in a “bile up” — a Belizean creole dish including boiled eggs, fish or pigtails with plantain, yams, and tomato sauce.

Black travelers wanting to experience afro-Belizean culture a bit deeper should head to Gulisi Garifuna Museum in Belize City for a look into the traditional culture of the indigenous Garífunaia people. Just two hours south of Belize City is Hopkins Village, a small fishing village. Laruni Hati Beyabu Diner in Hopkins Village is the perfect place to go to get a taste of traditional Garífunaia food like cassava, fish, coconut, and mashed plantains — no fork needed. The natural wonders and Creole culinary delights of Belize make it a paradise island that shouldn’t be overlooked.

5. United Arab Emirates

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Gloria Atanmo, The Blog Abroad (@glographics) on Feb 5, 2019 at 1:35pm PST

In 2015, there was an infamous Etihad Airways “error fare” from New York to Dubai for around $187 round trip. Many black travel communities on Instagram posted the flight deal encouraging travelers to book their tickets immediately. Since then, black travelers have looked to Dubai and Abu Dhabi for luxury vacations without the hefty price tag and for the community of black expats in the United Arab Emirates.

The allure of luxury experiences at an affordable price is what makes the UAE a popular destination. Lovers of luxury travel will want to indulge in the finer things like renting an all-inclusive yacht or jet skiing along Jumeirah Beach in Dubai. Brunch lovers should book a table at the elegant Rosewood Hotel in Abu Dhabi for their international garden brunch overlooking the waterfront. And then stick around after dining because the Rosewood turns into a party with a live DJ after 4:00 AM.

Those looking to dive into cultural experiences should head to the capital city, Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is only a two-hour bus ride away from Dubai. It’s known for its famous site, the Sheikh Zayed Mosque. “Beauty and opulence mixed in one, it’s enchanting, magnetic, and awe-inspiring the way such perfection sits there in all its white glory,” said Gloria Amato, travel blogger from The Blog Abroad.

For the solo black traveler wanting to experience the United Arab Emirates with a group, there are a few black-owned travel companies like Wind Collective, who host trips to Dubai. Traveling with a like-minded group of black travelers is a great way to ease into a new culture.

Multicultural cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi have attracted many black expats who often move there to lead simpler yet more fulfilling lives as compared to in the US. Sistas in Dubai is a social meetup group created for black women to bond over shared experiences living in the UAE. Gloria said, “I found the UAE to be a place where black travelers can thrive. I’ve met black entrepreneurs, engineers, and teachers through different emirates all living their best lives and I think it’s a place where you can indulge in the finer things in life without entirely breaking the bank.” So whether you’re visiting the region for a bit of culture or considering taking the leap to move abroad, there is a community of black travelers awaiting you.

6. Tunisia

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Eulanda+Omo👉Content creators (@dipyourtoesin) on Apr 27, 2018 at 10:24am PDT

Tunisia’s tourism numbers continue to recover from the 2015 terrorist attacks in the coastal city of Sousse and due to the temporary lack of mass tourism, this makes for an ideal time to explore the country.

Sub-Saharan African influences can be seen all throughout Tunis, the capital city of Tunisia. About 15 percent of Tunis’ population identifies as black. And in 1846, Tunisia was the first Arab Muslim country to abolish slavery and most recently, in 2018, it has passed legislation which criminalizes racist acts.

Black travelers wanting to connect with the black Tunisian culture should head to Jazz à Carthage in April. The festival is a celebration of international jazz that has been around since 2005, and features many black headlining artists such as Sabry Mosbah and more.

Visitors looking for some beach fun will find that traveling throughout the country to neighboring cities like Sidi Bou Said, the sun-drenched town perched on a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, is easily accessible. The cobblestone town is a perfect day escape — it’s only a 30-minute drive from the city center. For authentic shopping, head to the souks of the medina to barter with merchants over locally made goods like rugs or jewelry.

As lovers of Tunisia, Eulanda and Omo, travel bloggers at Hey Dip Your Toes In, said, “People of color can expect to be received with warmth and friendliness by the locals. Tunisia considers itself as one of the more liberal majority Muslim countries in the Arab world with democracy and reform both sources of national pride.” If you enjoy traveling somewhere that allows you to explore a completely new culture while still managing to feel like home, Tunisia should be on your list for 2019.",Destinations for black travelers,Matadornetwork.com,https://matadornetwork.com/read/best-destinations-black-travelers-2019/
157,Empty,2019-02-26T21:44:15Z,"Jagmeet Singh: lawyer, suit aficionado, NDP leader and now the MP for Burnaby South.","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won the Feb. 25, 2019 byelection and will now represent the riding of Burnaby South in Parliament.

He walked away with 39 per cent of the vote (8,884 votes), followed by Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22.5 per cent.

Here’s five things to know about Singh.

In 2011, Singh lost his first attempt to enter politics.

Singh’s first attempt to enter politics in 2011 was not successful. The longtime Toronto-area resident had run for federal government in the Brampton, Ont. riding of Bramalea-Gore-Malton but lost to Conservative candidate Bal Gosal by 539 votes.

Later that same year, he ran for a provincial seat in the overlapping riding and was elected with 38 per cent of the vote. After he was announced the winner, Singh gave a victory speech in English, French and Punjabi.

In 2017, Singh stepped down from his provincial seat after winning the federal NDP leadership race. He became the first member of a visible minority to lead a national political party. In 2019, he won a byelection in the B.C. riding of Burnaby South to secure a seat in parliament.

Singh has been hailed a ‘personality to watch’, ‘the greatest showman’ and the ‘most stylish politician in Canada.’

In 2012, the Toronto Star named Singh one of its “12 to watch in 2012.” In a profile, Singh was described as “not your typical New Democrat” and “one of the youngest, most dynamic MPPs at Queen’s Park”, a “trailblazer in Ontario politics.”

A Toronto Life feature last year called Singh “the greatest showman,” with a following that “should make Justin Trudeau nervous”, while a 2017 piece called him the “king of politician Instagram,” thanks to his photographs from international trips and of his well-cut suits. Earlier in 2013, Singh was also named among “the new power set” by the outlet.

Even popular magazine GQ chatted with Singh in 2017, the product of which was a piece that hailed Singh as an “incredibly well-dressed rising star in Canadian politics.”

“Jagmeet Singh looks the way you hope a progressive politician would,” begins the GQ piece. It’s safe to say Singh captured some attention on his way up through the political sphere with his approach and style.

Singh’s work as a lawyer paved his way into politics.

Singh has a science degree from the University of Western Ontario and a law degree from York University’s Osgoode Law School. He was called to the bar in 2006 and has worked throughout the Greater Toronto area, later opening his own firm.

Much of his work revolved around advocating for charter rights. In an interview with GQ, Singh said his entry into politics was largely due in part to his work in law: “As a lawyer I continued to do human rights work with local organizations and cultural communities that felt their political representation was inadequate; that the elected officials we had were not tackling the issues that mattered to them.”

Singh’s younger brother Gurratan is also a lawyer by trade but was elected last year in the Ontario provincial election in the riding of Brampton East. He has also served as Singh’s advisor during his campaigns.

At my little brother's call to the bar ceremony, he's a lawyer today…. proud of you bro. #proudolderbrother — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) September 21, 2011

Singh and wife Gurkiran Kaur recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

Singh and Kaur first met in 2010 when the former gave a presentation to Kaur’s class at York University. The pair went on a date in 2011 and kept things casual until 2017, when they went public with their relationship.

In January of 2018, Singh topped any photo-op Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had ever set up by inviting media to Toronto restaurant Vegetarian Haven – where the pair had their first date – to witness his proposal. The NDP leader got down one knee and proposed in front of family and friends as a quartet performed Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud.” Kaur said yes.

The couple married the next month, with a ceremony in Toronto and more festivities in Mexico. They celebrated their one-year anniversary on Feb. 22, 2019.

Singh’s victory song is Post Malone’s “Congratulations.”

Singh has said that during his NDP leadership campaign, he listened to Post Malone’s “Congratulations” “literally everyday.”

“Something about the bravado laced confidence of the track touched on the spirit of our campaign,” he wrote in a Dec. 12, 2017 Instagram post. “We were setting out to achieve something that had not been achieved in the history of our country.

“It takes a little bravado to do that.”

“Congratulations” was released as the promotional single for the American rapper’s debut album Stoney. The track reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 11 and has been certified eight times platinum. Singh rapped along to the song at his Burnaby victory party following the Feb. 25 byelection.",Five things to know about Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh,Vancouversun.com,https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/five-things-to-know-about-burnaby-south-mp-jagmeet-singh
158,Empty,2019-02-27T12:35:00Z,Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan after New Delhi launched air strikes in Pakistani territory. DW takes a look at the turbulent history between the nuclear-armed neighbors.,"Bloody partition (1947): The two neighbors have shared a tense relationship ever since the British divided the Indian subcontinent in a secular but mainly Hindu India and Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. The partition sparked riots and communal violence across the region and led to one of the largest human migrations in history.

The escalation of Kashmir conflict (1947-48): India and Pakistan contested Kashmir — a Muslim-majority kingdom ruled by a Hindu Maharaja — even before their independence from Britain. But the dispute escalated after Kashmir ruler Hari Singh acceded Kashmir to India in return for New Delhi's help to ward off attacks by an army of Pakistani tribesmen. The developments led to the first full-blown war over Kashmir between the two countries.

Partition of India: The way forward Birth of two nations In 1947, British India was divided into two countries - India and Pakistan. Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah and his All-India Muslim League party had first demanded autonomy for Muslim-majority areas in the undivided India, and only later a separate country for Muslims. Jinnah believed that Hindus and Muslims could not continue to live together, as they were distinctly different ""nations.""

Partition of India: The way forward The line of blood The partition of British India was extremely violent. Following the birth of India and Pakistan, violent communal riots began in many western areas, mostly in Punjab. Historians say that more than a million people died in clashes, and millions more migrated from Indian territory to Pakistan and from the Pakistani side to India.

Partition of India: The way forward The 1948 war India and Pakistan clashed over Kashmir soon after their independence. The Muslim-majority Kashmir region was ruled by a Hindu leader, but Jinnah wanted it to be part of Pakistani territory. Indian and Pakistani troops fought in Kashmir in 1948, with India taking control of most part of the valley, while Pakistan occupied a smaller area. India and Pakistan continue to clash over Kashmir.

Partition of India: The way forward Like US and Canada? Liberal historians say that Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi wanted cordial ties between newly independent states. Jinnah, for instance, believed that ties between India and Pakistan should be similar to those between the US and Canada. But after his death in 1948, his successors followed a collision course with New Delhi.

Partition of India: The way forward The 'other' Indian and Pakistani governments present very different accounts of the partition. While India emphasizes the Indian National Congress' freedom movement against British rulers - with Gandhi as its main architect - Pakistani textbooks focus on a ""struggle"" against both British and Hindu ""oppression."" State propaganda in both countries paints each other as an ""enemy"" that cannot be trusted.

Partition of India: The way forward Worsening ties Diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan have remained acrimonious for the past seven decades. The issue of Islamist terrorism has marred relations in the last few years, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of backing Islamist jihadists to wage a war in India-administered Kashmir. India also blames Pakistan-based groups for launching terror attacks on Indian soil. Islamabad denies these claims.

Partition of India: The way forward The way forward Many young people in both India and Pakistan are urging their governments to improve bilateral ties. Islamabad-based documentary filmmaker Wajahat Malik believes the best way for India and Pakistan to develop a closer relationship is through more interaction between their peoples. ""Trade and tourism are the way forward for us. When people come together, the states will follow suit,"" Malik told DW. Author: Shamil Shams



UN resolution (1948): India dragged the Kashmir dispute to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a resolution calling for a referendum to decide the status of Kashmir. But the Security Council made the referendum conditional to the withdrawal of Pakistani troops and reduction of Indian military presence to the minimum to maintain law and order in the region. The war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire but Pakistan refused to withdraw its troops. A ceasefire line effectively partitioned Kashmir with both sides controlling parts of the erstwhile kingdom but claiming it in its entirety.

Indo-Pakistan War (1965): Despite several attempts to solve the Kashmir dispute and deescalate tensions, the two neighbors fought their second war over the contested region. The brief war ended with yet-another UN-mandated ceasefire. Both sides returned to their previous positions.

War over Bangladesh (1971): India and Pakistan fought their third war, this time over East Pakistan. The conflict ended in a defeat for Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh.

Simla Agreement (1972): Following Pakistan's surrender in the 1971 war, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met and signed an agreement in the Indian hill town of Simla. The ceasefire line in Kashmir is designated as the Line of Control (LoC) and the two parties agree to resolve the dispute through negotiations.

Former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto signed the Simla Agreement in 1972

Armed resistance in Kashmir (1989): A pro-independenceinsurgencygathered momentum in India-administered Kashmir following disputed stateelections. The insurgency escalated over the next decade, partly fanned by a violent crackdown by Indian troops. India accused Pakistan of supporting the insurgents by providing weapons and training. Pakistan denied this claim.

Kargil conflict (1999): The two neighbors, by now nuclear powers, entered into an armed conflict after militants from across the LoC took control of key strategic positions in India-administered Kashmir. India drove the militants out but blamed Pakistan for supporting the incursion. The diplomatic gains made after a historic meeting in Lahore between the prime ministers of the two countries were eroded and India broke off relations.

Indian Parliament attack (2001): Tensions between India and Pakistan reached a new high after a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. India blamed Pakistan-based terror outfits for the attack and deployed troops on its borders with Pakistan. Islamabad reciprocated. The standoff ended after an international mediation.

Ceasefire (2003): The two sides agreed to a ceasefire along the LoC. The ceasefire is still in force but the two countries have blamed each other for occasionally violating it.

India broke off all talks with Pakistan after attacks in Mumbai that New Delhi claimed was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency.

Mumbai attacks (2008): Armed gunmen launched several attacks in India's financial capital of Mumbai, killing more than 150 people. India blamed Pakistan for the attacks. But Islamabad vociferously denied the Indian assertion that Lashkar-e-Taiba, the terror outfit behind the attacks, was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency. India broke off all talks with Pakistan after the attacks. New Delhi continues to maintain that ""terror and talks"" can't go together.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi tried to usher in a new era of peace.

Surgical strikes (2016): Efforts by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to relaunch talks came to an abrupt halt after an attack on an Indian army base by a Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India retaliated to the killing of 19 soldiers by launching ""surgical strikes"" on alleged terror camps on the other side of the LoC. Pakistan denied India's claims.

India bombs targets in Pakistan (2019): India conducted airstrikes on an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot. The attack came just days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for killing 40 Indian soldiers in a suicide attack in Kashmir. A day later, Pakistan said it downed two Indian jets in retaliation.

159,Empty,2019-02-28T13:03:44Z,"As the USA and North Korea meet in Vietnam to discuss the possibility of a peace treaty between the two after decades of hostility against North Korea from the USA, the governments of Russia and Japan are engaged in talks … The post Russia, Japan and the USA:…","As the USA and North Korea meet in Vietnam to discuss the possibility of a peace treaty between the two after decades of hostility against North Korea from the USA, the governments of Russia and Japan are engaged in talks about concluding a peace treaty to formally end the war between them that began during the Second World War. The two meetings are related since they concern peace and security in Asia and the Pacific and because the stumbling block to peace in both instances is the threat posed by the United States conventional and nuclear forces in the region.

North Korea has long sought a peace treaty with the USA along with a firm guarantee that the USA will not attack. North Korea’s requests for peace have been met, up until now, with nothing but false promises, unjust sanctions, attempts to isolate it from the world and threats of annihilation. The USA, on the other hand, has only one objective, the nuclear disarmament of North Korea, making it vulnerable to American attack while claiming the right to retain and develop its triad of nuclear forces and the right to use them whenever it sees fit. Since the word of the US leadership is not worth much, as the world has seen time and again as the US reneges on one international agreement after another, hopes of something positive coming out of the Korean-American meeting in Vietnam are slim. But we can hope.

The situation between Japan and Russia is also at an impasse and once again the basic cause for this is the USA. The key sticking point between them since the 1950’s has been, and remains, control over the Kuril Islands that lie north of the Japanese Island of Hokkaido and south of the Russian territories on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The islands have changed hands between them several times in history but with the defeat of Japan in 1945 the islands were given to the USSR by international agreement with Japan protesting that it should have ownership and control of the four southern islands in the chain. The islands have been in Russian hands ever since.

In 1956 the USSR and Japan entered into negotiations to try to conclude a peace treaty that resulted in a Joint Declaration paragraph 9 of which stated,

“9. Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics agree to continue, after the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, desiring to meet the wishes of Japan and taking into consideration the interests of Japan, agrees to hand over to Japan the Habomai Islands and the island of Shikotan. However, the actual handing over these islands to Japan shall take place after the conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.”

A peace treaty has never been concluded and the main reason is the signing in 1960 of a military treaty between Japan and the USA, the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, first signed in San Francisco in 1954, but amended in January 1960, which the USSR regarded as a hostile act. One of the key elements of the amended agreement, and which highlights Japan’s status as an occupied nation, provides for the continued presence of US military bases in Japan. The provisions of the treaty stipulate that it was to remain in force permanently unless one party gives a year’s notice that it wishes to terminate it. Since Japan is still, in reality, an occupied nation it is unlikely that any Japanese government will give such a notice unless it wants to draw down on itself the full measures of retaliation for which the USA is notorious.

The implications of the treaty were recognized by many in Japan at the time and the leftist opposition tried to prevent its ratification by the Japanese Diet. There were physical confrontations between members of the Japanese Socialist Party that opposed it and the Liberal Democratic Party deputies supporting it and this was followed by massive demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions. A Peoples Council to stop the treaty was formed representing a cross section of Japanese society including labour unions, farmers, teachers, poetry circles theater groups, student and women’s organisations and groups affiliated with the Socialist and Communist Parties but they were unsuccessful.

They took issue with the treaty primarily because of Article 6 that contains a Status of Forces Agreement on the stationing of US forces in Japan that permits the US to make major changes in the placement and location of bases and the use of those bases for US combat operations other than in defence of Japan, that is for offensive operations against other nations, with Japan thrown the bone of being “consulted” on these issues. It was a confirmation to many at the time that Japan remained an occupied country even though the formal military occupation had been declared at an end.

The consequences of the treaty are still important today as the US bases on the Japanese island of Okinawa continue to meet resistance from the people while successive Japanese governments, controlled by reactionary forces, act in lock step with the US in enforcing the agreement against the peoples’ wishes. Just this week Prime Minister Abe ignored a referendum that opposed the presence of the largest Okinawa base and instead approved the US plans for its relocation on the island.

As a result of the amendment of the Japan–US treaty, the USSR in January 1960, issued a Memorandum which needs to be read in full:

“The Soviet Union certainly cannot ignore such a step as Japan’s conclusion of a new military treaty which undermines the basis for peace in the Far East and creates obstacles to the development of Soviet-Japanese relations. A new situation has formed in relation to the fact that this treaty actually deprives Japan of independence and that foreign troops stationed in Japan as a result of Japan’s surrender remain on Japanese territory. This situation makes it impossible for the Soviet Government to fulfill its promises to return the islands of Habomai and Shikotan to Japan. It is because the Soviet Government met Japan’s wishes and took into consideration the interests of Japan and the peace-loving intentions expressed by the Japanese Government during the Soviet-Japanese negotiations that it agreed to hand over such islands to Japan after the signing of a peace treaty. But since the new military treaty signed by the Japanese Government is directed against the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, the Soviet Government cannot contribute to extending the territory available to foreign troops by handing over such islands to Japan. Thus, the Soviet Government finds it necessary to declare that the islands of Habomai and Shikotan will be handed over to Japan, as was stated in the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration of October 19, 1956, only if all foreign troops are withdrawn from Japan and a Soviet-Japanese peace treaty is signed.”

So, the USSR saw the Japan US treaty as a hostile act against both it and China, as a statement that Japan remained an occupied nation and was willing to conclude a peace treaty if, and only if, US forces were withdrawn from Japan.

The present Russian government states that this memorandum does not clarify conditions for handing over the islands and so further clarification is needed. What this language means is not clear but it is not a repudiation of the demand by the USSR that US forces be removed from Japan before a peace deal can be concluded. The dilemma for Russia is that the US forces in Japan are a threat to peace in the region and to Russia and China. Further, they fear that if they ignore the Soviet memorandum and go ahead with a peace treaty and hand over the designed islands to Japan the islands will be quickly occupied by US forces which will install their AEGIS missile systems there that can deploy nuclear armed missiles close to Russia in the Pacific and will allow them to threaten the large Russian naval base at Vladivostok. Yet the Japanese government, backed by the US, is pushing for the return of the islands as a precondition of a peace treaty. The Russians refuse to allow this.

In return the Russians can use the Memorandum as a lever to force the Japanese to kick the US forces out of Japan. So the impasse remains.

That these issues were discussed at a meeting on February 16 between Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Japanese Foreign Minister Kono at the Munich Conference is indicated by the statement of the Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshida Suga at a press conference in Tokyo that “there was a frank, though sometimes heated, exchange of views’ between the two,” diplomatic language for a blazing row.

The Japanese have been in the process of signing military accommodation agreements with a number of Pacific Rim countries, including Canada, the past year, allowing for exchanges of military assistance, training, transfers of equipment and cooperation at the same time as it tries to wiggle out from the Japanese constitution imposed by the Americans that limits its military forces to defensive purposes. Japan wants to be a major power once again, not only economically, but also politically and militarily. It continues to rely on the American military umbrella as it does this and this also suits American immediate objectives since Japan can then become a powerful ally in the region. Japan seems to want to become more than an ally of the US. It wants to become again a power in the world in its own right. Until it has achieved its objective of again being a world power it can be expected to be a loyal ally to the USA and therefore a threat to Russia. It will not ask the US to withdraw its forces until it is ready; and the Russian government would face serious problems on the domestic front if it surrendered the islands to Japan under these conditions so it is unlikely that a peace treaty can be concluded between Russia and Japan in the near future.

So as North Korea, having suffered decades of Japanese military occupation, tries to deal with US militarism in the region, Russia has to contend with both US existing militarism and a rising Japanese militarism both of which constitute threats to its peace and security, a result of unfinished business from a world war that threatens a new world war.

In dramat…,"Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister's office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn't illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,"" the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit the cabinet this month, also said she faced ""veiled threats"" about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau's team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall's election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party's past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau's path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

""I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. ""Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.""

The image of Wilson-Raybould, Canada's first Indigenous attorney general, skewering her ex-boss, a famed liberal who pledged to improve relations with native peoples and self-described feminist, has taken the shine off the PM.

“This is a huge, huge blow to Justin Trudeau’s personal brand and Justin Trudeau’s promise of doing politics differently,” a polling firm executive told the New York Times. “That shine is not dented or scratched. It’s been completely scuffed.”

Wilson-Raybould was the only Indigenous Canadian in Trudeau's cabinet, before she resigned.

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what's known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges involving the former Libyan government. SNC is accused of paying about $36 million dollars in bribes to those connected to the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi, as well as defrauding the Libyan government of nearly $100 million.

The charges relate to the world's largest irrigation system — the Great Man-Made River project.

SNC-Lavalin has said that those responsible for alleged wrongdoing left the company a long time ago. Gaddafi was killed in 2011 by militants aided by a coalition Western nations, including Canada, that provided key air support.

The company's stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada and 50,000 worldwide, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn't even legally able to intervene.

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company's relocation — and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party's provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. ""The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,"" Wilson-Raybould said. She said she'd told him she had made up her mind.

""The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,"" while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country's top bureaucrat, also warned her the company ""will likely be moving to London"" without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: ""We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.""

She met Butts in December in Ottawa, and was already frustrated by what she called ""the barrage of people hounding me and my staff."" She pushed back. ""I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC, as I had made up my mind and that the engagements were inappropriate.""

She read a text-message conversation with her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, who was relaying a conversation with Butts and Telford. Wilson-Raybould said Prince was told by Butts ""there is no solution here that does not involve some interference."" She said Prince told her Telford said: ""We don't want to debate legalities anymore.""","Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau faces political crisis, sullied image after former justice minister claims 'veiled threats'",Chicagotribune.com,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trudeau-wilson-raybould-20190302-story.html

Wilson-Raybould is due to testify to the House of Commons justice committee about a newspaper report which said she was pressured by senior officials last year to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

Polls show the allegation is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election against the official opposition Conservative Party in October.

Trudeau said on Tuesday the Liberal government would waive cabinet confidentiality to let Wilson-Raybould address most aspects of the case, but not all of them.

In a letter send to the justice committee late on Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould complained this “falls far short of what is required” for her to give a full account.

Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday the “justice committee is looking into the issue of whether or not (Wilson-Raybould) underwent pressure or inappropriate pressure and she will be able to speak fully.”

Opposition politicians accuse Trudeau of trying to cover up an attempt by officials to help SNC-Lavalin, which could be banned from bidding for federal contracts for a decade if found guilty on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

“Justin Trudeau can no longer hide the fact that he was at the center of an attempt to interfere in a criminal prosecution. He must come clean with Canadians,” Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony is due to start at about 4 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) and last for about two hours.

While officials say they spoke to Wilson-Raybould about the potential economic damage a trial could cause SNC-Lavalin, they insist they did not behave inappropriately.

Trudeau last week said he had been concerned about possible job losses at the firm. SNC-Lavalin is based in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

The Globe and Mail newspaper, which broke the story, said Wilson-Raybould had resisted pressure to let SNC-Lavalin off with a fine. She was unexpectedly demoted in January and resigned in February.

To the list of critics slamming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over a massive domestic political scandal, add one foreign player: the People’s Republic of China.

For weeks, Trudeau’s Liberal government has been rocked by claims that it inappropriately pressured the country’s first indigenous attorney general to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a firm from the prime minister’s home province.

The case touches on a host of hot-button Canadian issues, including Quebec, indigenous affairs and corporate influence. On Friday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs helpfully injected another angle, judicial independence, potentially compounding Trudeau’s troubles.

The question of judicial independence is at the heart of the SNC-Lavalin case. Unfortunately for Trudeau, it was also at issue in another recent legal-political drama: the arrest, in Vancouver, of Huawei Technologies’ chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver’s airport Dec. 1 on U.S. charges, setting off a diplomatic dispute that’s seen China call for Meng’s release and — when that failed — the detention of two Canadian citizens in China.

Trudeau and his team have stressed that Meng’s arrest was a legal matter, not a political one. The prime minister said Canada must adhere to its extradition treaty with the United States and could not and would not interfere on Meng.

When the former Canadian ambassador to China hinted that a deal could be cut, he was forced to resign. “We are a country of rule of law,” Trudeau said, again and again.

On Friday, at a news briefing in Beijing, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs took issue with that claim, telling reporters that Canada has questions to answer when it comes to the rule of law.

A reporter for a Communist Party-controlled news outlet asked the spokesman, Lu Kang, whether it was contradictory for Trudeau to say he couldn’t interfere in Meng’s case while at the same time being accused of intervening on SNC-Lavalin.

Lu, who does not typically praise reporters or weigh in on Canadian politics, responded that he “really liked” the question, according to Reuters. “Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” he said.

""In fact, on this case you have mentioned, people in Canada are paying it a great deal of attention,” Lu continued. “Not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

The reporter’s leading question drew a false parallel between what’s happening in the Meng case, which is in the courts, and a still-unfolding political scandal that’s seen no charges brought — a pretty standard-issue move.

Indeed, since Meng’s arrest, Chinese diplomats and the Communist Party-controlled press have tried to link Meng’s arrest to, among other things, Canadian white supremacy.

But it’s still significant to see a Chinese official comment on the political fortunes of a foreign leader. His tone sends a clear message to Ottawa: We know you are weak.

The question now is whether Trudeau’s Canadian critics pick up Lu’s line of attack. To do so would help China make a point. It would also make things even worse for Trudeau.

She danced herself to her death six days later, and soon thirty-four more villagers joined her. Then more. In a month more than 400 people had died from the mysterious dancing plague. In late-nineteenth-century England an eccentric gentleman founded the No Nose Club in his gracious townhome—a social club for those who had lost their noses, and other body parts, to the plague of syphilis for which there was then no cure.

From blonde to ginger, the brown that changed the way battles were fought to the white that protected against the plague, Picasso's blue period to the charcoal on the cave walls at Lascaux, acid yellow to kelly green, and from scarlet women to imperial purple, these surprising stories run like a bright thread throughout history.In this book, Kassia St. Clair has turned her lifelong obsession with colours and where they come from (whether Van Gogh's chrome yellow sunflowers or punk's fluorescent pink) into a unique study of human civilization. Across fashion and politics, art and war, the secret lives of colour tell the vivid story of our culture.Behind oak-panelled doors in the House of Commons, men with cut-glass accents and gold signet rings are conspiring to murder. It's the late 1960s and homosexuality has only just been legalised, and Jeremy Thorpe, the leader of the Liberal party, has a secret he's desperate to hide. As long as Norman Scott, his beautiful, unstable lover is around, Thorpe's brilliant career is at risk. With the help of his fellow politicians, Thorpe schemes, deceives, embezzles - until he can see only one way to silence Scott for good.The trial of Jeremy Thorpe changed our society forever: it was the moment the British public discovered the truth about its political class.

Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps.

There, in a public ceremony, the frightened but dignified child handed over to the British East India Company in a formal Act of Submission to Queen Victoria not only swathes of the richest land in India, but also arguably the single most valuable object in the subcontinent: the celebrated Koh-i Noor diamond. The Mountain of Light.The history of the Koh-i-Noor that was then commissioned by the British may have been one woven together from gossip of Delhi Bazaars, but it was to be become the accepted version. Only now is it finally challenged, freeing the diamond from the fog of mythology which has clung to it for so long. The resulting history is one of greed, murder, torture, colonialism and appropriation through an impressive slice of south and central Asian history. It ends with the jewel in its current controversial setting: in the crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.Masterly, powerful and erudite, this is history at its most compelling and invigorating.It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened, a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack.In an attempt to discover why, Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author ofand arguably Japan’s most important contemporary novelist, talked to the people who lived through the catastrophe—from a Subway Authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere.

But the song's international popularity is no passing fad. ""Gangnam Style"" is only one tool in South Korea's extraordinarily elaborate and effective strategy to become a major world superpower by first becoming the world's number one pop culture exporter.As a child, Euny Hong moved from America to the Gangnam neighbourhood in Seoul. She was a witness to the most accelerated part of South Korea's economic development, during which time it leapfrogged from third-world military dictatorship to first-world liberal democracy on the cutting edge of global technology.Euny Hong recounts how South Korea vaulted itself into the twenty-first century, becoming a global leader in business, technology, education, and pop culture. Featuring lively, in-depth reporting and numerous interviews with Koreans working in all areas of government and society,reveals how a really uncool country became cool, and how a nation that once banned miniskirts, long hair on men, and rock ‘n' roll could come to mass produce boy bands, soap operas, and the world's most important smart phone.Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits., he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives,"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.""Who were they? Ordinary people like you or me—or monsters?” asks internationally acclaimed author Slavenka Drakulić as she sets out to understand the people behind the horrific crimes committed during the war that tore apart Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Drawing on firsthand observations of the trials, as well as on other sources, Drakulić portrays some of the individuals accused of murder, rape, torture, ordering executions, and more during one of the most brutal conflicts in Europe in the twentieth century, including former Serbian president Slobodan Milošević; Radislav Krstić, the first to be sentenced for genocide; Biljana Plavšić, the only woman accused of war crimes; and Ratko Mladić, now in hiding.With clarity and emotion, Drakulić paints a wrenching portrait of a country needlessly torn apart.The “dean of Cold War historians” (The New York Times) now presents the definitive account of the global confrontation that dominated the last half of the twentieth century. Drawing on newly opened archives and the reminiscences of the major players, John Lewis Gaddis explains not just what happened but why—from the months in 1945 when the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. went from alliance to antagonism to the barely averted holocaust of the Cuban Missile Crisis to the maneuvers of Nixon and Mao, Reagan and Gorbachev.Brilliant, accessible, almost Shakespearean in its drama,stands as a triumphant summation of the era that, more than any other, shaped our own.",IJAF!

164,Empty,2019-02-27T12:35:00Z,Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan after New Delhi launched air strikes in Pakistani territory. DW takes a look at the turbulent history between the nuclear-armed neighbors.,"Bloody partition (1947): The two neighbors have shared a tense relationship ever since the British divided the Indian subcontinent in a secular but mainly Hindu India and Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. The partition sparked riots and communal violence across the region and led to one of the largest human migrations in history.

The escalation of Kashmir conflict (1947-48): India and Pakistan contested Kashmir — a Muslim-majority kingdom ruled by a Hindu Maharaja — even before their independence from Britain. But the dispute escalated after Kashmir ruler Hari Singh acceded Kashmir to India in return for New Delhi's help to ward off attacks by an army of Pakistani tribesmen. The developments led to the first full-blown war over Kashmir between the two countries.

Partition of India: The way forward Birth of two nations In 1947, British India was divided into two countries - India and Pakistan. Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah and his All-India Muslim League party had first demanded autonomy for Muslim-majority areas in the undivided India, and only later a separate country for Muslims. Jinnah believed that Hindus and Muslims could not continue to live together, as they were distinctly different ""nations.""

Partition of India: The way forward The line of blood The partition of British India was extremely violent. Following the birth of India and Pakistan, violent communal riots began in many western areas, mostly in Punjab. Historians say that more than a million people died in clashes, and millions more migrated from Indian territory to Pakistan and from the Pakistani side to India.

Partition of India: The way forward The 1948 war India and Pakistan clashed over Kashmir soon after their independence. The Muslim-majority Kashmir region was ruled by a Hindu leader, but Jinnah wanted it to be part of Pakistani territory. Indian and Pakistani troops fought in Kashmir in 1948, with India taking control of most part of the valley, while Pakistan occupied a smaller area. India and Pakistan continue to clash over Kashmir.

Partition of India: The way forward Like US and Canada? Liberal historians say that Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi wanted cordial ties between newly independent states. Jinnah, for instance, believed that ties between India and Pakistan should be similar to those between the US and Canada. But after his death in 1948, his successors followed a collision course with New Delhi.

Partition of India: The way forward The 'other' Indian and Pakistani governments present very different accounts of the partition. While India emphasizes the Indian National Congress' freedom movement against British rulers - with Gandhi as its main architect - Pakistani textbooks focus on a ""struggle"" against both British and Hindu ""oppression."" State propaganda in both countries paints each other as an ""enemy"" that cannot be trusted.

Partition of India: The way forward Worsening ties Diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan have remained acrimonious for the past seven decades. The issue of Islamist terrorism has marred relations in the last few years, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of backing Islamist jihadists to wage a war in India-administered Kashmir. India also blames Pakistan-based groups for launching terror attacks on Indian soil. Islamabad denies these claims.

Partition of India: The way forward The way forward Many young people in both India and Pakistan are urging their governments to improve bilateral ties. Islamabad-based documentary filmmaker Wajahat Malik believes the best way for India and Pakistan to develop a closer relationship is through more interaction between their peoples. ""Trade and tourism are the way forward for us. When people come together, the states will follow suit,"" Malik told DW. Author: Shamil Shams



UN resolution (1948): India dragged the Kashmir dispute to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a resolution calling for a referendum to decide the status of Kashmir. But the Security Council made the referendum conditional to the withdrawal of Pakistani troops and reduction of Indian military presence to the minimum to maintain law and order in the region. The war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire but Pakistan refused to withdraw its troops. A ceasefire line effectively partitioned Kashmir with both sides controlling parts of the erstwhile kingdom but claiming it in its entirety.

Indo-Pakistan War (1965): Despite several attempts to solve the Kashmir dispute and deescalate tensions, the two neighbors fought their second war over the contested region. The brief war ended with yet-another UN-mandated ceasefire. Both sides returned to their previous positions.

War over Bangladesh (1971): India and Pakistan fought their third war, this time over East Pakistan. The conflict ended in a defeat for Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh.

Simla Agreement (1972): Following Pakistan's surrender in the 1971 war, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met and signed an agreement in the Indian hill town of Simla. The ceasefire line in Kashmir is designated as the Line of Control (LoC) and the two parties agree to resolve the dispute through negotiations.

Former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto signed the Simla Agreement in 1972

Armed resistance in Kashmir (1989): A pro-independenceinsurgencygathered momentum in India-administered Kashmir following disputed stateelections. The insurgency escalated over the next decade, partly fanned by a violent crackdown by Indian troops. India accused Pakistan of supporting the insurgents by providing weapons and training. Pakistan denied this claim.

Kargil conflict (1999): The two neighbors, by now nuclear powers, entered into an armed conflict after militants from across the LoC took control of key strategic positions in India-administered Kashmir. India drove the militants out but blamed Pakistan for supporting the incursion. The diplomatic gains made after a historic meeting in Lahore between the prime ministers of the two countries were eroded and India broke off relations.

Indian Parliament attack (2001): Tensions between India and Pakistan reached a new high after a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. India blamed Pakistan-based terror outfits for the attack and deployed troops on its borders with Pakistan. Islamabad reciprocated. The standoff ended after an international mediation.

Ceasefire (2003): The two sides agreed to a ceasefire along the LoC. The ceasefire is still in force but the two countries have blamed each other for occasionally violating it.

India broke off all talks with Pakistan after attacks in Mumbai that New Delhi claimed was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency.

Mumbai attacks (2008): Armed gunmen launched several attacks in India's financial capital of Mumbai, killing more than 150 people. India blamed Pakistan for the attacks. But Islamabad vociferously denied the Indian assertion that Lashkar-e-Taiba, the terror outfit behind the attacks, was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency. India broke off all talks with Pakistan after the attacks. New Delhi continues to maintain that ""terror and talks"" can't go together.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi tried to usher in a new era of peace.

Surgical strikes (2016): Efforts by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to relaunch talks came to an abrupt halt after an attack on an Indian army base by a Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India retaliated to the killing of 19 soldiers by launching ""surgical strikes"" on alleged terror camps on the other side of the LoC. Pakistan denied India's claims.

India bombs targets in Pakistan (2019): India conducted airstrikes on an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot. The attack came just days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for killing 40 Indian soldiers in a suicide attack in Kashmir. A day later, Pakistan said it downed two Indian jets in retaliation.

Feb. 28 (UPI) -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denied accusations Thursday that he attempted to intervene in a corruption investigation targeting a major Canadian contractor.

Trudeau's comments came a day after former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau pressured her, as Canada's top prosecutor, to abandon the investigation of SNC-Lavalin.

She said the intervention included threats from Trudeau and senior staff.

Thursday, Trudeau said he's trying to determine whether Wilson-Raybould will be allowed to remain in the Liberal caucus. She left the justice ministry in January to head the veterans affairs ministry. She resigned from that post earlier this month.

The company had lobbied for a ""remediation agreement"" to pay a fine and avoid trial. If convicted of charges, SNC-Lavalin would be banned for 10 years from bidding for federal contracts.

In dramatic testimony Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau called her a week before a cabinet shuffle last month and advised her that she would effectively be reassigned.

""I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case,"" she said.

Trudeau said Thursday he disagreed Wilson-Raybould's account of events, adding that any lobbying he or his staff did in SNC-Lavalin's behalf was done to protect jobs.

""I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,"" he said, adding that her departure from the justice ministry had nothing to do with SNC-Lavalin.

""Had [former treasury board president] Scott Brison not stepped down, Jody Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,"" he said.

Trudeau said it will be up to ethics commissioner Mario Dion to determine who's telling the truth.

""Canadians need to know that we have an officer of Parliament who is tasked with a specific role to make sure that in questions where there are disagreements amongst politicians, amongst elected officials, there is an arbiter who is empowered to be like a judge,"" he said.

Some in Canada's Conservative Party have urged the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate, and some called for Trudeau's resignation.

Examining his record on the economy, corruption, foreign policy, and the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities

In Part One of this essay , I looked at why the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant received so little historical respect for so long, and why his record on Reconstruction — the defining issue of his time in office (1869–1876) — deserves to be honored, even though many of his accomplishments in that area failed to endure beyond his presidency.

As with any president, however, Grant had a lot else on his plate. Today, I’ll look at Grant’s record in three other areas: the economy and corruption, foreign policy, and the treatment of Native Americans and religious minorities.

The Gilded Age: President Grant’s economic record was decidedly mixed in the short run, but much better in the long run. The national economy boomed until it crashed in 1873, setting off a years-long depression that hit Europe as well as the U.S. Huge fortunes were made and lost during Grant’s presidency. The average American grew better off, but not nearly as much as the wealthiest “robber barons.” Ultimately, presidents in the 19th century had few levers to influence the economy besides building interstate infrastructure. But that was just as well, given the primitive state of economic thought at the time beyond the basics of supply and demand. Grant cut spending and debt in his first term, and cut tariffs as well, though he embraced a more protectionist view in his second term.

Grant, painfully aware of his limited business acumen, may have relied too much on the advice of plutocrats, but he was also free of ideology. In 1874, he stayed up all night alone preparing a message explaining his reasons for signing an inflationary bill authorizing new paper money; unpersuaded by his own arguments, he reversed course and vetoed the bill the next morning. For better and worse, it is hard to picture a modern president doing that.

In the long run, the laissez-faire economy of the 1860s and 1870s would lay the foundation for a massive expansion of American industry, transforming the country in the following decades into the world’s mightiest economic power. For all the criticisms of the inequalities of the Gilded Age in the roaring North and West of the country, the era was much kinder to those regions and their inhabitants than to the South, where industrialization lagged and black Americans in particular were left behind, with most toiling as subsistence sharecroppers.

Corruption was the watchword of the day, and scandals connected the highest levels of finance and industry (the gold market, the railroad business) with the highest levels of the federal government, reaching Grant’s own family and closest advisers. This was partly a feature of the times, but it was more than a coincidence that it happened on Grant’s watch. Grant throughout his life was an excellent judge of talent but a terrible judge of character, naïve about business and a frequent target of con men. His combination of loyalty to friends and family, magnanimity, and willingness to give the benefit of the doubt meant that he lacked the instinct to cut off ethically compromised people until the evidence against them was overwhelming. While Grant was sensitive to ethical conflicts of interest during the war, his finances were also chronically insecure, and he openly envied the gifts lavished by other grateful nations on their war heroes (e.g., the U.K.’s treatment of the Duke of Wellington). He seems never to have questioned why benefactors would ply him with favors. He also remained a foe of the civil-service reforms that were ultimately implemented after James Garfield’s assassination, partly out of loyalty to the spoils-system bosses who supported him.

If Grant was too tolerant of unethical people, he also presided over a new Justice Department that instituted the first large-scale prosecutions of federal-government corruption in U.S. history. The first special counsels date to the Grant years, and while Grant sacked one of them for impugning his own integrity in a closing argument to a jury, he generally let the chips fall where they may — even when corruption probes ensnared people close to him. Just as his Reconstruction policies created tools with which future presidents could attack America’s racial problems, his handling of the Justice Department created tools for future presidents to attack corruption.

Foreign policy: Taking the reins of a war-weary nation at the tail end of a turbulent period in international affairs, Grant’s chief concern was to still the waters. As general of the Army, he had pushed for an invasion of Mexico to dislodge the French and chase out ex-Confederate adventurers such as Jubal Early whom he suspected of further hostile intentions. Then–secretary of state William H. Seward, however, counseled patience, and three events in 1867 vindicated him: The French-backed regime in Mexico fell, Seward completed the Alaska purchase, and the British established the unified Dominion of Canada (in part a response to the realization in 1861 that Canada was unprepared to fend off a feared American invasion). By the time Grant took office, North America was quiet.

The great foreign-policy success of Grant’s tenure was the peaceable resolution of the CSS Alabama claims. America demanded damages from Great Britain, still the world’s most powerful empire, over “neutral” British provision of a warship to the Confederacy. Grant and his secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, managed an international arbitration that gave a substantial monetary award to the United States, reduced tensions with Britain so successfully as to set the two nations on the path to a long-term alliance, and established a new model for the resolution of international disputes. The Alabama precedent was so respected internationally that Grant was later asked to mediate a dispute between China and Japan.

Grant failed at his other major foreign-policy goal, the American annexation of Santo Domingo, the territory that would become the Dominican Republic. Haiti’s island neighbor, which had failed in its first try as an independent state and gone through a period of renewed Spanish control, was receptive to an American purchase, but tenacious opposition in the Senate shot down Grant’s plan. Where antebellum efforts to annex Latin American territory aimed at plowing new fields for human bondage, Grant had other purposes for seeking to annex the Dominican, which he envisioned as an American state: exploiting its natural resources, providing a domestic haven for African Americans fleeing southern repression, and building a naval base to control the approaches to a future Central American canal. (As it happened, it would be a generation before the canal would be built, but the Suez Canal had opened in 1869 and a canal across Panama or Nicaragua was already eagerly anticipated.)

A successful annexation may have been in America’s long-term interests as well as those of the Dominican and Haiti. For better or worse, it would have changed the shape of U.S.–Caribbean relations for generations. But Grant was unable to galvanize popular opinion or persuade influential senators — even ardent abolitionists such as Charles Sumner — who feared assuming responsibility for an island nation full of black, Spanish-speaking people.

Having measured the limits of popular appetite for expansion into the Caribbean, Grant backed down from an 1873 confrontation with Spain that found his administration on the opposite side of the Alabama precedent when an American ship was captured bringing aid to Cuban rebels. He was more successful in opening foreign markets to trade without annexation, as he did in Korea (using gunboat diplomacy) and Hawaii.

Despite the missed opportunity in Santo Domingo, Grant could claim one major long-term foreign-policy accomplishment with no foreign wars and no serious setbacks for the nation — a better record than those of many other presidents before and after him.

Sioux gold, Chinese women, and religious liberty: Aside from his valiant but often doomed efforts to secure African-American civil rights, Grant’s record on the rights of minority groups in America was checkered, to say the least.

The frontier was still a pressing concern. As with his Reconstruction policy, Grant tried to be magnanimous and pacific in his dealings with both Native Americans and western settlers, and found himself instead caught between two perpetually warring camps. In the most celebrated example, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, the ancestral lands of the Sioux, led to the usual pressures from white settlers seeking to exploit valuable resources and remove the tribe to some place out of the way. Grant not only failed to hold back the tide, he also let himself be talked into keeping George Armstrong Custer on the mission to confront the Sioux, against his better judgment. The 1876 massacre of Custer’s men was a short-term humiliation for the U.S. Army. It was also a long-term disaster for Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the Sioux tribe, who found themselves in the unenviable position of having galvanized the American public to support a punitive military response.

The Sioux didn’t care much about gold; in purely economic terms, they would gladly have traded their lands for greener pastures. But they cared very much about the importance of the Black Hills to their religious traditions. Grant’s Native American policies were based on the view that the tribes would never be able to live in peace or prosperity until they assimilated into “white” civilization: Christianity, schooling, farming, trades. This was both a well-meaning and a coldly realistic point of view, vindicated by subsequent history, but it gave no weight to Native American religion or culture.

For Grant, a devout if undemonstrative Methodist, failures of empathy for religious minorities and a preference for assimilation into the institutions of mainstream Protestant America were recurring blind spots. The most infamous example was General Order No. 11, a hastily issued 1862 directive that expelled Jews from Grant’s military district. The order, swiftly rescinded at the insistence of a horrified President Lincoln, could be understood in context (Grant was furious at merchants trading with the enemy, including his own father’s Jewish business partners) but not justified. Grant simply gave in to anti-Semitic stereotypes. He repented soon afterward, and spent a good deal of his campaigns and presidency building bridges with American Jews in a sincere show of having learned from a prejudiced decision made with too little thought.

He did not rethink his approach toward Catholics or Mormons, however. Amid an openly anti-Catholic debate over “the School Question” with parallels to the contemporary Kulturkampf in Germany, Grant in an 1875 speech called for new laws on secular and religious schooling, as part of a legislative agenda he summarized in his penultimate State of the Union message in 1875, which warned of the subversion of intelligent self-government by “the demagogue or by priestcraft”:

First. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a good common-school education to every child within their limits. Second. No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in whole or in part by the State, nation, or by the proceeds of any tax levied upon any community. Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all persons who can not read and write from becoming voters after the year 1890, disfranchising [sic] none, however, on grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect. Third. Declare church and state forever separate and distinct, but each free within their proper spheres; and that all church property shall bear its own proportion of taxation. Fourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as polygamy and the importation of women for illegitimate purposes. To recur again to the centennial year, it would seem as though now, as we are about to begin the second century of our national existence, would be a most fitting time for these reforms.

Notably, in contrast to current policy, Grant proposed taxing church properties, excepting only churches and cemeteries. James G. Blaine, then speaker of the House, introduced a constitutional amendment, which was understood at the time to be aimed squarely at states such as New York that chose to support Catholic schooling out of their general-education budgets:

No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.

The amendment passed the House overwhelmingly before falling four votes short in the Senate. Thirty-eight states would subsequently add “Blaine Amendments” to their own constitutions in the following decades — amendments that remain potent weapons in education-funding battles to this day. In 1884, Catholic backlash against Blaine in New York cost Republicans the White House for the first time since 1856.

Grant also pressed for a hard federal line against Mormon marriage practices, as he noted elsewhere in his 1875 State of the Union message:

In nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting to Congress I have called attention to the anomalous, not to say scandalous, condition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah, and have asked for definite legislation to correct it. That polygamy should exist in a free, enlightened, and Christian country, without the power to punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality, seems preposterous. True, there is no law to sustain this unnatural vice; but what is needed is a law to punish it as a crime, and at the same time to fix the status of the innocent children, the offspring of this system, and of the possibly innocent plural wives. But as an institution polygamy should be banished from the land.

Grant was following two decades of Republican rhetoric; the 1856 party platform had declared that “it is the duty of Congress to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.” Federal law banned bigamy in 1862, and in 1874, Grant signed the Poland Act, removing such prosecutions to federal court to prevent nullification by local Mormon-dominated courts. (Brigham Young himself was indicted in 1872.) In the end, after harsher federal action in the 1880s, the Church of Latter-day Saints renounced plural marriage, paving the way for Utah statehood and eventual Mormon acceptance into the American mainstream.

On immigration, Grant moved from the liberalizing Naturalization Act of 1870, which allowed black immigrants to be naturalized on the same terms as whites, to the Page Act of 1875, the nation’s first restrictive immigration law. The Page Act banned immigration by Chinese women, which Grant saw as necessary to prevent sex trafficking and de facto sex slavery: “I invite the attention of Congress to another, though perhaps no less an evil — the importation of Chinese women, but few of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful occupations.” The ban would be followed, in 1882, by a broader ban on Chinese immigration.

Grant’s Mormon policy, Native American policy, and support for the Page Act were all part of a broader, Victorian-era view of public morality and humanitarianism that incorporated his opposition to slavery and the Klan. Grant supported and signed the 1873 “Comstock laws” that forbade use of the mails to promote abortion, contraception, or pornography, and appointed their proponent, Anthony Comstock, a special agent of the Postal Inspection Service with broad powers of enforcement.

Many of Grant’s collisions with religious practices came on issues that remain fraught to this day. In 2019’s political climate, Grant would be considered a conservative on traditional marriage, abortion, and international sex trafficking, and a liberal on education funding. His view of the path forward for Native Americans was, if jarring to modern eyes, more humane than those of Sherman and Sheridan, and prescient about the fate of the tribes of the Great Plains. Yet recent positive biographies have mostly ignored Grant’s record on a number of these issues. Ron Chernow, for example, spends a lot of time examining Grant’s relationship with American Jews, but ignores his record on Mormon polygamy and Chinese immigration, and essentially endorses his pro–Blaine Amendment stance.

Grant in full: On the strength of his military record, Ulysses S. Grant was one of our greatest Americans, and his presidency should be seen as an addition to that legacy, not an embarrassment. Grant’s flaws deserve to be remembered. He probably could not have done much more to build public support for continuing Reconstruction after 1876, but he could have done more to prevent corruption, respect religious liberties, win the debate over Dominican annexation, and avoid the catastrophe at Little Bighorn. The corruption scandals of Grant’s tenure were far less important in the long run than his policy record, which they should not be allowed to overshadow, but they did interfere with his ability to do the job by handicapping his Supreme Court nominations, his Reconstruction and Native American policies, and even his efforts to annex Santo Domingo.

In the end, though, Grant buried secession and slavery for good, kept the peace abroad, laid the building blocks for a long-term Anglo–American alliance, oversaw the nation’s turn down the path to economic-superpower status, and can claim both the Fifteenth Amendment and the modern Justice Department as important milestones in his legacy. That’s a record any president would be proud of.

167,Empty,2019-02-26T19:03:35Z,The three major parties all came out of last night's byelections with reasons to celebrate - and even more reasons to worry.,"Is the glass half full or half empty?

Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats might all be asking themselves that question today after seeing the results from last night's three federal byelections.

On one hand, each party scored a win and made some gains in popular support — the NDP in Burnaby South, the Conservatives in York–Simcoe and the Liberals in Outremont.

On the other, each party also suffered a hit in support in electoral battlegrounds key to their hopes for success in October's federal vote.

Eric, Francoise, Stockwell and Supriya break down the byelection results. 9:53

Turnout was abysmal, even by byelection standards. It hit a new low in this session in York–Simcoe, where preliminary turnout figures stand at just 19.9 per cent.

Bad weather undoubtedly played a role in that, but neither Outremont nor Burnaby South had the same excuse. Turnout was just 21.4 per cent in Outremont and 29.9 per cent in Burnaby South — both below average levels for a byelection.

That makes it difficult to draw wider conclusions from the results but — notwithstanding the low turnout — the voting patterns still fit within the broader historical trends in each riding.

So what are the tea leaves saying?

Liberals can still bank on Quebec to offset losses elsewhere

The path to re-election for Justin Trudeau's Liberals in the fall is to win new seats in Quebec — largely at the expense of the NDP — to compensate for what appear to be inevitable losses in places like the Greater Toronto Area.

That strategy looks intact after Monday, with the Liberals gaining 6.9 percentage points in the Montreal riding of Outremont and taking the seat away from the NDP.

With 40.4 per cent of the vote, Rachel Bendayan put up the best result for the Liberals in Outremont since 2004. If the party can repeat these gains in other parts of Quebec, the New Democrats will be hard-pressed to hold any of the 16 seats they won in the province in 2015.

But the Liberals will struggle to hold or win suburban seats in the rest of Canada if they repeat the kind of losses they suffered in Burnaby South (a drop of 7.9 points from the previous vote) and York–Simcoe (a drop of 8.8 points).

Singh finally gets his win, but ...

The big winner on Monday has to be NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. He staked his political future on the voters of Burnaby South and his gamble paid off. This is the first win Singh can boast of since he became leader in October 2017 and it's only the second byelection of the 17 held in the current Parliament which saw the NDP increase its share of the vote.

Singh beat his nearest rival, Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, by a margin of 13 points — far better than the 1.2-point margin the NDP managed in this seat in 2015. He gained 3.9 points over the NDP's performance in the riding here last time. The lack of a Green candidate on the ballot in Burnaby South might have helped Singh, but the jump in the NDP's performance there was bigger than the 2.9 per cent of the vote the Greens took in 2015.

New Democrats should worry about the 18-point drop in their support in Outremont, however. The result is in line with losses the party has suffered in other byelections in Quebec, so it isn't all due to the departure of former leader (and Outremont MP) Tom Mulcair.

Polls suggest the NDP has lost a lot of support in Quebec and every last one of its seats is vulnerable. The results in Outremont did nothing to change that perception.

With 26.1 per cent of the vote, however, the NDP's Julia Sanchez did better than the party's candidates did in Outremont in 2004 and 2006 — before Mulcair's breakthrough in 2007. That suggests the New Democrats have planted some roots in the province.

But those roots aren't deep enough to allow the NDP to breathe easily in Quebec, though it might offer hope to some of their higher-profile incumbents — people like Alexandre Boulerice, Ruth Ellen Brosseau and Guy Caron — that they can withstand the headwinds pushing against them.

A win is a win, but Conservative numbers flat

Of the three main parties, the Conservatives may have had the least at stake on Monday. York–Simcoe is a party stronghold where conservative candidates (of all stripes) have won the most votes in every election since 1979. But there's nothing in the results that should fill the Conservatives with enthusiasm — or dread, for that matter.

A win is a win, and Scot Davidson secured that for the party by a comfortable margin. But a gain of only 3.6 points in York–Simcoe is not what the Conservatives should be seeing if they're on track to oust the Liberals from power this year.

At 53.9 per cent, Davidson's share of the vote was well below the scores the party put up in York–Simcoe when it won government in 2008 and 2011. The win also pales in comparison to the 10.4-point gain the Conservatives saw in the Leeds-Grenville–Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes byelection in December.

Mixed results for Bernier, new high for Greens

People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier might be pleased with Laura-Lynn Thompson's 10.6 per cent result in Burnaby South, but Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is likely relieved that the PPC captured just two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York–Simcoe.

A party with national aspirations should expect to take more than two per cent of the vote in any riding; independent candidates combined for 1.8 per cent of the vote in Burnaby-South and the Progressive Canadian Party captured 3.8 per cent in York–Simcoe. Few seats will be decided by a margin of two points or less in the fall.

The Conservatives might be able to write off Thompson's performance as the result of her particular appeal for social conservative voters in that one riding. But if even half of that vote had gone to the Conservatives, they would have finished a strong second. If Bernier can find more candidates like Thompson, he might still have a spoiler role to play in the fall.

The Greens managing 12.5 per cent of the vote in Outremont — the party's best result in any federal election in any riding in Quebec — is notable, as the environment has emerged as a more pressing issue for voters in Quebec than in other parts of the country.

It makes for a crowded field in the province — the Bloc Québécois' new leader, Yves-François Blanchet, is a former environment minister and Singh has used the Liberal government's purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline as a wedge issue in Quebec. There might not be room for three parties in Quebec going hard on the environmental file.

But for now, there's something in these byelection results for just about everyone to be happy about. There's plenty of things there for them to worry about, too — and less than eight months left to worry about them.","Win, lose or draw?

Assad met with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, as well as other top officials in Tehran. It was a rare foreign trip for Assad, who has visited Russia twice since the outbreak of the conflict eight years ago.

Khamenei praised Assad for strengthening the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah against US and Western plans for the region.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran sees helping Syria's government and nation as support for the resistance movement and is deeply proud of doing it,"" Khamenei said.

""The creation of the buffer that the Americans are seeking to create in Syria is an example of these dangerous conspiracies which must be strongly denounced and resisted,"" Khamenei added.

Syrian state TV reported that Assad ""thanked the Islamic Republic's leadership and people for what they have given to Syria during the war."" The presidency said ""both sides expressed their satisfaction with the strategic levels reached between the two countries in all fields.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on 'I feel nothing' On February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran from exile in France. When a reporter asked him how he felt upon his return to Iran, Khomeini replied: ""Nothing — I feel nothing."" Some analysts interpreted his remarks as the Shiite leader's idea about embarking on a ""divine mission"" where emotions hardly mattered.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The Shah ran out of time Two months before Khomeini's return to Iran, an estimated six to nine million people took to the streets in the country's major cities. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, compared to the violent September 8, 1978, protests. The Shah regime, headed by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, had realized that its time in power was over and that they could not stop Khomeini's return.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Even women rooted for Khomeini The revolutionary mood was so intense in Tehran that even many women celebrated Khomeini's return, ignoring the fact that Khomeini had slammed Shah's measures for women's emancipation in exile. In 1963, the Shah of Iran granted women the right to vote.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on A spectacle of exuberance In 1971, the Shah and his wife Farah Diba (seen in the picture) staged a lavish spectacle on the ancient site of Persepolis to mark the ""2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarchy."" Many heads of state attended the event. Khomeini, in his message from exile, condemned the monarchy as ""cruel, evil and un-Islamic.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Exile and death Under pressure from the Islamic Revolution, the Shah (left) had left Iran on January 16, 1979. After spending time in several countries, he succumbed to cancer on July 27, 1980 in Cairo, Egypt.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Consolidating power In the beginning, women's rights were not a major issue for the Islamic revolutionaries. They only imposed hardline Islam after consolidating their victory.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Soldiers join the revolution Upon Khomeini's return to Iran in 1979, the military did not confront the protesters. On February 11, the army declared itself neutral. Despite that, the revolutionaries executed several generals in February and April.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on New government Soon after his return, Khomeini declared the monarchy, the previous government and parliament illegal, and said he would appoint a government ""because of the fact that this nation believes in me."" According to Iran experts, it was not self-deception but reality.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The liberal face of the revolution Mehdi Bazargan, a scholar and pro-democracy activist, had campaigned against the Pahlavi dynasty, for which he had been incarcerated for several years. Khomeini appointed him as his first prime minister, although Bazargan was critical of him as well. Bazargan had called Khomeini a ""turbaned Shah"" after a meeting with the Ayatollah in Paris. He remained in office for only nine months.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Occupation of the US Embassy In November 1979, radical Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took the embassy staff hostage. The students were fearful of Shah's return to power with US help. Khomeini took advantage of the situation. He dismissed his opponents as ""US allies.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Ali Khamenei – guardian of the revolution In 1989, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was elected by the expert council to succeed Khomeini. Khamenei, to this date, has the ultimate power over all state institutions. Although the 79-year-old does not have the same charisma as his predecessor, he represents the policies of Iranian hardliners who refuse to reform the system and continue to persecute dissidents.

Assad takes victory lap

Assad has retaken major cities and largely defeated rebels seeking to oust him with the support of Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

The regime now controls most of the population and about two-thirds of the country, excluding a jihadi-controlled enclave in Idlib, Turkish zones in the north and a part of the country controlled by US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces. Assad has vowed to bring all territory under the state's sovereignty.

Sitting in the room during Assad's meeting with Khamenei was General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force — the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which has provided the Syrian regime with military and financial support.

During their meeting, Rouhani assured Assad that ""Tehran will be alongside Damascus in the stabilization, return of refugees and internal political process.""

The two presidents also discussed efforts by Russia, Iran and Turkey to end the Syrian conflict.

Iranian-backed Shiite militias have carved out a major role in Syria's security apparatus, and Tehran and Damascus have in recent months signed a string of economic deals that are likely to further increase Iran's long-term presence in the country.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization National support against Israel Hezbollah emerged in the 1980s as an amalgamation of Shiite militias and played a major role in the Lebanese civil war. It used guerrilla warfare to drive Israeli forces out of South Lebanon — Israel withdrew in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought another war in 2006. Its defense of Lebanon against Israel had won it cross-sectarian support and acceptance in Lebanese society.

Today, Hezbollah's military wing is more powerful than Lebanon's own army and has become a major regional paramilitary force.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Political apparatus Hezbollah turned its focus to politics following the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. It represents a large section of the Lebanese Shiite population and is allied with other sectarian groups, including Christians. Their political development has mostly come under Hassan Nasrallah (pictured), who became the group's leader in 1992.

Some Lebanese political groups, such as Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future Movement, want Hezbollah to put down its arms. Hezbollah argues its militant wing is necessary to defend against Israel and other external threats.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Hezbollah enters Syria's civil war Hezbollah has been one of the main backers of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. Its entrance into the war helped save Assad, one of its chief patrons; secured weapons supply routes from Syria and formed a buffer zone around Lebanon against Sunni militant groups it feared would take over Syria. As a result it has won considerable support from Shiite communities in Lebanon.

However, Hezbollah's military and political ascendancy, as well as its intervention in Syria, have also helped stoke Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions in Lebanon and across the region.

Tensions with Israel, US

Iran's growing influence in Syria has increased the prospect of a conflict with Israel, which has carried out dozens of attacks on Iranian forces, Shiite militia and Hezbollah.

US President Donald Trump announced in December that all American forces would leave Syria, but US officials recently said between 200-400 troops would remain in the country to support US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and prevent a resurgence of the ""Islamic State."" The US also has a base at al-Tanf, near the Iraqi border, where troops are expected to stay.

The decision to maintain a US troop presence is intended to prevent clashes between US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces and NATO ally Turkey. It is also viewed as an attempt to stop the Assad regime and Iran-backed militia from widening their grip over more of Syria's territory.

Grant received so little historical respect for so long, and why his record on Reconstruction — the defining issue of his time in office (1869–1876) — deserves to be honored, even though many of his accomplishments in that area failed to endure beyond his presidency.

As with any president, however, Grant had a lot else on his plate. Today, I’ll look at Grant’s record in three other areas: the economy and corruption, foreign policy, and the treatment of Native Americans and religious minorities.

The Gilded Age: President Grant’s economic record was decidedly mixed in the short run, but much better in the long run. The national economy boomed until it crashed in 1873, setting off a years-long depression that hit Europe as well as the U.S. Huge fortunes were made and lost during Grant’s presidency. The average American grew better off, but not nearly as much as the wealthiest “robber barons.” Ultimately, presidents in the 19th century had few levers to influence the economy besides building interstate infrastructure. But that was just as well, given the primitive state of economic thought at the time beyond the basics of supply and demand. Grant cut spending and debt in his first term, and cut tariffs as well, though he embraced a more protectionist view in his second term.

Grant, painfully aware of his limited business acumen, may have relied too much on the advice of plutocrats, but he was also free of ideology. In 1874, he stayed up all night alone preparing a message explaining his reasons for signing an inflationary bill authorizing new paper money; unpersuaded by his own arguments, he reversed course and vetoed the bill the next morning. For better and worse, it is hard to picture a modern president doing that.

In the long run, the laissez-faire economy of the 1860s and 1870s would lay the foundation for a massive expansion of American industry, transforming the country in the following decades into the world’s mightiest economic power. For all the criticisms of the inequalities of the Gilded Age in the roaring North and West of the country, the era was much kinder to those regions and their inhabitants than to the South, where industrialization lagged and black Americans in particular were left behind, with most toiling as subsistence sharecroppers.

Corruption was the watchword of the day, and scandals connected the highest levels of finance and industry (the gold market, the railroad business) with the highest levels of the federal government, reaching Grant’s own family and closest advisers. This was partly a feature of the times, but it was more than a coincidence that it happened on Grant’s watch. Grant throughout his life was an excellent judge of talent but a terrible judge of character, naïve about business and a frequent target of con men. His combination of loyalty to friends and family, magnanimity, and willingness to give the benefit of the doubt meant that he lacked the instinct to cut off ethically compromised people until the evidence against them was overwhelming. While Grant was sensitive to ethical conflicts of interest during the war, his finances were also chronically insecure, and he openly envied the gifts lavished by other grateful nations on their war heroes (e.g., the U.K.’s treatment of the Duke of Wellington). He seems never to have questioned why benefactors would ply him with favors. He also remained a foe of the civil-service reforms that were ultimately implemented after James Garfield’s assassination, partly out of loyalty to the spoils-system bosses who supported him.

If Grant was too tolerant of unethical people, he also presided over a new Justice Department that instituted the first large-scale prosecutions of federal-government corruption in U.S. history. The first special counsels date to the Grant years, and while Grant sacked one of them for impugning his own integrity in a closing argument to a jury, he generally let the chips fall where they may — even when corruption probes ensnared people close to him. Just as his Reconstruction policies created tools with which future presidents could attack America’s racial problems, his handling of the Justice Department created tools for future presidents to attack corruption.

Foreign policy: Taking the reins of a war-weary nation at the tail end of a turbulent period in international affairs, Grant’s chief concern was to still the waters. As general of the Army, he had pushed for an invasion of Mexico to dislodge the French and chase out ex-Confederate adventurers such as Jubal Early whom he suspected of further hostile intentions. Then–secretary of state William H. Seward, however, counseled patience, and three events in 1867 vindicated him: The French-backed regime in Mexico fell, Seward completed the Alaska purchase, and the British established the unified Dominion of Canada (in part a response to the realization in 1861 that Canada was unprepared to fend off a feared American invasion). By the time Grant took office, North America was quiet.

The great foreign-policy success of Grant’s tenure was the peaceable resolution of the CSS Alabama claims. America demanded damages from Great Britain, still the world’s most powerful empire, over “neutral” British provision of a warship to the Confederacy. Grant and his secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, managed an international arbitration that gave a substantial monetary award to the United States, reduced tensions with Britain so successfully as to set the two nations on the path to a long-term alliance, and established a new model for the resolution of international disputes. The Alabama precedent was so respected internationally that Grant was later asked to mediate a dispute between China and Japan.

Grant failed at his other major foreign-policy goal, the American annexation of Santo Domingo, the territory that would become the Dominican Republic. Haiti’s island neighbor, which had failed in its first try as an independent state and gone through a period of renewed Spanish control, was receptive to an American purchase, but tenacious opposition in the Senate shot down Grant’s plan. Where antebellum efforts to annex Latin American territory aimed at plowing new fields for human bondage, Grant had other purposes for seeking to annex the Dominican, which he envisioned as an American state: exploiting its natural resources, providing a domestic haven for African Americans fleeing southern repression, and building a naval base to control the approaches to a future Central American canal. (As it happened, it would be a generation before the canal would be built, but the Suez Canal had opened in 1869 and a canal across Panama or Nicaragua was already eagerly anticipated.)

A successful annexation may have been in America’s long-term interests as well as those of the Dominican and Haiti. For better or worse, it would have changed the shape of U.S.–Caribbean relations for generations. But Grant was unable to galvanize popular opinion or persuade influential senators — even ardent abolitionists such as Charles Sumner — who feared assuming responsibility for an island nation full of black, Spanish-speaking people.

Having measured the limits of popular appetite for expansion into the Caribbean, Grant backed down from an 1873 confrontation with Spain that found his administration on the opposite side of the Alabama precedent when an American ship was captured bringing aid to Cuban rebels. He was more successful in opening foreign markets to trade without annexation, as he did in Korea (using gunboat diplomacy) and Hawaii.

Despite the missed opportunity in Santo Domingo, Grant could claim one major long-term foreign-policy accomplishment with no foreign wars and no serious setbacks for the nation — a better record than those of many other presidents before and after him.

Sioux gold, Chinese women, and religious liberty: Aside from his valiant but often doomed efforts to secure African-American civil rights, Grant’s record on the rights of minority groups in America was checkered, to say the least.

The frontier was still a pressing concern. As with his Reconstruction policy, Grant tried to be magnanimous and pacific in his dealings with both Native Americans and western settlers, and found himself instead caught between two perpetually warring camps. In the most celebrated example, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, the ancestral lands of the Sioux, led to the usual pressures from white settlers seeking to exploit valuable resources and remove the tribe to some place out of the way. Grant not only failed to hold back the tide, he also let himself be talked into keeping George Armstrong Custer on the mission to confront the Sioux, against his better judgment. The 1876 massacre of Custer’s men was a short-term humiliation for the U.S. Army. It was also a long-term disaster for Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the Sioux tribe, who found themselves in the unenviable position of having galvanized the American public to support a punitive military response.

The Sioux didn’t care much about gold; in purely economic terms, they would gladly have traded their lands for greener pastures. But they cared very much about the importance of the Black Hills to their religious traditions. Grant’s Native American policies were based on the view that the tribes would never be able to live in peace or prosperity until they assimilated into “white” civilization: Christianity, schooling, farming, trades. This was both a well-meaning and a coldly realistic point of view, vindicated by subsequent history, but it gave no weight to Native American religion or culture.

For Grant, a devout if undemonstrative Methodist, failures of empathy for religious minorities and a preference for assimilation into the institutions of mainstream Protestant America were recurring blind spots. The most infamous example was General Order No. 11, a hastily issued 1862 directive that expelled Jews from Grant’s military district. The order, swiftly rescinded at the insistence of a horrified President Lincoln, could be understood in context (Grant was furious at merchants trading with the enemy, including his own father’s Jewish business partners) but not justified. Grant simply gave in to anti-Semitic stereotypes. He repented soon afterward, and spent a good deal of his campaigns and presidency building bridges with American Jews in a sincere show of having learned from a prejudiced decision made with too little thought.

He did not rethink his approach toward Catholics or Mormons, however. Amid an openly anti-Catholic debate over “the School Question” with parallels to the contemporary Kulturkampf in Germany, Grant in an 1875 speech called for new laws on secular and religious schooling, as part of a legislative agenda he summarized in his penultimate State of the Union message in 1875, which warned of the subversion of intelligent self-government by “the demagogue or by priestcraft”:

First. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a good common-school education to every child within their limits. Second. No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in whole or in part by the State, nation, or by the proceeds of any tax levied upon any community. Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all persons who can not read and write from becoming voters after the year 1890, disfranchising [sic] none, however, on grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect. Third. Declare church and state forever separate and distinct, but each free within their proper spheres; and that all church property shall bear its own proportion of taxation. Fourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as polygamy and the importation of women for illegitimate purposes. To recur again to the centennial year, it would seem as though now, as we are about to begin the second century of our national existence, would be a most fitting time for these reforms.

Notably, in contrast to current policy, Grant proposed taxing church properties, excepting only churches and cemeteries. James G. Blaine, then speaker of the House, introduced a constitutional amendment, which was understood at the time to be aimed squarely at states such as New York that chose to support Catholic schooling out of their general-education budgets:

No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.

The amendment passed the House overwhelmingly before falling four votes short in the Senate. Thirty-eight states would subsequently add “Blaine Amendments” to their own constitutions in the following decades — amendments that remain potent weapons in education-funding battles to this day. In 1884, Catholic backlash against Blaine in New York cost Republicans the White House for the first time since 1856.

Grant also pressed for a hard federal line against Mormon marriage practices, as he noted elsewhere in his 1875 State of the Union message:

In nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting to Congress I have called attention to the anomalous, not to say scandalous, condition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah, and have asked for definite legislation to correct it. That polygamy should exist in a free, enlightened, and Christian country, without the power to punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality, seems preposterous. True, there is no law to sustain this unnatural vice; but what is needed is a law to punish it as a crime, and at the same time to fix the status of the innocent children, the offspring of this system, and of the possibly innocent plural wives. But as an institution polygamy should be banished from the land.

Grant was following two decades of Republican rhetoric; the 1856 party platform had declared that “it is the duty of Congress to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.” Federal law banned bigamy in 1862, and in 1874, Grant signed the Poland Act, removing such prosecutions to federal court to prevent nullification by local Mormon-dominated courts. (Brigham Young himself was indicted in 1872.) In the end, after harsher federal action in the 1880s, the Church of Latter-day Saints renounced plural marriage, paving the way for Utah statehood and eventual Mormon acceptance into the American mainstream.

On immigration, Grant moved from the liberalizing Naturalization Act of 1870, which allowed black immigrants to be naturalized on the same terms as whites, to the Page Act of 1875, the nation’s first restrictive immigration law. The Page Act banned immigration by Chinese women, which Grant saw as necessary to prevent sex trafficking and de facto sex slavery: “I invite the attention of Congress to another, though perhaps no less an evil — the importation of Chinese women, but few of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful occupations.” The ban would be followed, in 1882, by a broader ban on Chinese immigration.

Grant’s Mormon policy, Native American policy, and support for the Page Act were all part of a broader, Victorian-era view of public morality and humanitarianism that incorporated his opposition to slavery and the Klan. Grant supported and signed the 1873 “Comstock laws” that forbade use of the mails to promote abortion, contraception, or pornography, and appointed their proponent, Anthony Comstock, a special agent of the Postal Inspection Service with broad powers of enforcement.

Many of Grant’s collisions with religious practices came on issues that remain fraught to this day. In 2019’s political climate, Grant would be considered a conservative on traditional marriage, abortion, and international sex trafficking, and a liberal on education funding. His view of the path forward for Native Americans was, if jarring to modern eyes, more humane than those of Sherman and Sheridan, and prescient about the fate of the tribes of the Great Plains. Yet recent positive biographies have mostly ignored Grant’s record on a number of these issues. Ron Chernow, for example, spends a lot of time examining Grant’s relationship with American Jews, but ignores his record on Mormon polygamy and Chinese immigration, and essentially endorses his pro–Blaine Amendment stance.

Grant in full: On the strength of his military record, Ulysses S. Grant was one of our greatest Americans, and his presidency should be seen as an addition to that legacy, not an embarrassment. Grant’s flaws deserve to be remembered. He probably could not have done much more to build public support for continuing Reconstruction after 1876, but he could have done more to prevent corruption, respect religious liberties, win the debate over Dominican annexation, and avoid the catastrophe at Little Bighorn. The corruption scandals of Grant’s tenure were far less important in the long run than his policy record, which they should not be allowed to overshadow, but they did interfere with his ability to do the job by handicapping his Supreme Court nominations, his Reconstruction and Native American policies, and even his efforts to annex Santo Domingo.

In the end, though, Grant buried secession and slavery for good, kept the peace abroad, laid the building blocks for a long-term Anglo–American alliance, oversaw the nation’s turn down the path to economic-superpower status, and can claim both the Fifteenth Amendment and the modern Justice Department as important milestones in his legacy. That’s a record any president would be proud of.

Britain’s government took the first big steps in 2006-2007, a joint US-UK “Common Missile Compatment” (CMC) project was launched in 2008, and initial gate approval for Britain’s “Successor” project followed in 2011. Other contracts have followed, covering design, infrastructure, and even the new kind of nuclear reactor the submarines are expected to use. What hasn’t quite followed yet, is full approval to launch the build program.

Note that the CMC sub-program, which is financed by the USA and UK, is covered in its own article.

February 27/19: Maintenance Britain awarded Rolls-Royce a $307 million contract to maintain nuclear submarines. Until 2022, Rolls Royce will provide support and advice for systems on board the fleet of Trafalgar, Vanguard and Astute class submarines. The new deal, known as the Nuclear Propulsion Lifetime Management (NPLM) contract, forms part of a wider suite of contracts with Rolls-Royce to provide naval reactor plant design, support, advice and components to the submarine build program and provide enabling services such as infrastructure and IT. The British Defense Ministry also revealed the name of the third Dreadnought submarine, which will be called the HMS Warspite. The name Warspite goes back to 1595 and was the last “great ship” to be built during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The newest submarine is expected to see service in the early 2030s, and will be the eighth Royal Navy ship to carry the name Warspite.

October 4/16: BAE Systems will commence work on the UK’s newest nuclear submarines following the release of nearly $1.7 billion in funds. The announcement was made by the Minister of Defence on Saturday after approval was given by MPs earlier this year. Known colloquially as the Trident system, the first of the Vanguard-class submarines will enter service in the early 2030s.

March 10/16: Britain’s Ministry of Defense has confirmed that it is to invest £642 million (US $908 million) in preparation for the production of its new fleet of Trident missile-armed nuclear submarines. The funding had initially been set out in the government’s 2015 strategic defense and security review (SDSR), and will be spent on upgrading production facilities at BAE Systems’ Barrow-in-Furness nuclear submarine yard, essential long lead items for the submarines, and the nuclear propulsion program being led by Rolls-Royce. In total, the Successor submarine program is estimated to cost around $44 billion, with a contingency fund of $13 billion set aside for any emergencies that arise.

December 15/15: The UK government may nationalize the nuclear submarine arm of Rolls-Royce as concerns grow that the company may be subject to a takeover bid by a foreign company. The news comes as Rolls-Royce has reported its fifth profit warning in 20 months as the company struggles to come to grips with its finances. While it’s not usually the Conservative Party’s style to nationalize, the company is integral to the development of the powering of the Trident nuclear deterrent system. Other alternatives may see a partial or full merger with BAE Systems, although this has already been mooted. Either way, David Cameron will be impatient to keep the firm within British control to protect UK interests and the security of the Trident program.

FY 2014

Aug 21/14: Industrial. BAE is starting to demolish certain disused buildings at their Barrow-in-Furness site, as the 1st major stage in a large-scale 8-year industrial program. An old foundry and boiler shop are the first to go, and construction will eventually include:

Refurbishment of the site’s main fabrication facility, together with its existing plant and machinery;



An extension to the Devonshire Dock Hall construction facility to include a new state-of-the-art manufacturing and installation facility;



An intent to build a 28,000 m2 off-site facility to store submarine parts and materials within the local area, for easier and faster access.

Sources: BAE Systems, “Demolition Begins To Transform Submarine Building”.

Feb 2/14: Politics. The buzz in Westminister is that Labour Party MPs are beginning to back away from their leader Ed Miliband’s support for the Successor Class. The erosion is serious enough that Conservative Party Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has told his junior ministers to lobby the shipbuilding unions and have them firm up Labour Party support.

The Liberal Democrats are openly against the project, but the Labour Party doesn’t want to head into the next election on a pledge to abandon Britain’s deterrent. Neither does the Conservative Party, despite reservations in some of its own quarters. Labour’s Miliband voiced his public displeasure over the perceived interference in his party’s affairs, but he has no way to block discussions with the shipbuilding unions. Sources: The Guardian, “Lobby ship unions over Trident, Philip Hammond tells ministers”.

Jan 31/14: RUSI Report. RUSI releases a report that looks at how a smaller or less active SSBN force would affect Britain’s deterrent, compared to the current arrangement of Continuous At-Sea Deterrence (CASD) that ensures at least 1 submarine ready at all times. A number of proposals are in play politically: “At lower readiness, the ‘preserved deterrence’ posture presented in the TAR and the ‘contingency’ posture proposed elsewhere by the Liberal Democrat Party would have no nuclear platforms deployed on a day-to-day basis, and would only have the ability to reconstitute a force over a limited period of time (in the case of ‘preserved deterrence’, a matter of years).19 At medium levels of readiness, the ‘sustained’ or ‘responsive’ postures presented in the TAR would have nuclear-armed submarines patrolling on a day-to-day basis, interrupted by voluntary periods of inactivity of varying length (the former permitting fewer and shorter interruptions than the latter). At higher levels of readiness, the ‘focused’ posture would maintain back-to-back patrols, interrupted only for periods of technical or personnel recuperation.” RUSI’s conclusion is that the lowest-readiness option, and proposals that would cut the submarine force to just 2 boats, are problematic because of the breadth of gaps and/or lag time they create. Medium levels of readiness, or a fleet of 3 boats, might work, but it means the UK has to change from deterrence as an undefined concept and invisible non-factor in crisis escalation. Instead, the need to activate the deterrent would require a very clear doctrine of deterrence and escalation that would play a significant role in future crises. This state of affairs also adds opportunities for British politicians to bungle things beforehand by ignoring vital signals, or create big problems during a crisis by managing their suddenly-public moves badly. Based on the historical record, RUSI is more complacent about future governments’ handling of such things than they ought to be. Britain will also have to worry about rushed moves causing a submarine-related accident, and about the morale and readiness rot that afflicts personnel who see themselves as a sideline. RUSI uses the USA’s ICBM missile force as a negative example. Sources: RUSI, “A Disturbance in the Force: Debating Continuous At-Sea Deterrence” (see Additional Readings). Key report

Dec 16/13: Procurement begins. GBP 79 million is a drop in the ocean for this program, but the UK MoD has begun the process of ordering known early-build items items like structural fittings, electrical equipment, castings and forgings, etc. The GBP 79 million in contracts are actually a set of 2, both awarded to BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines.

The Ministry of Defence also releases the 1st conceptual graphics of the Successor Class design, based on work done to date. At this stage, they don’t show much and shouldn’t be expected to.

Dec 15/13: Doubts. Former defense minister James Arbuthnot [Cons. – North East Hampshire], who chairs Parliament’s Defence Select Committee, tells the Guardian that he’s concerned about the UK armed forces, and is less sure that maintaining Britain’s nuclear deterrent is a good idea. He isn’t suddenly becoming a pacifist. Rather:

“Nuclear deterrence is essentially aimed at states, because it doesn’t work against terrorists. And you can only aim a nuclear weapon at a rational regime, and at rational states that are not already deterred by the US nuclear deterrent. So there is actually only a small set of targets. “With the defence budget shrinking, you have to wonder whether [replacing Trident] is an appropriate use of very scarce defence sources. You have to wonder whether nuclear deterrence is still as effective a concept as it used to be in the cold war…. [If Russia wanted to attack, they] would organise for a terrorist group to put a nuclear weapon on a container ship and sail it into Tilbury docks, with the signature of Pakistan on the nuclear device. And what would the UK do? Launch a missile at Islamabad? We could not be sure against what we are retaliating. Nuclear deterrence does not provide the certainty that it seemed to in the past. It’s not an insurance policy, it is a potential booby trap.”

On the other hand, can Britain assume that the US nuclear deterrent will remain reliable over the next 50 years? The last half decade has greatly frayed their relationship, and the USA faces significant financial challenges of its own. Arbuthnot says he would still vote in favor of renewing Trident, but the extent and content of his reservations suggest that a “Syria moment” over nuclear weapons remains a possibility in Parliament. Sources: The Guardian, “Tory ex-defence minister voices doubts over need for Trident replacement”.

Oct 6/13: Not good. The Independent newspaper reports that a 90-minute breakdown of all reactor coolant supply at Devonport dockyard’s Tidal X-Berths in Plymouth, UK nearly led to a major nuclear incident. Based on a heavily redacted report from the Ministry of Defence’s Site Event Report Committee (SERC), both the electrical power for coolant supply to docked nuclear submarines, and the diesel back-up generators, failed at the dockyard on July 29/12. That failure followed a similar failure involving HMS Talent in 2009, and a partial failure involving HMS Trafalgar in 2011. The newspaper adds that an internal Babcock investigation blamed the incident on the central nuclear switchboard, but added a note of concern about “inability to learn from previous incidents and to implement the recommendations from previous event reports.” This will not help existing uneasiness over the next generation of nuclear submarines, and “Nuclear scare at Navy submarine base after ‘unbelievable’ failures” adds that: “Its own “stress test” on Devonport safety, launched after the Fukushima disaster, said that in the event of the failure of both power supplies, heat levels in reactors could be controlled by emergency portable water pumps, and added that such a failure had occurred a “number of times” previously.” Dockyard failure

Oct 3/13: SSE. Babcock announces an unspecified contract from BAE Systems for the System Design phase of a new model of Submerged Signal Ejector (SSE Mk.12). It follows Babcock’s October 2012 system definition contract for the Successor Class’ WHLS (tactical weapons handling and launch) and SSE, thanks to a recent and successful concept review.

An SSE’s self-contained launch tubes sit in the submarine’s external under-casing, and are used for more than just communications beacons. Decoy devices, bathythermograph sensors, flares, and escape signals are all options for the SSE, hence Babcock’s description of it as a “first level system.” Babcock has extensive experience in SSE design and has been heavily involved in designing and making all UK SSE systems.

With an SNP-sponsored debate on Trident set to take place in the Scottish Parliament this week, a Labour Party that depends on its advantage in Scotland needs to be clear on its policy. British media are reporting that the Labour Party is looking to backtrack slightly, and propose replacing the 4 Vanguard Class submarines with just 3 successors. Labour Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy continues to support the idea of a Trident replacement, saying that:

“North Korea is trying to develop nuclear weapons, as is Iran. If they do, then Saudi Arabia and Turkey may do the same. The UK shouldn’t just give up our nuclear deterrent by ourselves…. The precise shape of the future deterrent will be based on capability and cost.”

March 7/13: Scotland. With a 2014 referendum looming that could deprive the UK of its nuclear submarine base in Scotland, Britain’s House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee weighs in. Bottom line? The SNP seems to have taken a leaf from their counterparts in Quebec, Canada, and decided to be extremely vague regarding their plans in a potentially controversial area. After all, 6,700 work at Falsane and Coulport now, which is expected to rise to 8,100 after they house all of Britain’s Astute and Trafalgar Class boats and other facilities. Parliament will be pressing the issue hard and publicly:

“Unfortunately, the Scottish Government has gone on evasive manoeuvres over the issue of what they will really do in the event of Separation. Their response dodges the central question, which is what they really mean by their stated policy of the ‘speediest safe transition’ of Trident from Scotland. As we said in our report, in reality, Trident can be deactivated within a matter of days and the warheads removed from Scotland within twenty four months. In the process, the UK would lose the ability to operate its nuclear deterrent. Alternatively, it would take approximately 25 years for new facilities to be created elsewhere in the UK. We believe the Scottish Government must be honest and open about their intentions. Tomorrow we will be taking evidence from the Convener and Shop Stewards at the Coulport and Faslane. They represent the workers who will bear the brunt of job loss…”

Really? 25 years? If so, the whole issue of the Successor Class could become moot very quickly. Which would be fine with the SNP, who want to eliminate the Trident program if Scotland does vote to stay in the UK. Expect to hear more of this sort of to-and-fro, what with another 5,000 jobs on the line in shipbuilding, 15,000 in the UK government 4 Army infantry battalions, 2 Royal Marine Commando units and 5 squadrons of Tornado and Typhoon fighter aircraft in Scotland.

Feb 13/13: Reactors. The UK MoD signs a 10-year, GBP 800 million (then about $1.2 billion) contract with Rolls Royce, financing the Submarines Enterprise Performance Programme (SEPP) envisioned in the 2010 SDSR. The goal is to consolidate costs under one contract with consistent incentives, and improve operational efficiency in the infrastructure that delivers and supports the UK’s naval nuclear propulsion systems. They’re hoping for a GBP 200 million saving over this 10 years. Time will tell.

SEPP isn’t technically part of any one program. Contracts for products and services to deliver and support the submarine programs themselves will continue in parallel. Royal Navy | Rolls Royce.

Jan 25/13: Electrical. HMS Vengeance’s GBP 350 million Long Overhaul Period and Refuel (LOP(R)) will feature a switch that’s likely to be a precursor for Britain’s next-generation SSBNs. Vengeance is replacing the maintenance-heavy rotating machinery of motor generators (MGs) with fixed solid-state Main Static Converters (MSCs), as a key component of the boat’s electrical system.

The new MSCs are derived from the system developed for Britain’s Astute Class SSNs, but adapted for the higher power requirements of an SSBN. They also had to be smaller, due to space limitations in the Vanguards. Finally, they had to successfully integrate into the Vanguard submarines’ existing electrical, control, and coolant systems. Installations have now begun, and a modified version is almost certain to to be part of Britain’s Successor Class. Its designers are likely to be watching the MSCs’ performance in the Vanguards closely. Babcock, via ASD.

Dec 18/12: The British Ministry of Defense submits its 2012 report to Parliament [PDF] on the future nuclear deterrent, noting the ramp up in public and private resources via an Integrated Programme Management Team (IPMT). A whole boat System Definition Review is scheduled to take place in 2013. With respect to the big items:

“Of the [GBP] 3Bn we plan to spend in the Assessment Phase, the expenditure to the end of Financial Year 2011/2012 has totalled [GBP] 315M. This is some [GBP] 30M lower than expected at the time of the Initial Gate approval, principally as a result of slower than expected manpower build-up in our Industrial partners… still expects to deliver the Assessment Phase within the approved cost of [GBP] 3Bn… Current forecast costs, including planned SEPP efficiency measures, indicate that we remain within the 2006 White Paper estimates of [GBP] 11-14Bn (at 2006/7 prices) for the Successor platform costs (assuming a four boat fleet). The 2006 White Paper also recognised that investment of [GBP] 4-6Bn (at 2006/7 prices) would be required for supporting infrastructure and a replacement warhead ([GBP] 2-3 Bn for each element). As set out in the 2011 report, the MOD plans to spend some [GBP] 8M between 2011 and 2013 assessing the requirement for additional infrastructure investment. The 2011 report also noted that a decision on whether to refurbish or replace the existing warhead design could be deferred until the next Parliament, as the current warhead design is now planned to continue in service until the 2030s.”

Oct 29/12: Design contracts. The UK commits GBP 350 million to design their next-generation SSBN submarine, which will incorporate CMC. The work will be divided GPB 315 million to BAE Systems, who already has over 1,000 people working on this program, and a further GBP 38 million to Babcock. This award is part of the GBP 3 billion design phase (vid. May 18/11 entry).

The current Vanguard Class submarines are scheduled for replacement from 2028, and Britain is busy moving its entire submarine force to Falsane in Scotland, which will grow to 8,000 jobs by 2017.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who leads Britain’s Liberal Democrat party, angrily denounced the way the move was presented by the government. The government presented it as another step toward renewing the submarine deterrent, but Clegg sees that as ‘jumping the gun.’ His party has set up a review that’s looking at options like shorter-range cruise missiles launched from the torpedo tubes of existing Astute Class fast attack submarines, or to air-launched nuclear missiles. UK MoD | BAE Systems | UK’s Daily Mail.

June 18/12: Reactors. Britain’s Ministry of Defense signs a GBP 1.1 billion contract with Rolls Royce for submarine nuclear reactor cores, (GBP 600 million) and industrial investment in the Raynesway plant that manufactures them (GBP 500 million). The contracts will secure 300 jobs at Rolls-Royce.

The nuclear reactor cores will be used to power the 7th and final SSN Astute Class fast attack submarine, and the 1st of the Royal Navy’s next generation of SSBN nuclear deterrent submarines, currently known as the Successor Class.

Rolls Royce is the sole Technical Authority for the UK Nuclear Steam Raising Plant, whose reactors have powered British nuclear-powered submarines for the past 50 years. The GBP 500 million infrastructure contract aims extend the operating life of the Rayneway plant in Derby, UK, by more than 40 years. Rolls-Royce will continue to maintain and operate its existing reactor core manufacturing facility, while undertaking a parallel phased rebuild and modernization of buildings on site. UK MoD | Rolls Royce | The Telegraph.

May 22/12: Design contracts. The UK MoD issues a series of design phase (vid. May 18/11 entry) contracts for its next-generation “Successor” Class SSBNs, while re-iterating that a decision on the final design and build contracts won’t be made until 2016. The design work has to be done, or it would be impossible to make an informed decision about costs.

BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines receives the main design contract, worth GBP 328 million.

Babcock receives a GBP 15 million contract to focus on designing parts of the in-service support program.

Rolls Royce receives over GBP 4 million to integrate a new reactor design into the submarine. The reactors themselves will be separate design/ build contracts.

May 15/12: 5 bn for AWE. The UK MoD announces a multi-billion pound agreement with the AWE Management Limited (AWEML) joint venture, which manages Britain’s Atomic Weapons Establishment. The AWEML joint venture includes Jacobs Engineering, Serco and Lockheed Martin, and they signed the current 25-year management contract in 2000.

Scientists at the AWE’s Berkshire sites are involved from the initial concept and design of British nuclear warheads, through manufacture and support, to their decommissioning and disposal. Under the agreement, the ministry will invest GBP 1 billion a year over the next 5 years in skills and facilities at the company’s Aldermaston and Burghfield sites in Berkshire, where more than 4,500 staff are based. Around 40% cent of this money will be invested in essential capital projects, including production and research facilities. The remainder will be spent on operating and maintaining the AWE.

(click to view full) May 19/11: Initial Gate. The British government approves the initial Successor Class assessment phase, known as Initial Gate. This allows a design phase to begin that could be worth up to GBP 3 billion. The new submarine class will retain the current Trident II D5 missiles, and introduce a PWR3-based passive cooling nuclear reactor design for the Royal Navy. The cost for 4 boats is estimated to be GBP 15-20 billion at 2006/7 prices, but the final decision to build 3 or 4 submarines will be taken in 2016. UK House of Commons, “Statement on the Nuclear Deterrent.” | UK MoD. Design Phase approved

March 23/11: New reactor? Britain is reportedly shifting toward the passive-cooling PWR3 nuclear reactor design for its future SSBN nuclear missile submarines. The PWR2 design used in its SSBN Vanguard Class, as well as the SSN Trafalgar, and new SSN Astute Class fast attack boats, reportedly shares unwelcome features with the Fukushima reactors, in that they entirely on back-up power supplies to provide emergency cooling in the event of an accident.

In contrast the PWR3, which is widely used in modern US nuclear submarines, uses “passive” cooling. That makes it less reliant on back-up power, and offers additional methods of injecting coolant into a reactor.

Oct 18/10: SDSR Britain’s new government releases its 2010 Strategic Defense and Strategy Review [PDF]. With respect to its future SSBNs, the government intends to move forward, but: “Under the 1958 UK-US Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes (the ‘Mutual Defence Agreement’) we have agreed on the future of the Trident D5 delivery system and determined that a replacement warhead is not required until at least the late 2030s. Decisions on replacing the warhead will not therefore be required in this Parliament. This will defer £500 million of spending from the next 10 years. We have also reached agreement with the US over the size of the missile tubes in the new submarines; this has enabled us to reduce the cost of the submarine missile compartment by up to [GBP] 250 million. As a result of our value for money review, we will reduce the number of operational launch tubes on the submarines from 12 to [8], and the number of warheads from 48 to 40, in line with our commitment vigorously to pursue multilateral global disarmament. This will help reduce costs by [GBP] 750 million over the period of the spending review, and by [GBP] 3.2 billion over the next ten years. ‘Initial Gate’ – a decision to move ahead with early stages of the work involved – will be approved and the next phase of the project will start by the end of this year. ‘Main Gate’ – the decision to start building the submarines – is required around 2016.” There is tension in the governing coalition between Conservative party members, who want to maintain the deterrent, and the Liberal-Democrat party members, who do not.

March 19/09: Report. Edward Leigh MP, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, makes a statement as the committee publishes “The United Kingdom’s future nuclear deterrent capability” :

“The Department’s timetable for completing the design and build process for the replacement submarines is extremely tight. It has 17 years to do it, even though the Department itself accepts that such a process usually cannot be completed in under 18. The MOD’s track record in delivering major defence projects on time is not exemplary. The MOD must make absolutely fundamental decisions about the design of the new submarines by September of this year. These include the main design features; whether to develop a new type of nuclear reactor requiring substantial research and development; and, crucially, the design and size of the missile compartment.”

Oct 26/07: Concepts. BAE presents 2 SSBN concept designs at DSEi 2007, labelled Concept 35 and Advanced Hull Form (AHF). Concept 35 is an evolution of the SSBN Vanguard Class and SSN Astute Class. The Advanced Hull Form uses a broad y-shaped stern with twin propulsor shrouds, which reportedly houses much of the boat’s machinery outside of the pressure hull. See Beedall for pictures.

Oct 18/07: IPT opened. BAE Systems announces that Rear Admiral Paul Thomas CB, FREng chairman of the defence nuclear safety committee, has officially opened the Future Submarines (FSM) Integrated Project Team office at Barrow-in-Furness.

“This element of the Future Submarines IPT will be based on the BAE Systems Submarine Solutions site and will be manned by a collaboration of up to 128 personnel made up from the Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Rolls Royce and Babcock Marine. Working with the FSM IPT office in the MoD’s Abbey Wood offices, the team will, over the next two years, develop a concept design for the submarine component of the future deterrent programme.”

March 4/07: Vote. Britain’s Labour government wins a 409 – 161 vote to build a new SSBN successor the Vanguard Class. 95 Labour Party MPs vote “no,” but the motion passes with the support of most Labour Party MPs and Britain’s Conservative Party. Britain’s Liberal Democratic Party, Green Party, and Scottish National Party are all opposed as matters of party policy. BBC | The Guardian | The Telegraph. Commons vote

Dec 4/06: Britain’s government releases “The Future of the United Kingdom’s Nuclear Deterrent” [PDF] white paper, and decides to maintain the UK’s nuclear deterrent. That will mean building a class of 3 or 4 SSBNs, to replace the current fleet of 4 Vanguards. White Paper

In fact, I was in the studio in western New York all ready to go, but, alas, due to frankly some rather basic incompetence on the Rochester end, there was an issue with the audio. There will be no such problems at the Kodak Center in Rochester tonight, when Dennis Miller and I take to the stage. It's all but sold out, but there are just a few good seats left in the front balcony. If your social diary has suddenly opened up, you can book online, or call 1-800-745-3000. Tomorrow night we'll be in the enigmatically enunciated Wilkes-Barre.

Some news from around the Commonwealth:

~Ottawa: Speaking as someone who gets sued a lot, I account Jody Wilson-Raybould as a killer exemplar of what every litigant dreads the other side coming up with - a credible witness. In a riveting performance, the former Attorney General of Canada laid out calmly and without overheated rhetorical flourish a campaign by the most powerful figures in the government to get their cronies at SNC-Lavalin off the hook of a criminal prosecution for bribing (Libyan) government officials. Ms Wilson-Raybould identified just shy of a dozen Liberal Party bruisers who leaned on her, including the most senior chaps in the Prime Minister's Office, the Privy Council Office and the Ministry of Finance - and ultimately the PM himself.

But, in a competitive field, perhaps the behavior of Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, a career civil servant and the highest-ranking in Canada, is the most outrageous. In a three-man meeting - the Clerk, the Attorney General and the PM - Mr Wernick acted not as an impartial public servant but as a gung-ho party hack demanding political interference in a criminal prosecution in order to help Justin's pals beat the rap:

The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise – the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA – he said ""there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders"" ... ""they will likely be moving to London if this happens""... ""and there is an election in Quebec soon""... At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ""and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau"". I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: ""Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it."" The Prime Minister said ""No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.""

When Ms Wilson-Raybould held firm against Justin's pressure to lean on the Crown's prosecution of a serious criminal case, he arranged a Cabinet reshuffle to remove her as Attorney General.

This is a protection racket: Underneath the LGBTQWERTY Ramadan socks and the Bollywood bridesmaid outfits for his passage through India, Justin Trudeau turns out to be Lee J Cobb in On the Waterfront. My old friend Paul Wells calls this a ""moral catastrophe"" for Justin. Not quite: He is who he is. It's a moral catastrophe for Canada if those who dote on the Dauphin make the rest of us go along with it.

~Melbourne: Cardinal George Pell, a Vatican bigshot to Popes Francis, Benedict and John Paul II, this week became the highest-ranking priest to be brought down by paedophile charges. I don't doubt there is a rottenness in much of the contemporary Catholic Church, and that evil clerics prey on children and leave them ruined. But, as in Ottawa, this case is of interest to me mainly because of what it says about the integrity of justice and its own vulnerability to politicization.

Pell was convicted in a retrial on the word of one unidentified witness, who says that in the mid-Nineties, as a thirteen-year-old-boy, he was sexually assaulted by the Cardinal after Mass in the sacristy of Melbourne Cathedral, with the door open and congregants passing by. Or at any rate that's what he said in the first trial. In the second, only a video of his testimony in the first trial was used. My old Telegraph boss Charles Moore comments:

Expert witnesses explained in court that Cardinal Pell, fully robed after the Mass, simply could not have performed the alleged acts because, as one report put it, it is 'impossible to produce an erect penis through a seamless alb'. I wouldn't know. But I do wonder how safe Pell's conviction will prove in a case so strangely conducted and so astonishingly politicised.

He is right on that last point. And so one of Pell's few defenders is described even by his own employer as ""divisive columnist Andrew Bolt"". Back when Pell was supposedly getting erections in his seamless alb, columnists were meant to be divisive - to stir things up, set people against each other with principled and iconoclastic stands. Now we are all supposed to get on board with the official narrative - or else.

~London: I shall have more to say later about the passing of André Previn, whom I knew a little over the years. He was not, of course, British but an American born in Germany. But, during his tenure at the London Symphony Orchestra, he became a household name in the United Kingdom, and surely, in our great age of cultural vandalism, the last classical conductor to be beloved by the masses.

It happened overnight, in December 1971, when Previn accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its top-rated Christmas edition of ""The Morecambe & Wise Show"", conducting the Grieg piano concerto with Eric as soloist:

The following day Previn hailed a taxi, whose cabbie refused the fare because he'd laughed so much. Random pedestrians saluted him in the street as the peerless ""Mr Preview"". And the conductor was suddenly a household name and comic genius. He certainly is brilliantly deadpan above, and he ad libbed a few of his responses, too.

Donald Trump’s New Cold War with Beijing has caught Chinese foreign students at American universities in its crosshairs. His administration has tightened restrictions on their visas, accused them of spying for the Chinese state and its high tech giants, and in the process whipped up a climate of Anti-Asian racism.

Trump’s policies have yielded bitter fruit most recently at Duke University. The chair of the graduate program in biostatics, Megan Neely, in the wake of complaints from a couple of faculty members about Chinese grad students “speaking Chinese (in their words VERY LOUDLY)” in the student lounge and study areas, wrote an email scolding them for speaking their native language.

She told students to “commit to using English 100 percent of the time” while in department buildings or “any other professional setting.” Even worse she warned them that if they didn’t it might impact their ability to get internships and jobs. She told them “PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak Chinese”.

This was not the first time that Neely had criticized students for speaking a language besides English in their private time. Last year she sent a message to all the biostatistics students saying, “I don’t like being the language police [but] … speaking in your native language in the department may give faculty the impression that you are not trying to improve your English skills and that you are not taking this opportunity seriously.”

She also warned of “potential downstream effects” that might compromise their professional advancement in the biostatics program and their employability.

These were no idle threats. The two professors whose complaints prompted her most recent email asked for and received photographs of the Chinese students from Neely with the expressed intent of discriminating against them.

Chinese students were shocked by this blatant racism. One PhD student in Chemistry, Chi Liu,said, “All of us are angry. We feel offended. You have this email to the Chinese students saying … if you speak Chinese you will be remembered and identified, and that will affect your performance. That is very serious”.

Duke’s Asian American Student Organization and International Association issued a joint statement that pointed out, “For international students, speaking in their mother tongue is a means of comfort and familiarity with a home and culture that is oftentimes suppressed within the United States. … Within the bounds of one’s personal conversations, people should wholeheartedly be able to speak any language they wish — to strip away this agency is demeaning, disrespectful, and wholly discriminatory”.

Neely’s shocking email provoked a wave of criticism at the university. A group of “concerned students” created a petition, which demanded the school investigate Neely and the two professors collected over 2,000 signatures from the campus community.

The uproar even spread to China. On the country’s equivalent of Twitter, Weibo, the hashtag “Duke University Bans Speaking Chinese” was viewed over 6.7 million times.

Caught in a spiraling scandal, Duke demoted Neely from her chair position and issued an apology. The dean of the medical school, Dr. Mary Klotman wrote, “To be clear: there is absolutely no restriction or limitation on the language you use to converse and communicate with each other. Your career opportunities and recommendations will not in any way be influenced by the language you use outside the classroom. And your privacy will always be protected”.

Duke may have resolved this crisis for now, but Trump’s New Cold War will only provoke more attacks on Chinese students. He has raised tariffs on China’s exports to the US, targeted its companies with sanctions, and has begun a military buildup to confront Beijing.

He is extending his economic nationalist program against China into the higher education system. Universities and colleges are what Hal Draper called knowledge factories that reproduce the ideas of the dominant class, generate scientific innovations for corporations, and also train different classes for their roles in ruling, managing, and working in American capitalism.

Universities and colleges are directly integrated into the American state through funding as well ties to the military industrial complex. As a result, the higher education system is tied to the interests of American capitalist class and its imperial domination of the world.

During the period of neoliberal globalization, however, the US higher education has undergone a transformation both in function and student composition. First, it became increasingly internationalized, creating connections with higher education systems of other countries.

Second, the increasing privatization of public universities has opened them to a growing number of foreign students, especially ones from China. States across the country have cut funding, universities have dramatically raised tuition, and students have gone into massive debt—now over $1.3 trillion—to afford a degree.

In the wake of the Great Recession, both public and private universities have suffered declining enrollment as American students balk at the enormous debt entailed in getting a degree. Higher education bosses have made up for that drop by luring foreign students who pay full tuition, room and board to attend their undergraduate and graduate programs.

This isn’t simply lucrative for some universities, it’s essential at a time when many, including prestigious institutions like Hampshire College, are struggling to keep their doors open.

As a result, the total foreign students in universities has doubled in the last two decades to over 1 million today. Chinese students have grown the fastest increasing by five fold since 2000 to over 360,000, about 35% of the total.

The overall value of this trade in students is estimated at $42.4 billion for the American economy, a sum greater than the $21.6 billion exports in soybeans and rivalling exports of $51 billion in pharmaceuticals and $53 billion in automobiles.

Duke is an example of the overall pattern. In their master’s program in biostatics heretofore overseen by Neely, Chinese students account for 36 out of a total of 55, and, in the whole graduate program, 1,300 out of 8,500.

Unsurprisingly, the Chinese ruling class and state have used this opening to advance their interests. The Chinese elite are now sending students to undergraduate and graduate programs.

These students overwhelmingly enter undergraduate and graduate programs in sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (the so-called STEM disciplines) as well business administration.

After graduation, some stay and staff key sectors of American big business particularly in high tech while others return to China to bolster the competitiveness of the country’s corporations.

The Chinese state has encouraged their high tech national champions like Huawei to establish contracts with American research institutions to bolster their standing as world leaders in research and development.

At the same time, the Beijing is worried that their students might be influenced by liberal and radical ideas that might encourage them to challenge the Communist Party’s autocratic rule back home.

Therefore, Beijing has established about 150 chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholar Associations on campuses throughout the US. These both organize social activities for students as well as keep tabs on them.

China has established Confucian Institutes on over 100 campuses to promote Chinese language and culture, provide services for Chinese nationals teaching in the US, and facilitate cultural exchanges. They also use the institutes to influence American the universities, registering protest against speakers the state considers anti-Chinese like the exiled religious leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama.

The Communist Party also attempts to influence American academics portrayals of China by threatening to deny them visas to visit and conduct research in the country. For example, Andrew Nathan and Perry Link, editors of The Tiananmen Papers about the Communist Party’s massacre student and workers to quell the uprising in 1989, have been denied visas ever since the publication of their book.

In response, Trump has initiated a campaign against the Chinese state and its corporations influence over universities as well as against Chinese foreign students, their rights and their organizations. Trump aims to discipline the nation’s higher education system to serve “America First.”

Trump’s lapdog Mike Pence’s announced this offensive against “the enemy within” American universities in his speech at the Hudson Institute (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-administrations-policy-toward-china/). He warned, “The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and federal officials.”

He charged China with creating a “culture of censorship” in universities. He complained that “Beijing provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars, with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. China experts in particular know that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts Beijing’s talking points.”

Then in formulations worthy of the poster “Is Your Washroom’s Breeding Bolsheviks?” he denounced “the Chinese Students and Scholars Association” for alerting “Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students, and American schools, stray from the Communist Party line.”

Of course, all of this reeks of hypocrisy. Trump and the right are enemies of academic freedom and scientific thought. They are conducting McCarthyite attacks against progressive academics as advocates of “cultural Marxism,” policing students and academics who are advocates of Palestinian liberation, waging war on the humanities, and are aiming to reduce the function of every level of education to the narrow interests of the American state and corporations in dominating the world system.

Double talk aside, Trump has already begun implementing his plan. He has issued an order instructing public universities to terminate all contracts with Huawei or federal funding would be cut.

And the schools have all obeyed. For example, the University of California at Berkeley has banned any further research projects with Huawei, which has donated $7.8 million to the school over the last two years.

Trump has extended the attack on corporation to Chinese students. The US intelligence agencies are warning universities that they are spying for Beijing and stealing intellectual property for its state corporations and national champions.

To put a stop to this supposed threat, he has denied and delayed issuing visas to Chinese students and threatened to reduce visas for those studying robotics, aviation, and high tech.

Trump’s racist advisor, Stephen Miller, almost convinced the administration to impose a total ban on Chinese nationals studying in the US.

Far from standing up against Trump’s China bashing and protectionism, the Democratic Party including its progressive and even socialist wing has joined his chorus. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has denounced against the neoliberal establishment for promising that open markets would bring about democracy in China.

She states, “Policymakers promised that open markets would lead to open societies. Instead, efforts to bring capitalism to the global stage unwittingly helped create the conditions for competitors to rise up and lash out. Russia became belligerent and resurgent.China weaponized its economy without ever loosening its domestic political constraints.”

Similarly, Bernie Sanders, who has become a spokesperson for progressive internationalism, has in fact long advocated an economic nationalist program against China.

In 2011, for example, he denounced the Smithsonian Museum for selling busts of American presidents made in China. He complained “that a museum owned by the people of the United States, celebrating the history of the United States, cannot find companies in this country employing American workers that are able to manufacture statues of our founding fathers, or our current president”.

More recently he supported Trump’s tariff war with China, writing “I strongly support imposing stiff penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to prevent them from illegally dumping steel and aluminum into the U.S. and throughout the world”.

Such nationalism can only breed anti-Chinese and more generally anti-Asian racism. Barbara Ehrenreich plumbed the depths of such bigotry recently when she tweeted “I will be convinced that America is not in decline only when our de-cluttering Marie Kondo learns to speak English”.

This xenophobia is only the latest expression of the toxic history of anti-Asian prejudices and laws that began with the Chinese exclusion act and continued through the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the racist demonization of the Vietnamese during the US war on their country, and the recent bigoted caricatures of Koreans during Trump’s stand-off with Kim Jung-un.

Unsurprisingly, the American political class’s China bashing has triggered a sharp increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination. NPR reports that “hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are rising exponentially. A report from the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations found that crimes targeting Asian-Americans tripled in that county between 2014 and 2015”.

And since the Trump administration’s rise to power, they increased ever more. There was a 20 percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-Pacific Americans in 2017.

Trumps Islamophobia, immigrant bashing, and hostility to foreign students and specifically Chinese students drove down international enrollment by 3.3 percent in 2016 and by 6.6 percent in 2017 .

Indian graduate school applications dropped by 12% in 2017.. While Chinese student enrollment is still increasing it has begun to slow from an increase of 8.1 percent in 2014-15 to 6.8 percent in 2015-16 and 3.1 in 2017-2018.

Those that remain have soured on the US. One study by Purdue University found that the percentage of foreign students holding negative views of the US jumped from 29 percent in 2016 to 42 percent in 2018.

One anonymous student told the South China Post, “More students, including myself, have even considered returning to China as a plan B if we can’t find a job in the US, and some of them are searching for jobs in China simultaneously”.

But, as the Post notes, “the job market for new graduates on the other side of the globe is not much better, as Trump’s trade war begins to cause sweeping lay-offs and hiring freezes in China’s tech industry.” These students are thus caught between two powers struggling for dominance in a crisis ridden system.

With Trump tearing at the internationalized structure of American higher education and trying to push out Chinese students, some universities and high tech businesses have begun to worry about a possible drop in the pool of Chinese students they can recruit from.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign went so far as take out a $60 million insurance policy to protect against any sudden drop in Chinese enrollment.

The conflict between the US and China is also spilling into other countries with educational systems with large Chinese student populations. For example, when Trump forced Canada to detain Huawei’s the chief financial officer, Meng Whanzhou, on charges that the company violated sanctions on Iran, China responded by threatening to withdraw all its 77,000 students, if Ottawa sent Meng to the US to stand trial.

Chinese students account for a large share of the 40 percent increase in foreign students since 2013. These pay an average of $27, 159 a year in tuition—4 times what Canadian residents pay—and spend over $15 billion a year in Canada. Thus, they are an important part not just of the country’s big business in higher education but also the broader economy.

Moody’s Investors Services went so far as to warn “that the intensification of political tensions between the Government of Canada and the government of China poses credit risks for Canadian universities”.

Back in the US, university presidents became so concerned that 65 of them penned a letter supporting a legal challenge to Trump’s threat to ban international students for overstaying their visas.

Some high tech bosses have similarly protested about the loss of access to foreign students in American universities. They point to the fact that about a quarter of new companies worth a billion dollars were started by moguls who first came to the US as students.

Thomas Harnisch from the American Association of State Colleges and Universities notes that “international graduate students are pivotal to our economic system, these students go on, many of them earn master’s degrees and PhDs in many highly-needed fields. They’re incredibly important not only to our universities, but our economy as well” .

But the logic of the spiraling inter-imperial rivalry between the US and China will likely continue to pry apart the inter-penetration of their educational systems. The US is already trying to retool its own education system to yield more American talent in the STEM fields and China may redirect its students to its own rapidly improving higher education institutions and those of countries less hostile to it.

Amidst this intensifying conflict, socialists must take a clear stand against the political class’s China bashing no matter whether it comes from right wing Republicans like Trump or progressives like Warren and Sanders; it is rank American nationalism that binds workers to their exploiters against their fellow workers in China.

Instead we must unite just like the Duke students did against the racist attacks on Chinese students, defend their right to speak their language of choice, agitate against any restrictions on their visas, and build a movement among both native and foreign students and workers for our common interests against the university bosses, their capitalist masters, and their state overseers.

Such organizing will also open up opportunities to build the international workers movement. Some of these students are part of the developing new left on universities in China that has suffered government repression for organizing solidarity with workers on strike. They should be considered part of our emerging new socialist movement.

We should build this common struggle without in any way supporting the Chinese state, which is a rising imperialist power in the world system that oversees the exploitation of its own population, the oppression of subject nations like Tibet and national minorities like the Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, and increasingly exploits third world countries in pursuit of raw materials and outlets for its surplus capital.

The slogan for our solidarity movement must therefore be “Neither Washington, Nor Beijing, But International Socialism.”

But a local politics professor says it's just the latest in a ""clash of ideologies"" between the provincial and federal governments.

Adam Vaughan, MP for Spadina-Fort York and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, made the comments Sunday after calling into CBC Radio's Cross-Country Checkup.

When asked by host Duncan McCue what he would say to Canadians who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, Vaughan said provinces need to work with the federal government.

He then singled out Manitoba for not yet agreeing to take the cash.

""We have a Manitoba government that is refusing to take federal dollars to house people, think about that,"" he said during the unplanned call to the national call-in radio program.

""You've got a provincial government that no matter how much money you put on the table, they want to teach us how to balance the budget instead of house people.""

Adam Vaughan, MP for Spadina-Fort York, made the comments during a call into CBC Radio’s Cross-Country Checkup. (CBC)

The federal government announced plans for the housing strategy in November 2017.

Len Catling with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said B.C., the Northwest Territories, Ontario, P.E.I. and New Brunswick have all signed agreements with the federal government. A CMHC spokesperson said another will be announced in the near future while others are expected to sign by April 1.

Catling wouldn't weigh in on whether Manitoba is refusing federal funds, though he noted the province continues to receive funding from Ottawa for other programs under the national housing strategy.

The 10-year strategy promises everything from tackling homelessness and the shortage of new housing units to enshrining the right to adequate housing as a fundamental human right in Canadian law.

The government is also preparing a separate Indigenous housing strategy tailored to the needs of the many Indigenous communities with inadequate housing where market-based solutions are often unfeasible.

Negotiations ongoing, says province

During his call Vaughan told McCue about $5.7 billion has been spent through the strategy so far, building around 15,000 new units, repairing roughly 150,000 units and delivering subsidies to more than 800,000 homes.

But none of that work is happening in Manitoba, where a spokesperson for Manitoba's Minister of Families confirmed late Sunday the provincial government is still negotiating a bilateral agreement with the federal government.

The spokesperson added that ""most provinces [and] territories continue to negotiate their bilateral agreements"" and said that process is ongoing between Manitoba and the federal government.

""Manitoba's expected allocation is an estimated $300 million over nine years, and further details are being finalized through our bilateral engagement,"" a spokesperson wrote in an email.

'Clash of ideologies'

Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba, said this is the latest salvo between two governments known for butting heads on health funding and other philosophical differences.

The Pallister government has implemented an austerity program and committed to balancing budgets and reducing the size of government, whereas the federal government is ""spending their way to prosperity,"" said Thomas.

""There's a clash of ideologies here, and then when you go against Premier Pallister you better know that you're in for a fight. He's a quite combative, competitive person,"" said Thomas.

""He won't take kindly to a Toronto-based MP from the Liberal Party telling him how he should spend Manitoba's money.""

About $15 billion of the $40 billion plan is dependant on provincial cost sharing, according to a report from the Social Planning Council Right to Housing Coalition released in March, which urged Manitoba to contribute its share.

The report suggested Manitoba would need to reverse cuts to its housing capital program.

'Crucial ingredient'

Thomas said there are a variety of demands on the public purse, particularly with respect to social services, health and education, but housing is a ""crucial ingredient"" to helping people lead more productive lives.

""You don't want to turn money down if it's on offer, especially if you don't accept the money for whatever reason: if you're hung up ideologically or constitutionally because you don't want Ottawa interfering in your provincial affairs,"" he said

""At some point I think you swallow your pride and you take the money and you say, ""Well, we're not happy about it,' and that's what they eventually did on the mental health.""

Jino Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies, said he understands relations are ""frayed"" between the Trudeau and Pallister governments but that doesn't change the pressing need for housing.

""Manitobans are falling behind in affordable housing and we still have a crisis with respect to housing individuals who are homeless,"" he said.

""It is a bit frustrating because you would hope that we would have a bit more collaboration between the two levels of government to get these types of projects funded and supported.""

The list of promises includes:

Construction of 100,000 new affordable housing units.

Repairs on 300,000 affordable housing units.

Cutting chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.

Protecting 385,000 households from losing an affordable home.

Removing 530,000 households from housing need.

The strategy would also introduce a housing benefit for families that won't kick in until after the next federal election. The Canada Housing Benefit will help 300,000 families by providing an average rent subsidy of $2,500 annually, beginning in April 2020 and ending in 2028, the government has said.

'Have to take advantage'

Distasio said while the two governments hash out their differences, there are a number of community non-profit housing organizations caught in the middle, waiting on needed funds.

""Any time we have an opportunity to leverage significant federal interventions in housing — and over the last two decades they've been far and few between — we've got to take advantage,"" he said.

""We need a provincial housing strategy that takes advantage of what's available and also does so in a manner that makes sure that every Manitoban has access to quality affordable housing.""

Vaughan says the ongoing negotiations are leaving a pot of money for supportive housing initiatives untouched in the Keystone province.

""Yes the federal government has to be a leader in housing … but we need provincial governments and territorial governments to participate,"" he said during the call, describing housing the most important issue facing the country.

174,Empty,2019-02-26T09:00:27Z,Many in Germany want to have their cake and eat it by scrapping nuclear power and avoiding coal at the same time. Pieter Cleppe looks at some of the questions raised by Germany’s decision.,"Many in Germany want to have their cake and eat it by scrapping nuclear power and avoiding coal at the same time. Pieter Cleppe looks at some of the questions raised by Germany’s decision.

Pieter Cleppe is head of Brussels office at Open Europe, a euro-critical think-tank focused on Britain’s new relationship with the EU and the rest of the world after Brexit.

After a long debate, Germany’s so-called “Coal Commission”, which includes representatives from political, industry, and environmental groups, has recommended the country end its use of coal power by 2038. This still needs to be approved by four German states that will be affected, as well as by the federal government, though Chancellor Angela Merkel has already voiced support.

With questions still surrounding the whole endeavor, here’s an overview of the five most pressing debates.

What will it cost?

The Coal Commission suggests spending at least €40 billion to aid coal-mining states affected by the phase-out, and at least €2 billion per year to limit increases in consumer power bills – already the highest in Europe. 5,000 government jobs would be relocated to the affected regions, carrying costs in itself.

The Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) estimates the real cost at closer to €170 billion, taking into account the effect on energy prices, possible damages, and the cost of extra investment into alternative energy sources such as natural gas plants. It warns price increases must be avoided, as German companies already face the highest power bills in the European Union.

These come in addition to the costs of Germany’s overall energy transition plan, which aims to almost completely shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy at an estimated price of €1.1 trillion by 2050.

Much of the potential economic damage will depend on the second major issue: energy security.

Will the phase-out plan endanger energy security?

If it weren’t for Angela Merkel’s decision to phase out nuclear energy following Fukushima, the challenge would be much less tricky.

Coal and brown coal now provide more than 42% of Germany’s power, according to the International Energy Agency. That proportion has been growing since the nuclear decision. As a result, Germany has admitted it is on track to miss its 2020 CO2 emissions targets.

Many in Germany want to have their cake and eat it, scrapping nuclear power and avoiding coal at the same time. The Coal Commission wants coal capacity reduced from 42 gigawatts of generation capacity to 30 gigawatts by the end of 2022, and 17 gigawatts by the end of 2030. German industry fears energy blackouts in a country more dependent on coal than the UK or Canada, who have decided to phase it out.

Almost no other country has tried to simultaneously phase out both nuclear and coal simultaneously. Sweden, for example, reversed its decision to phase out nuclear power in 2009.

One study has claimed renewable energy sources overtook coal as Germany’s main power source for the first time in 2018, but that’s not the whole story. As Rolf Schmitz, head of leading energy firm RWE, maintains: “there are days when renewables are covering 70% or more of energy needs, but there are also days when that share is only 5%, when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine”.

Another challenge, acknowledged by the Coal Commission itself, is that major investments in Germany’s energy transport and storage infrastructure are needed to cope with an exit from coal, to transport wind energy created offshore in the North Sea to the south of the country, and to improve storage capacity.

Precisely because of such doubts, Ralph Brinkhaus, the faction leader of Merkel’s CDU in the German Parliament, has warned the coal exit could be delayed beyond 2038 if the deadline creates problems for the electricity supply: “energy supply security must be guaranteed… if it is endangered, we should be free to do another round and address that, without abandoning the path we’ve chosen. There’s no reason to be dogmatic about this.”

Isn’t it all a bit hypocritical?

As journalist Brigitte Fehrle argued in a comment for German public radio: “it would be fatal for the credibility of the whole initiative when instead of receiving energy from German brown coal-powered plants, brown coal from Poland or the Czech Republic would need to be imported”. Merkel herself has already commented that “we want to be out of coal in 2038. Then we need more gas”.

However, gas is no panacea for avoiding carbon emissions. Christian Lindner of German liberal opposition party FDP, who has dismissed the Commission’s recommendations as “pure ideology”, predicted that “in 2030, this game will be repeated with the energy source gas”.

The Dutch government was criticised in a similar way for shutting down gas exploration, with opponents pointing out it may open the door to more gas imports from Russia. Abandoning coal may leave Germany more dependent on Russian gas, with Merkel already under fire for allowing “Nord Stream 2”.

How environmentally friendly are alternative energy sources?

Hazardous materials are necessary to produce solar panels, and wind turbines have their own environmental downsides. But surely those drawbacks are worth it, given how renewables will replace every other energy source?

That’s questionable. On a global level, the role of wind and solar energy is still modest at best. According to the International Energy Agency’s 2016 Key Renewables Trends, wind provided 0.46% of global energy consumption in 2014, and solar and tide combined provided 0.35%. This is total energy, not just electricity, which accounts for less than a fifth of all final energy.

Even if 14% of the world’s energy is considered “renewable”, three quarters of that is biomass. Professor John Beddington, a former UK government chief scientific adviser, argues wood-burning in order to help countries reach renewable energy targets shouldn’t be the way forward; otherwise, Europe may soon need to burn an amount of wood greater than its total harvest – not exactly in line with green gospel.

Isn’t coal energy technology improving?

While progress in renewables makes headlines, fossil fuels have also been improving, with the development of “clean coal” technologies.

The current debate’s hysterical approach ignores the fact that 60% of primary energy will still come from fossil fuels by 2040, down from just 81% today.

If one cares about reducing CO2 emissions, completely phasing out coal is not only expensive but also ignores the role of technological progress in improving an indispensable energy source.",Five questions surrounding Germany’s coal phase-out plan,Euractiv.com,http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/five-questions-surrounding-germanys-coal-phase-out-plan/

Solidarity is the foundation of building political power. When an elected official steps in and lends their voice to an issue that we care about, our voices are amplified. Elected officials are theoretically there to speak up on our behalf, fight for what we believe in, and to take positions that are risky.

The problem is that we ascribe the same amount of value to every statement that an elected official makes, no matter how calculated and self-serving it is. More often than not, elected officials are bound by message discipline that keeps them from the kind of nuanced judgments required by social issues.

When they speak up on issues that matter to us or they speak out against an issue that plagues us, they’re rarely taking an uncalculated risk. It takes very little work of reading between the lines when that message discipline helps them build power. If they’re repeating a position instead of responding to the actual content of an issue, they’re hoping to sell us a vehicle without us ever taking a peek under the hood.

When any public figure, especially elected officials, is anti-Semitic, homophobic, or accused of human rights abuses, we want others to speak up. However, as 84% of Americans think money has too much influence in politics, nearly the same number are afflicted with magical thinking when they assume elected officials are speaking from the heart.

How Many Benjamins To Screw In a Light Bulb?

Within moments of Ilhan Omar posting some fairly banal tweets about the role of money in politics via lobbying groups like AIPAC, she’s faced an aggressive backlash. Omar’s background and ethnicity have been linked to her comments ad nauseam. Islamophobes have cravenly relished these comments, coming from a Muslim woman, and presumptively taken their meaning to be anti-Semitic.

The fact that there’s a loose argument to be made for this lends it validity and attracts our attention away from the content of her statement. She’s questioning the role of money leading the way of policy and opinion. In questioning AIPAC, she revealed that the group is so good at lobbying that it’s a sin to claim that they’re lobbyists.

Many officials who’ve benefited from their association with AIPAC, which requires members to donate to elected officials, have tried to shame Omar. These electeds are nowhere to be found when real anti-Semitism arises in their own backyards.

Let’s take Carolyn Maloney’s response as an example, from a congresswoman who has taken several opportunities to call for Democratic party unity. Congresswoman Maloney stated that Omar’s “personal and anti-Semitic attacks” were unwelcome and disturbing. Let’s remind ourselves of Omar’s actual comments.

In response to Omar criticizing Israel’s national policies, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy likened her political criticism to Steve King’s claim that white supremacy has been stigmatized. There were no clear statements that McCarthy claimed Omar said to be offensive, certainly none claiming that anti-Semitism deserved the right to oxygen. The only real policy that could be pointed to was Omar’s support for BDS, a political position of boycotting products and services linked to the nation, was somehow offensive.

When we boycott products from Chik-Fil-A, we aren’t demonizing the people who work for Chik-Fil-A. We’re disputing the political positions of the people at the top. It’s believable that American consumers are sophisticated enough to critique a country without turning their thoughts to hate speech. Hate for injustice isn’t an injustice, though it’s a common swerve for those accused of injustice.

Elected officials critical of Omar are the ones who chose to plunge our politics into a state of cognitive dissonance where there’s no difference between criticizing the national policies of Israel and criticizing all Jews. In fact, the response has led to wild flights of fancy which have unleashed some toxic Islamophobia. No state with a lobbying influence over our elected officials should go unchecked, whether we’re talking about Russia, Canada, or Israel.

If elected officials like Carolyn Maloney are so concerned with anti-Semitism, why don’t they ever show up when it matters? Recently, a Manhattan GOP club had their membership packed by the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos and Gavin McInnes, only to elect as president a consultant for Alternativ Für Deutschland, the rising neo-Nazi party in Germany. A few people protested, but right under Maloney’s nose, neo-fascists gained real political power, with the ability to put people on the ballot in New York State and to run against her for Congress.

This rallying against anti-Semitism is nothing more than posturing to benefit a powerful lobby which brags about its hold over elected officials. They only take it seriously when it’s a rhetorical gesture and an escape hatch to avoid tough conversations.

The ferocity of the attacks in response to Ilhan Omar amounts to empty power-brokering because not one elected official has joined her criticism of AIPAC’s power. How juvenile are we to be sold and to buy an argument that criticizing the role of a country’s politics in the world can only mean that we hate its citizens? Islamophobes love this argument but most of us don’t live and die by that perspective.

The Enemy of my Enemy

In New York, an elected official very directly criticized an entire identity group, talking of their power over politics. Bronx Councilmember Ruben Diaz Sr. wasn’t talking about a group like AIPAC or a specific lobby when he said that homosexuals control New York City Council. If people embroiled in the Ilhan Omar statements were seeking an example of what it actually looks like when someone blames an identity group for conspiring to control politics, they have one.

Following the statements the Taxi Commission chair made on the taxi driver-focused show “El Desahogo” in NYC, Ruben Diaz Sr. has since doubled down. Corey Johnson, openly-gay city council speaker and mayoral hopeful, has asked for him to step down. He even punished Diaz Sr., by dissolving the Taxi subcommittee Johnson created to reward Diaz for his vote to help him become city council speaker.

Corey Johnson even visited an ill Diaz Sr. in the hospital to lobby him for that vote in early 2018. He did so despite the fact that the 74-year old Diaz has played the role of a homophobic minister for decades. His hate is well-documented, yet because political power was at stake, now-Speaker Johnson took a calculated risk by giving power to a homophobe.

Since Diaz Sr.’s homophobia is so well documented, it came up several times during his 2017 Democratic City Council primary in the Bronx. There were several viable and experienced candidates who ran in the primary that the many now-upset city council members refused to take a stand for in 2017. They feared retribution from the then-state senator and his son, the Bronx Borough president, who defended his father then and is calling for his resignation now.

Fear of losing a job is a powerful motivator for too many legislators. If we ever talk ourselves into thinking our ethics matter, we need to pump the brakes and remind ourselves of moments like this one. Our elected officials march side by side while power-brokering with our sworn enemies when we’re not looking.

The Hawks Circle Like Vultures

In late 2018, National Security Advisor John Bolton gave a speech about an axis of evil in Latin America. He decried Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a “sordid cradle of communism” in the Americas. He said that President Trump would be taking direct action against them.

In the early weeks of 2019, a member of National Assembly in Venezuela named Juan Guaidó declared himself interim president of the country. The problem is that Guaidó is facing the fact that there’s still a seated and democratically elected president named Nicolás Maduro. In the event that the president is deposed, the president of the National Assembly, a position Guaidó assumed in early January 2019, becomes president.

U.S. elected officials and the Trump administration have found common ground in supporting Guaidó, despite the Maduro’s constitutionally-grounded insistence that he is still the president.

Nancy Pelosi, who defends the standards of democracy that we should uphold in the U.S.A. by supporting investigations of Russian interference in 2016, is now fighting democracy abroad. Disagreements with a democratically elected president are one thing, but sparking a coup and supporting regime change is another.

This position puts her on the side of her sworn enemy, under the advisement of John Bolton, and interrupts the democratic process for the Venezuelan people.

Bolton is a vehement interventionist who believes that the U.S. can and should violate treaties, accords, and international law when necessary. Bolton, who has vehement disdain for the UN, is now supported by the liberal darling with the golf clap, Nancy Pelosi.

Since we won’t see any of these figures in front of a court of law for violating any treaties or subverting democracy, the court of public opinion is what matters. With the right-wing hawks happy to have a liberal hero on their side and the do-no-wrong halo Pelosi is wearing now, she’ll rally bipartisan support for a crime against democracy.

Where does her sudden interest in Venezuela’s politics come from? Pelosi told an NYU student a few years ago that Democrats are capitalists, in case we’re curious where her interests lie. Whether it’s the red-baiting or the pressure from the energy industry to support a president who wants to privatize Venezuela’s oil reserves, time will tell. Either way, her solidarity smells suspiciously of power-brokering that’s conditional on her own interests.

When is Solidarity Sincere?

Unconditional support, like unconditional love, leaves us with some strange and unsavory bedfellows. In a perfect world, we could elect people who have been honest about their values and then go about our business for the next few years until the next election. We would have strict term limits so that we would be electing people not to a lifelong job but to a temporary role in public service, as it was imagined at our founding.

When someone is on our side, we need to continue to scrutinize their motives. Trumpism has brought a lot of us together under a large and unexpected umbrella, but there’s a reason we didn’t know each other before.

We weren’t always on the same side of many important issues. When we see someone saying what we want them to say, our applause is dangerous and especially loud in the echo chamber of politics.

It’s hard to know when solidarity is sincere. As we dive into the next presidential cycle, we need to remain steadfast in watching the actions of the people who want our support, not merely their ability to perform that support.",Golf Claps and Clapbacks Are Not Solidarity,Counterpunch.org,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/02/27/golf-claps-and-clapbacks-are-not-solidarity/

He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould prompted the leader of Canada’s main opposition party to insist that Trudeau quit just months ahead of an October federal election.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. “I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

Both Craft and her husband are major supporters of President Donald Trump.

The pick gives the former Republican commentator Max Boot major concerns that the Trump administration will once again become a laughingstock on the world stage.

Writing in the Washington Post, Boot points out that historically that position was filled by the major statesmen of their time — major historical figures including Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson. He notes that the President’s first pick, Nikki Haley, was a continuation of that legacy. “She was a former governor who has been talked about as a possible presidential contender, and she acquitted herself admirably at the United Nations,” Boot writes.

Her initial replacement, Heather Nauert, did not have an equally relevant resume. Nauert had previously worked at Fox News.

Craft is even more problematic, argues Boot.

“Kelly Knight Craft was chosen to be U.S. ambassador to Canada, and now to the United Nations, because she and her third husband, the billionaire coal baron Joe Craft, are mega MAGA-donors,” he writes.

“According to The Post, they gave ‘about $1.5 million to GOP candidates in 2016, including $270,800 to Trump’s campaign committee or his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee.'”

He observes that Craft appears to be politically connected to the Trumps and the Republican leadership. She previously served as ambassador to Canada.

“Perhaps just as important from this president’s perspective, they are also ‘repeat, high-paying customers at Trump’s hotel in Washington.’ Craft’s other recommendation is that, as a Kentucky native, she is a supporter of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and is said to be friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.”

“If confirmed, Craft will arrive at the United Nations as a laughingstock — just like her boss,” writes Boot, who left the Republican Party due to their embrace of President Donald Trump.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The leader of Canada's main opposition party demanded on Wednesday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quit after a former justice minister said government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major firm avoid a bribery trial.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

After 16 months without a seat in the Commons — and dire warnings from within his own party that he'd either win the seat or find himself looking for another job — the NDP leader defied his critics and the pundits by capturing Burnaby South.

""To Burnaby South, thank you for trusting me to be your member of Parliament,"" a jubilant Singh told the crowd at his election headquarters.

Singh led throughout the night over his main rivals, Conservative candidate Jay Shin and the Liberals' Richard Lee.

Some will still suggest that Lee, a long-time provincial politician, had too much ground to make up after the Liberals original choice was forced to resign mid-campaign after making remarks in Mandarin about Singh's ethnicity that were considered offensive.

Some Liberals even suggested, privately, that a Singh victory wouldn't be such a bad thing for them given his uneven performance as leader, and their hopes of repeating their success poaching NDP supporters in 2015.

Whatever the reason, Singh is now poised to take a seat in the House of Commons — poised, finally, to begin shifting the discussion away from his embattled leadership to the issues the party intends to champion in the few months remaining before the fall general election: affordable housing, pharmacare and real action to combat climate change.

'National stage'

""With this win, people will get to see a progressive alternative to Justin Trudeau,"" said James Smith, Singh's campaign spokesperson. ""Conservatives won't push for more affordable housing, or for universal pharmacare. Jagmeet gets a chance now to stand up for those values on the national stage.""

That's the good news for the NDP. Good news for the party these days, however, always seems to come mixed with the bad.

In this case, New Democrats have to balance Singh's personal win against the loss of Outremont, the closest thing the party had to a fortress in Quebec. The Liberals resoundingly reclaimed the Montreal riding held by Singh's predecessor, Tom Mulcair, for the past decade.

Mulcair's 2007 byelection win gave the New Democrats a beachhead in Quebec. It was only the second time a New Democrat had ever won a seat in the province.

Four years later, Outremont became the epicentre of the so-called Orange Wave that swept across Quebec, giving the NDP nearly 60 seats there and vaulting it into the official opposition in Ottawa for the only time in its history.

Still, Monday's result in Outremont was not unexpected. For the Liberals, winning in Burnaby South would have been significant — more of an indication of momentum, especially in the wake of two weeks of negative media coverage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Watch as Singh addresses supporters after his byelection win:

Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has claimed victory in the Burnaby South byelection, finally allowing him to lead his party from within the House of Commons. 7:03

In Quebec, opinion polls have unblinkingly recorded the decline in NDP support ever since Singh became leader. As it stands, the party might have trouble holding a single one of its 16 — make that 15 — seats in the province after Monday night.

Battle for momentum

Liberals insist the win in Outremont is a good omen for them, a clear indication that they are on track to increase their seats in a province that may well be decisive to their chances of winning a second term.

Outremont is also the third byelection in which the Trudeau Liberals have taken an opposition seat, joining Lac Saint Jean, Que., and South Surrey-White Rock, B.C. Both had been held by Conservatives.

The Conservatives, as expected, won handily in the Ontario riding of York—Simcoe. And they did so despite the presence of candidates from Maxime Bernier's maverick People's Party of Canada.

The PPC did surprisingly well in Burnaby South. The party's candidate took about 11 per cent of the vote there, most of it from the Conservatives. In the other two races, Bernier's candidates barely registered.

What does that mean? Possibly very little. But Conservatives will have to consider the potential impact of vote-splitting with the People's Party this fall in swing ridings, where even a small amount of vote bleeding just might mean the difference between them and the Liberals.

But the big story of the night remains Burnaby South.

Watch as Singh calls for change after his byelection win:

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says Canada can make different choices and get better results 1:59

The prevailing wisdom was that Singh would have a tough time winning the riding for any number of reasons.

Start with the results in 2015, when the NDP won Burnaby South by fewer than 600 votes. Add in the fact that Singh's political home, until recently, was halfway across the country in Ontario. His political experience was based on his time in provincial politics there.

The polls have been similarly unkind since he became leader in October 2017. NDP fortunes took a tumble with each Singh stumble, whether it was not knowing the party's position on a gun control bill or his decision to boot MP Erin Weir from caucus after complaints that he made women feel uncomfortable.

The party's fundraising has also been weak, with the NDP lagging far behind the other two major parties. And just to finish the pile-on, let's observe that fully a quarter of the current NDP caucus isn't running again.

That made Burnaby South an interesting choice for a rookie leader who had what appeared to be everything to lose in this race.

But it proved to be a good laboratory for testing the tolerance of progressive voters in one of this country's most diverse ridings. Half of the people who live there were born outside Canada.

It's also exactly the kind of riding Justin Trudeau has cultivated, said Shachi Kurl, executive director of the polling firm Angus Reid Institute, with tax hikes on the rich, the tax-free child care benefit and promises of new money for infrastructure.

""This is middle-class ground zero, middle-class central,"" said Kurl. ""This will be a good assessment of whether people think Justin Trudeau's delivering or not.""

Three byelections. Three winners from three different parties. For the candidates, an exciting conclusion to three exhausting campaigns. And the winners, at least, will get to do it all over again in just a few months' time.

On Wednesday, the main opposition leader, chairman of the Conservative Party of Canada Andrew Scheer, urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to quit the office amid accusations of alleged political interference into the SNC-Lavalin case.

In turn, Trudeau said that he ""definitely does not agree"" with the testimony of Wilson-Raybould that she faced ""constant pressure"" and ""hidden threats"" from his office.

In particular, the company is accused of paying nearly $48 million to public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to influence government decisions.

In celebration of the GT-R’s 50th anniversary, we’ve ticked off the early edition GT-Rs, the revolutionary R32 GT-R, and the underrated R33 GT-R so far – go back and catch up first if you’ve not read them already.

Considering the lukewarm reaction that the R33 GT-R got upon launch (and arguably still today), the R34’s GT-R reception couldn’t have been more different when it was unveiled in 1999. The more square-looking front and rear ends, aggressive scowl and tall front bumper gave it a road presence unlike any GT-R previous. But aside from the cosmetics, there’s far less difference mechanically between the R33 and R34 than there is between the R32 and R33.

Rumour has it that the R34 GT-R was scaled back from ambitious plans due to Nissan’s uncertain financial situation at the time – apparently, a V6 featured in the original blueprints which wouldn’t resurface until much later in the R34’s successor. What the R34 did receive was an aerodynamics overhaul which greatly reduced front lift and increased downforce. Suspension tweaks, improved braking efficiency, an improved all-wheel drive and HICAS system, clever electronics, chassis stiffening and bracing was added, but more focus was put on saving weight whilst doing so too, meaning kerb weight is only just up on the R33.

Of course, Nissan still had its ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ with other Japanese manufacturers, so if you were to believe the book, it had less horsepower than a modern hot hatch at just 276hp. Nissan is famously conservative with power figures, so this was likely to be closer to 320-300hp in reality.

Background check complete. Here, in no special order, are my favourite five examples that we’ve showcased over the years…

1. Party Like It’s 1999: The Blitz Autobahn Project

Built to take on the RUF Yellowbird, Blitz’s R34 GT-R topped out at 343km/h (213mph) on the German autobahn in 1999 when a power steering belt disintegrated spectacularly. The Skyline was brought to a safe halt, and later went on to complete several other high-speed runs before being retired.

Featuring actual functional overfenders and some perfect period correct features, Trevor caught up with this iconic R34 just last year before it left the US and returned to Japan.

2. A 1,000hp GT-R & The Long Road To WTAC

It’s safe to say that Matt Longhurst takes time attack pretty seriously, and his 1,000hp R34 GT-R is about as extreme a track animal as you’ll find.

Boasting a full built billet engine, 1,000hp on tap, and some of the most insane bodywork and aero I can remember seeing on an R34, you’d be forgiven for thinking this was a big-builder project or race team build. But it’s not, it’s the results of what happens when one guy follows his passion. Well worth a read.

3. Trust Future Proofs The R34 GT-R

The R34-GTR is a 20-year-old car now, so the fact that the big Japanese tuning houses are still building them as demo cars speaks volumes for its potential. On a related note – is the heyday of coveted JDM machines in the past now, or do you think the R35, new Supra, Toyota 86, Type R and 370Z are future icons in the same way that we seen the Japanese performance models of the 1990s?

This particular example has been built by Trust to stand up to modern standards. It doesn’t boast crazy horsepower, or anything too off-the-wall, but rather a healthy dose of off-the-shelf parts perfect for sprucing up your GT-R. It’s pretty much the perfect spec R34 in my eyes.

4. Endless Legacy: An R34 GT-R Abroad

There’s something special about coming across a suspiciously special car overseas and then discovering that it’s a former demo car from one of the big Japanese tuning giants in its new life. That’s exactly what happened when Paddy visited Gatebil back in 2015.

Of course, what he uncovered was a former Endless demo car ripping it up in Norway. It’s not the only JDM legend now living in cooler climes, either. Maybe Norway’s where the best cars go to retire?

5. The Canadian Garage Saurus R34 GT-R

Anyone up to speed on their GT-Rs should instantly recognise the name Garage Saurus, one of the most ambitious and successful GT-R tuning shops.

Dino stumbled across this curiously Canadian GT-R in Japan at R’s Meeting late last year and did some further digging. It turns out that the car had been built by Garage Saurus and then shipped back and forth between Canada and Japan for periodic upgrades, and was now in the country for an epic road and track trip. How’s that for cool?

That brings us to the end of the Skyline era in our GT-R countdowns, but if I’m allowed a cheeky sixth choice, then this is it right here.

Next up, and in the final instalment, we look at the first non-Skyline GT-R, the R35…

Attempting to work around a lack of pipelines, the provincial government intends to spend $3.7 billion to lease 4,400 oil tank cars and locomotives to export more Canadian tar sands oil to the U.S. The announcement came just days after the latest oil train derailment and spill in Manitoba, Canada.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley addressed concerns about safety regarding the oil trains.

“We are treating the safety of these rail cars as though they are traveling through our own backyards,” Notley said. “The cars we will be using will be the safest cars on the tracks. They include the safest technology and meet the highest standards including all recent changes to safety standards.”

New regulations enacted after the 2013 oil train disaster killed 47 in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, require oil and rail companies to use newer rail cars to move oil. And while these new tank cars — known as DOT-117 and 117Rs — are more robust than the older tank cars involved in the deadly incident, they aren't immune to the forces of a train derailment.

In the past year, two Canadian oil trains consisting of these “safest” tank cars have derailed and resulted in large oil spills. In June 2018, a train from Canada derailed and spilled 230,000 gallons of oil into floodwaters in Iowa.

The most recent oil train crash, which occurred on a ranch in Manitoba on February 16, involved 37 derailed tank cars. No details have been released on the amount of oil spilled, but aerial photos show streams of dark black oil leaking from the damaged tank cars.

While Premier Notley claims that these new rail cars are the safest, that doesn't mean they will survive a derailment intact. Oil trains will continue to derail and cause large fires and spills.

Oil-By-Rail Becomes an Election Issue

Not everyone is welcoming Alberta’s plans to get into the oil-by-rail business, which will likely become an issue in the upcoming election. The announcement was criticized by Jason Kenney, leader of Alberta's Official Opposition United Conservative Party, who told the CBC that, “If elected, a United Conservative government will subject today's [oil-by-rail] proposal to that value-for-money review.”

While Notley claims that the Alberta government will make over $2 billion in revenue from the investment, Kenney is skeptical. He says the deal is something Canadian taxpayers “cannot afford” and called it “corporate welfare.”

The skepticism about the deal's finances comes after recent reports that Canada likely overpaid in purchasing the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project when Kinder Morgan couldn't find a buyer — another Canadian government effort to support the money-losing tar sands industry.

Dueling Policies Mean Economics Not Working for Oil-By-Rail

Oil-by-rail can cost as much as $15 more a barrel for Canadian producers to transport the oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast compared to pipelines. It only makes economic sense for oil producers to use rail when the discount for Western Canadian Select (WCS, Canadian) oil versus West Texas Intermediate (WTI, American) oil is more that $15.

In late 2018, that discount was as high as $50 per barrel, which led Canadian producers to export a record 354,000 barrels of oil per day by rail in December. However, the steep discounts for WCS oil meant the Alberta tar sands industry was losing money on all of the oil it sold.

This situation led to Premier Notley announcing mandatory oil production cuts in early December, which very effectively decreased the discount for WCS oil. However, with the discount below $15, many producers are choosing to no longer use trains to move oil because it is no longer economically viable.

In mid-February, the CEO of oil producer Suncor commented on this unintended consequence of the production cuts.

“The rail economics are seriously damaged,” said Suncor CEO Steve Williams. “A lot of the rail movements are stopping or have stopped.”

Yet the Alberta government is now investing in moving oil by rail.

Whether or not Canadian government efforts to save the struggling tar sands industry succeed, the risks of moving oil-by-rail are well known.

The latest oil train derailment and spill demonstrate a maxim among oil spill responders: It's not a question of if the next oil spill happens but when. That would also seem to apply as more Canadian oil moves by rail and more oil spills inevitably occur.

While the oil may be moving in the “safest” rail cars — those cars are by no means safe.

Barnier called for decisions, rather than extra time.","Any delay to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ""must serve not to put off the problem but to resolve the problem"" in the British parliament, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said Thursday.

""Today, above all we need decisions, much more than extra time,"" he added.

After a meeting with Barnier in Vienna, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he would also like to see Brexit resolved before European elections in May. It would ""seem more than absurd"" for a country wanting to leave the bloc to be able to vote for its legislature, he said.

On Wednesday, more than 500 MPs in the 650-seat parliament backed a plan to vote on British Prime Minister's Brexit deal on March 12. If lawmakers reject the deal, the plan foresees another parliamentary vote on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal or delay it's March 29 exit date.

UK approach

May has been struggling to gain enough support from hard-line pro-Brexit MPs within her Conservative Party and Northern Ireland's DUP party, which props up her government, for the existing withdrawal agreement.

Prime Minister Theresa May speaking in the House of Commons

In recent weeks, her government has tried to convince EU leaders to accept legal guarantees that would make the deal's so-called Irish backstop temporary. Critics fear the backstop could force the UK to follow EU rules indefinitely.

But EU leaders have repeatedly said they would not agree to any legal changes to the existing deal.

Barnier reiterated that position in Vienna, telling reporters that the EU was ""not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement.""

Another one bites the dust

On Thursday, George Eustice, a junior minister in the UK's agriculture ministry, resigned from his post in protest of May's three-step plan.

The decision to offer parliament the power to delay Brexit would ""lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country,"" he said.

This septic isle It never rains A delay by UK Prime Minister Theresa May to allow Parliament to vote on her Brexit deal has increased the chances Britain will leave the bloc without a deal in March. The odds on a no-deal Brexit have shortened to 2/1, according to oddschecker.com, while Steve Eisman, the trader whose prediction of the 2008 crisis was dramatized in the film The Big Short, is betting against UK banks.

This septic isle Money where your mouth is The IMF says that while some sectors like agriculture and mining might benefit, the majority of sectors would shrink by between about 1 percent and 33 percent. The Bank of England said no-deal would wipe between 4.75 percent and 7.75 percent off what the UK would have produced by 2024 and the pound would fall by 25 percent.

This septic isle Not waving, but drowning The EU has said the UK would have ""third country"" status under a no-deal scenario, giving it the same status as China, Russia and Pakistan. All goods crossing EU borders would be subject to tariffs of up to 38 percent. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said additional paperwork attached to trading under WTO rules would act as an extra tariff of up to an average of 6.5 percent.

This septic isle Love's labor lost Britain’s farmers and manufacturers face the largest shortage of skilled workers since 1989 due to a fall in the numbers of EU27 nationals coming to work since the Brexit vote. A no deal would likely accelerate that process.

This septic isle A road to nowhere The financial industry and British regulators say a hard Brexit poses a threat to trillions of euros worth of derivative and insurance contracts London could lose up to to €800 billion to Frankfurt, lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance has said. Some 30 banks and financial firms have already chosen the city as the site of their new EU headquarters, with others opting for Dublin or Paris.

This septic isle Movers and shakers left in limbo No-deal would have significant implications for people's ability to go where they want. A €7 charge for visiting the EU's Schengen Area would kick in in 2021, after the UK's transition period ends. British expats would face uncertainty, as many foreign governments have not yet established their rules for residency under no-deal.

This septic isle Can't beat a good queue The UK Road Haulage Association has said a lack of planning over no-deal would mean the manufacturing sector would be put under ""severe pressure"" and hauliers would go out of business. European airports have warned that no-deal would cause ""major disruption and heightened safety risks"" to the air network. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has warned planes could be grounded.

This septic isle All in it together The biggest impact of no deal could be felt in Ireland, which exports 12 percent of its goods and 40 percent of its food to the UK, and two-thirds of its other exports travel through the UK. The IMF believes the Netherlands, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Belgium also face taking moderate hits to their economies of between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent.

This septic isle Where there is harmony, May brings discord The Police Federation has said it was worried about ""widescale disruption and dangers for the general public."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said 3,500 troops are on standby to cope with the fallout of no deal. The government is preparing for potential shortages of key items in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. But May refused to guarantee the health service (NHS) would have enough medicines.

This septic isle Christmas-voting turkeys play chicken in Ireland The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would remain unresolved with no deal. The main sticking point has been the Irish 'backstop' — the insurance scheme for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. One solution has been a Canada-style agreement that would remove most EU restrictions but would not abolish the need for a hard border. But uncertainty breeds fear. Author: Jo Harper



Meanwhile, the opposition Labour party has said it would put forward an amendment calling for a second EU referendum when the next ""meaningful vote"" is held. However, opposition to a second public vote within Labour and the Conservative Party makes its chances of success slim.

No-deal fears

With 29 days to go before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, businesses are starting to scramble to prepare themselves for a potentially chaotic ""no-deal"" exit.

Drivers in the Republic of Ireland were told Thursday that they would need an insurance document to cross the border into Northern Ireland if both sides failed to reach a deal.

As the 45th Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, begins Wednesday, a look at the event’s sponsors shows a collection of outside spending groups, prominent conservative activist organizations, think tanks and media outlets.

A who’s-who of conservative money networks, many sponsors are promoted in CPAC’s’ panels and events, and often onstage rubbing elbows with the influencers currently driving grassroots conservative politics.

CPAC touts itself as “the birthplace of modern conservatism,” and has long been observed for the pulse of the conservative movement. President Donald Trump’s appearances at the event before his presidential bid have been credited by some for raising his profile among movement conservatives in the years before the 2016 Republican primary.

Behind CPAC is the American Conservative Union a conservative lobbying organization and outside spending group which organizes the event. In the last election cycle, ACU spent $258,000 in support of Republican candidates, according to data tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics.

2018 was ACU’s biggest year for lobbying since 2005. Last year the group spent $540,000 on lobbying, advocating for bills ranging from net neutrality, pro-sugar industry regulation, budget cuts and sentencing reform.

ACU’s going rate for a sponsorship buy-in at CPAC costs thousands of dollars. The lowest level of sponsorship, a “participating sponsor,” costs $7,000, with the highest level, a “platinum sponsor,” running at $250,000.

Sponsorship not only buys organizations extensive promotion at the event, but many sponsors have their own panels, speakers and events at CPAC. As one “ACU insider” told the Daily Beast last year: “That’s one of the bigger benefits of sponsorship… the higher you sponsor, the higher the chances your speaker and your panel topic will happen at CPAC.”

Yet the subject of panels and events is reached through “consensus” by CPAC’s organizers and not by sponsors, according to Ian Walters, ACU’s communications director. Planning committees in the run-up to the event, which can include people affiliated with sponsors, plan the event’s schedule before sponsors are ultimately decided, Walters said. He added that it would be inaccurate to say sponsors have any limiting influence on potential events or panels.

“It’s about as public and transparent a process as there can be,” Walters said.

This year, CPAC has two “platinum sponsors” spending $250,000. One is Liberty HealthShare, a health care cost-sharing company. The other is Dragging Canoe – Pigeon Forge.

Dragging Canoe is the only sponsor without a hyperlink to its website on CPAC’s sponsors page. It is an upcoming “a second-amendment themed entertainment venue and restaurant in Pigeon Forge” slated to open in 2020, according to Walters. CPAC was approached by Dragging Canoe’s owners last year for a potential sponsorship.

Google searches provide no information about the company. A Dragging Canoe, LLC was registered as a business with the Tennessee Secretary of State last November and lists a for-sale empty building in Maryville, Tennessee as its address. Despite being an up-and-coming business, Dragging Canoe is sponsoring CPAC’s $250 a ticket “Ronald Reagan Dinner and Reception” on Friday night.

The next level of sponsorship at CPAC, “presenting sponsors” who spent $125,000, include the National Rifle Association, the GOP, and Liberty, a Japanese cryptocurrency start-up.

The event, in turn, has multiple panels on the second amendment and gun control, including a speech by NRA president and Iran-Contra figure Lt. Col. Oliver North. The co-founder of Liberty, Jikido “Jay” Aeba of the Japanese Conservative Union, will participate in a panel about cryptocurrency.

While not all events and speakers represent sponsors, those that do have extensive real estate in CPAC’s agenda. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, spent $60,000 to sponsor the event. A number of Heritage Foundation staff are to appear on stage throughout the week, and the think tank will host events on censorship of conservatives and election security.

The Center for Security Policy, another think tank and longtime sponsor, spent $12,000 to sponsor CPAC this year. CSP has long been criticized as Islamophobic, and has promulgated conspiracy theories about Muslims, including an impending Sharia take-over of the United States and the infiltration of the U.S. government by the Muslim Brotherhood.

CPS is sponsoring multiple events at CPAC, including an event moderated by National Security Advisor John Bolton’s former chief of staff on “Why Anti-Zionism is a Form of Anti-Semitism and a Threat to National Security.” Frank Gaffney Jr., the controversial founder of CPS, will moderate his own event on CPAC about the persecution of Christians around the world.

Another major sponsor of CPAC is the Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank and previous sponsor. The Heartland Institute has positioned itself as a leading critic of climate science for many years, and has coordinated with the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency to promote views denying climate change. As a $28,000-sponsor, Heartland is present throughout CPAC’s agenda. Its CEO has a stand-alone speech on Friday afternoon, and the group is sponsoring an event on “AOC’s Green New Deal: Debunking the Climate Alarmism Behind Bringing Full Socialism to America.”

Another CPAC sponsor is the Alliance of Conservative and Reformists in Europe, or ACRE, which represents the third-largest political party in the European Parliament. While ACRE includes member parties outside of Europe like the GOP, the conservative party of Canada and Likud in Israel, it has within its parliamentary ranks the controversial far-right parties of Poland, Italy, Denmark and Bulgaria.

ACRE will host an event at CPAC on “Building a Stronger Transatlantic Security and Defense Cooperation” featuring the Polish ambassador to the United States.

There are other ties to the European right-wing at CPAC. Italian lawmaker Giorgia Meloni, an ally of Matteo Salvini, Italy’s controversial deputy prime minister, will appear on a panel with ACU board member José Cárdenas and Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) on “Democracy Breaking through Darkness: Can Europe and Venezuela be Liberated?”

Though not listed as an official sponsor, Heritage Action for America, a lobbying organization and outside spending group, has a number of sponsored events throughout CPAC’s agenda. Heritage Action for America spent nearly $2 million supporting Republican candidates in the last-election cycle.

Reporters for conservative media outlets who paid thousands of dollars to sponsor CPAC are also featured prominently throughout the event’s agenda.

The Washington Times, which spent $60,000 to sponsor the event, has 6 of its reporters appearing on-stage. The Daily Caller, a participating sponsor, has four reporters featured at CPAC, one of whom publicly apologized earlier this month for racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic old tweets.

As CPAC commences, it remains at the intersection of grassroots conservatism and big-money influence. The event too remains a prominent spot for GOP officialdom, shown by its upcoming appearances by numerous Republican lawmakers as well as President Trump.",A guide to CPAC’s sponsors: from a Japanese cryptocurrency startup to the NRA,Opensecrets.org,https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/02/a-guide-to-cpacs-sponsors-from-a-japanese-cryptocurrency-startup-to-the-nra/
193,Empty,2019-03-01T05:00:20Z,"“If it turns out that there is a God … the worst that you can say about him is that basically he’s an underachiever.”—Woody Allen If you go into a Reform or Conservative temple, it’s likely that you will notice two things: The congregation is becoming smaller…","“If it turns out that there is a God … the worst that you can say about him is that basically he’s an underachiever.”—Woody Allen

If you go into a Reform or Conservative temple, it’s likely that you will notice two things: The congregation is becoming smaller and older. Across the United States and Europe, Jewish congregations are aging at a rapid rate, a phenomenon increasingly common for mainstream religions across the high-income world.

Overall, the American Jewish population—unlike that of demographically robust Israel—is on the decline, with a loss of 300,000 members over the past decade, a number expected to drop further by 2050. The median age of members of Reform congregations is 54, and only 17 percent of members say they attend religious services even once a month. Four-fifths of the movement’s youth are gone by the time they graduate high school. The conservative movement is, if anything, in even worse shape: At its height, in 1965, the Conservative movement had 800 affiliated synagogues throughout the United States and Canada; by 2015 that number had fallen to 594.

But Jews, and their religious institutions, should not feel singled out. The share of Americans who belong to the Catholic Church has declined from 24 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in 2014, a more rapid decline according to Pew, then any other religious organization in memory. There are 6.5 former Catholics in the U.S. for every new convert to the faith, not a number suggesting a very sunny future.

The mainstream Protestant churches are not exactly filling the sanctuaries either. Some, like the internally conflicted Methodists have seen their number of North American congregants drop from 15 million in 1970 to barely half that today. Since 2007 alone, America’s mainstream churches have lost 5 million members, and even the once vibrant evangelical movement is losing adherents outside of the developing world. Ever more churches, particularly in urban areas, are being abandoned, turned into bars, restaurants, and luxury condos. And nothing augurs worse for the future than the fact that American millennials are leaving religious institutions at a rate four times that of their counterparts three decades ago; almost 40 percent of people 18 to 29 are not unaffiliated.

This decline is not necessarily a reflection of less spiritual feeling: Two-thirds of unaffiliated Americans still believe in God or a universal spirit. The Pew poll shows that since 2012, the share of Americans who describe themselves as “spiritual but not religious” has surged from 19 percent to 27 percent five years later.

Why, then, the decline in religion? For one thing, young Americans have different habits. Rather than join institutions, millennials, argued Wade Clark Roof, author of the book Spiritual Marketplace, are indulging in a kind of “grazing,” finding their spiritual fixes in various different places rather than any one organized church. As sociologists Robert Putnam and David Campbell explained, those in this age group “reject conventional religious affiliation, while not entirely giving up their religious feelings.”

But the consumption habits of the young aren’t the only reason for America’s religious drought. Religious institutions and ideas are currently under political attack, predominantly from the left, with some progressives, such as California’s Dianne Feinstein or New Jersey’s Cory Booker, appearing to see embrace of Christian dogma, or even membership in such anodyne organizations as the Knights of Columbus, as cause for exclusion from high judicial office.

This trend is reinforced by the media , which is often dismissive of traditional faith. There has been a powerful tendency to demonize and suggest the worst of motives among the faithful, which was evident in the rush to judgment about the alleged racism of the Covington, Kentucky, religious students. Before the facts proved claims of racism to be false, newspaper accounts and tweets from journalists endorsed actions against the students, sometime including violence, in ways more reminiscent of Joseph Goebbels than Joseph Pulitzer.

As in many cases, this bias reflects the groupthink nurtured at our leading universities. Evangelicals and religious conservatives barely exist in the country’s leading theological seminaries, where they are outnumbered, by some estimates, 70 to 1 by liberals, and evidence suggests that those espousing traditional religious views are widely discriminated against in academic departments.

In this difficult environment, many religious movements—Reform Judaism, mainstream Protestantism, and increasingly the Catholic Church under Pope Francis—have sought to redefine themselves largely as instruments of social justice. Although doing good deeds, or mitzvot, long has constituted a strong element in most religions, the primary motivation of the faith community traditionally focused on heritage, spirituality, and family. In their haste to be politically correct, even Catholic private schools such as Notre Dame are rushing to cover up murals of Columbus, and, in one California case, a private Catholic grammar school has gone as far as hiding statues of saints.

Yet rebranding themselves as progressive often brings religious activists into alliances with people who reject their core values. The Catholic left, for example, allying itself with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, implicitly embraces the advocates of the most extreme abortion liberalization. Sometimes, these linkages are ironic: Faith in Public Life, for example, a strident “religious” group advocating a progressive anti-Trump line, gets much of its funding from George Soros, arguably the world’s most well-heeled and active promoter of atheism.

For their part, progressive Jews, embracing the notion of tikkun olam, face a similar dilemma. In their rush to oppose President Trump, with his occasional despicable winks at alt-right groups, many Jewish activists have collaborated with the organizers of the Women’s March, including enthusiastic backers of the most influential anti-Semite of our time, Nation of Islam head Louis Farrakhan.

Deep blue cities and the progressive feeding lots of the academy—strongholds of progressivism—are precisely where support for such anti-Jewish measures as the BDS movement is strongest. Anti-Semitism is particularly rife not in conservative Southern schools but in progressive places like San Francisco State; in that city, the ultimate progressive stronghold, a leftist gay Jewish café owner recently has been subject to repeated protests for being a “Zionist gentrifier.”

This alliance with anti-Semites and those opposing the existence of the state of Israel pushes the limits of cognitive dissonance. Jews in the U.K. are confronted with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who defends not only anti-Zionist but also traditional anti-Semitic tropes. Recently progressive heartthrob Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, herself an adopter of anti-Israel memes about Gaza and other occupied areas, gushed over her recent “lovely and wide-reaching” conversation with Corbyn, the West’s most politically prominent Judeophobe.

Indeed, despite the impression left by some progressive Jews, the largest threat to Jews in America stems not from the isolated and pathetically small lunatic fringe of white supremacists. The most anti-Israel members of Congress , as well as on the local level , come primarily not from the right wing of the GOP but the burgeoning left wing of the Democratic Party. Democratic voters—as well as key constituencies like minorities and millennials—poll consistently less sympathetic to both Jews and Israel than older, generally white Republicans.

Is there a way back from this sorry state of affairs?

However satisfying to its practitioners, the emphasis on social justice is clearly not attracting more worshippers. Almost all the religious institutions most committed to this course are also in the most serious decline, most notably mainstream Protestants but also, Catholics and Reform and Conservative Jews. The rapidly declining Church of England, which is down to 2 percent share among British youth, is burnishing its progressive image by adding the use of plastics to its list of Lenten sacrifices, but seems unable to serve the basic spiritual and family needs of their congregants.

In contrast, more conservative faith organizations generally enjoy better growth, and higher birthrates, particularly in the developing world . The University of London’s Eric Kaufmann explains in his important book Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth? that if current trends continue, the more fundamentalist family-centered faiths seem most likely to survive. Already, for example, Orthodox Jews, historically a small subgroup, are projected to become the majority of the Hebraic community in Britain by 2100, and already constitute some three-fifths of Jewish children in New York.

Orthodox Jews and evangelicals may be finding common ground, then, but the future of religion overall does not seem a bright one. It’s hard to imagine most young Jews becoming Orthodox, or casual Christians embracing en masse Mormonism or evangelical Christianity. Instead, the future seems to point to a smaller, more conservative religious community, isolated amidst an increasingly secularized culture.

To survive, less traditionalist faiths need less “virtue signaling” and more emphasis on serving the needs of congregants. Marshall Toplansky, who advises Church World Services, a major Protestant aid group, suggested that groups like Mormons and evangelicals who focus on providing services for families and their local communities fare far better than those more tied to strictly a social gospel. Toplansky said that many mainstream churches “have overlooked the value of building grassroots relationships with their donors,” who sometimes do not share the progressive ideology of the clerical class. Without engaging the faithful and addressing their needs, he noted, “people stop identifying with their local institution and stop participating in the local activities that defined them to begin with.”

Catholicism, now under a reforming and politically progressive pope, faces a similar challenge. It is losing adherents, not only in North America and Europe, where his views are popular, but also his homeland of South America, where the church is steadily losing out to more conservative evangelical churches. Until the 1960s, at least 90 percent of Latin America’s population was Catholic, but that number has fallen to under 70 percent. Today, roughly 1 in 4 Nicaraguans, 1 in 5 Brazilians and 1 in 7 Venezuelans are former Catholics. The one place where the church is growing most, Africa, is dominated by conservative bishops often at odds with Francis.

Anthony Lemus, an influential lay Catholic, believes the church’s future relies on remaining true to its principles while refashioning its message to serve its adherents’ worldly, as well as spiritual, needs. An astrophysicist brought up in a deeply Catholic East Los Angeles household, Lemus is working with a prominent Catholic theologian, Rev. Robert Spitzer, on rewriting of the Catholic Catechism to make the faith more accessible to the new generation. He also supports efforts to improve services from the church—day care, athletic clubs, camps—that might attract young families back to the faith.

“Today’s generation is more in tune with value-add products and services influencing their lives immediately, and the relevance of faith competes with these promotions,” he said. “A ‘sticky’ rebranding of the importance of faith formation’s value in everyday life is key to reposition its importance for living a holistic life.”

Ultimately, as Lemus suggested, religions, including Judaism, can only hope to thrive if they serve a purpose that is not met elsewhere in society. It is all well and good to perform good deeds, but if religions do not make themselves indispensable to families, their future could be bleak. As we already see in Europe, churches and synagogues could become ever more like pagan temples, vestiges of the past and attractions for the curious, profoundly clueless about the passion and commitment that created them.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Getty Realty's Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2018. This call is being recorded. Prior to starting the call, Joshua Dicker, Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Secretary of the company will read a safe harbor statement and provide information of our non-G-A-A-P financial measures.

Please go ahead, Mr. Dicker.

Joshua Dicker -- Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary

With that, let me turn the call over to Christopher Constant, our Chief Executive Officer.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call for the fourth quarter and year-ended 2018. With Josh and me on the call today are Mark Olear, our Chief Operating Officer; and Danion Fielding, our Chief Financial Officer.

I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our fourth quarter and year-end 2018 performance, touch on our 2019 strategic objectives and then we'll pass the call to Mark to discuss our portfolio in more detail, and then, Danion will discusses our financials as well.

Our fourth quarter 2018 results and business activities concluded another strong year for Getty. During the quarter, our portfolio continued to display the strength and stability that we expect from our long-term triple net leases. And just as important, we continue to execute on our growth strategies with the acquisition of two properties and the completion of three redevelopment projects.

As we close out 2018 and look ahead to 2019, we continue to benefit from the overall health of the convenience and gas sector, while we remain focused on creating shareholder value by executing on each of our stated growth initiatives, including realizing internal growth from our operating assets and financing our portfolio through accretive acquisitions and unlocking embedded value through selective redevelopments, all of which we further demonstrated throughout 2018.

Turning to our results for the quarter. We continue to grow our revenue, net earnings, FFO and AFFO for the quarter as compared to the same periods for the prior year. On a per share basis, which takes into account our capital raising activities during 2018, our quarterly AFFO per share was $0.43.

For the year ended 2018, we reported AFFO per share of $1.71, which was 3% higher than our results for the prior year and which fell within our revised guidance range. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to underwrite and acquire new properties during the quarter. For the year, our total investment was approximately $87 million.

We acquired 41 high-quality convenience and gas, and other automotive locations during the year. This demonstrates our proactive, yet disciplined underwriting approach to grow our portfolio. Over the past few years, we have acquired 144 properties for investments for approximately 300 -- have mostly completed three portfolio transactions over this time and established relationships with new high-quality growth-oriented tenants.

So relationships, such as these are one of the keys to our ongoing ability to source accretive growth opportunities. As an example, subsequent to our initial transaction with Applegreen, in 2017, we partnered with them to acquire another portfolio in 2018. In addition, rents commenced on six redevelopments during 2018.

These projects included new-to-industry convenience and gas, automotive, retail, financial services, food services and urgent care uses. This brings our total completed redevelopments to nine, since commencing this program. We also maintain an attractive pipeline of both acquisition and redevelopment projects, which are scheduled to come online in 2019 and beyond.

Utilizing the financial flexibility that we've worked hard to create, we were able to finance our growth in 2018 with a combination of debt and equity, including a 10-year unsecured debt private placement and measured use of our ATM program.

We placed a premium on being conservatively leveraged and are committed to maintaining a well-laddered flexible capital structure as we look to grow completions.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to an active approach to managing our portfolio of net leased assets, expanding our portfolio through acquisitions in the convenience, gas and auto-related sectors and selective redevelopment projects. We are confident that we will be able to continue to successfully execute on our strategic objectives throughout 2019.

We will continue to be focused on acquiring high-quality real estate and partnering with tenants who share our commitment to the growth and evolution of the convenience, gas and other automotive-related sectors. This approach and focus on these critical components should result in driving additional shareholder value as we move through 2019 and beyond.

With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Olear to discuss our portfolio and investment activities.

Mark J. Olear -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Chris. In terms of our investment activities, we had a productive year, where we were able to both add high-quality, convenience and gas, and other auto-related assets to the portfolio, as well as move redevelopment projects back into our net lease portfolio following rent commencement.

During 2018, Getty's pipeline of potential transactions remain consistent with prior years experience. For the year, we underwrote approximately $1 billion of opportunities, which met our initial screening process, the result of which was the acquisition of 41 properties for $78 million. The weighted average return exceeded 7.25%, and the weighted average initial lease term was 14.1 years.

To review a few highlights of our investment activities, for the fourth quarter, we acquired two convenience and gas locations for $3.2 million with an average initial return of more than 7.2%. For the year, we further advanced our goal of diversifying our revenue by expanding our relationships with three tenants, Applegreen, Circle K and GPM Investments.

We display high-quality operations and strong credit quality. We also expanded the company's presence in Southern US, primary through our portfolio transaction with GPM, which had one-third of the sites in the Dallas-Fort Worth MSA, and through our second transaction with Applegreen, where all of these sites are located in the Columbia, South Carolina metropolitan market.

The net result is that we are now represented in 30 states, plus Washington DC, and 60% of our annualized base rent comes from the top 25 National MSAs. Overall, the pipeline of opportunities we are underwriting for convenience and gas and other automotive use sites remains robust.

Moving to our redevelopment platform. For the year, we invested approximately $9 million in both our completed projects and sites, which are in progress. As Chris mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we returned three redevelopment projects back to the net lease portfolio, bringing our total for rent commenced projects to six in 2018 and nine since the inception of this initiative.

Specifically in November, rent commenced for a build-to-suit urgent care location lease to ConvenientMD in Massachusetts. Our total investment in the project was $2.1 million, and we expect to generate a return on our investment of more than 10%. In December, we funded the raise and rebuild of a convenience and gas side with our global partners on Long Island, New York. In this project, our total investment was $3.1 million, and we expect to generate a return on our investment of 7.5%.

Finally, in December, rent commenced on a project where we ground lease a site to a regional developer for a food service use. In this project, we invested $0.3 million, and we expect to generate a return on investment of more than 20%. In terms of redevelopment projects, we ended the quarter with 13 signed leases. Of these redevelopment projects, six are on properties not currently included in our net lease portfolio and seven are on properties, which are included in our net lease portfolio.

All of these projects are continuing to advance through the redevelopment process. We expect substantially all these projects will be completed over the next one to three years. In total, we have invested approximately $2.1 million in these 13 redevelopment projects in our pipeline, and we expect to have rent commencement at several sites during 2019.

On the capital spending side, we estimate that these 13 projects will require a total investment by Getty of $8.2 million and will generate incremental returns for the company in excess of where we can invest these funds in the acquisition markets today. For more detailed information on the redevelopment pipeline, please refer to page 14 of our investor presentation, which is found on our website. We remain committed to transforming selective sites in our portfolio and look forward to updating everyone as we make progress.

Turning to dispositions. We sold 10 properties during 2018, realizing proceeds of approximately $7.2 million. The properties sold were vacant or returned to us by our tenants as per the terms of their lease agreements. We expect the net financial impact of these dispositions will be minimal.

As we look ahead, we continue to selectively dispose the properties where we have made a determination, that the properties are aren't competitive as a gas, convenience location and does not have redevelopment potential. As a result of our -- all of our activity, we ended the year with 918 net lease properties, six active redevelopment sites and nine vacant properties. Our weighted average lease term is approximately 10 years, and our overall occupancy, excluding active redevelopments remains constant at 99%.

With that, I turn the call over to Danion.

Danion Fielding -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

Thank you, Mark. For the fourth quarter, our total revenues and revenues from rental properties, which excludes tenant reimbursements and interest on notes and mortgages receivables grew 3% to $35.1 million, and 5% to $29.5 million, respectively.

Our top line growth continues to be driven by rents escalated in our leases, plus incremental growth from completed acquisitions and redevelopment projects. During the fourth quarter of 2018, property costs and environmental and G&A expenses collectively declined, primarily due to reductions in our environmental expense line item, which is highly variable quarter-to-quarter. For more information on the specific expense movements, please refer to today evening's release.

Our FFO for the quarter was $20.3 million, or $0.49 per share, as compared to $20.2 million, or $0.51 per share, for the prior year's quarter. Our AFFO for the quarter was $17.6 million, or $0.43 per share, as compared to $17.3 million, or $0.43 per share, for the prior year's quarter. For the year ended 2018, our total revenues and revenues from rental properties grew by 13% to $136.1 million and 15% to $116.3 million, respectively. Again, this growth stems from the escalators on net leases and successful execution of both acquisitions and redevelopments.

For the year ended 2018, our operating expenses increased. The primary driver for the increases was our environmental expense line item, which is highly variable. In addition, during the year, we experienced an increase in property costs due to pursue cost of deals, ultimately, not completed.

Our FFO for the year was $73.6 million, or $1.80 per share, as compared to $74.6 million, or $2 per share, for the prior year.Our AFFO for the year was $69.7 million, or $1.71 per share, as compared to $62.0 million, or $1.66 per share, for the prior year.

Turning to the balance sheet and our capital markets activities. We ended 2018 with $445 million of borrowings, which includes $120 million under our credit agreement and $325 million of long-term fixed rate debt. Our weighted average borrowing cost is 5.1%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is five years, with 73% of our debt being fixed rate and our earliest debt maturity remains 2021. Our debt to total capitalization currently stands at 24%. Our debt to total asset value is 36%, and our net debt to EBITDA is a conservative four times.

In addition, we utilized our at-the-market equity program during the quarter and issued $9.7 million of capital at an average price of $30.24 per share. For the year, we raised $31 million through our ATM program at an average price of $27.93 per share. Our environmental liability ended the quarter at $59.8 million, down $3.7 million for the year.

For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018, the company's net environmental remediation spending was approximately $3.1 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Finally, we are introducing our 2019 AFFO per share guidance at a range of $1.71 to $1.75 per share.

Our guidance does not assume any acquisition or capital markets activities, although it does reflect our expectation that we will continue to execute on our redevelopment, leasing and disposition activities. Specific factors, which impact our guidance this year include, one, our expectation that we forego rent when we recapture properties for redevelopment.

Two, our expectation that our cost of borrowings will increase in 2019. Three, the full-year impact of the dilution associated with the company's 2018 capital raising activities. And four, our expectation that we will remain active in pursuing acquisition on redevelopments, which could result in additional expenses for deals ultimately not completed.

With that, I will turn the call back to Chris.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

That concludes our prepared remarks. So, let me ask the operator to open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey guys. Good morning.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Dan, anything else in guidance, any other big variances as we look year-to-year? Do you guys have any impact from the new lease accounting impact on G&A at all, year-over-year?

Danion Fielding -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

Craig, we're not expecting in our guidance a big impact on that at the moment.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. And then just bigger picture. I know acquisitions are a little bit more volatile for you guys. You guys are north of $200 million in '17 and about $80 million in '18. Just -- as you guys look at what's in the pipeline, the competitiveness of the market, I mean, do you think that 2019 could be more like '18 or '17 in terms of volume?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think if you look at our track record of portfolio acquisitions and one-off acquisitions, we think we've been successful in executing both portfolio and one-off deals. Really, it's a matter of two factors, which is, a lot of our activities being driven by industry M&A and consolidation, and we expect that trend to continue.

And secondly, we have an underwriting criteria, which really places an emphasis on being in certain markets and where those sites are located within those markets. And any transaction that we ultimately pursue has to fit right into our underwriting model for us to move forward with it. So, those are two things that I think will impact any deal that we look at sort of this year and beyond.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Maybe another way to ask it. The investment pipeline today, how does that look relative to maybe the beginning of last year?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think it's consistent. We disclosed a year ago this time that we underwrote $1.3 billion last year and last year, we underwrote $1 billion, so a slight difference. But the volume of opportunities that we continue to see, which make it through our initial screen is fairly consistent.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

And what are you guys seeing on the competitive side, and how is that impacting yields that you're able to get in the market on acquisitions?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think there's no doubt that there is definitely competition from other REITs and from other institutional real estate investors for convenience and gas assets. This sector is quite healthy and it is consolidated. We are seeing a lot more activity there.

In general, our view is that pricing has been pretty disciplined across the -- especially, the public REIT market for our type of assets. So, I don't really think it impacts pricing on our side. I do think it does make the sector a little more crowded just from the number of people looking at every deal.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Welcome.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities.

Mitchell Germain -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

I just wanted to follow up on Craig's question regarding the deal pipeline. I mean, more or less what deals you saw. 2017, I think you said 1.3 or so. Last year, one. Closed on a smaller amount in 2018. Did you guys make any sort of shift in your underwriting just to account for the rate environment or the -- where we sit in the cycle? Was there any kind of shift that you guys made personally that might have caused a smaller amount of acquisition activity?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

No, our model has been pretty consistent in terms of the way we value the real estate, the way we price transactions internally. I think, really, it is -- it's the acquisition, so certain transactions closed and certain transactions that we really like didn't close for various reasons. And that's really the thing that I would point to in terms of the delta between 2017 and 2018.

We think We've been pretty consistent in terms of generating new activity in terms of our underwriting model and our internal processing. We think we can continue to do that. Looking ahead, the volume of opportunities will be fairly consistent from where it was in '17 and '18.

Mitchell Germain -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

Got you. And then any new players emerged? I mean, obviously, you've got some big retail focus funds or -- I don't even know if we want to call them non-traded REITs again. But that's sort of a product is certainly reemerging again. Is that -- is the competitive environment changed in any way, shape or form?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Look, similar to my answer to Craig's question, the convenience and gas sector has definitely become more mainstream in terms of the retail, real estate landscape side. The competition, I think has been increasing over the last three to five years. And we decide where it is and we've been able to execute with more competition over the last several years.

Mitchell Germain -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

Did the tax reform made any shift to house some of the private owners are approaching some of the generational issues in terms of state planning and what not?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I think if you look at some of the industry data that's out there, there is a immense amount of real estate that's owned by these companies or by families who have built up their businesses over time. And a lot of the M&A activity or what we generally refer to as industry M&A activity is driven by succession or state planning and really, a family or small private business that's reached the end of their risk tolerance to continue to grow their business on their own balance sheet. And there are large acquirers out there, many of which we've partnered with, for seizing that opportunity to grow their business and expand, either within their region or nationally as a result of a family that's sort of looking to monetize or transition out of the business.

Mitchell Germain -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

Thank you.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Welcome.

We'll take our next question from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

Good morning.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Hey, John.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

So, what's sort of kind of the decline in properties leased from third-party landlords? It came down by about three. If I think about the owned ones, it kind of makes sense based on what you bought when you sold. But was that movement, maybe some landlords taking those properties back or maybe transfer of those into you guys having full ownership of them?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. So, I'll answer the question in a few different ways, right? So, there are certain leased properties, right, that we have acquired over time, where we want to eventually own the real estate and we're able to come to an agreement with our landlords.

The flip side to that is, there is a number of leases where we're coming to the end of our term and either, we were not able to buy the property or we chose not to renew the lease for economic reasons and we let the lease expire. That's really -- those are the two moving pieces with the lease portfolio.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

In -- how many of those lease properties are coming to that kind of decision in the next, maybe one to two years?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. The schedule is in the 10-K. We'll need to pull it up here. Sorry.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

No, if it isn't there (ph), I can --

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We have 74 leases. There are seven, which we expect to -- which come up for expiration in 2019.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

Okay.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

It's a steady stream of properties for you there. But the initial term is coming due, and why they want to buy the property, in certain cases, we'll look to extend the lease, if we have a long-term tenant up there and in other cases, we'll exit the leases.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

Okay. And then maybe switching to the acquisition front again. There has been a lot of talk of operator transaction activity up in Canada. Is that a place where you guys feel you can invest and will be willing to invest?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We've looked at Canada a little bit over the years. I think our focus really is on the US, and we think there is ample opportunity for us to continue to do acquisitions within the 50 states.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

And then, one kind of clarifying point on guidance. Is it correct in kind of the way you were describing it that you're assuming costs of pursuing the transactions this year, but no NOI from closing any transactions?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So the reference that Danion made to those costs, that's really a cost that we expect to incur with respect to the developments, right? And certain costs that are expensed as part of our development projects and then certain deal-related costs, again, for development.

We have not traditionally included acquisitions as part of our guidance. Obviously, to the extent we are successful throughout the year, we'll update the guidance and that will reflect any additional costs coming from those acquisitions.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

That makes sense. That's it for me. Thank you very much.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Operator

At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to our management for any additional or closing remarks.

196,Empty,2019-03-02T05:33:38Z,"“If it turns out that there is a God … the worst that you can say about him is that basically he’s an underachiever.”—Woody Allen If you go into a Reform or Conservative temple, it’s likely that you will notice two things: The congregation is becoming smaller…","“If it turns out that there is a God … the worst that you can say about him is that basically he’s an underachiever.”—Woody Allen

If you go into a Reform or Conservative temple, it’s likely that you will notice two things: The congregation is becoming smaller and older. Across the United States and Europe, Jewish congregations are aging at a rapid rate, a phenomenon increasingly common for mainstream religions across the high-income world.

Overall, the American Jewish population—unlike that of demographically robust Israel—is on the decline, with a loss of 300,000 members over the past decade, a number expected to drop further by 2050. The median age of members of Reform congregations is 54, and only 17 percent of members say they attend religious services even once a month. Four-fifths of the movement’s youth are gone by the time they graduate high school. The conservative movement is, if anything, in even worse shape: At its height, in 1965, the Conservative movement had 800 affiliated synagogues throughout the United States and Canada; by 2015 that number had fallen to 594.

But Jews, and their religious institutions, should not feel singled out. The share of Americans who belong to the Catholic Church has declined from 24 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in 2014, a more rapid decline according to Pew, then any other religious organization in memory. There are 6.5 former Catholics in the U.S. for every new convert to the faith, not a number suggesting a very sunny future.

The mainstream Protestant churches are not exactly filling the sanctuaries either. Some, like the internally conflicted Methodists have seen their number of North American congregants drop from 15 million in 1970 to barely half that today. Since 2007 alone, America’s mainstream churches have lost 5 million members, and even the once vibrant evangelical movement is losing adherents outside of the developing world. Ever more churches, particularly in urban areas, are being abandoned, turned into bars, restaurants, and luxury condos. And nothing augurs worse for the future than the fact that American millennials are leaving religious institutions at a rate four times that of their counterparts three decades ago; almost 40 percent of people 18 to 29 are not unaffiliated.

This decline is not necessarily a reflection of less spiritual feeling: Two-thirds of unaffiliated Americans still believe in God or a universal spirit. The Pew poll shows that since 2012, the share of Americans who describe themselves as “spiritual but not religious” has surged from 19 percent to 27 percent five years later.

Why, then, the decline in religion? For one thing, young Americans have different habits. Rather than join institutions, millennials, argued Wade Clark Roof, author of the book Spiritual Marketplace, are indulging in a kind of “grazing,” finding their spiritual fixes in various different places rather than any one organized church. As sociologists Robert Putnam and David Campbell explained, those in this age group “reject conventional religious affiliation, while not entirely giving up their religious feelings.”

But the consumption habits of the young aren’t the only reason for America’s religious drought. Religious institutions and ideas are currently under political attack, predominantly from the left, with some progressives, such as California’s Dianne Feinstein or New Jersey’s Cory Booker, appearing to see embrace of Christian dogma, or even membership in such anodyne organizations as the Knights of Columbus, as cause for exclusion from high judicial office.

This trend is reinforced by the media, which is often dismissive of traditional faith. There has been a powerful tendency to demonize and suggest the worst of motives among the faithful, which was evident in the rush to judgment about the alleged racism of the Covington, Kentucky, religious students. Before the facts proved claims of racism to be false, newspaper accounts and tweets from journalists endorsed actions against the students, sometime including violence, in ways more reminiscent of Joseph Goebbels than Joseph Pulitzer.

As in many cases, this bias reflects the groupthink nurtured at our leading universities. Evangelicals and religious conservatives barely exist in the country’s leading theological seminaries, where they are outnumbered, by some estimates, 70 to 1 by liberals, and evidence suggests that those espousing traditional religious views are widely discriminated against in academic departments.

In this difficult environment, many religious movements—Reform Judaism, mainstream Protestantism, and increasingly the Catholic Church under Pope Francis—have sought to redefine themselves largely as instruments of social justice. Although doing good deeds, or mitzvot, long has constituted a strong element in most religions, the primary motivation of the faith community traditionally focused on heritage, spirituality, and family. In their haste to be politically correct, even Catholic private schools such as Notre Dame are rushing to cover up murals of Columbus, and, in one California case, a private Catholic grammar school has gone as far as hiding statues of saints.

Yet rebranding themselves as progressive often brings religious activists into alliances with people who reject their core values. The Catholic left, for example, allying itself with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, implicitly embraces the advocates of the most extreme abortion liberalization. Sometimes, these linkages are ironic: Faith in Public Life, for example, a strident “religious” group advocating a progressive anti-Trump line, gets much of its funding from George Soros, arguably the world’s most well-heeled and active promoter of atheism.

For their part, progressive Jews, embracing the notion of tikkun olam, face a similar dilemma. In their rush to oppose President Trump, with his occasional despicable winks at alt-right groups, many Jewish activists have collaborated with the organizers of the Women’s March, including enthusiastic backers of the most influential anti-Semite of our time, Nation of Islam head Louis Farrakhan.

Deep blue cities and the progressive feeding lots of the academy—strongholds of progressivism—are precisely where support for such anti-Jewish measures as the BDS movement is strongest. Anti-Semitism is particularly rife not in conservative Southern schools but in progressive places like San Francisco State; in that city, the ultimate progressive stronghold, a leftist gay Jewish café owner recently has been subject to repeated protests for being a “Zionist gentrifier.”

This alliance with anti-Semites and those opposing the existence of the state of Israel pushes the limits of cognitive dissonance. Jews in the U.K. are confronted with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who defends not only anti-Zionist but also traditional anti-Semitic tropes. Recently progressive heartthrob Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, herself an adopter of anti-Israel memes about Gaza and other occupied areas, gushed over her recent “lovely and wide-reaching” conversation with Corbyn, the West’s most politically prominent Judeophobe.

Indeed, despite the impression left by some progressive Jews, the largest threat to Jews in America stems not from the isolated and pathetically small lunatic fringe of white supremacists. The most anti-Israel members of Congress, as well as on the local level, come primarily not from the right wing of the GOP but the burgeoning left wing of the Democratic Party. Democratic voters—as well as key constituencies like minorities and millennials—poll consistently less sympathetic to both Jews and Israel than older, generally white Republicans.

Is there a way back from this sorry state of affairs?

However satisfying to its practitioners, the emphasis on social justice is clearly not attracting more worshippers. Almost all the religious institutions most committed to this course are also in the most serious decline, most notably mainstream Protestants but also, Catholics and Reform and Conservative Jews. The rapidly declining Church of England, which is down to 2 percent share among British youth, is burnishing its progressive image by adding the use of plastics to its list of Lenten sacrifices, but seems unable to serve the basic spiritual and family needs of their congregants.

In contrast, more conservative faith organizations generally enjoy better growth, and higher birthrates, particularly in the developing world . The University of London’s Eric Kaufmann explains in his important book Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth? that if current trends continue, the more fundamentalist family-centered faiths seem most likely to survive. Already, for example, Orthodox Jews, historically a small subgroup, are projected to become the majority of the Hebraic community in Britain by 2100, and already constitute some three-fifths of Jewish children in New York.

Orthodox Jews and evangelicals may be finding common ground, then, but the future of religion overall does not seem a bright one. It’s hard to imagine most young Jews becoming Orthodox, or casual Christians embracing en masse Mormonism or evangelical Christianity. Instead, the future seems to point to a smaller, more conservative religious community, isolated amidst an increasingly secularized culture.

To survive, less traditionalist faiths need less “virtue signaling” and more emphasis on serving the needs of congregants. Marshall Toplansky, who advises Church World Services, a major Protestant aid group, suggested that groups like Mormons and evangelicals who focus on providing services for families and their local communities fare far better than those more tied to strictly a social gospel. Toplansky said that many mainstream churches “have overlooked the value of building grassroots relationships with their donors,” who sometimes do not share the progressive ideology of the clerical class. Without engaging the faithful and addressing their needs, he noted, “people stop identifying with their local institution and stop participating in the local activities that defined them to begin with.”

Catholicism, now under a reforming and politically progressive pope, faces a similar challenge. It is losing adherents, not only in North America and Europe, where his views are popular, but also his homeland of South America, where the church is steadily losing out to more conservative evangelical churches. Until the 1960s, at least 90 percent of Latin America’s population was Catholic, but that number has fallen to under 70 percent. Today, roughly 1 in 4 Nicaraguans, 1 in 5 Brazilians and 1 in 7 Venezuelans are former Catholics. The one place where the church is growing most, Africa, is dominated by conservative bishops often at odds with Francis.

Anthony Lemus, an influential lay Catholic, believes the church’s future relies on remaining true to its principles while refashioning its message to serve its adherents’ worldly, as well as spiritual, needs. An astrophysicist brought up in a deeply Catholic East Los Angeles household, Lemus is working with a prominent Catholic theologian, Rev. Robert Spitzer, on rewriting of the Catholic Catechism to make the faith more accessible to the new generation. He also supports efforts to improve services from the church—day care, athletic clubs, camps—that might attract young families back to the faith.

“Today’s generation is more in tune with value-add products and services influencing their lives immediately, and the relevance of faith competes with these promotions,” he said. “A ‘sticky’ rebranding of the importance of faith formation’s value in everyday life is key to reposition its importance for living a holistic life.”

Ultimately, as Lemus suggested, religions, including Judaism, can only hope to thrive if they serve a purpose that is not met elsewhere in society. It is all well and good to perform good deeds, but if religions do not make themselves indispensable to families, their future could be bleak. As we already see in Europe, churches and synagogues could become ever more like pagan temples, vestiges of the past and attractions for the curious, profoundly clueless about the passion and commitment that created them.

197,Empty,2019-02-26T14:35:00Z,"The British prime minister has outlined a plan for parliamentary votes on her Brexit deal with the EU, a ""no deal"" or an extension to the date for leaving the EU. But another key motion is also on the agenda this week.","British Prime Minister Theresa May announced a series of parliamentary votes on Tuesday that will let lawmakers decide on whether or not to leave the European Union on March 29 as planned — or to postpone the date.

The move comes after weeks of mounting political pressure on May, whose initial withdrawal agreement with the EU was overwhelmingly rejected by Parliament in January.

What will be voted on?

The first vote in the House of Commons will take place no later than March 12 when lawmakers will decide whether or not to accept May's divorce agreement with the EU. The deal would include any amendments that she has been able to agree with Brussels since January.

Should lawmakers reject the deal again, another vote will take place on March 13. This time, MPs will vote on whether or not to leave the EU without a deal.

If MPs reject a ""no-deal"" Brexit, a third vote will be held on March 14 on asking the EU to temporarily extend Article 50. If EU leaders approve, Brexit will be delayed and both sides will have extra time to negotiate a final deal.

Clock ticking

May told lawmakers that she still intends to lead Britain out of the EU at the end of March with a deal.

""Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article 50 extended. Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on March 29,"" she said, later adding: ""An extension cannot take 'no deal' off the table.""

The prime minister added that any extension, which she says would not extend beyond the end of June, would be a one-off and that her government was committed to following through on honoring the results of the 2016 referendum that saw 51.9 percent of voters back leaving the EU while 48.1 percent voted to remain.

May's announcement comes after the opposition Labour Party shifted its Brexit policy towards supporting a second referendum.

Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn accused May of ""continuing to run down the clock,"" saying that the ongoing spat is intensifying uncertainty for business.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe June 2016: 'The will of the British people' After a shrill referendum campaign, nearly 52 percent of British voters opted to leave the EU on June 24. Polls had shown a close race before the vote with a slight lead for those favoring remaining in the EU. Conservative British Prime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned for Britain to stay, acknowledged the ""will of the British people"" and resigned the following morning.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe July 2016: 'Brexit means Brexit' Former Home Secretary Theresa May replaced David Cameron as prime minister on July 11 and promised the country that ""Brexit means Brexit."" May had quietly supported the Remain campaign before the referendum. She did not initially say when her government would trigger Article 50 of the EU treaty to start the two-year talks leading to Britain's formal exit.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe March 2017: 'We already miss you' May eventually signed a diplomatic letter over six months later on March 29, 2017 to trigger Article 50. Hours later, Britain's ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow, handed the note to European Council President Donald Tusk. Britain's exit was officially set for March 29, 2019. Tusk ended his brief statement on the decision with: ""We already miss you. Thank you and goodbye.""

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe June 2017: And they're off! British Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, kicked off talks in Brussels on June 19. The first round ended with Britain reluctantly agreeing to follow the EU's timeline for the rest of the negotiations. The timeline split talks into two phases. The first would settle the terms of Britain's exit, and the second the terms of the EU-UK relationship post-Brexit.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe July-October 2017: Money, rights and Ireland The second round of talks in mid-July began with an unflattering photo of a seemingly unprepared British team. It and subsequent rounds ended with little progress on three phase one issues: How much Britain still needed to pay into the EU budget after it leaves, the post-Brexit rights of EU and British citizens and whether Britain could keep an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe December 2017: Go-ahead for phase 2 Leaders of the remaining 27 EU members formally agreed that ""sufficient progress"" had been made to move on to phase two issues: the post-Brexit transition period and the future UK-EU trading relationship. While Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her delight at the decision, European Council President Tusk ominously warned that the second stage of talks would be ""dramatically difficult.""

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe July 2018: Johnson, Davis resign British ministers appeared to back a Brexit plan at May's Chequers residence on July 6. The proposal would have kept Britain in a ""combined customs territory"" with the EU and signed up to a ""common rulebook"" on all goods. That went too far for British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned a few days later. May replaced them with Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe September 2018: No cherries for Britain May's Chequers proposal did not go down well with EU leaders, who told her at a summit in Salzburg in late September that it was unacceptable. EU Council President Tusk trolled May on Instagram, captioning a picture of himself and May looking at cakes with the line: ""A piece of cake perhaps? Sorry, no cherries."" The gag echoed previous EU accusations of British cherry-picking.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe November 2018: Breakthrough in Brussels EU leaders endorsed a 585-page draft divorce deal and political declaration on post-Brexit ties in late November. The draft had been widely condemned by pro- and anti-Brexit lawmakers in the British Parliament only weeks earlier. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned along with several other ministers, and dozens of Conservative Party members tried to trigger a no-confidence vote in May.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe December 2018: May survives rebellion In the face of unrelenting opposition, May postponed a parliamentary vote on the deal on December 10. The next day, she met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to seek reassurances that would, she hoped, be enough to convince skeptical lawmakers to back the deal. But while she was away, hard-line Conservative lawmakers triggered a no-confidence vote. May won the vote a day later.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe January 2019: Agreement voted down The UK Parliament voted 432 to 202 against May's Brexit deal on January 16. In response to the result, European Council President Donald Tusk suggested the only solution was for the UK to stay in the EU. Meanwhile, Britain's Labour Party called for a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, her second leadership challenge in as many months.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe March 2019: Second defeat for May's deal May tried to get legal changes to the deal's so-called Irish backstop in the weeks that followed. She eventually got assurances that the UK could suspend the backstop under certain circumstances. But on March 12, Parliament voted against the revised Brexit deal by 391 to 242. EU leaders warned the vote increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Two days later, MPs voted to delay Brexit.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe March 2019: Extension after second defeat The EU agreed to minor additions to the Irish backstop, but it wasn't enough. On March 12, Parliament voted again against the revised Brexit deal. After MPs voted to delay Brexit, EU leaders gave May two options: delay Brexit until May 22 if MPs vote for the withdrawal deal or delay it until April 12 if they vote against the deal. If the deal fails, May could ask for a long extension. Author: Alexander Pearson



Key votes still to come this week

It remains to be seen whether May's move to offer parliamentary votes will win over hardliners within her Conservatives.

The House of Commons is due to vote on several Brexit-related amendments, which could possibly bypass May's proposed votes if they are approved.

Several of the amendments would force the government to set a new Brexit date if May fails to secure her deal by March 13.

The Labour Party will also table an amendment that pushes for the adoption of its Brexit proposals, including creating a permanent customs union with the EU. Corbyn has said that if the Labour measure doesn't pass, his party would then put forward an amendment that would call for a second referendum.

This septic isle It never rains A delay by UK Prime Minister Theresa May to allow Parliament to vote on her Brexit deal has increased the chances Britain will leave the bloc without a deal in March. The odds on a no-deal Brexit have shortened to 2/1, according to oddschecker.com, while Steve Eisman, the trader whose prediction of the 2008 crisis was dramatized in the film The Big Short, is betting against UK banks.

This septic isle Money where your mouth is The IMF says that while some sectors like agriculture and mining might benefit, the majority of sectors would shrink by between about 1 percent and 33 percent. The Bank of England said no-deal would wipe between 4.75 percent and 7.75 percent off what the UK would have produced by 2024 and the pound would fall by 25 percent.

This septic isle Not waving, but drowning The EU has said the UK would have ""third country"" status under a no-deal scenario, giving it the same status as China, Russia and Pakistan. All goods crossing EU borders would be subject to tariffs of up to 38 percent. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said additional paperwork attached to trading under WTO rules would act as an extra tariff of up to an average of 6.5 percent.

This septic isle Love's labor lost Britain’s farmers and manufacturers face the largest shortage of skilled workers since 1989 due to a fall in the numbers of EU27 nationals coming to work since the Brexit vote. A no deal would likely accelerate that process.

This septic isle A road to nowhere The financial industry and British regulators say a hard Brexit poses a threat to trillions of euros worth of derivative and insurance contracts London could lose up to to €800 billion to Frankfurt, lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance has said. Some 30 banks and financial firms have already chosen the city as the site of their new EU headquarters, with others opting for Dublin or Paris.

This septic isle Movers and shakers left in limbo No-deal would have significant implications for people's ability to go where they want. A €7 charge for visiting the EU's Schengen Area would kick in in 2021, after the UK's transition period ends. British expats would face uncertainty, as many foreign governments have not yet established their rules for residency under no-deal.

This septic isle Can't beat a good queue The UK Road Haulage Association has said a lack of planning over no-deal would mean the manufacturing sector would be put under ""severe pressure"" and hauliers would go out of business. European airports have warned that no-deal would cause ""major disruption and heightened safety risks"" to the air network. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has warned planes could be grounded.

This septic isle All in it together The biggest impact of no deal could be felt in Ireland, which exports 12 percent of its goods and 40 percent of its food to the UK, and two-thirds of its other exports travel through the UK. The IMF believes the Netherlands, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Belgium also face taking moderate hits to their economies of between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent.

This septic isle Where there is harmony, May brings discord The Police Federation has said it was worried about ""widescale disruption and dangers for the general public."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said 3,500 troops are on standby to cope with the fallout of no deal. The government is preparing for potential shortages of key items in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. But May refused to guarantee the health service (NHS) would have enough medicines.

This septic isle Christmas-voting turkeys play chicken in Ireland The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would remain unresolved with no deal. The main sticking point has been the Irish 'backstop' — the insurance scheme for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. One solution has been a Canada-style agreement that would remove most EU restrictions but would not abolish the need for a hard border. But uncertainty breeds fear. Author: Jo Harper

198,Empty,2019-03-01T13:50:30Z,"Ten weeks into the administration of progressive president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), the Mexican right has made it clear how it plans to oppose him: not as an adversary to be defeated, but as an enemy to be destroyed. … The post The War on AMLO: US …","Ten weeks into the administration of progressive president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), the Mexican right has made it clear how it plans to oppose him: not as an adversary to be defeated, but as an enemy to be destroyed. And in a war of this kind, as the Spanish saying goes, Todo vale. Anything goes.

The first of the false furors flared up even before AMLO took office, when former presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón – both from the conservative National Action Party (PAN) – criticized his decision to invite Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to his inauguration, setting off a tempest-in-a-teapot firestorm within the nation’s corporate media. Inviting foreign heads of state to an inauguration, of course, is part and parcel of diplomatic protocol, something both Fox and Calderón had adhered to when inviting then-president Hugo Chávez to their respective ceremonies.

But hypocrisy was no object when it came to the PAN’s attempts to tie AMLO to the Bolivarian Revolution, an obsession that dated to the party’s shadowy attack ads in the 2006 election and repeated faithfully through last year’s campaign. When, during his inaugural speech in Congress, AMLO read out Maduro’s name among a list of the foreign leaders in attendance, deputies from the PAN leapt up on cue and, with cries of “Dictator!,” ran to the front of the chamber to unfurl a banner condemning the Venezuelan head of state (a stunt strangely not repeated for the president of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel).

First Steps

AMLO’s first major initiative as president was to reduce the bloated salaries of the top federal bureaucracy, fulfilling a key campaign pledge; the Maximum Salaries Law, in fact, was the first to be passed by the MORENA Congressional majority when it took office in September of 2018. But opposition parties quickly challenged the law’s constitutionality, arguing that it violated the separation of powers.

Source: The Bullet

It was a strange argument to make, especially in light of the fact that Article 127 of the Mexican Constitution expressly stipulates that no public servant can earn more than the president; the law, in fact, was designed to enshrine the constitutional provision in secondary legislation. No matter. The leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the Senate, Osorio Chong, fustigated against “a climate of lynching” against the judicial branch “propitiated by the government and its party,” going so far as to claim that the measure would encourage not only the removal of judges and magistrates but aggression against them.

The judges themselves then got into the swing of things, beating their breasts in a public display of inconformity that led some observers to wonder why they hadn’t bothered to protest in the same way the abuses of power, disappearances, and violence that led to some 267,000 homicides over the last two administrations.

The attempt to portray the judiciary as the victims was audacious, to say the least. Federal judges are among the highest paid members of the federal bureaucracy, with the eleven members of the Supreme Court – which proceeded to place a temporary stay on the Maximum Salaries Law – earning upwards of 600,000 pesos ($31,470 US) per month, including benefits, several times more than the president and more than the average Mexican makes in eight years (the justices have since agreed to reduce their base salary by 25 per cent for 2019).

But such was the fever to portray AMLO as an authoritarian dictator-in-waiting – and such was the president’s political acumen in choosing an initial battle that commanded near-unanimous popular support, forcing his knee-jerk opposition into a neat trap – that it was willing to defend the indefensible when the wisest course, seemingly, would have been to pick a smarter battle. But in a war of attrition, losing battles is part of the strategy. The key is to attack, always attack.

#AMLOAsesino

The day before Christmas, three weeks into the president’s term, a tragic accident gave the Mexican right another chance to strike. Ten minutes after taking off, the helicopter carrying the governor of the State of Puebla, Martha Erika Alonso, and her husband, former governor Rafael Moreno Valle, both from the PAN, crashed into a cornfield in the town of Santa María de Coronango, killing everyone on board.

The accident occurred just ten days after Alonso had belatedly taken the oath of office after defeating the MORENA candidate, Miguel Barbosa, in a judicially contested July election which, according to a study by the Iberoamerican University, contained “multiple and grave inconsistencies” that called into question the results.

Within hours, the hashtag #AMLOAsesino (AMLO Assassin) had become a national trending topic, which it was to remain for several hours. Closer investigation, however, revealed that, far from being a spontaneous outpouring of citizen internauts blaming AMLO for the accident, a deliberate campaign of defamation was at work.

According to an analysis performed by the news site Sinembargo.mx , the trend benefited from “artificial and coordinated support” by a series of anti-AMLO bots.

“The way in which the clusters gathered around the #AMLOAsesino trend showed that they did not arise from an organic dialogue in which users with distinct profiles converge and contribute different points of view,” stated author Ivonne Ojeda de la Torre.

She continued:

“The farm of recently created accounts that participated in the trend from the first moments after its appearance contributed to positioning [it] through simultaneous retweets and spam, distinguishing it from the organic dialogue that resulted from the tragedy … The tweets were published constantly, but without generating discussion, behavior that is characteristic of artificially amplified trends.”

The following day, De la Torre published a second analysis showing how, since 2011, the PRI has generated an army of bot accounts to create and promote trends, spread fake news, attack opponents, and buy votes, using money of doubtful origin that, unlike traditional campaign spending, is much harder to trace. In the days following the accident, moreover, residents of Puebla began receiving robocalls with a supposed survey asking whether the cause of the crash was “mechanical error” or a planned “attack.” The goal, clearly, in the absence of any evidence whatsoever, was to sow doubts through innuendo and insinuation.

In a very overt accompaniment to this covert activity, former presidents Fox and Calderón again leapt into the fray to fan the flames in the most irresponsible of possible ways.

“We demand an explanation!” Fox wailed in a tweet. “It is hard to accept this coincidence after such a stiff democratic battle for Puebla.”

Calderón was only slightly more discreet, calling for “an impartial investigation into the causes of the accident.”

So feverish did the cyber-conspiracy theorizing become that AMLO, at his morning press conference on December 26, used unusually strong language to shut down the speculation.

“There’s been an environment created by the same conservatives as always,” he stated in response to a question about the accusations. “Not all, but a mean-spirited minority … These are neo-fascist groups that are very upset by the triumph of our movement and are trying to affect us, to stain us. They won’t succeed.”

Turning the Screws

On the foreign-relations front, there are also signs that the United States is beginning to turn its screws on AMLO. Although the Trump administration has systematically vilified Mexicans for years, his language regarding its new government has been surprisingly measured. Venezuela may have changed that.

On January 4, Mexico refused to sign the “Lima Accord” calling on Nicolás Maduro to stand down from his second presidential term, slated to begin on January 9. The accord was a product of the Lima Group, comprised of Canada and a dozen right-wing Latin American governments, whose purpose has been to provide soft cover for the United States by pushing for regime change in Venezuela. Even though Mexico is a part of the group, thanks to the previous Peña Nieto government, Deputy Foreign Minister Maximiliano Reyes declared in a statement:

“We call for reflection in the Lima Group about the consequences for Venezuelans of measures that seek to interfere in internal affairs.”

When, on January 23, the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly Juan Guaidó declared himself “interim president,” Mexico reiterated its position, citing Article 89 of the Mexican Constitution which mandates non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

“It’s not that we’re in favor or against. We’re following through with our institutional principles,” AMLO said in his daily news conference on January 24th.

In doing so, he was effectively resurrecting the Estrada Doctrine, which formed the basis of the nation’s independent foreign policy in the mid-twentieth century, even during the height of the Cold War. Named after Foreign Secretary Genaro Estrada (1930-32), the doctrine calls on Mexico to back the peaceful settlement of conflicts and neither support nor reject foreign governments or governments-in-transition, since to do so would be to violate state sovereignty. On January 25, Mexico offered to mediate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, in conjunction with Uruguay. Two weeks later, at the meeting of the International Contact Group in Montevideo, Mexico, Bolivia, and the Caribbean Community (Caricom) bucked the majority of attendees by refusing to sign the call for new elections in Venezuela.

The Mexican right, of course, fell over itself to attack the government’s position. On the same day as Guaidó’s self-proclamation, the PAN debuted a similarly self-proclaimed foreign policy by rushing to recognize him. Columnist Leo Zuckermann at the newspaper Excelsior declared AMLO to be “on the wrong side of history.” With slightly more nuance, analyst Carlos Bravo Regidor tweeted:

“The terms ‘non-intervention’ and ‘neutrality’ do not serve to explain the position of the Mexican foreign ministry regarding the Venezuelan crisis. To prefer mediation is to seek to intervene to defuse the situation; to promote negotiation in search of a political settlement is not to remain neutral.”

On January 29, American secretary of state Mike Pompeo cancelled a planned trip to Mexico to discuss the issue of Central American migrants traveling through the country to the US border. Although no explicit reason was offered for the cancellation, it came amid mounting controversy over Mexico’s position on Venezuela.

On the same day, the Wall Street rating agency Fitch downgraded the credit rating of the state oil company Petroleros Mexicanos (PEMEX) an entire point from BBB+ to BBB-, citing “unfunded pension requirements, negative equity and exposure to political interference risk.” The downgrade, which places PEMEX’s bonds just above junk status, will make it much more expensive for the company to borrow funds to upgrade its operations, neatly cancelling out the cost-cutting savings AMLO has sought to carry out. As PEMEX continues to contribute nearly a fifth of government revenues, even after being bled by a major privatization effort by former president Peña Nieto, this may also wind up squeezing the government’s ability to deliver on its social-spending promises.

At his daily press conference the next day, AMLO ridiculed both the decision and its timing:

“What these organizations do is very hypocritical … They allowed the looting [of Pemex], they endorsed the so-called energy reform, they knew that foreign investment didn’t arrive, investment in PEMEX didn’t increase and that was what caused the decline in petroleum production. And they never said anything.” He added, “They maintained a complicit silence and now that we’re rescuing PEMEX, they come out with their recommendations and … ratings.”

As if anticipating this changing mood, Time Magazine – ever a faithful mouthpiece of empire – plopped Mexico into its top-ten list of “biggest geopolitical risks of 2019.” In the words of editor-at-large Ian Bremmer, AMLO’s “bid to roll back the opening of Mexico’s economy, orthodox macroeconomic policies, privatizations, and deregulation threaten a return to the 1960s. In 2019, he’ll spend money Mexico doesn’t have on problems like poverty and security that resist straightforward solutions. And as he centralizes power, policymaking will become more erratic.”

The choice of decade is curious, as Mexican growth rates in the 1960s averaged some 6.5 per cent per year, three times higher than the neoliberal era inaugurated in 1982. Curious, as well, that his concerns do not extend to the case of Latin America’s other newly inaugurated president, Jair Bolsonaro. As Bremmer breezily concludes,

“the public, the media, and Brazil’s political institutions won’t allow space for any dangerous centralization of power.”

Avoiding Erosion

For now, AMLO’s position appears stable: latest polls give him a staggering 86 per cent approval rating, economic indicators are solid, and the machinations of the Mexican right – especially in light of the abject failures of recent conservative administrations – appear both overwrought and sophomoric. But as the screws continue to tighten, a number of options could be mobilized down the road, such as a combined media, diplomatic, and economic campaign to weaken, discredit, and isolate AMLO, one that brings together the domestic and international actors analyzed here.

Delegitimation, after all, is a gradual process of erosion, and when it comes to progressive governments, with their reduced margin for error, missteps that in themselves seem minor can prove fatal. It is imperative, then, that the radicalized political base that elected AMLO does not allow itself to become lulled into complacency by the false belief that winning office is the same as conquering power.

Thank you for your patience. With that, and it's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host. Nexstar, Chairman, President and CEO Perry Sook. Perry?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Tom Carter, our Chief Financial Officer and me today to review Nexstar's record financial performance and our outlook for 2018-2019. With our record fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results, the December announcement of the Tribune Media transaction and our immediate work on the regulatory approval process and the development of our post closing plans, it's been an active and productive time here at Nexstar.

We believe what we've accomplished since the closing of the Media General transaction, is an important guide for what we will achieve as we move toward the closing of the Tribune transaction expected later this year. Nexstar had an outstanding 2018, our strong fourth quarter and full-year operating results mark our seventh consecutive year of record financial performance with all of our key metrics from net revenue to free cash flow growing at double-digit rates and coming in at the highest levels in the Company's history for both the three and the 12-month periods.

The 22.1% rise in fourth quarter net revenue and nearly 100% increase in operating income highlight the ongoing value of our strategies focused on leveraging our local content and community involvement, that generate record shares of political spending in our markets, as well as continued distribution and digital revenue growth. Our ability to capture historic levels of mid-term election spending in our markets combined with the strong operating leverage in our business model drove our record fourth quarter -- a record fourth quarter BCF adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.

For the full year, our enterprisewide focus on managing operations for current and future cash flow enabled us to generate free cash flow of $692.7 million or about $15.20 per share, representing approximately 30% -- 31% growth over 2017 levels. By comparison, if you look back at the 2016 presidential election year and prior to the completion of the Media General transaction, Nexstar generated approximately $7.97 in free cash flow per share, so in just two years, we've grown that important metric by approximately 91%.

In 2018, we brought about $0.25 of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line, allowing us to invest in our people, our local media platform and our complementary accretive acquisitions, while at the same time reducing net debt by approximately $400 million and returning over $120 million to shareholders, in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

I'll do a quick review of the quarterly highlights and then review some of the transaction initiatives under way, after which, Tom will go through the financials, including an update on our cap structure, 2019 expectations and other items of interest to those of you on the call.

Again, Nexstar's record fourth quarter financial results highlight our ability to maximize the political revenue opportunity in our markets as we continue to build new to television ad revenue and grow retransmission consent revenue, also combined with the ongoing benefits of our management and operating disciplines. 22.1% rise in fourth quarter net revenue resulted in BCF growth at 57%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 57.3% and free cash flow growth of 62.1%.

In total, Nexstar's fourth quarter core local and national television ad revenue were down little over 1% at $4.7 million down, that's all related to our heavy allocation of inventory to political as we booked over $140 million in political in Q4, were $127 million more than 2017. As expected, local, national ad revenue strengthened as we move through Q4 and they remain up on a year-over-year basis in the 2019 period-to-date.

November and December were the strongest months of 2018 for core advertising revenue, when excluding February, which benefited from the Super Bowl and Olympic-related spending in Q4 of '18, we generated increased ad revenue in three of our top five categories and five of our top ten overall. Core revenue continues to reflect healthy levels of new business with Q4 new to television ad revenue of $16.3 million, which is a 15.6% rise over the prior year. Reflecting our expanded platform and presence in states with contested elections, we generated solid results in the political ad category in markets like Las Vegas, Tampa, Portland and Grand Rapids, to name a few, with a diversified mix from the house, the gubernatorial and senate candidates, as well as healthy contributions from PAC and issue spending.

Nexstar's fourth quarter television ad revenue growth was complemented by the combined fourth quarter retransmission and digital media revenue growth up 10.5% to a combined total of $349.6 million in the fourth quarter and we grew 13.1% to $1.4 billion for the full year, marking the first time in the Company's history that this combined distribution and digital metric has exceeded total television advertising revenue on an annual basis.

Overall, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter and full year non-television advertising revenue reflects renewals of distribution agreements with MVPDs and initial contributions from distribution agreements with OTT providers and the early '18 accretive acquisition of LKQD, as well as organic growth across our profitable digital operations.

Reflecting the ongoing benefits of our revenue diversification strategies and considering the magnitude of the Q4 '18 political revenue, total fourth quarter retransmission fee and digital media revenue represented 43.8% of our fourth quarter net revenue, compared to 40.7% of total net revenue in 2016. The last even year political quarter. At $284.5 million in the quarter retransmission fee revenue reached the highest ever level for quarter in the Company's history, and we expect our long-term distribution revenue growth to continue at a double-digit pace.

We continue to see consistency in pay television subscriber levels in our markets with now meaningful growth in OTT subs for which we are beginning to be compensated. With the renewal of retransmission consent agreements, representing approximately 10% of our subscriber base in 2018 and approximately 70% in 2019, continued revenue growth from this source remains highly visible for 2019 and beyond. And given the after acquired clauses in our retransmission consent agreements, once we complete the transaction, the Tribune stations are immediate party to our distribution agreements and our rates.

On Tribune with our long-term strategic focus on completing accretive transactions to enhance our overall competitive position, we were delighted to announce in December, our definitive agreement to acquire Tribune were $6.4 billion in an accretive all-cash transaction. Upon closing, Nexstar will be the largest local television group in the United States, and one of the nation's leading providers of local news, entertainment, sports, lifestyle and network programming across all devices. Importantly, we've approached this transaction, just as we did when we acquired Media General. Namely, we've identified and plan to divest of certain television stations necessary to obtain FCC and other regulatory approvals, which we believe will allow us to close the transaction sometime in the third quarter of 2019.

This transaction highlights Nexstar's role as the industry's leading consolidator and represents the culmination of over a year-and-a-half of work. The proposed transaction is a strategically and financially compelling growth opportunity that further expands our geographic diversity and our audience reach.

With 216 combined post divestiture television stations and 118 markets, and rapidly growing digital media operations, Nexstar will offer superior and great engagement across all devices and influence on consumers' purchasing decisions that will be unrivaled by other media, including now large scale digital companies. Pro-forma for the completion of the transaction, we will serve 15 of the nation's top 25 markets and 34 of the top 50 markets and by adding Tribune, we will increase our audience reach by approximately 50% from 26% to 39% of U.S. television households, reflecting the FCC's UHF discount and that audience reach is pro forma for the anticipated divestitures. Pro-forma for the completion of the transaction, Nexstar will generate approximately $900 million in average annual free cash flow pro forma for the 2018-2019 cycle.

That anticipated 46% free cash flow accretion afforded by the transaction relative to our last guide of $615 million for the average annual free cash flow in 2018-2019, clearly surpasses our stated criteria of evaluating strategic growth opportunities against the opportunity to repurchase our own shares. Upon closing, we intend to allocate our free cash flow to rapid leverage reduction as well as the increased return of capital to shareholders and allow us to make additional investments in our business to improve our service to viewers and advertisers.

Notably, we expect our net leverage ratio to approximately 5.3 times at the closing of the transaction and to decline to approximately 4 times by the end of 2020. In fact in the slightly more than two years, since we closed Media General. We have, as expected, reduced our opening leverage from 5.5 times at the closing of the transaction to 3.69 times at 2018 year-end.

So our vigilance with respect to managing leverage is obviously well documented. As with our past acquisitions, we developed a comprehensive regulatory compliance plan for required station divestitures and a detailed integration plan that will result in significant synergy realization. Nexstar has committed financing for the transaction and has made all required FCC and other regulatory applications and as you've likely read in the press, Nexstar and Tribune are actively engaged in the process of reviewing our planned divestiture stations with respective purchasers.

We've also embarked on a battery of station due diligence visits with more to come even this week and based on these meetings, our corporate management team and our executive team are refining our strategic plans for each station and business unit to ensure they operate with Nexstar's proven disciplines and adopt and implement best practices enterprise wide post closing.

The common core principles underlying the Tribune transaction and the Media General deals completed in -- the Media General deal, which we completed in January '17 is that they both represent further steps along our path of growing our local marketing and content platform and free cash flow through accretive acquisitions. Our growth has been rapid, yet measured in each of our transactions and while we've met or exceeded our synergy targets we've also improved operations and margins significantly and we've reduced the purchase multiple to what we acquired going in.

Importantly, with our track record of significant post transaction synergy realization and the organic growth in front of us including significant upcoming distribution renewals, as well as the 2020 presidential election and the continued growth of our digital platform, Nexstar will be posed for rapid leverage reduction and increased capital returns for shareholders, and will be one of the nation's preeminent local and national brand builders.

Nexstar will offer brands and advertisers a deep and truly diversified local marketing and content platform allowing us compete even more aggressively in the dynamic and rapidly converging advertising markets. And as an industry leader with a portfolio of premier stations and digital assets, a strong balance sheet and attractive weighted average cost of capital and significant free cash flow and free cash flow growth, we are also extremely well positioned to continue to build value for our shareholders.

In January, we announced a 20% increase in the amount of our quarterly cash dividend marking our sixth annual consecutive rise in our cash dividend. With the annual dividend rate now at $1.80 per share, approximately 45.6 million Nexstar Media Group shareholders and our $900 million of pro forma average free annual cash flow in 2018-2019, we'll be in a sweet spot for deleveraging, as well as other shareholder-friendly initiatives as I said.

With that, let me turn the call over to Tom Carter, who I'd like to acknowledge for his insights, his vision and his tireless efforts as we move toward the execution of our definitive agreements with Tribune, as well as the financing package. Tom?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Perry and good morning everybody. I'll start with a review of Nexstar's Q4 income statement and balance sheet data, after which I'll provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance. To start, as noted previously, effective 11 of 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue accounting guidance issued by FASB. As a result, beginning on 11 of '18, the Company presents local, national digital and political revenues net of their related agency commissions. This morning's release also provided the 2017 Q4 and year-to-date, local, national and political revenue comps adjusted to net out the sales commissions. In addition, we no longer recognize barter revenue and barter expense related to the exchange of advertising time for certain program materials.

These changes don't impact the Company's past or future income from operations, net income, BCF, adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow. Also effective at the beginning of 2018, the Company adopted an accounting standards update, which requires pension and other post retirement plans cost or credit other than service cost to be presented outside of income from operations. Thus the income from operations during the 3 and 12 months ended 12/31/2018 was decreased by a pension I'm sorry, 12/31/2017 was decreased by a pension and other post retirement credit of $4.2 million and $13.1 million respectively. And I'm pleased to say that's the last time I'll have to remind everyone of those accounting changes.

Now turning to the Q4 income statement. Net revenues were $798 million, which was a 22% increase over the same fourth quarter -- over the same period the previous year, fourth quarter of 2017. Total television ad revenue, local, national, political was up almost 39% to $438 million with local revenue down 1.5% to $216 million and national revenue at $81.9 million, which was down 1.8%. Political revenue, as Perry mentioned, was a record high of $140.2 million for the fourth quarter, which is up over 1000% of the same period in 2017, and digital revenues were up approximately 3%.

Profitability metrics across the Board were records with broadcast cash flow of approximately $380 million, adjusted EBITDA before one-time expenses of $358 million and free cash flow before one-time expenses of approximately $255 million.

On a same-station basis, our results were very comparable to the 2017 -- 2018 reported results with net revenue up approximately 22% total television ad revenue on a same-station basis, up 38% local revenue on a same-station basis was down 2% as was national revenue and digital revenues were up 3%. Retransmission fee revenues on a same-station basis we're very much comparable to the actual reported results and were up 12%.

As Perry mentioned, we recorded net political revenue of $140 million in the quarter, which exceeded our net political guidance for the full year and to further emphasize the strength of the election spending in our markets during 2018 mid-terms, full year same station political ad revenue came in 50% higher than the comparable 2014 period and 38% higher than the 2016 presidential election cycle.

Fourth quarter non-television advertising revenue increased 10.5% including 12.3% in retransmission fee revenues and 3.3% in -- rise in digital revenues. While full-year digital revenues were up 15.2%, fourth quarter was impacted by timing issues related to the implementation of required updates of our technology platform to comply with GDPR and authorized dealer sellers -- digital seller specifications, as well as rebranding and consolidation of certain digital businesses to focus on profitability.

During the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $19.9 million and $20 million respectively relating to goodwill and intangible assets of our digital businesses, including the last of the goodwill writedowns from legacy Media General assets. Fourth quarter station direct operating expense,s net of trade expense, rose 5.5%, primarily reflecting the growth in broadcast ad sales, as well as budget increase in network affiliation expense and expenses from LKQD. Same station fixed expenses including programming expenses were down 1.3% year-over-year. The 7.9% rise in fourth quarter G&A expense primarily reflects higher variable costs relating to the higher political revenues and our previously disclosed reclassification of certain digital administrative expenses to corporate expense.

Nexstar's fourth quarter -- corporate expense was in line with our expectations at $29.5 million inclusive of $8.5 million in stock-based compensation and $5.5 million of one-time transaction cost relating to the Tribune merger. This was largely in line with our guidance for the fourth quarter recurring cash overhead exclusive of stock comp of approximately $18 million to $19 million.

Overall, our significant fourth quarter revenue growth combined with ongoing expense management resulted in substantial increases in fourth quarter BCF and adjusted EBITDA margins, which rose to 47.6% and 44.2% respectively. Looking ahead to the 2019 first quarter, we project recurring corporate overhead, while approximately $20 million inclusive of stock -- exclusive of stock comp and Tribune related transaction expenses. Non-cash compensation is projected to be approximately $7 million for the quarter and $37 million for the year, reflecting anticipated issuance of new equity incentive awards later this year.

Cash transaction expenses primarily severance and success oriented fees cannot be capitalized -- that cannot be capitalized or expected to be approximately $5 million to $7 million during the first quarter.

Turning to balance sheet, I'll review a couple of key items at 12/31/2018. Total net leverage at that date was 3.69 times, which compares to 4.23 at the end of Q3 and 5.07 at the end of fourth quarter -- Q4 of '17. Covenant first lien leverage was 2.11 versus a covenant of 4.25, which compares to 2.59 at the end of Q3 '18 and 3.20 at the end of Q4 '17.

Our outstanding debt associated with the balance sheet amounted first lien debt of $2.4 billion, comprised of the term loans, with a decrease from September 30th, reflecting an additional $167 million in payments on the term loans in Q4 with cash from operations.

Our three outstanding bond issues, the 6.125%, the 5.875% and 5.625%, remain outstanding in approximately $1.5 billion in total outstandings. Net debt at December 31, 2018, amounted to approximately $3.84 billion compared to $4.25 billion a year ago and $4.7 billion in January of '17, when we close the MEG transaction, thus we quickly reduced debt by approximately $850 million since the closing the Media General transaction through eight quarters of operation even as we've allocated capital to serve other shareholder enhancement initiatives.

As you'll see in the 10-K, which is expected to be filed this evening, subsequent to quarter end, we made additional principal payments of approximately $10 million and through the 13-month period ended January 31, 2019, $412 million in total debt repayments. We anticipate making additional principal payments on the senior facility over the next several months.

In line with Nexstar's focuses on actively managing our capital structure and cost of capital, we closed on the $2.7 billion repricing our outstanding senior secured term loan facilities early in 4Q. The new terms represent a 25-basis point interest rate reduction compared to the Company's prior senior secured term loans and revolving credit facilities, resulting in approximately a $7 million reduction in the Company's annual interest expense, increasing net income and free cash flow by approximately $5 million on an annualized basis.

As it relates to our funding of the pending acquisition of Tribune Media, we intend to be opportunistic in tapping the markets and have a $6.4 billion committed financing facility, initially provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, to fund the transactions cash consideration. Similar to our previous transaction, our intention is to have pro forma capital structure reflect a proper balance of fixed and floating debt and attractive weighted average cost of capital with prepayment and refinancing flexibility.

At closing, which is anticipated in 3Q of 2019, we expect our net leverage to be approximately 5.3 times on an L8QA adjusted EBITDA basis after giving effect to the transaction, the incurrence of that transaction expenses anticipated first year synergies of $160 million and net of the divestiture proceeds.

With the free cash flow generated from base operations, we expect Nexstar's net leverage to decline to the 4 times range by the end of 2020. We've remain committed to applying our growing free cash flow to drive shareholder returns and our record 2018 results including full year cash flow of $693 million, enabled us to remain opportunistically active in taking action to enhance shareholder value through the year with our total return of capital in leverage reduction activities amounting to approximately $521 million, including net debt reduction of $400 million, dividend payments of approximately $70 million and share repurchases of approximately $50 million. In addition, we funded the $120 million accretive acquisitions in the digital and television space during the year.

Fourth quarter total interest expense approximated $53.9 million compared to $52.7 million in the prior year's period, while cash interest expense was $51.8 million compared to $50 million in the prior year. We expect cash interest expense to approximately $50 million in Q1 of 2019. In Q4, we had operating cash taxes of approximately $32.7 million compared to $7 million of cash taxes in Q4 of '17. Full-year operating cash taxes were approximately $90 million, including a net payment of $1.1 million relating to tax liabilities in an assumed acquisition and payment slightly below our full year guidance of approximately $100 million. We expect operating cash taxes to amount to between $110 million and $115 million for the year and $20 million for Q1 of 2019.

Nexstar's CapEx for the quarter totaled $42 million of which $28.6 million was related to the station infrastructure investments, our platform programming digital operations with the remaining $13.3 million for station spectrum repack and relinquishment of spectrum costs, which are fully reimbursable.

Through 12/31/2018, we have spent $29.7 million included in CapEx, of which $29 million has been been reimbursed as it relates to the income statement, both relating to the spectrum repack. We expect CapEx in Q1 of 2019 to approximately $20 million with an additional amount for repack CapEx.

Our Q4 cash flow was approximately $250 million inclusive of the impact of $5.5 million of one-time transaction expenses and this compares with consensus estimates of approximately $230 million. With 2017- 2018 average annual free cash flow of over $610 million, before one-time expenses and projected to be slightly higher on a 2018-2019 basis, our near and long-term path to growth and enhancement of shareholder value remains on plan.

As it relates to management's focus on free cash flow generation, our record 2018 and positive outlook for Nexstar Media Group will follow the approach we've successfully deployed in terms of building the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet and capital structure. The plan will continue to support our goals of generating significant free cash flow while allowing us to reduce leverage, pursue additional selective accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, repurchase shares and take other actions taken that enhance shareholder value.

Our focus on free cash flow is a key driver of our attraction to the Tribune assets and the value we can create by combining the companies. As Perry noted, we expect the transaction to result in approximately $900 million of average annual free cash flow in the 2018-2019 cycle or 46% more than our last guidance for Nexstar -- for legacy Nexstar of $615 million of annual free cash flow in the same period.

All of our pre-Tribune merger activities in due diligence continues to support our $900 million or $19.15 a share of free cash flow, but we recognize that our analysts and others continue to model Nexstar stand-alone in the periods leading up to the Tribune, closing later this year. As such, we reiterate the $900 million Tribune guidance and remind you that the two variables related to Tribune that we are aggressively working on every day, are the divestitures in the financing and we look forward to reporting to you as we finalize those items.

Now, I'll provide some guidance points for next our stand-alone over the next two years. First, as I mentioned before, we reiterate our guidance on 2018-2019 cycle of approximately $615 million per year or $13.40 rolling that forward today we're establishing guidance for average annual free cash flow in the 2019-2020 cycle of approximately $660 million or $14.40 a share or $1 more than the prior guidance.

The 2019 guidance assumes that core advertising is up slightly in 2019 versus 2018. The trend that we have seen since the November post election. Our guidance assumes that net political revenue in 2019 will decline almost $220 million compared to the 2018 period with respect to deep potential for early primary spending later this year, we're using historical data and not at this time forecasting anything in the way of material changes from past pre-presidential election cycle revenues.

As we've indicated previously, retrans and digital revenues will both grow low double-digits in 2019 over 2018 levels and again we have a high percentage of renewals at the end of this year, which will show up in our 2020 retrans growth. 2020, of course, will be a political year, so we'll see the same type of inventory management, we successfully exercised in 2018 to maximize this revenue opportunity.

I'm not going to provide guidance for 2020 core because it's just too far out and our sites will be based on driving political dollars in that year.

In summary, Nexstar is executing well on all functions including operations, integration, synergy realization, capital structure and service to our communities. Our disciplines in these areas have driven successful growth as well as consistency and visibility in our results with our financial results and the value we expect to derive from our pending accretive merger with Tribune Media. We continue to believe we have forged a clear path for the continued near and long-term enhancement of shareholder value.

As such, we're excited about our guidance for pro forma and annual average free cash flow in the 2018-2019 cycle of $900 million for the post Tribune merger and approximately $19.50 per share, per year. Our long-term experience in integrating acquired assets and our success over the last eight quarters and outperforming our synergy targets and driving other operating efficiencies related to the transaction of the Media General operations, will serve us well as we add Tribune Media to our operating base upon closing this year.

That concludes the financial review, and now I'll turn the call back over to Perry for some closing remarks before Q&A.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks very much, Tom. In the almost 23 years since Nexstar was founded, we remain true to our mission to deliver premium local programming and content as well as advertising solutions at the local level now with the growing scale for advertisers as well as political campaigns. This focus has proven to be good business for Nexstar as it consistently has positioned us to continue to invest in our business as well as reducing leverage and aggressively returning capital to shareholders and building shareholder value.

Consumer's brand awareness in purchasing decisions are every bit as strong if not stronger at the local level where businesses is operated and transactions take place. Local diversified media companies like ours, are uniquely positioned to thrive in today's multi-platform world because we provide superior local content that is unique and relative to each of the local communities that we serve across the U.S. while offering local businesses advertisers and brands unparalleled 24/7 marketing opportunities across all screens and all devices.

At the same time, our development of complementary retrans and digital revenue streams have materially diversified our revenue mix and we continue to focus on implementing new standards and technologies to monetize the unrivaled reach, trust and influence of our leading local platform. The fourth quarter marked a strong end to a record year of financial performance for Nexstar as well as the beginning of what we expect to be a tremendous period of growth for the Company with our pending acquisition of Tribune Media.

As we begin to benefit from initial contributions from Tribune later this year as well as the continued double-digit growth of

combined retransmission and digital revenue, a large number of distribution contract renewals up at the end of the year and what many expect to be a very substantial and possibly unprecedented spending level related to the 2020 presidential election cycle. We have excellent visibility to delivering on or exceeding our free cash flow targets and a clear path for the continued near and long-term enhancement of shareholder value through our commitment to localism, innovation and growth.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our operator to express and hear from you as to your specific areas of interest. Operator?

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Thank you. I'm surprised by the core guide for '19, so curious what's driving positive core? Is this Nexstar's specific? Is just the overall better environment? Is it a contribution from auto or is it growing in spite of auto?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I would say it's a little bit of all of the above. Marci, we budget conservatively for core growth this year. But I would say into the absence of political has inventory back into our base that we can resell to local advertisers, automotive is better than what we saw ending the Q4 period and 2018. I think it's just a combination of things. I think at Main Street, there is a pretty good level of confidence in the economy. And so, we're also beating (ph) the business for new business. So I think it's a combination of things that, that are driving the growth and with January and February in the books, we are over budget on core, our core revenue budgets for this year and obviously in February, we budget it down because of the Olympics last year, but we have exceeded our goals in the first two months of the year. Small sample size, but it's the beginning of a streak.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. In terms of the Tribune deal, I have a couple of questions. It feels like you're still on par to close in Q3 despite the government shutdown. I assume that means that conversations with the regulators are going well. And then can you also update us on the timing of station divestitures that forthcoming in the next couple of weeks?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. The station divestiture process is robust. There are a number of participants that are moving forward and have advanced into our next round. We do anticipate being in a position to announce the divestiture buyers and stations and markets, and all of those details by the end of the quarter and maybe a little sooner than that.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. Any conversation with the FCC or DOJ or anything you can comment on?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

No. Other than, we have made a commitment that we will deliver to them a quote-unquote clean transaction. We won't be asking for any waivers of any existing regulations and we're keeping our eye on the price of closing the big deal.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. And then last question, does your net leverage or any commentary on synergies related to Tribune include the real estate sales coming from Tribune?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Not in 2019, but in 2020, and really all it is, is a -- would be a cash inflow and a debt reduction because the economics of the real estate really don't materially affect the EBITDA of Tribune, in our view.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you so much.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Dan Kurnos with Benchmark. Please go ahead.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Yes, good morning. Heck of a quarter guys. Just quickly to go back on the core. I think the bigger surprise in the quarter was Q4 core strength. Perry , you talked about November and December being particularly strong and we're kind of trying to do the math or crowd. I know it's never really a clean number. But if you could give us a sense of kind of what December was up and kind of what you think sort of ex-crowd out Q4 look like, that would be helpful?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I can tell you core December was up mid single-digit and the crowd out thing is almost impossible to quantify because the last passenger on the plane pays the highest rate, so some of the political rates were multiples of what regular advertisers pay on a 52-week basis. So it's hard, you would have to assume a static demand and quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and of course that's not the case. So, I hesitate to comment on that because I wouldn't want to lead you down and exit ramp that goes nowhere. But we did see mid mid single growth in core and as I look at Q1 core revenue again with the comparison of February out of the mix. If I look at January and March taken together, it's a mid single-digit pacing increase on core business, right now.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Perfect. That's really helpful. And then obviously you had a bit of a protracted negotiation with TDS which got resolved. I know you guys talked about a pretty healthy retrans outlook. I don't know if those negotiations are getting any more contentious, but it doesn't sound like your outlook has been changed. But if you care to comment on sort of the landscape that you're seeing there?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

You know, there's a deal of contention in every negotiation and ultimately, a constructive conversation. So, I don't think the -- certainly we feel that this is a business and revenue stream that we pioneered that we pay a lot of attention to it, treat it with respect and do a lot of planning and analysis before we begin the negotiation. So I -- the the outage is the exception rather than the rule, if you look at our track record here and I don't think the 2019 renewals will be any different from that, from where we sit today.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Great. And then just last, Tom. I don't know if I maybe misheard you, but you said retrans up double digits and assuming that was gross, as your outlook -- you guys outlook changed at all for net for this year and next?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

No.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

And what was that outlook, if you care to reiterate Tom?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

It will be low double-digit growth in net retrans this year and slightly more than that next year.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you very much guys.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from David Joyce with Evercore. Please go ahead .

David Joyce -- Evercore -- Analyst

Thank you. If you could just provide some more color on a couple of the revenue items. I was just wondering why digital was down, was there some political impact in that somehow. And what should we think about that contributing going forward? And then secondly, on the new to TV advertisers, what should we think about in terms of the upside from there. Are those advertisers who are allocating to local media or they just literally newer companies in your footprint, if you could provide some more color there will be great? Thank you.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. When you look at our digital revenue number. As reported, there are two components there, local site revenue and then there's Nexstar Digital , which is our digital operating company. Nexstar site revenue for the quarter was up high-single digits and that's usually high-single low-double digit growth, consistently for us. Nexstar Digital, basically the revenue was flattish, but let me read the financial statements from the bottoms up in 2017, Q4, we had negative operating income of about $3 million for Nexstar Digital and in Q4 of 2018, we had positive operating income of approximately $5 million.

So, the lower top line growth was a conscious decision, not to chase on profitable revenue and also the cessation of certain unprofitable lines of business, and you did see we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter related some of those legacy businesses that will no longer be contributing.

I think on a going forward basis, if I again look at site revenue, January's growth was double-digit and we anticipate that being the case for the quarter on our site revenue and we are off to a good start in Nexstar Digital and I think you'll see a return to a consistent high-single low-double digit growth, as the year progresses on the combined metric.

Your second question was on new to television advertising, If I remember, and these are literally in a local marketplaces, we probably do business consistently with somewhere between 5% and 10% of the registered businesses in the marketplace. And so, our greenfield opportunities, the other 90% of the of the businesses that exist in a local market that don't do business with us. And so, there is a tremendous incentive to develop new business, tremendous commission potential. And so, it's just part of our culture and and quite frankly, I think it will be a driver of post closing growth in the Tribune acquisition, because they've not focused as much on business development in their markets, as I think they will under Nexstar.

David Joyce -- Evercore -- Analyst

Great, thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Please go ahead.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Hi, thanks. You guys posted 50% cycle growth, it sounds like in '18 off of '14. Can you help us think that on the '12 and '16 cycles and give us present contribution as a percent of total political for those periods?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

'12 is a little far back from a reach perspective for me, I don't have that information, but on '16, I want to say that it was traditionally low relative to other presidential elections and it was probably somewhere in the 20% to 25% contribution of total political. And before it had been closer to 30%.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I was going to say almost closer to 40% contribution from presidential, but remember in 2016, President Trump didn't spend a lot of money on his own behalf because of all the free media that he was getting at the time. We don't anticipate that being the case in 2020, but again for being conservative, we're use -- basically using historical numbers for 2020 compared to '16 and the end of '15. So that parallel would be '19 into '20.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Could you -- I'm sorry, could you say that last statement one more time?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, I'm just saying, we're basically -- we're not assuming huge growth in political revenue in '20 over '16 on a pro forma basis, at this point in time.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. Got it. And then I know you can't make detailed commentary here, but I'm interested from a high level kind of your views on Apollo's COGS (ph) transaction, how that either does or doesn't change your operator perspective?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think it's a net positive for shareholders to have private equity interest in the business because that should help to firm up valuations. My understanding of that. We dropped out of the COGs process when we acquired Tribune because we couldn't acquire COGs under the National ownership gap (ph), but my understanding is that the headline price will be a healthy multiple probably above where the space is trading today. But time will tell and the documents will need to be made public before we can know for sure, but we see it as a net positive in the space, but there is private equity interest and anytime there's another buyer that should help values.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Great, thank you.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Zack Silver with B. Riley, FBR. Please go ahead.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to kind of discuss local viewership and given how compelling the 2018 election cycle was, it seems like that could have provided a nice lift for local news viewership. Can you provide an update on how viewership trends were during the election? And if you have available how they are pacing in December as well as maybe year-to-date?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

As you know, we subscribe to comps for primarily and there is not huge users of Nielsen, suffice to stay there was enhanced interest in local news during the election cycle. We produced 83 debates across our footprint that were well viewed during the election cycle. We don't get a rating book, our November rating book until now and we're in a rating period in February, that we won't see the results until April. So, kind of hard to me to comment on current trends here. But again, we've expanded our local newsprint -- footprint even within our local group and launched additional news broadcasts, since the beginning of the year. And so, we obviously believe it's a good business and we will continue to grow our footprint, which will grow our gross aggregate eyeballs just because of more time periods being programmed for local news.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, Perry, and then one more if I could. Can you just give us an update on the tip initiative and when we may see that providing some left to core advertising?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure, that's the television interface practices and project or whatever you want to use for the initials, but the whole focus there is to provide more automation to the bay-sell process with local television stations to make the business more profitable for the agencies to do business with us. We are attempting to automate all of the back-end processes, the reconciliations, log times and all of that. We're not focused on the front end of the buy-sell process, but it's more of the automation of all the processes around make goods and invoicing and those kinds of things. And we had a press release, which you should have seen earlier this year, that talked about milestones that we'd achieved and our roadmap of what we look to achieve in 2018.

And our goal is to have the whole back-end process automated and vendors designing to that process, which they are now. And these -- it's basically open standards here at the business rules, here's how we see going about it, let the market determine who are the winners and losers from a technology standpoint, but at least have business rules and common standards, my goal is ultimately searchable APIs, but at this point, we're just taking it a step at a time, but I think if we can remove the friction out of the reconciliation part of the process that will be a huge saving for agencies and we hope the money will flow back to -- an increasing money will flow into spot television because of its superior value proposition for the advertiser, we just have to make it profitable for the agency to do business with us.

So, more will come as the year goes on and our goal is that we'll have the whole back-end process automated by the end of the year and then obviously now it's -- it will be up to agencies to adopt those standards and to implement them when -- and that's our ultimate goal.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Got it. That's interesting. Thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Yes, hi. Thank you, a few questions. Maybe, I think you said January and March TV pacings were up mid single digits, if you included February. Are you sort of suggesting is up say 1%, 2% for the whole quarter year-over-year as it stands right now?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me look. Yes, it's up slightly, probably on the order of about 1% as we see it today.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Thank you for that. And then how would you categorize auto relative to that, is it better or worse?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I have not drove down into category pacing by category yet, but that Tim Busch is in the room. He can comment on that. Tim, do you want to talk about auto pacing for the quarter?

Timothy Busch -- President, Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Auto pacing has been slowly improving and certainly over prior quarter.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, hopefully that's helpful to you.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Yes, appreciate that. You're paying TV subs like say in the fourth quarter, what was that number on a year-over-year basis, was it flat? Up a little bit? Down a little bit?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

I would say down a little bit.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Okay. And then also wanted to jump over now that your are basically two years off the Media General deal, can you remind us please, how much was the original synergies you've told us where you thought you would get out of Media General deal, and what is it coming out now you look back on it?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

The original synergies when we announced the deal were $75 million. When we closed the deal, we up that to $81 million, and I would say obviously we stop keeping count after a little while. But in the first nine months, we totaled between $85 million and $87 million in synergies.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And I think we have to give commentary the time that there would be additional synergies in years two and three, which we have realized on the order of single-digit million dollars of contract run-outs and lease cancellations and things like that. So, we've realized that as part of our '19 guidance as well.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

And do you think the $160 million. I think you've talked about for Tribune has potential upside too, I know it's early, but do you feel pretty conservative about that number?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Well, it is what it is until that something different.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Okay, thanks a lot guys.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Thanks. Maybe first Perry, just to drill down on what you said on the 2020 presidential election. I think a lot of us intuitively agree that it probably won't look like 2016. But just wondering if you could help us sleep a little better with why you think that's the case. Are you hearing that from some of your ad agencies? Are you hearing that from the parties that are putting money to work. So anyway you could couch that would be helpful?

And then, Tom, just on the debt, I think, in December, you said about the Tribune debt refinancing it that we should stay tune. Just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the Tribune debt. And just reluctantly (ph) when it comes to debt reduction, is there any value or transaction you think it's possible for food network? Thank you.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me first start with political; Tim Busch, who's President of Nexstar Broadcasting, is in the room, just made a tour of all of the major political agencies in Washington. So let him remark on their pulse of things.

Timothy Busch -- President, Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

I would tell you that the president election is probably going to come earlier this year, meaning for the primary races than we have seen in prior cycles. It will also be more robust because you'll have a larger field of candidates and you may have opposition on the incumbent party. And so, you're also going to see spending that will need to occur from our president, which we did not see in 2016, to that degree. And then lastly, pack and party moneys that should be more robust to support eventual candidates beyond the primary. So, you're going to just see overall activity larger than what we saw in 2016 on both sides of the parties in addition to Bernie Sanders.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, we've never disappointed on political guidance and I think you should just take us at our word that we, as we have more information, we will give more clarity on our guidance. But we are -- I would say you can probably always bet the over on our guidance, but we're going to do database and fact-based projections here and not -- just put a finger in the wind. So, as we get closer and have more data, you will likely see our guidance on political improve, as it has historically. And again, we tend to try and over-deliver on our promises.

As it relates to food network. That's not even on the to-do list of things to be thinking about right now. We're looking for clean divestitures and maximizing that value, regulatory approval, integration and that's -- we're happy to get it checked that we don't have to do a lot of work for as part of our EBITDA, but there's really nothing in the wind regarding food network not even on our radar screen to talk about. Now I'll let Tom answer the debt question.

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Sure. On the debt, we feel a lot better about the debt capital markets now than we did at year-end. We're not quite back to the levels we were in late November or early December when we did our -- when we got our indications at that time from our financing sources. But clearly, the market continues to grind back to more acceptable levels. And we're not going to give interim updates on the synergy number on Tribune until we have more absolute known, we're doing ongoing diligence on the operating synergies, the financing synergies and the financing costs will be worked into that as well as the divestiture.

So, as soon as we have more known's, then we will give more guidance with regard to the synergies.

Operator

Thank you for the question. We have a question from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Thank you. First, I was wondering the broader national scope and increased penetration in larger markets with the Tribune acquisition, makes me wonder that despite your historical aversion to entertainment programming and maybe that would continue, are there other programming initiatives you think would be a better consideration for you just because they would give you greater chance to monetize your base of operations?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Tim Busch and I have visited so far seven markets that of the Tribune markets that we will be retaining. And I think we've identified opportunities to increase local programming in every one of those markets along the way, and we'll be in Des Moine and Oklahoma City later this week and the roadshow will continue through the first week of April.

So I would say, we still have an aversion to national entertainment programming creating that, but I do think that we can potentially monetize our local programming as a day part or potentially an upfront or an unwired network of our own doing. We participate in unwired networks with our rep firms and other parties event specific that perhaps we can do that under our own power given the national reach we have.

This will be a company with national scale, but focused on local markets and I think that's the thing to remember. And that's what we're good at and that's what we'll continue to strive to get better at.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Barton Crockett of BCS Stocks. Please go ahead.

Barton Crockett -- BCS Stocks -- Analyst

Okay, great, thanks for taking the question. I haven't heard much from you guys about ATSC 3.0 on this call. I was just wondering if you could update what you see the landscape looking like for ATSC 3.0 in 2019, in terms of rollout, in terms of potential building a base for monetization are -- is there still reason to be excited about that or does it look like it is taking a little bit longer than maybe it had been hoped at one time?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think we've been encouraging folks to kind of cap the brakes on monetization because we've got to go through a repack and then a conversion to ATSC 3.0, most folks are doing that or spending money to get ATSC 3.0 ready, when they do the repack and spend incremental money and I think we have earmarked probably $20 million of our CapEx this year and next for ATSC 3.0 improvements beyond what the FCC would reimburse. And so that's how that this will begin, the first market to participate in a full market conversion is Phoenix. We will be the first ATSC 3.0 lighthouse station, others will provide the 1.0 lighthouse. We're still waiting on some approvals from the FCC to license MODs (ph) to allow us to do that.

So, there's a lot of organization, but our goal is that we have between the Pearl consortium and the Spectrum consortium. And again, we're the only Company in -- with a foot in both of those camps have 20 markets converted by the end of this year. That may be ambitious, but as you know, it's a voluntary transition, you have to get all the parties to agree. And then you've got to negotiate reciprocal tower leases. I mean there's a lot that goes into this and Brett Jenkins our Chief Technical Officer, is probably spending 30% to 40% of his time on ATSC and repack related issues here, but you have a coalition of the willing, it's just the repack itself will take three years plus from where we sit here and then we'll begin the path to monetization once markets do the voluntary conversion to 3.0 transmission technology.

So, all of which is to say, we think it's like having mineral rights and there is value here to be unlocked by the right technology and while it took 20 years to monetize shale oil and gas by improved technology, it's not going take 20 years, but it's going to take 5 to 10 before, this is a real meaningful contributor.

But again, I think it is the next huge value lever for local television because we're the ones that control and can monetize our spectrum. And I think the potential is as big as retrans probably, which is a $10 billion, almost $11 billion industry at the local station level in 2018. So, we think it has that potential, but you just going to have some patience, it's going to take time.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Ryan Vaughan with Needham. Please go ahead.

Ryan Vaughan -- Needham -- Analyst

Hi, Tom And Perry. Thanks for taking my question. Just Tom you mentioned the -- I'm sorry, Perry mentioned that the $10 billion or $11 billion I actually have a retrans question for you. So, you've talked about double-digit growth for years to come. I'm just curious how do you think about that, whether it's coming from virtual MVPD subs growth or is it the distribution option for the pricing expands or is it coming from some of the lower viewership channels that are getting bumped of at certain packages, fully recognizing in the bigger picture that broadcast is under earning relative to what cable is getting today, is a big picture question there?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, if you look at 2019, the estimate is that total distribution payments are $50 billion and we're getting, let's call it $10 billion or $11 billion. So we're somewhere between 20%, 22% of the pie. And that's for all television stations in aggregate. And all television stations in aggregate typical MVPD home, generate 35% of the cumulative viewing.

So I would say that's your bid and as to begin with, we won't even get into a quality of content -- premium content and what people really want, which is the local television stations. But, we're right now at about a 1.6 million in OTT sub counts. And that number is probably a little less than the actual, because there is a payment lag on that from the networks who are paying us to be part of their offering and so, that is a growth driver.

Again, we've seen our sub count declines really level off. I think people kind of get the bundle and the value of the bundle and they don't want to have four remotes on the coffee table again, and so broadband plus video and navigation is pretty powerful. And so -- but I think the primary driver is going to be from getting our fair share of the distribution bundle. And I think that will occur over the next couple of cycles, which would be three to six years basically.

Operator

Thank you. The final question will come from Dennis Leibowitz with Act II Partners. Please go ahead.

Dennis Leibowitz -- Act II Partners -- Analyst

Yes. What is the same factors that are causing you to raise your free cash flow estimates, moving from '18-'19 to '19-'20 for the core apply to the Tribune stations as well meaning that the total instead of 1950 or even 2050 would be higher than that?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

We're not prepared to comment on Tribune '19-'20 free cash flow guidance yet. There's a lot of moving parts that goes into that. I think we want to do it once and we want to do it with full information from synergies, from diligence, from financing, from divestitures, et cetera. But -- we're just speaking for the Nexstar at this point.

Operator

Thank you speakers. This concludes the Q&A portion. I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to ORBCOMM's Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded and a replay of this conference call will be available from approximately 7:30 PM Eastern Time today through 7:30 PM Eastern Time on March 13, 2019. The replay service details can be found in today's press release. Additionally ORBCOMM will have a webcast available in the Investors section of its website at www.orbcomm.com.

I would now like to turn the call over to Aly Bonilla, ORBCOMM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Aly.

Aly Bonilla -- Vice President of Investor Relations

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm here with Marc Eisenberg, ORBCOMM's Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Ford, ORBCOMM's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's conference call includes forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ from the expectations reflected in these statements. We encourage you to review our press release and SEC filings for a full discussion of the risks and uncertainties that pertain to these statements. ORBCOMM assumes no duty to update forward-looking statements.

Furthermore, the financial information we will discuss includes non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is included in our press release. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Marc Eisenberg.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Aly, and good afternoon. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year end -- ending December, 2018. We're going to focus this quarter's call on a number of significant initiatives, I'd like to cover in detail and Mike will then provide an in-depth look at the financials and our 2019 outlook. We'll finish the call by taking some questions. So let's get started.

Looking at the fourth quarter, the first thing that stands out is that hardware sales were light. Hardware sales were down $9 million year-over-year, but if you back out the large deployments with JB Hunt and the U.S. Postal Service hardware sales in the quarter were up almost $2 million. That being said comparative declines have not been our trend and it's not the entire story.

We entered 2018 with a number of initiatives that we believe were absolutely necessary for the long term. While our Company was growing, we were not getting the anticipated leverage in the business. With a desire to improve adjusted EBITDA and optimize our working capital, we embarked on the following initiatives. First, we refreshed nearly all our products with a new feature-rich technology while significantly reducing costs. This gives our customers a better products, while also achieving a jump in product margins.

Second, we set out to change how we manage our working capital. Inventory was hampered by growing lead times, coupled with a wide assortment of products with multiple variations. This led it to escalating inventory levels and dramatically slowed our cash generation. In short, we reduced the number of SKUs. Third, we set out to take our newly acquired Blue Tree in-cab solution to some of our largest customers that needed significant integration with their third-party systems. Had we focused on smaller opportunities, we likely would have had experience faster short-term growth, but that's not a representation of our customer base. Throughout 2018, we further developed our fleet manager in-cab solution to meet the needs of these larger customers.

With these issues in mind, over the course of 2018 we replaced nearly every product in our portfolio with a more-featured less-expensive version. As a result, we've grown our product margins from 13% in Q4, 2017 to almost 28% in Q4, 2018. We've reduced inventory levels by about 30% from our highs of $48 million to $34 million and have cut our SKUs by more than half. With these initiatives, having a -- a negative short-term effect on the hardware revenues, they're having a significant positive effect on adjusted EBITDA, where we improved Q4 year-over-year by almost 80% despite lower hardware revenues.

Let's take a minute to talk about the impact of our product transition on revenues. Over the last couple of quarters with inventory levels of discontinued SKUs running low, we were helping customers work through their valuation and integration process on our new products, while increasing production. Breaking that down on a per product basis, our satellite products are almost completely transitioned. Our reefer product is about 50% transitioned. Our trailer product, the GT1200 line is about 25% transitioned, and our new container product is only just starting to be shipped. With the new products commercially ready and many evaluations completed, we're starting to see the customer reaction we were hoping for.

In our container and ports group, we received an initial order from one of our OEMs for 10,000 units, anticipated to begin shipping in August and we expect to supply their customers total fleet of approximately 200,000 units. We've also completed evaluation programs with five other major shipping companies with additional opportunities totaling between 150,000 and 200,000 units. So combined with all six customers, they represent approximately $70 million in hardware revenue alone. This would be a substantial increase compared to 2018, where the port -- the container and ports group did about $2 million in hardware sales.

In our in-cab group, we've signed letters of intent to our negotiating final contracts to deploy on 10,000 trucks expected this year, which is double what we did last year. Keep in mind, it's only February. Needless to say, we expect revenues to ramp in the back half of 2019. With the 2018 initiatives in place, we successfully improved adjusted EBITDA margins from a low of 12% last year to about 25% in Q4 2018, achieving $57 million for the full-year 2018, a record high for the Company and a 27% increase over the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA margins achieved in 2018 were also insisted by improvements in service gross margins, increasing from 58% in Q4, 2017 to 68% in Q4, 2018. This was primarily driven by steering away from negative margins realized from managing third-party installation services as well as increased efficiencies in the business. As a result of these efforts, the Company's free cash flow pivoted from using about $24 million of cash in the first half of 2018 to generating about $14 million of cash in the second half. This is the result we expected to achieve and gives us confidence that we're now in a position to be a significant cash generator in 2019 and beyond.

Let's move on to our business highlights. We were selected by Lidl UK, one of the largest supermarket chains in Europe, will be using our cold chain solution to ensure transparency on their refrigerated trucks and trailers. By providing insight alerts and systems integration, we are helping Little gain real-time visibility and control of their assets, while ensuring regulatory compliance and improving customer service.

In addition, Swift, one of the largest transport companies in the United States and a longtime customer of our reefer solution has started to deploy our newly designed cargo product for their intermodal assets. Swift is a great example of a longtime customer that started with one asset class and is now taking advantage of our Double Player Triple Play (ph) bundles, where multiple asset classes utilizing our single integrated platform. These opportunities may use a combination of our in-cab, refrigerated, dry van or intermodal solutions, which is a unique competitive advantage . We've also been selected by SeaCube, a large container leasing company has begun offering our ReeferConnect solution to provide end-to-end visibility and remote control of their refrigerated containers in gensets. SeaCube can bundle ORBCOMM's telematics offerings with a sea container into one lease for one monthly price.

Our partner AT&T fully deployed an additional 70,000 containers from Maersk, after they completed the acquisition of Hamburg Sud in late 2017. All 70,000 devices were activated throughout 2018. The Hamburg Sud deployment demonstrates another key win in the reefer container market. Our resellers in Latin America are gaining market share and have committed to a minimum of approximately 30,000 units in 2019. We've also began significant deployments of our IDP products with a large telecom operator in the Middle East and we can expect them to offer our solution portfolio throughout their sales channels in the region.

We're excited to announce the first significant opportunity deployed by our analytics group with Rehrig Pacific Company, a leader in supply chain solutions to provide our services to power their business intelligence platform. The platform is designed to help Rehrig customers maximize their ROI and assets across their waste management sites, environmental and retail markets. With the addition of ORBCOMM's Analytics, Rehrig enabled its customers to query massive amounts of real-time data in seconds, providing actionable information and visibility into their supply chain, including missed customer container pickups, inefficient routes, driver behavior, inventory management and damaged assets.

Turning to operations, over the last few years, we invested tens of millions of dollars to create and redesign 20 cost optimized feature-rich products that enhance our existing capabilities. We tend to compete more effectively and to improve our product margins. I'd like to go into some detail on a few of these. So you can see the incremental benefits they offer to our customers. For our cargo business, which includes trailers, containers and railcars, we developed a new GT1200 line which replaces the GT1100. This device helps customers locate assets, improve turn times for increased asset utilization, maximize fleet size and improve the speed of cargo delivery to customers. With multiple sensor options, the GT1200 helps containers turn from dark, dumb and disconnected to visible, smart and connected.

Our integrated cargo sensor tells customers if they're asset is full or empty and ready for pickup. Our door sensor reports whether the assets doors are open or close to help manage theft. And geofences alert customers when the asset reaches designated areas to start the loading or unloading process or if the assets deviate from their schedule route. The integrated cargo sensor and the other wireless sensors eliminate the need for up to 40 feet of cable that can take up to an hour to install. With its new streamline design and external installation, the GT1200 could be installed on an asset in just minutes even when the trailer or container is full, making customer deployments quick and efficient with minimal disruption to their operations.

The GT1200 charges 20 times faster than its predecessor even without direct sunlight resulting in three times more messages per day for enhanced visibility and utilization. In addition by offering just a few versions of the GT1200, we were able to reduce the number of SKUs by 80% resulting in faster customer fulfillment, while substantially lowering inventory levels and achieving significant cost savings.

Our new PT 6000 is an industry-leading trailers solution for cold chain temperature control and monitoring compliance, which replaces the RT 6000. Historically a fleet with 3,000 trucks with 3,000 drivers to manage the refrigeration assets, while focusing on their primary objective driving the truck. Connecting the PT 6000 directly to the trucks refrigeration unit takes control out of the hands of the 3000 drivers and puts it in the hands of just a few dispatchers. The dispatcher can adjust unit temperature settings remotely, while the trailers on the move, monitor fuel levels, observe critical diagnostics and respond to maintenance alerts by ordering parts and scheduling repairs before the truck even gets back to the yard. Not only does this add efficiency and save temperature sensitive loads, but in today's market with increasing driver shortages, it maximizes the amounts of driving time.

The PT 6000 includes multiple new temperature probes and humidity sensor, which protects the quality integrity of the cargo, ensures compliance and mitigate cycling losses. The PT 6000 is also the first reefer products sold to the Carrier Transicold dealer network, allowing Carrier customers to remotely update the firmware in the reefer, including new temperature applications. Our next generation IDP products continue to resonate well with customers looking for satellite connectivity for new or existing telematics solutions that are deployed in remote parts of each geographies.

You can take a successful telematics application and add satellite connectivity with a single cable for easy installation. Our new IDP products are ideal for markets such as tuna fisheries, secure cargo transport and oil and gas applications that require satellite coverage. These products utilize our dual mode RFIC custom chip, which was designed to reduce the component counts of our first IDP products from 600 to 1, providing significant cost reductions and higher reliability while making satellite connectivity affordable.

Wrapping up, I'm pleased with the accomplishments of 2018, while we still have a lot of work to do in the year ahead. Our Company's foundation is stronger than it's ever been and we're executing at a higher level. With our margin improvement and cash generation plans on track in an unprecedented number of opportunities in our pipeline, 2019 is shaping up to be a promising year as we expect to make substantial strides in all three key metrics of the business, revenue, margin and profitability.

With that I will turn the call over to Mike to take you through the financials.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with our Q4 results. Total revenue was $66 million compared to $76 million in the same period last year. Keep in mind, last year included over $13 million of revenue from the JB Hunt and U.S. Postal Service deployments. Excluding the revenues of these two customers in both years, total revenue from our base business was up nearly 3% versus Q4 2017. Even with some revenue shifting to the right, we successfully increased adjusted EBITDA to $16.5 million, an improvement of $7 million over the prior year.

There were a number of non-recurring accounting entries in the quarter mostly associated with inthinc and Blue Tree acquisitions, which resulted in a net benefit of $1.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin continued to improve, reaching 24.9% in Q4 '18. This is 40 basis points higher than Q3 '18 and more than doubled compared to Q4 '17. Our adjusted EBITDA performance was primarily driven by higher service and product margins. Q4 service gross margin increased to 67.7% up 90 basis points from Q3 '18 and up over 1,000 basis points from Q4 '17. Product gross margin in Q4, improved to 27.5% compared to 12.7% in Q3 '18 -- Q3 '18, 24.2%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing product margins.

In Q4, we saw a significant number of our older models SKUs, which carried lower margins and had a negative impact on the impressive 27.5% we reported. We sold off about $9 million of this older inventory in the quarter. Excluding these sales, our Q4 '18 product margins would have been significantly higher. We believe there is further upside to product margins, as we shipped out greater quantities of our cost reduced products to customers in 2019. We ended the year with almost $54 million of cash on our balance sheet strengthening our liquidity position. This was an improvement of nearly $8 million from Q3 '18. Even after making a $10 million interest payment on our debt in October, we generated operating cash flow of $12.4 million in Q4, an increase of $10.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by favorable operating results and reductions in inventory.

With CapEx of $5 million in the quarter, the Company generated free cash flow of $7 million in Q4, our second consecutive quarter with positive free cash flow. With improvements in cash generation, coupled with higher adjusted EBITDA, our Company's trailing 12-month net debt leverage ratio now stands at 3.4 times, down from 3.9 times in Q3 and from our high of 4.9 times in Q1 '18.

Turning to our full year results. 2018 total revenue was $276 million, an increase of about $22 million or 8.6% compared to 2017. This increase is driven by our growing service revenues, which ended the year at $154 million, up nearly $19 million or 13.8% over the prior year. More importantly, full-year recurring service revenue grew 17% over the prior year, driven by nearly 350,000 net new subscribers, bringing our total subscriber count to approximately 2.37 million at year-end.

Contributing to the improvement was steady growth from our AIS business achieving a record high of $11 million in 2018, 17% increase over the prior year. Higher service and product margins drove gross profit margin for the year to almost 47%, a 600 basis point improvement over 2017. Compared to the full-year 2017 product margins climbed 730 basis points and service margin grew 290 basis points. Full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 27% over the prior year to a record $57 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins reaching almost 21%. This is an improvement of $12 million or 300 basis points over 2017. Better operating results, along with improvements in working capital and cash management practices led to operating cash flow of $11 million in 2018 versus $5 million use of cash in 2017. This is $16 million year-over-year improvement. Let me summarize the six key financial highlights of our 2018 performance year-on-year. Revenue was up 8.6%. Service margin was up 290 basis points. Product margin was up 730 basis points, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 310 basis points, operating cash flow was up $16 million, subscriber count increased by nearly 350,000 units.

Moving to our 2019 outlook, they will -- we will provide full-year guidance on recurring service revenue, service margins, product margins, adjusted EBITDA, operating cash flow and capital expenditures. For the full year 2019, we expect recurring service revenues to grow 5% to 7.5% compared to 2018 with service margins anticipated to be between 66% and 68%. We expect product margins to continue increasing throughout 2019 and average over 30% for the full year. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be between $70 million and $75 million in 2019, weighted more heavily toward the second half of the year. We expect operating cash flow in 2019 to be approximately $50 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated to run at approximately $25 million this year.

As Mark pointed out earlier, our sales pipeline includes several customer opportunities with large-scale deployments, leading us to provide quarterly guidance on product sales and net subscriber counts, due to the uncertain timing of these deployments. Looking at Q1, we expect product sales to be similar to Q4 '18 as we work through our short-term hardware issues over the course of the quarter. We expect to bring onboard about 70,000 net new subscribers. In summary, we look forward to delivering sales growth, margin expansion, improved profitability and greater cash flow this year.

This concludes our remarks for the call and we'll now take your questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And the first question will be from Mike Walkley of Canaccord. Please go ahead.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Great, thank you. Marc, just trying to get a little more color on the 5% to 7% recurring revenue guidance. Is there any puts and takes, maybe a drop in the mix for ARPU or some greater churn this year that's pointing to year slower recurring revenue growth versus last year? Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think what we experienced toward the end of 2018 is -- you heard me say that AT&T put on those units. And you remember the ARPUs on those units are just a fraction of what some of the other ones are. So when you're churning the units in normal numbers and you're adding on -- based on that -- based on the ARPU of those units, it had a kind of a slowing effect in Q3 and Q4. I think, we're being conservative in the first half of next year, because we're seeing hundreds of thousands of units that we're going to have to start turning on, especially in that container group and transportation group in the second half. And when that stuff comes on or when you're little back heavy in the year, you don't get the full year effect of the service revenues that are coming on, like you do, if we were installing them early in the year. So I think, when you do the math, that's just the way the timing comes out.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. And just on the short term, just with the adjusted EBITDA guidance and it sounds like there is a little bit of some positive effects that helped in Q4. Should we expect higher OpEx levels from what you posted for Q4 to start the year and a little bit dip in adjusted EBITDA, then kind of build from that level throughout the year that kind of how we should think about it?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

We've been pretty strict with our field organization about OpEx growth. We don't expect to see much growth at all of the course of the coming year. We stabilized the workforce. We don't anticipate adding much of them -- with winning (ph) more employees. We'll be concentrating heavily on cost control as we move forward. We're at the point now where scaling our business is possible and will be a high priority for us.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

But I think you, Mike, you were referring to the seasonality in the first quarter where there is like another $0.5 million or $1 million, because the spike the -- some of the public company cost to come in earlier in the year. So, yeah, there's probably just like it was last year, it spikes up like $0.5 million or $1 million in costs.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Okay, great. Last question from me and I'll pass it on. And just as you look at the pipeline, Marc. Just a little color on kind of the mix of the ARPU and particularly on maybe the Blue Tree. I know that's been getting some good traction, how you see the front of the cab business developing throughout the year? Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, so I kind of see the Blue Tree stuff or in-cab in general, if you look at Blue Tree and then think, they tend to average around 30-ish, give or take a couple of dollars in the other -- in either direction. And then, the container stuff is kind of in the low single digits, but you're talking about hundreds of thousands of units we expect to be fielding. So, I think the timing can push ARPUs around in multiple directions, but I think if the number is 10 to one, then you end up just where you started between those two.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

Operator

The next question will be from Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Thanks, good afternoon.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Hey.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Hey. One follow-up on a couple of Mike's questions. If we can go back to the non-recurring items in 4Q that had to do I think you said with inthinc and Blue Tree. What line items did those effect with that $1.5 million, was it revenues? Was it margins? Just kind of where should we think that $1.5 million was in 4Q '18?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

They'll will be in our SG&A line.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. And then if we think about the guidance going forward for 2019, I think you've mentioned recurring service, sorry, service gross margins of 66% to 68%. But I think you guys have been putting up kind of closer to 67% already. What would cause service gross margins to go back down into the 66% range versus being able to get up to the 68% range?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Not a whole lot. You've got to 66% to 68%. So you're going to model 67%, but I don't know, I mean, to come up with a range of an exact number, I don't know something can happen. You get an increase from one of your terrestrial providers, where we're doing an awful lot of work with Inmarsat. We do have some vendors there. I think that our products, our costs are going to hold steady. In some cases they even fall. So I would probably bet closer to the higher end of that the lower.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I would. Fair. I think that's a good assumption.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't something unseen or that we didn't know about out there.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

No. There is nothing in our head. that made us change that number. I think we like that 67%. So we drew ourselves as a point in each direction for the unforeseen.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Makes sense. And final one for me Marc, obviously the timing is important as you pointed out to Mike earlier. But if we thought about maybe recurrings service revenue growth like second half '19 over second half '18, how should we think about that, because there is the optics, so the guidance is 5% to 7.5% on an annual basis, but you thought apples-to-apples, like whether it's 1Q '19 over 1Q '18 or 4Q '19 over 4Q '18. Can you help us understand on which order of magnitude kind of what would be a more normal rather than calendar year to look at that kind of growth rate?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think, in -- I'm trying to remember what Q1 was last year. So if you took Q4 and just flat, put it over last year, what would the growth be? Let's -- I'm -- these guys feeding me the numbers. Maybe Mike you could answer here?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

So, yeah, so I think if you expect the first half of the year to be up low-single digits growth year-over-year, the second half of the year will be closer to 10%.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. I think that helps Mike's question a little bit more to just understand that the optic looks kind of odd, so that helps, I appreciate.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I agree, I mean if you take a look at Q4 and you run the Q4 against our own Q1, that's the 5%. So that's the low end. And then any growth on top of that gets you to the higher number.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

And you we put on -- as we sell more products in the second half of the year, that's when the subscriber show up. So that's when you'll start to see an uptick in our service revenue.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

And then that leads to probably more sustained growth even on calendar '20 then?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. We haven't seen -- we haven't seen any change -- real change in our churn rates. So I don't -- I think, that you can -- I think you can rely on the subscriber growth following closely the product revenue sales growth. And I think, Rick, the hardware thing that we're dealing with now, I think it's kind of a blip on the radar. I think as we -- if you look at just this container deal that we're talking about, you're going to start shipping about 2,000 a week in August, and if we could stay at that rate, which I don't think we can, it would have to escalate. But you'd be shipping that 8,000 to 10,000 a month for the next 3.5 years. And so I think, there is -- when you're in these big game hunters like we are, you get these peaks and valleys.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Yeah, and that gives us some comfort too on the visibility than on the product sales of having that big contracts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I would love to see these guys with $70 million worth of backlog versus $2 million of hardware sales in 2017.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

One other question. You see that one (ph). Have you guys thought about giving backlog numbers as far as what the backlog on sales or product sales or service revenue might be?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Maybe, but let me explain why we come up with something that says first order of 10,000 against the fleet of 200,000. Why it kind of looks like that? There is a long lead item in those components that, it is like four months or five months. So what happens is the OEM is always giving you orders to keep you running four, five months ahead. So you get -- so what you get is a 10,000 in order to get you started in August against a fleet that's much larger. But in fact you continually get these purchase orders as you continue to put up the fleet. Because putting it out a year or two in advance doesn't do them any good.

So just to be clear, that's the way JB Hunt was done. That's the way Hub Group was done. That's the way every deal gets done. So I -- to answer your question, I don't know if the backlog is 200, is the backlog the 10, I don't know.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. We'll see you down here in Orlando next week. Take care. Thanks guys.

Operator

The next question will be from David Gearhart of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Mr. Gearhart. Your line is open, you may be muted on your side.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question for you is just a housekeeping question. Did you provide the AIS revenue for the quarter? Because I think you mentioned $11 million for the year and it would imply, I'm not (ph) having the full number that it's down quarter-over-quarter. So I just wanted to clarify what the number was for the quarter?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

No, it was flat quarter-over-quarter.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Okay. Flat. And then Marc, throughout the year, you were providing forecasted number of net additions 350,000 to 400,000 for the year, you came in at 348,000 for the year, slightly below that. So just wondering if you could quantify the impact for Q4, if that's being pushed into 2019. And if you can give us an update on kind of what you're expecting for the sub number for the year, if possible?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think, we're expecting 70,000 for Q1, because the hardware is going to be similar to Q4 and we shipped about 75,000 units in Q4 of hardware. I think, that's the struggle with the timing on the hardware. I think, if everything kind of goes off flawlessly, which it never does, and we're shipping all these container units and bunch of trailer units and all the stuff we're looking at, it would be well over 100,000 in the back half of the year. But the timing is what's pulling back us our ability to give you full-year hardware guidance. So it's the same problem.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Okay and then lastly from me. Just one of your initiatives, I know, that you've been working on, is rationalizing your acquired platforms kind of standardizing on the Blue Tree platform and just wondering where you are with those efforts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

So seven platforms, web platforms are going to move into one. We call it Project Synergy. And I think all along the plan is to have that available in Q2. But all new customers are already being deployed on it. So there is the conversion, but in terms of new customers are already being deployed that way. So in Q2, what's going to happen is people that have been on the old platforms are going to have visibility on both platforms. They're going to be able to run them both concurrently and while we're going to keep those old platforms alive, we're not going to do any more development on it.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Got it. That's it from me. Thanks so much.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

Operator

The next question will be from Mike Malouf of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Hi guys. This is Eric Des Lauriers on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could just dive a bit more deeply into ARPU? I know there is obviously a mix difference between you're Blue Tree and inthinc products and your container products. But I was wondering if you could kind of give us your take on how -- where you expect the bottom to be come down pretty steadily for the past four quarters. And just wondering if you guys see that trend continuing or if this Q4 range is about bottoming out? Thanks.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think those Blue Tree products, while the backlog keeps building and the workload for the engineers keeps building, Q4 didn't have an actual lot of shipments. We're getting more orders, we're getting more excitement, but we still have a huge amount of integration that the engineers are doing. So you didn't get any of the impact. But when I said -- when we say a quarter of 70,000 net adds, those are net adds. So the gross adds it could be north of 100,000 and then you add some new churn and over the last year you turned on 70,000 of those AT&T units at these super low ARPUs. And then your churn could be $4 ARPUs, $5 ARPU, $6 ARPUs. So those units kind of cancel each other out. The rest of your subscribers you're putting on have to eat up the difference, and it's been ticking away from -- ticking away from ARPUs. And I think that's literally what you've been seeing in the ARPU.

So the -- I think, there's maybe one or two partnership deals with AT&T, that we're still looking out of the six that I talked about on the call today. One of them is an AT&T deal and six of them are not. So as opposed to one of these deals that's kind of turned upside down, when you're ARPU shrink. But you have you know very low costs. The deals that are coming forward ORBCOMM is the lead on these deals. So the economics are kind of turns right side up like a normal ORBCOMM deal. So I think that should be helpful.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Okay. So do you think that this sub 5 range that we've seen in the back half of the '18 should, basically touch the bottom out and then start to trickle up again or is this kind of like the new normal do you think?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I hope so. I think, that's the case. The only reason I'm hesitating is the Blue Tree units, I think those are the ones that are -- they're going to come in the back half of the year. We're pretty certain of that. So I think, that's going to help us. And then, I think we're going to close 400,000 or 350,000 units on the container side. And if they all zoom into this year, good news is, wow, you're going have some great revenues. (Inaudible) is they are a a lower ARPU than the average and if it kind of get some split over the course of the next two years, it could be more balanced. So I think, it still depends on the mix. But I just want to emphasize that regardless of what the ARPUs are -- there is not a single sub that's a bad sub. If you look at some of these licensing subs, where the ARPUs are all the way down at $1. There's no cost on those. There is no -- in the cost of service line there's nothing there. So it's a great sub. A $30 with the $6 cost is a better sub, but it's still -- from a margin perspective, it's a good, but it's not as good as the service one. So I'm kind of routing for all of them and let the chips fall where they may.

Our ARPU has been dropping over time because of pricing concerns. It's all mix.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Sure. Yes. That definitely makes sense. I was just trying to get a gauge of where do you expect the mix. Thanks guys. I appreciate the color.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks.

The next question will be from Mike Latimore of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hi guys. This is Pavan (ph) on for Mike Latimore. I have two questions. What percentage of your shipments now are from newer low-cost products?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I'm sorry, say that again. The new products?

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

What percentage of your shipments now are from newer low-cost products?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So in my script, let me say 50%. But of that 50%, the satellite products are complete, the GT1200 which is the cargo product was -- we only shipped 3,500 of them, because that's all we built last quarter in time, so that was -- I don't know 25%. If you look at the PT 6000, which was the reefer product, it was about 50% and the cargo products for the most part that was just hundreds of units, but we're not shipping the old ones. So it was 100% of a very, very low number, but I guess if you were to just rough estimate, average all those things out, it would be about half.

So there is a long way to go. I mean, Mike said something, I went and did the math, because if I was struggling to believe it and then we're kind of parked here with our Chief Accounting Officer that was splitting out the numbers. We did $9 million of the old products at high-teen margins. And then the other 50% -- whatever we did it averaged to 27.5%.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, thank you. So my second question is related to Chinese tariffs. Are you seeing any difficulty in sourcing components or like -- is there any impact, which we could expect on the income statement going forward?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

China kind of scares me. I think the good news in China is we've got upside there. We're in the middle of installing an earth station and we're going we're going to go into China, assuming that whatever these issues are, by the time we get installed it will work out and if not, it's not like like an incredible investment, but I don't think there's anything built into our plan or our guidance today that -- some tariff or something is going to blow up in China. We've got upside there. There's very little business there today. There's almost no downside, but our plan is to go forward.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Yeah. Thank you. That's all for me. Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your next question will be from Chris Quilty of Quilty Analytics. Please go ahead.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Thanks. Marc, it sounds like you've done a tremendous transition on the hardware side, but I know you've always got some new tricks in your back pocket. Can you talk about what is next or what you have in development in terms of hardware and is it having already done cost reduction, are you targeting new markets or new applications, what's the emphasis on the hardware side?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Well, the emphasis on the hardware is, I don't know, it feels like each each one has a different story. And Chris, you've been -- this is 50th call. So I'm guessing this is your 50th call. So, like -- and I know you're -- you've got such great expertise in satellite, but our goal on the satellite side is -- I think the satellite business across the entire IoT is growing -- it's growing, but it is not growing like the cellular side is growing and the reason it's not growing is as you know, it's not features. I mean, gee, you've got a platform, that's going to last for an awful lot longer than 2G converting to 3G or 3G converting to LTE.

Plus, you get all the benefits of global coverage. I think everyone would want to you satellite, but that being said, the price per byte and the price for the hardware, it's always been a very difficult comp for satellite and why satellite struggled and when you can take 600 components and put it down on one chip. The idea is to make satellite affordable. Blue Tree -- Blue Tree is super cool. It's a in the in-cab side and it is a perfect customer for dual mode, but they never were able to do dual mode before, because if they sourced it from one of our competitors, then the cost of just the 15% of the time they would have used satellite would have been greater 5x what the cellular was and then you were burdening it with this great hardware and then we figure to ourselves.

As opposed to 10% of the in-cab business being satellite, what is the price point that makes it 30%? What is the price point that makes it 50%? What is the price point that makes it 100%? And how could we get there, right? That is the -- that is the purpose there. The other big one is, this container business, Maersk, went first. They are up to 350,000 to 400,000 units now with the acquisition of Hamburg Sud. Everyone's going to do something, it feels like over the next year or two years, we think we're going to win the lion's share of that business. And it's funny, I'm sitting there with these customers and it's not, gee, your competitors here and you're there and what makes you excited. That's not what we're seeing at all. What we're seeing is, this is the price that -- makes this a positive return for us. And this is the go forward or not go forward.

It's almost like that discussion that we had with JB Hunt. And we went, pulled the cost out of it, ripped it apart and the good thing here is the volumes are so damn high, right. So you have the economies of scale. So that is part of it. And then secondly, we did a -- we took a long time to take a look at the model and took a step back and -- yeah, we had a little hardware blip this quarter. It's not going to matter, but you have this hardware blip in the quarter. But what's really -- look at what's happening here, right. You had some sales that weren't profitable last year and you've like more than doubled your -- you more than doubled your margins at a small decrease in hardware, and I think it all day. All day, right. Of course, you do.

And I think in order to get running on all three cylinders, in order to get the margins back in line, to get our cash in line because, well, we had too many skews and in order to get the revenues up, we took 2018 to -- I mean this is the year of the product and these things are really cool.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Got you. And Mike, I mean, clearly you're focused on cash flow -- free cash flow generation, but at some point what becomes the primary goal here in terms of delevering to a certain level or do you start to look at tack-on acquisitions once again?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. I think we will -- we're going to get on too fast, right? We're going to generate as much cash as we can between now and when our debt comes due. And we can start to pay it down. But between now and then, we're going to -- we'll have -- we'll have positive operating cash flow, even positive free cash flow I believe from this point going forward. So, two years from now, when it's time to make our final decision about what to do with our debt, if we are in an economy where there are acquisition bargains, there are attractive technology we want to buy, we'll go down the acquisition path. If there are not any good bargains there, then we'll consider we can -- we will consider restructuring our debt.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I don't think you're thinking far different than what we are, Chris. We are just looking at the math. 2020, your (inaudible) disappears and you've got a 4% penalty to refinance; 2021, it's 2% and 2022, It's -- there's no penalty. So that's just a whole lot of math, right?

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Yeah.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Because of our increased EBITDA, our cash is on the balance sheet -- our leverage ratio, as I mentioned those earlier. They will be much more attractive by the time it's -- we are ready to make a decision about what to do with our debt. So we're going to have more options this time around than we did last time.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Great. And final question here. When you look at the company structure, you've had a lot of consolidation of hardware and manufacturing in the EMS providers is the structure of the company in terms of number of facilities and capabilities, where you want it, do you see a need to expand or are there areas where you can make some cuts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think in terms of where we are, there are definitely areas of excellence that have evolved in the company based on the acquisitions. Some offices have been shrunk down, other ones have been built up. But if you look at ORBCOMM as a whole, if you want to know where ORBCOMM does it's hardware, it's in Ottawa, Canada. May be supported by some other building, but there are 145 people in Canada and predominantly they do hardware engineering.

The largest office ORBCOMM has believe it or not, it is not in Dulles, Virginia, it's in Hyderabad, India. Hyderabad is about 160 employees and that is where the overwhelming majority of customer service and where most of our web design is. Our in-cab products are really designed out of go away. There is so damn talented there. We couldn't consider moving them. And then our space operations are in Dulles, Virginia. I think, we've really kind of built, even through acquisition, the people that came through the acquisition are not necessarily doing exactly what they were doing then. So I think that's worked out pretty well for us.

Are there efficiencies out there? Yes, there's always efficiencies out there and I think, we can find them. I mean, if you're thinking that you know the Company goes from 860 employees to 500 and to be able to support the growth that we're looking to achieve, not likely. But that being said, if we're wrong, and the business isn't what we think it is, then there is certainly opportunities there.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

One final, if I can. You just had the announcement a couple of days ago with the Rehrig Pacific and the poorly named Analytics Services, which is sort of a generic name. But clearly that looks like something that you're selling now as a separate service software platform. Can you add a little bit there of color in terms of -- does this become a branded packaged product or is it just an add-on to existing customers in terms of capability and can that help drive some of service margins up.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So -- let me start by saying, if you have a better name for it, you know my -- you've got email, you've got text, you've got my phone number, whatever you need. But I get it's a bit of a buzzword these days. But we really are doing it. I mean for Rehrig, it's pretty neat. They've got this -- garbage is a good busines, right. They monitor these garbage trucks and they're monitoring it by the second. When they miss a stop, they know precisely where it is and how to reroute and go around. I mean it's pretty incredible what they're able to do and we were put up against some of the biggest companies that you've heard of. And we were able to get the timeliness and get that data spun much quicker than they were. So I think that's pretty neat.

But for Rehrig, it looks like a sub-times ARPU deals. It does. Because it's not really a telematics deal, it's something that we're doing on top of what they already have. So, there is no telecommunications, but it's just software times ARPU. And I think, when there is something unique, that's kind of the model, it could be a flat fee or something. But I think that is a portion of the business. The real part of -- not the real, but the other part of the business is taking some of our best practices and some of the data that we have across entire fleets and helping companies with best practices, helping customers with gee. I mean, there is everything you want to know about reefers.

There's is only one company that knows at all and that's ORBCOMM or that business or how long the average time that you are sitting there waiting to unload or be picked up or whether you're using the amount of time you use continuous cool versus start-stop, and driver efficiency over time. I mean there's so much stuff that we already know that we are almost -- those are the next generation stuff that we're building. And I think, we're perfectly happy to continue offering to a refrigerated customer, let's say, the product that they have today, but maybe for another $2 or $3 of ARPU. They can kind of get the LinkedIn plus as an example.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Great. Thank you for the color and good luck with that.

The circus that is called U.S. governance continues to entertain with its bizarre acts. This week, an awestruck public witnessed yet another one, this time with the Cohen clown testifying before Congress.

Yes, President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and ‘fixer’ (is that really a thing?) Michael Cohen stood before a Congressional committee and swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This is the same man who, in May, will begin a prison sentence for, among other things, lying to Congress.

And what did we learn? Let’s look at just a few tidbits of information; we won’t call them facts, due to Cohen’s known record of lying to Congress.

+ Trump ordered Cohen to pay porn star and alleged former mistress (or perhaps one-night stand) Stormy Daniels, and then reimbursed him for that payment. Cohen claimed that his initial statements about that payment were not lies; he never said Trump didn’t reimburse him. He carefully said that no one from the Trump campaign reimbursed him. So there. + Cohen threatened people and organizations 500 times in ten years, under Trump’s direction. + Trump never tells people to lie, break the law, or even skirt it. He simply tells them what he expects as results. If achieving those results means his underlings must lie, or break or skirt the law, so be it. But Trump never tells them to do so. + When the infamous Billy Bush tape was made public, Cohen was immediately contacted by Trump aide Hope Hicks (a one-time member of his staff who, like so many others, became a victim of Trump’s employee revolving door), who told him to position Trump’s disgraceful, misogynist remarks as ‘locker room talk.’

Democrats on and off the House Oversight Committee, the hosts of this week’s spectacle, were gleeful; despite there being no actual smoking gun, there was enough innuendo for any normal person to conclude that Trump probably broke all kinds of laws, not only during his campaign for the presidency, but throughout his life as a real estate mogul.

These Democrats seem to forget that they were listening to testimony from someone who has been convicted of lying to them previously. Cohen may have been telling the truth, or he may not have been. His record in such things is not exemplary.

The Republicans, on the other hand, were filled with righteous indignation that anyone would dare to impugne the good name of St. Donald the Great. They were so outraged that they even arranged for one Matt Gaetz, a representative from Florida, to sit in the gallery, despite the fact that he isn’t a member of the House Oversight Committee. Gaetz, an ardent worshipper at the Trump altar, gained notoriety for threatening to expose Cohen’s extra-marital affairs, an accusation he made without any corroborating evidence. When asked for evidence, Gaetz replied: “As the President loves to say, ‘We’ll see.’“ One newscaster compared Gaetz presence in the gallery as akin to trials of organized crime figures, when enemies of witnesses were brought in to sit in the courtroom to intimidate the witness just by their very presence.

Today, some Republicans are referring Cohen and his testimony to the Justice Department, saying they have evidence that he committed perjury during his appearance this week. Whether or not their evidence falls into the Trump-Gaetz category of ‘we’ll see’, remains, ahem, to be seen.

Trump, meanwhile, was visiting his good friend Kim Jung-un, North Korea’s leader, to discuss nuclear disarmament. We must understand that this disarmament only applied to North Korea; Trump and most, if not all, of the U.S.’s elected officials only want the ‘bad guys’ (as they define them) to get rid of nuclear weapons, while the ‘good guys’ (again, by their twisted definition), can keep theirs. In U.S. parlance, the one nation that has ever used nuclear weapons, and on a civilian population no less, falls into the ‘good guys’ category. Go figure.

That this endeavor wasn’t successful, and that the world’s self-proclaimed best deal-maker wasn’t able to make any progress, isn’t too surprising. Additionally, while in Vietnam, Trump limited press access, because those pesky reporters wanted to ask about Cohen’s testimony. Why waste the president’s time with such trivia? Who cares about his relationships with porn stars, or his threats against people and companies? How dare that Cohen upstart attempt to upstage him? No wonder he fell into disfavor. The former ‘fixer’ better not expect a presidential pardon now!

This writer, watching such happenings from the relative safety of the U.S.’s neighbor to the north, is continually astounded. Republicans in Congress rally around their incompetent, petulant president, despite his erratic behavior and the fact they he can barely string two words together coherently. They attempt to explain away his behaviors or, worse yet, justify them.

On the other side of the aisle, the reality-show buffoon is universally despised, as the Democrats react in horror to each of his shocking behaviors, conveniently forgetting their own, and those of their past leaders. Democratic stars in the polluted firmament slowly announce to a world that hardly wants to hear the news, that they have decided to seek the party’s nomination for president, thus offering a viable alternative to the Great Orange one. Sadly, they seem to be stuck in the rut of believing that the voters will choose anyone other the current incumbent, as they hesitate to make any bold proposals, not wanting to alienate any voting bloc, and content not to please any, either. There are some exceptions, but most of them try to ride in the middle of the road, some being PEP (Progressive Except for Palestine), but mainly presenting themselves as the anti-Trump candidate.

Can neither member of either party learn nothing? Must they put party over principle? Why is this writer even asking? Of course they must! That is how they get re-elected, and for them, that is the highest goal. Statesmanship, integrity, the good of the people and other such lofty principles don’t have powerful lobby groups, and so such things are beneath notice.

The 2020 election is still a long way off; Trump may still be president by then, but his vice-president, Michael Pence, could assume that office if The Donald is found guilty of criminal activity and is removed from office. Pence, a conservative Christian, would probably be worse than Trump, if such a thing can be imagined. But in 2020, this writer, still a U.S. citizen despite his fourteen years living in Canada, will probably vote for a third-party candidate. That is where one looks for integrity, honesty and real caring for the people.",The Circus that Never Leaves Town,Counterpunch.org,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/03/01/the-circus-that-never-leaves-town/

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the Cheniere Energy Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Randy Bhatia, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Randy Bhatia -- VP of Investor Relations

Thanks, operator. Good morning and welcome to Cheniere Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me for today's call are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO, Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Michael Wortley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements.

And actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to non-GAAP financial measures such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere Energy Inc's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc.

The call agenda is shown on slide 3. Jack will begin with an overview of our 2018 operating and financial highlights and perspective on 2019 and beyond. Following Jack's comments Anatol will provide an update on the LNG market and Michael will review our financial results. After prepared remarks we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Thank you, Randy and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our significant accomplishments from a very successful 2018. To share my optimism for the continued success as we look forward to 2019 and beyond. 2018 was a truly remarkable year for Cheniere. On last year's call I described 2017 as our breakthrough year which is certainly was. In 2018, we maintained our momentum achieving excellence in reaching new heights in virtually all phases of our business.

From commercial success achieved by signing over 7 million tons per year, a new long-term SPAs. To the FID of Corpus Christi Train 3 in May and the start up of Corpus Christi Train 1 few months later. To continued financial discipline and simplification of our corporate structure. We've achieved those and much more and in doing so have cemented our reputation as a reliable full service LNG operator which delivers on its promises to its customers, employees and stakeholders.

In 2018, we executed on our strategic growth plans, operational plans and financial plans and the results of our execution are apparent in the financial results we reported earlier this morning. Slide 5 presents some key highlights of the fourth quarter 2018. There are a couple of achievements I'd like to highlight from this slide. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over $630 million and the the distributable cash flow of approximately $130 million. And produced and exported a record 80 cargoes on the quarter almost a cargo a day. In addition, we reached the commissioning milestone of our first cargo at both Train 5 at Sabine Pass and Train 1 at Corpus Christi.

As of year-end we had exported four commissioning cargoes from Train 5 at Sabine Pass and two from Train 1 at Corpus Christi. Our substantial commercial momentum continued in the fourth quarter, as we signed long-term SPAs with both Polish oil and Gas Company and Petronas for over 2.5 million tons per year in aggregate. We look forward to successful long-term relationships with our newest SPA customers and expect these SPAs to support our growth plans.

The market for LNG contracting remains active and we continue to pursue additional long-term commercial arrangements with new and existing counterparts worldwide. Turning now to slide 6, a look of some of 2018s most notable highlights. Financial results for the first year 2018 came in at the top end of our guidance ranges for both consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. As we generated more than $2.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and approximately $600 million in distributable cash flow for the full year.

Michael will cover these results in more detail. But our financial performance in 2018 improved throughout the year. And we are pleased to deliver full-year financial results at or above our upwardly revised guidance range. In 2018, we executed two important market transactions that I'll highlight briefly. First, we closed the merger with CQH in which we opportunistically and economically, simplified our corporate structure. Our corporate structure remains complex and we would prefer to be simpler, however, we will remain opportunistic and only pursue further simplification transaction to the extent they are economic LNG shareholders.

In addition to the CQH transaction in 2018, we also refinanced the remaining term loans at CQP into the bond market. Economically addressing the nearest term maturity in our complex and further demonstrating our commitment in managing our balance sheet throughout the corporate structure. Operationally in 2018, we produced and exported a total of 273 cargoes which required over 1 quadrillion BTUs of gas to our terminals. Our teams in gas supply and operations made the significant operational and logistical achievement look easy and their dedication and commitment to excellence are significant contributors to our reputation as a reliable operator.

Strategically 2018 was an incredible success, as we made a positive final investment decision on Train 3 at Corpus Christi and originated over 7 million tons per year of new long-term SPAs, giving us sufficient visibility on Train 6 at Sabine Pass that enables us to finalize the EPC contract. An issue limited notices to proceed on that project late last year. Having that project under way, the limited notice to proceed is strategically important for us. As we have cost and date certainty on Train 6 ahead of a formal FID which is where efforts are concentrated today.

The FID of Train 6 is one of my key priorities for 2019 which I'll address on slide 7. On this slide I have included a few key priorities which highlight that our focus remains centered on growth, execution and being disciplined toward the capital. We are focused on completing the remaining steps necessary to achieve FID of Train 6 which we expect to occur over the coming months. As we have previously communicated we expect to finance Train 6 with approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which is consistent with our strategy of deleveraging through growth.

Ahead of that FID, Bechtel is hard at work on Train 6 and making excellent progress at its scope of work. Bechtel now estimates that Train 6 is approximately 14% complete, highlighted by over that 3300 piles already driven as part of the site preparation. Beyond Train 6, we are focused on progressing Stage 3 at Corpus Christi through the permitting process which we are permitting for approximately 9.5 million tons of additional LNG capacity. This project is moving through the process very well. We expect to have all the required regulatory approvals in place by the end of 2019.

We expect to bring three trains into commercial operations during 2019. Train 5 at Sabine Pass and the first two trains at Corpus Christi. As we have done with all the trains to date, we expect these three to be brought online safely, ahead of schedule within budget. Completing commissioning and start-up as well as commencing long-term contracts associated with new trains, is a significant undertaking and requires a tremendous amount of work and coordination among Cheniere, our EPC partner Bechtel in our foundation customers.

These efforts are especially critical for 2019, as we will be starting up three trains and commencing long term SPAs for Train 5 at Sabine Pass, Train 1 at Corpus Christi and I am focused on maintaining our track record for seamless transitions from construction to operations. The performance test for Train 1 at Corpus Christi has been successfully completed and we expect substantial completion to occur in the next few days.

Last priority, I'd like to highlight is our plan to communicate the capital allocation policy. This is a high priority for the executive team who are working closely with our advisors and our Board of Directors to ensure we develop a durable flexible policy that enables us to allocate capital. The most effective impactful way for our shareholders. We look forward to communicating it to the investment community in the coming months. As I said earlier, 2018 was a remarkable year for Cheniere. And we are proud of the accomplishments we achieved throughout the year, we have many more successes we're pursuing both in 2019 and beyond. And my confidence in our ability to continue delivering on our promises underscored our people and the relentless focus on execution that continues to define Cheniere. And now, I'll turn it over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the market.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Jack, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 9, 2018 was a banner year for LNG in many regards. Globally 9 Trains started service increasing global supply by roughly 30 million tonnes. The largest year-on-year increase since 2009 when Qatar began to bring its mega trains online. New and expansion trains in Australia, Russia and the U.S. push total global supplies over the 320 million tonne mark, according to preliminary data. In the U.S., exports from our facilities totaled nearly 19 million tons during the year, a 33% increase over 2017. The Sabine Pass Train 4 started commercial deliveries in March and Train 5, which is currently undergoing commissioning exported its first cargo in November. Also in November, we saw start-up of the first greenfield LNG terminal in the lower 48 U.S. as Train 1 at our Corpus Christi facility started producing LNG and exported two commissioning cargoes before the end of the year.

We expect LNG production from our facilities and others in the U.S. to continue ramping up in the coming months and contribute to further enhancing the reliability, flexibility and liquidity of the global LNG market. Strong global LNG supply growth was met with robust demand in 2018, that led to some late year market rebalancing. Demand growth in Asia absorbed virtually all of the incremental supply, the step up in global production, especially in the fourth quarter when the global complex added more than 10.5 million tonnes year-on-year. Ensured adequate supply availability for Asia and the rest of the world as mild winter temperatures kept price spikes in check and supported an uptick in imports into Europe which added over 4 million tonnes year-on-year in 2018.

The graph on the top right displays the fourth quarter of 2018 demand compared to that what we saw in fourth quarter of 2017. As you can see China along with the rest of Asia had strong year-on-year increases in imports. For the month of November, China overtook Japan as the world's top importer although the position went back to Japan in December. Total European demand increased nearly 7 million tonnes in the quarter, which as I mentioned was partially supported by mild weather in Asia, new LNG supply coming online and high shipping rates that incentivized Atlantic source cargoes to target Europe.

I'll come back to weather in Europe in just a minute. Global gas price benchmarks in the fourth quarter saw higher levels and increased volatility compared to the same period in 2016 and 2017. However, even with a brief spike in Henry Hub prices in December. The U.S. benchmark continue to trade at a heavy discount compared to other global gas price indices. Despite a mild winter and a reduction in the storage deficit seen earlier in the year. TTF prices traded more than a $1.50 higher than levels seen during the same time a year ago.

Similarly, fourth quarter Asian spot prices settled at more than $3 higher on average year-on-year though the premium decreased over the course of the quarter. Please now turn to slide 10. More than 20 countries, almost half of all LNG importing countries had record annual LNG import levels in 2018 including China, South Korea, India and Pakistan. In addition to record import levels China and Pakistan also set records for LNG demand growth rates in 2018.

The graph to the far left highlights how remarkable China's demand has been over the past two years. China alone absorb more than 50% of the worldwide incremental supplies in 2018 adding 16 million tonnes above the 2017 level. China remains an important demand center for our product and the country's need for natural gas and LNG is expected to continue to rise as the country balances its economic growth needs and environmental commitments.

South Korea's steady demand over the last two years has also been impressive. Demand growth was largely due to low nuclear utilization as well as lower coal-fired power generation resulting from policies intended to improve air quality. Looking ahead to 2019 for South Korea, LNG consumption taxes are set to decrease while coal taxes are set to increase which of course is expected to be supportive of LNG demand. Pakistan which began importing LNG in 2015 has shown consistent in growing demand and regasification build-out in the early 2020s could make Pakistan a significantly larger importer than it is today.

The middle graph shows the total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in Asia. Populous areas of East Asia have seen mostly minor cold spells this winter and the month of January finished on an extremely mild note. Asia's heating degree days an indicative of factor of weather-driven demand ran close to average at best for much of the early part of the winter. Nonetheless, prices remained fairly robust, compared to last year. The graph on the far right shows spot prices in relation to crude oil for the past three years. Price levels in the first half of '18 were higher than in 2017 and particularly more bullish from June to November probably due to China's early buying ahead of the winter in order to secure more LNG and avoid shortages and price spikes in the winter.

High Asian LNG storage levels, combined with the arrival of new supply in the fourth quarter and a fairly mild winter resulted in more moderate prices in the fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 11 where I'll highlight the European market. LNG imports to Europe reached record levels in December. European LNG imports during the first three quarters of 2018 were actually lower year-on-year. But the fourth quarter showed very strong levels for a number of reasons. Storage levels were at a 17-year low after the 2017-18 winter in Europe leaving the region to play catch-up throughout the year.

The relative tightness in the global LNG market through the first three quarters left limited opportunities for storage replenishment. Early buying and mild temperatures in Asia left that region adequately supplied and elevated shipping rates. High coal and carbon prices and an uptick in global LNG production incentivized flows into Europe in the fourth quarter. Nuclear maintenance and domestic supply declines also supported imports. The middle graph shows a total accumulation of population weighted, heating degree days for the heating season in Europe through January 24.

Europe has also seen mild weather this winter, particularly in December making the regions heating degree days below average in the fourth quarter. Cooler temps in the back half of January have helped bring Europe's temperatures closer to average for the season which should help with the weather sensitive demand. However, given all of the factors encouraging LNG flows into Europe, we do not view the increase is entirely weather driven.

The graph on the far right displays storage levels on the left and TTF prices on the right axis. As mentioned earlier, the store situation Europe faced coming out of the winter of 2017 exerted upward pressure on TTF prices. Europe entered the third quarter with storage levels near the bottom of the 5-year range which contributed to upward pressure on TTF prices. In the fourth quarter, prices were still more than $3 an MMBTU, higher the level seen in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although they have moderated particularly after October settlement.

Europe is undergoing a structural shift in the overall dynamics of its gas market, which makes it an increasingly attractive region for both our long-term and shorter term LNG strategies. There is debate in Europe heightened in recent weeks about limiting coal use and achieving climate targets that could have a significant positive impact on Europe's appetite for LNG in the longer term. In the near term a number of the issues that were in play in the fourth quarter could remain in 2019. Potentially, resulting in continued robust European LNG imports again this year. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Anetol and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 13 for the fourth quarter, we generated net income of $67 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $634 million and distributable cash flow of approximately $130 million. Our results for the quarter were positively impacted by higher than forecast LNG volumes and revenue and lifting(ph) margins. As well as lower than forecast O&M expenses. For the full year, we generated net income of $471 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over $2.6 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $600 million.

As Jack mentioned consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for the full year were both at the top of the revised guidance ranges we provided on our third quarter call. Exported 285 TBtu of LNG from our liquefaction projects during the fourth quarter, of which 21 TBtu were commissioning volumes. Total volumes exported were higher than exports in the third quarter due to commissioning volumes from Sabine Pass Train 5 and Corpus Christi Train 1 and higher seasonal production from the four trains in operation at Sabine Pass.

Approximately 72% of the volumes exported during the quarter are 260 TBtu were listed by our third party long term SPA customers and the remaining 79 TBtu were lifted by our marketing functions. Long-term SPA customer volumes were consistent with prior quarter and marketing volumes were higher due to increased production and commissioning volumes. The full year and we exported 976 TBtu from our liquefaction projects, of which 21 TBtu were commissioning volumes. Approximately 77% of total volumes 756 TBtu were lifted by a third-party long term SPA customers and 220 TBtu were lifted by our marketing functions.

In the fourth quarter, we recognized an income 242 TBtu of LNG produced at Sabine Pass, consisting of 263 TBtu loaded during the quarter, plus 3 TBtu or one cargo loaded in the prior quarter, but delivered and recognized in the current quarter. Last 25 TBtu or 7 cargoes sold on a delivered basis that were in transit as of the end of the fourth quarter. We also recognized an income 40 TBtu or 12 cargoes of LNG that were sourced from third parties. The full year, we recognized an income 973 TBtu of LNG produced at Sabine Pass and 84 TBtu of LNG that were sourced from third parties. Five commissioning cargoes from Sabine Pass Train 5 in Corpus Christi Train 1 totaling 17 TBtu of LNG were recognized on our balance sheet as an offset of $140 million to LNG terminal construction in progress during the fourth quarter. One commissioning cargo exported during the fourth quarter was on the water at year-end and will be recognized as an offset to construction in progress during the first quarter of 2019.

Net income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter was $67 million or $0.26 per share consistent with the third quarter. Increased operating income due to additional LNG volumes recognized in revenue was offset by increased derivative loss related to interest rate swaps. Full year 2018, we generated net income attributable to common stockholders of $471 million or $1.90 per share on a diluted basis. An increase of more than $860 million from a net loss of 393 million in 2017.

Increase in net income was primarily due to increased income from operations as a result of additional trains in operation at Sabine Pass. Decreased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt, increased derivative gain and decreased net income attributable to non-controlling interests, partially offset by increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. During the fourth quarter we amended our existing revolving credit facility. Increasing total commitments to $1.25 billion and extending the maturity date to December 2022.

This undrawn revolving facility enhances our liquidity position and provides a backstop for Corpus equity funding obligations. Turn now to slide 14 where I'll review our 2019 guidance and touch on the highest priorities for 2019. Jack mentioned earlier, we remain focused on delivering results and today we are reiterating our full year 2019 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion. A distributable cash flow guidance of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion. We are also reconfirming our full year 2019 CQP distribution guidance of 235 to 255 per unit.

Our actual results could be impacted by changes to train completion timing or LNG market pricing. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to briefly review our top three financial priorities for 2019. First is to achieve financial results within these guidance ranges. Second priority is to complete the debt financing transaction for 50% of the total cost of Sabine Pass Train 6. (inaudible) that process and it is an essential step prior to reaching FID. Jack also mentioned this that our final key priority for this year is to develop and communicate capital allocation strategy. A process, which has been under way for several months now.

As we have previously indicated, we expect our capital allocation plan to support our ability to invest in growth, enable us to maintain investment grade credit metrics at the projects and ensure that consolidated leverage is at an appropriate level and return capital to shareholders in a way most appropriate (inaudible) our shareholders. We expect to communicate this policy to the investment community in the coming months. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question from Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Good morning, everyone.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Christine.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

I know it's early for Corpus Christi Stage 3 and it depends on the contracts, but how are you thinking about targeted financing for it, especially as you are in the process of developing your capital allocation policy. Should we also think of it as 50-50 bet equity similar to Train 6?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Christine. It's Michael. That's how we're thinking about it, continue to deleverage through growth, with no more than 50% debt on all incremental projects and maybe you can bring that down over time.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Okay and then I think on the last quarter call you said that 2.5 to 3 mtpa was the assumption for early cargoes this year. Has the contracting for this book increased since last quarter and how should we think about your strategy around this, as we move through the year? And should we still think $5 margin for the uncontracted portion, this is what we should assume?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes, this is Michael again. So I think the number is more like 6 million tonnes. I think is of post COD volumes with another 1.5 million on top of that a commissioning volumes which won't hit the P&L. I don't know exactly how the portfolios evolved over the past few months, but certainly we've been selling one thing to keep in mind is we don't like to sell volumes until we know we have them, right until we go through this commissioning process. There's always uncertainty about exactly when the train is going to come on. So we don't want to get out of our skies having placed a lot of volume prior to getting the train.

So with that starting to become behind us as Jack mentioned Corpus passed the performance test recently. So we have more certainty there. So the guys will definitely be more active in putting those volumes away. In terms of market you guys can all see the screen like we can. I told you for the unsold piece of our portfolio we were assuming $4.5 to $5.5 margins when we did our budget, three or four months ago. Clearly that has come in, probably almost $2 and so we gave you that sensitivity on the last call that said, for every dollar move in margin it affect our EBITDA by $130 million. So you can do that math. So if we were in upper half of our guidance range three or four months ago certainly were lower in that range today, but still within it.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Okay, thank you so much.

We'll now take our next question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

Good morning. Just wanted to build on SPL 6 a little bit more here and see what else is needed for positive FID seems like a contractual support is largely there. Is it just lining up the financing and then also looks like the EPC contract price $2.5 billion is a bit lower than what you had pressed PL5 and just wondering what drives the deltas there.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Hi, Jeremy. Thanks. SPL 6 we're extremely excited about as I mentioned on my talking points we've released Bechtel with limited notice to proceed. So we've locked in the price. We've locked in the schedule in regards to that and Bechtel is making extremely good progress as you know. There's a lot of synergies with having the workforce just roll off of five into six. Additionally, what you're seeing are with the cost of 6, we think it's extremely competitive just like Corpus Christi Train 3 and we were able to utilize not only the synergies of having the workforce, already mobilized in the equipment already there to move right into train 6, but also into utilizing some of the existing infrastructure that it affords us having the brownfield site. So we've got the infrastructure that was already built for the first five trains that we've rolled into Train 6 and that's part of the cost reduction. Michael, I don't know if you have anything to add.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I mean on the financing that we're progressing that as we speak. As I said on the last call, as Jack said, we have Bechtel working right there full speed ahead, we know price, we know schedule, we don't owe them a full mtpa until all of the summer. And so, as I said on the last call, we're just kind of waiting to see what contracts come in and what the best portfolio is to really attached to that train for financing purposes and since the last call you saw Petronas come in, it's a very clean FOB deal, which we like to put down at the project.

So we have three or four months to see what else comes in and then decide the optimum mix and close that financing. But that's not slowing us down in anyway because we're under way on Train 6 and then I'd add to Jack's comment on remember when we built Train 5, the first four trains leveraged a lot of infrastructure that we had at the regas facility all the utilities and things like that with Train 5, we had to really add all of that and we did that in anticipation of Train 6. So Train 5 was always going to be the higher cost train ,Train 6 was is far more attractive on a cost perspective, because so much infrastructure is in place from the Train 5. So yeah just like Train 3.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

That's helpful, thanks. Just wanted to switch gears over to ESG seems like this is the greater focal point for the marketplace for investors going forward here. And we're just wondering if you could tell us how Cheniere thinks about these issues? How you're positioning yourself and how you guys see yourselves stacking up versus other energy infrastructure company?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

So we're very excited here recently organizationally, we were able to bring on a Fiji George who is from Southwest who's got a lot of experience in ESG type programs and he's been spearheading our effort, as well as Chris Smith, who is our Senior Vice President of External Affairs in Washington DC, and you all may know Chris he was Assistant Secretary of Energy under the previous administrations. So we think we need to be a leader in it as you know we feel like we're on the right side of the equation when it comes to ESG we think natural gas is the solution. It's economic, it's secure and it's sustainable and what you see around the world is a policy shift I think it's going to be a secular shift in the way energy is utilized worldwide and I think you're going to see natural gas and liquefied natural gas take a much more prominent role in that.

Well, we will be rolling out our ESG methodology and program here very, very soon. Anatol, do you have anything there?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

No, just exactly as you said, we're focused, we are looking to leverage our position on the gas procurement side as well as our ability to supply this clean reliable fuel to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world achieve that type of carbon dioxide reductions that the U.S. has enjoyed over the last decade.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

That's all from me. Thanks for taking my question.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Michael Webber from Wells Fargo Securities. Mr Webber. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Thanks. Hi, good morning guys, how are you ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Good morning.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Jack, just wanted to start off with you a market-based question, overnight we saw tensions escalate in Pakistan and India, because obviously I have some exposure there to India. I'm just curious, can you maybe you run the risk and the impact your business, can you maybe walk us through the impact theoretically of a force majeure there on your import contracts if we saw a replay of 1999 or a broader conflict. And then maybe I guess within the context of kind of walking through that -- volumes just gets put into the spot market and make them on the back end. I know it's early but seems pretty pressing so..?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, there is no force majeure Michael right it's FOB, so our contract with GAIL they pick up at the flange as Sabine Pass, and they can take it wherever they want to take it and that's one of the benefits of the U.S. LNG and the Cheniere model. So from that perspective, we don't see anything meaningful one way or the other.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay, that's it wouldn't be applicable to an FOB-based contracts that basically, what you're saying ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

It's not, no we would expect them to honor their contract and we would enforce our contract but so far relationship with GAIL is extremely strong, and we will continue to try to meet their needs so.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay now that's helpful I appreciate that. And then maybe just around the competitive dynamics in and around the U.S. Gulf I guess it's been again a bit more crowded in the last quarter or two with FID at Golden Pass and VG kind of knocking on the door I guess maybe a little bit more insight. I guess within the industry in terms of where those deals are getting done, do you have a better sense yet around whether you've been able to price or able to command a premium for your volumes relative to your peers in U.S. Gulf, and if so maybe kind of a vague sense on where you think that is ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

So a couple of things, one, I think when you see a lot of other folks that want to have a position like Cheniere and then it just reconfirms that our business model, our position is second to none right worldwide and so I'm very, very excited about that as you know we were a first mover and we've executed extremely well right, you can compare us to just about everybody else in the U.S. and see that our construction effort has been second to none. Our operating ability in the hand off from construction operations has been second to none, our ability to produce real volume in a growing demand market has been second to none so I feel very good about our ability to execute.

And I do think our full-service model and our ability to deliver anywhere around the world has afforded us a slight premium to were the spot market is clearing today.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay, thanks for the time guys. I appreciate it.

Operator

We'll take the next question from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers, please go ahead.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

Good morning guys.

Hi Craig, Michael In May, 2018 at your Analyst Day I think you guided that on a 9 train program that you won't required to think about debt amortization out of operating cash flows at both the MLP, SPL level and also at the LNG Corpus Christi level to late 2020s, can you kind of share what maybe all equity funding of $300 a ton upsizing of all the liquefaction trains and the possible successful addition of a 50-50 Corpus Christi Phase 3, would do to that would push amortization requirements under the 20s and 30s ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, absolutely I don't know what the exact date is that we'd look to get into the details on that when we hit the road probably after our next call to roll-out capital allocation and Train 6, the Train 6 numbers and probably add some Stage 3 numbers into the whole model but absolutely I mean it's every piece of equity differs that amortization date.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

Yes speaking of Phase 3, since Corpus Train 3, you signed four agreements with a total of five in a quarter mtpa which obviously is more than you could possibly need for 4.5 6, how much do you feel like you already have in the bag so to speak Corpus Phase 3 and what minimum percentage of the 9.5 mtpa, would you like to Train 6 contracted before perhaps an FID next year ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, I mean, we definitely have more contracts than we need for Train 6 for sure we've drawn down kind of some of our CMI inventory to service some of that, but the plan would be to, we would think that piece of our business competitive advantage to keep some capacity there. How much do we need on Stage 3 I think we're running a couple of cases, one where we built the whole thing and one where we built, half of it and certainly we're making our way toward at least building, half of it but not quite there yet so.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

And I would say, Craig, we're extremely excited about Corpus Christi, and our ability to expand, we think there are no constraints with the site, there's no constraints with natural gas pipeline capacity coming into the side, the amount of infrastructures is there and then our location to the Permian should be a real advantage -- all the way around so that we're not going to slow down on the growth side I think I've got some of the best originators in this industry, and we're going to capitalize upon that.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

That sounds great. Jack, if I could kind of dovetail on the those comments do you see prospects related to Corpus Phase 3, for signing both supply and off take agreements linked to Brent or perhaps a Texas-based gas (inaudible)?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Anatol you want to take that.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Greg yes, I think one of the things that was surprising in some sense amazing in the LNG market in 2018 was that the majority of the contracts that were executed were Henry Hub linked and obviously it was us and our neighbors at VG that had the that success, the world has got comfortable with this as an attractive model it offers liquidity, price transparency and it has seen a number of times now when if Henry Hub has a quick excursion to prices above $3 it comes down very rapidly and continues to be very competitive with Brent linked and other contracts. We continue to think that that is the right flag to fly, your question about alternative indices that's a very long part and in our view of the world isn't ready to price meaningful volume. Aguadulce(ph) while it's something that you and we know well just does not have the liquidity, transparency term structure that would make it marketable internationally.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

That's very helpful. Very quick last one for Michael, I think May last year at Analyst Day, you said $1.9 billion of incremental forecast equity funding for Corpus Christi Trains 1 to 3 with things progressing seemingly better than expected. Any range of how much that might come under?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I don't think we're ready to I mean Train 3 has a long way to go. So I would stick with that number for now. Train 6 we're going to end up with probably close to $300 million of contingency though. And so that will get rolled into Train 6 to help meet our 50-50 debt equity to Train 5 we had excess contingency which will roll into Train 6 to achieve our 50-50 debt equity. But on Corpus side stick with the numbers we put out in May.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

Operator

Will, now take our next question from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Thanks and good morning. My first question is for Michael. You have pretty clear visibility to the contractive portion of your cash flow profile, just curious with that in mind, how you sort of evaluating the various capital allocation decisions going forward?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, we do have a lot of visibility. Again, we'll roll that out in a few months, probably after our next call will hit the road and talk about it. But it's pretty straightforward for us, there's three buckets. Right there is the growth bucket, the balance sheet bucket and the shareholder returns bucket. And I can tell you we're really excited about the growth. So that's going to be a big number as we look at not only Train 6 but stage 3, reinvesting in the business is the best use of our money at the returns. We think we can generate and then we'll have to decide if we want to do something else on the balance sheet, relative to what we've already said publicly. So we're thinking through that and then there's probably some money left over for some kind of shareholder return, flexibility is going to be key for us. We will keep that in mind as we think about bucket number 3. But look to put some real numbers to that here in the coming months.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

And as you think about bucket number 3. Is that something that you think you'd be able to actually implement this year or farther out to assuming some sort of a run rate and (inaudible).

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, we'll see. I mean, probably both, but we'll see.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. I thank you for that other question is for Jack. You spoke earlier in your prepared remarks about being opportunistic to a CQP simplification I mean it seems that there will be a little bit more difficult to achieve versus what you were able to do with CQH. How should we think about how you ultimately end up rolling up the MLP. Thank you.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

I think that I said it fairly clearly we're going to be very opportunistic. The math doesn't work and we're going to have a complicated structure for the foreseeable future and until we convince all of you that our growth really is there. I think we'll get hopefully get you'll comfortable and we can actually execute what we say and that we're a conservative bunch overall. But right now the exchange ratio just don't work.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Got you. Last question from me. With respect to Stage 3 have we ultimately just abandoned midscale , that seems to be, let's talk about now. There seems to be shift in zones just having sort of conventional trains going forward. How should we think about that?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

No, we are moving full speed ahead with our midscale solution right now which is our Corpus Christi stage 3 sorry not train 3, stage 3 that would filing, which we have in front of FERC right now.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Those are my question. Thank you.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Thanks.

As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up and rejoin the queue for additional questions. Our next questioner comes from Jean Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Hi, good morning. How much advanced locking in is there of pricing for spot cargoes. Have we seen the full effect of the fourth quarter winter gas spike on margins or it will sum up your next quarter.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Well. Thank you. It's Anatol, it's really a mix as Michael said, we have three trains coming on with a fair amount of timing uncertainty on cargoes and we're not in the business of going short in the market. We, as we've said to you before, we do have some tranches, obviously we have early cargoes associated with some term deals that we've executed over the last year, as well as some medium-term deals for '19 and '20, but for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into the specifics of the volumes quarter by quarter.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Okay, fair enough. And then, do you see a risk in 2019 that have everything starts up as scheduled some U.S. LNG facilities won't be running at full capacity for parts of the year.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

It Anatol again. I really cannot envision that scenario. Actually, I have to say I can't envision the first premise of that scenario either. But even if that did play out, the probability that on a marginal basis, there is no value in exporting a $2.5 Henry Hub molecule to a strong global market is pretty close to zero to me.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Okay, that's all from me. Thank you.

Next question comes from Fotis Giannakoulis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Yes, hi. Thank you all. Anatol, I have one question for you. The last three FIDs they can be reached without long term SPAs from the respective parties. Is this a new trend and how does this change the the long-term dynamics of the market and your potential margins and growth initiatives beyond the stage 3 of Corpus Christi.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks Fotis. It's not a surprise to you or to us, it's a global and competitive market and lots of places have attractive molecules that they want to monetize with eight different capital allocation algorithm and different risk tolerance than we do. So we are always expecting what in the U.S., we may have called a producer push component, the LNG market calls it the equity lifting model. Those are projects that we always believed would be able to get off the ground, whether that's East Africa, Western Canada, Arctic Russia et cetera and where we are expecting fully expecting to compete with them. We have been competing with them and there weren't a surprise to anyone in 2018 where we had pretty close to a record year. So we love the hand that we're dealt, we love as Jack said the business model and the track record that we've built and we're confident that we'll be able to leverage that into continued success. But it is a competitive market.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

So from your answer. Shall I take that your strategy of backing every new expansion, with long-term SPAs will remain intact or this new FIDs might change your risk appetite.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Well, look, we told you a couple of years ago, our model was continued to refine that we think that the range of CMI having the warehouse staff 5% to 20% sort of as the side boards of volume in it is a very good number and we're still comfortable with that and we've had good success. As Michael mentioned, we've in essence drawn down that inventory will look to reallocate volumes to that in order to continue to prosecute the type of bridging volume and secure reliable attractive value proposition that we've been successful with. So there is no reason to change what's been working and is expected to continue working for the foreseeable future.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you very much, Anatol. Congratulation for the great year.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Fotis.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Two questions, one on the last quarterly call, you kind of updated the range of potential output. Our capacity for each training kind of raise the high end. Can you talk to us about kind of how you get comfortable with hitting that high-end and is even upside to that level. I'd love response on that and then I've got a follow-on about the balance sheet.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Michael, it's Jack. Yeah. So from an operating perspective. I would say that we are very comfortable now with the upper end of the range that we gave all of you. We have some de-bottlenecking initiatives that we have plans of achieving this year with some of our turnaround and maintenance schedules and you should expect us to revise our output but I think most of you are probably on Genscape and can see our gas flows into our facility and noq hat we're very close to 5 Bcf/d right now so we're very, very pleased with the way our trains have been performing.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. And then one quick one on the balance sheet, just curious how do you think about, let's say, once you get Train 6 online and that's we're talking a couple years down the road what you think about as a normal credit metrics that you'd like to achieve kind of a long run target or a long-run goal and whether that is measured on an FFO to debt or debt to EBITDA perspective ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Before Michael answers that question, I just want to make sure already this morning with the L&T of Train 6 that the price in the schedule are fixed and not a risk for us so we haven't had any cost overruns yet we don't expect to start now on our Trains number 8 and 9. So I just want to make sure I got that clear.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Understood. I've known you for a long time have, I've not seen, you have very many cost overruns in the 12 to 15 years.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Go ahead Michael.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

The balance sheet, the rating agencies, look at it several different ways the projects they care about debt service coverage ratios and then deconsolidated numbers consolidated numbers and for us, I think we had, we need to keep it simple and just communicate like everybody else, which is just a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA number.

And so that over the long run I think that's what we'll start to look at more and more though the rating agencies are more nuance given our multiple levels of debt.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Do have a kind of a mental target in mind of where you'd like that debt-to-EBITDAR number to be Train 6 is up and running ?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well they are the part of our grant roll-out in a few months currently we're at 5 times to 6 times consolidated probably on the upper end of that range from what we said last time so that's what we'll stick with for now.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Alex Kania -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Thanks. I just wanted to touch on the commentary related to maybe the financing package for Sabine Pass 6 Michael, I think you talked about thinking about optimizing what contracts you which has that facility are you talking mainly about the CMI contracts that you've already got secured or maybe are you, is there kind of discussions far enough along in another FOB type contract that you may want to wait to see play out for you, you finalize that ?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I mean we have a free option right now which is that we don't have to give full mtpa summer so yes, we just wait and see what happens I mean I like our position now if we had to make a decision tomorrow I don't think we have any problem with that but given that we have free time to wait working hard yes, I mean we'll wait and see if anything else comes down the pipe between now and then we have Vitol and PETRONAS which you're FOB deals and then we have a fair amount of does deals so yes we'll just wait.

204,Empty,2019-02-27T10:00:00Z,The Nova Scotia equivalent of an organization that became a major player in the last Ontario provincial election is making robocalls here about health care.,"The Nova Scotia equivalent of an organization that became a major player in the last Ontario provincial election is making robocalls here about health care.

Nova Scotia Proud is a registered non-profit that lists its directors as Devin Drover, Hugh McNamara and Reagan Seidler. The robocall asks recipients if they are concerned about long wait times for health care.

""Our concern is not red or blue or orange — our concern is with politicians that implement bad policies,"" Drover said via email.

Targeting Trudeau, McNeil

Drover said the group was created to raise awareness about ""the bad governance we are experiencing in Nova Scotia"" and to provide a voice for people concerned about the health-care system, high taxes and government waste.

""Our goal is to help shift public discourse so that politicians are better listening to everyday Nova Scotians, and to make sure we have a government we can be proud of,"" he said.

Devin Drover is a director of Nova Scotia Proud. (Facebook)

Drover has volunteered with the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador, but he said Nova Scotia Proud is not affiliated with any political party.

The majority of political posts on its Facebook page relate to defeating the Liberal governments of Premier Stephen McNeil and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. People who've commented on posts indicate a strong preference for Progressive Conservative and Conservative alternatives.

As with other provincial Proud groups and the Canada Proud group, the Nova Scotia organization's Facebook page shares various news stories, predominantly related to health care and the justice system, often from the Conservative news website, The Nectarine. It also cross-posts from other Proud pages, although Drover said they are separate organizations.

In December, CBC reported Ontario Proud received almost $460,000 in corporate donations to help with efforts in support of Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford's election campaign. The group first gained notice in 2017 as its Facebook page targeted then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne.

Election rules are different for Nova Scotia, in that registered third parties can only receive contributions from individuals and spending limits are capped at $10,000 for a general election and $2,000 for a byelection.

Ontario Proud's Facebook page has 428,000 likes, while that of Nova Scotia Proud — which was created much more recently — has 3,500.

Looking at upcoming elections

Drover said it's the organization's policy not to disclose findings or details of its research surveys, and he declined to say how the robocalls were paid for or how the group is funded.

""We will accept donations from any entity that shares our values, whether that is a sole individual or an organization,"" he said.

As for whether Nova Scotia Proud would attempt to become involved in upcoming elections, Drover said the group is ""actively exploring how we can get our message out during any election campaign, while maintaining compliance with all election rules and regulations.""

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jerry Mattys, Tactile Medical's Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir.

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. I'm joined on the call today by our Chief Financial Officer Brent Moen.

Let me provide you with a brief outline of today's call. I'll begin my prepared remarks with a review of our financial performance highlights for the full year 2018, during which, I'll also discuss the primary drivers of our revenue performance. Then I'll turn to a discussion of our 2018 operating highlights, including the commercialization of our new products Flexitouch Plus and Flexitouch Head and Neck, and our strategic transaction with Sun Scientific and Wright Therapy Products.

Following this discussion I'll walk you through our financial performance during the fourth quarter before turning it over to Brent for a detailed review of our financial results as well as our financial guidance for 2019, which we introduced in our earnings press release this afternoon.

I'll then conclude with a few remarks on our strategy and outlook for 2019 before we open the call for your questions.

Simply stated, 2018 was a phenomenal year for Tactile Medical. We achieved revenue of $143.8 million for the full year, representing 32% growth year-over-year, exceeding our 2018 guidance range. Our 2018 revenue growth was driven by sales of our Flexitouch Systems which increased 31% year-over-year to $131.9 million.

Sales of our Entre and ACTitouch Systems also contributed to our 2018 revenue performance, increasing 32% year-over-year to $11.8 million. In 2018, our revenue growth benefited from four primary drivers that we've discussed on our quarterly earning calls throughout the year.

First, our third-generation Flexitouch System, the Flexitouch Plus, was successfully introduced to our prescribing customer base in the second quarter. The features and benefits of this new design allow prescribers to consider Flexitouch for more of their patients. Its ease of use, better fitting garments and reduced treatment time for patients with bilateral disease drove a higher number of prescriptions. With the earlier than anticipated award of a new federal supply schedule contract by the National Acquisition Center of the US Department of Veterans Affairs, we also saw stronger than expected sales of our Flexitouch Plus Systems to VA customers in the fourth quarter.

Second the continued expansion of our sales team which we've grown to include more than 200 in the field at the end of 2018 compared to more than 160 representatives at the end of 2017.

Third, our targeted selling strategy, which focuses our sales team on the most productive accounts in the lymphedema market.

And fourth, the increased in network coverage that we've obtained with commercial insurers in this and prior years, which lowers out-of-pocket expenses for patients and makes our products more affordable. This expanded insurance coverage includes a new national contract with a large third-party payer, which was effective mid-year. The expanded patient access we gained from this new contract provided an additional contribution to our revenue growth in the fourth quarter.

In addition to these primary drivers, we also achieved exceptionally strong sales in the VA healthcare system throughout 2018. Sales into the VA in 2018 increased 42% year-over-year and represented approximately 20% of our total revenue compared to approximately 18% in 2017.

Our success in the VA throughout 2018 was primarily due to the continued effectiveness of our team of dedicated VA specialists, whose expertise helps our sales team navigate the VA system and optimize their selling efforts there.

In addition to our revenue growth, we also reported gross margins of 71%, consistent with our annual target of 70%-plus gross margins and improved our profitability with net income growth of 13% year-over-year to $6.6 million and adjusted EBITDA growth of 74% year-over-year to $17.2 million.

Our operational progress in 2018 was as robust as our financial results. In April, we followed our successful limited market release with the full commercial launch of Flexitouch Plus. The market's response to the features and benefits of this latest generation Flexitouch System has been incredibly positive, resulting in strong adoption particularly in the second half of 2018.

Thanks to the efforts of our payer relations team, we were awarded a new federal supply schedule contract for Flexitouch Plus in September earlier than we expected, which allowed us to introduce our Flexitouch Plus System to the VA channel during the fourth quarter.

Based on the momentum we saw last year, we are confident Flexitouch Plus will continue to remain an important driver of our growth throughout 2019. We also continue to experience steady demand for Flexitouch Head and Neck from customers in lymphedema clinics and the VA, the existing call points where our sales team is currently focused. Importantly, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we added a dedicated marketing and sales professional to lead the development and implementation of our longer-term strategy to drive broad-based adoption of Flexitouch Head and Neck by expanding our marketing and sales efforts to new call points.

In tandem, we've been focused on expanding of our portfolio of clinical support for Flexitouch Head and Neck, which will enable us to gain broad-based reimbursement coverage for that product. I'm excited to announce that these efforts resulted in the publication of our second clinical study of Flexitouch Head and Neck in the Journal Otolaryngology Head and Neck surgery on January 29th of this year. This important study included 10 head and neck cancer survivors that were diagnosed with Head and Neck lymphedema.

Patients imaged before and after a single treatment with our Head and Neck System, and again, after two weeks of daily at-home use with Flexitouch Head and Neck in order to assess the impact of the therapy on lymphatic drainage. The imaging results showed enhanced lymphatic drainage in all subjects after a single Flexitouch treatment. In addition, the researchers also found that after two weeks of treatment, areas of dermal black flow were either reduced or disappeared entirely in six of the eight patients that initially presented with dermal black flow at steady of onset.

In 2019, we expect to build on the compelling findings of this study with additional clinical publications, as we continue to increase the market adoption and reimbursement coverage of Flexitouch Head and Neck.

In 2018, we also laid the groundwork for the future development of our product portfolio with two important strategic transactions.

In June, we acquired the rights to a portfolio of 31 issued and pending patents consisting of intellectual property related to Wright Therapy Products pneumatic compression therapy devices. We believe these patterns will further expand and strengthen our growing IP portfolio and may also help us develop new technological features that could be incorporated into future generations of our Flexitouch Systems.

And in October, we announced an exclusive license agreement with Sun Scientific for the intellectual property of their Aero-Wrap compression therapy products in The United States and Canada. We intend to market these products under the trade name of Airwear. (ph) This agreement provides us with a unique and differentiated technology that we believe represents the innovative static compression product on the market today. Airwear is also highly complementary to our current product portfolio as almost every patient that utilizes one of our product also uses a static compression product.

And most importantly we believe that it will improve our ability to access patients suffering from lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency and chronic wounds earlier in their treatment pathway. We are currently focused on securing our supply chain in order to initiate a limited launch of Airwear, which we expect will begin in the second half of 2019.

Moving to a review of our performance in the fourth quarter. We achieved revenue of $46.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, which represented 33% growth year-over-year. Our impressive revenue growth was again driven by sales of our Flexitouch Systems, which grew 32% year-over-year to $42.7 million in the fourth quarter.

Sales of our Entre and ACTitouch Systems also contributed to our strong fourth quarter performance, growing 51% year-over-year to $3.7 million. This increase in sales was driven by the transition of order processing from the field team to our internal team of specialists.

In addition to the four primary drivers of our 2018 revenue performance that I mentioned earlier, which include our Flexitouch Plus product launch, expanded sales force, targeted selling strategy and increased reimbursement coverage. Our growth in the fourth quarter benefited from exceptionally strong sales of our latest generation Flexitouch System in the commercial and VA channels.

Beginning with the commercial channel. As a reminder during the fourth quarter, many of our potential patients covered under commercial insurance plans have met their annual deductibles, which reduces the out-of-pocket cost of our systems. Because of the seasonal dynamic, our sales force is typically very focused on serving commercial patients during this time to drive sales, and the fourth quarter of 2018 was no exception.

Sales of our Flexitouch Plus Systems to commercial patients also benefited from a new contract that we signed with a large commercial payer effective in July of 2018. We have previously accessed some of this payers plans through a buying group, but the new contract provides us with in-network, direct access to patients covered by all of their plans, albeit at a lower contracted price.

As discussed on our Q3 call, we estimated the ASP impact of this new contract could have been as large as $2 million in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report that we were able to more than offset the ASP impact with increased sales to patients covered under this payer's plans. We had anticipated that the expanded access would be a tailwind to revenue growth and we were able to leverage the new contract to increase volume with this payer faster than we had expected, which favorably impacted our fourth quarter sales growth.

We also achieved strong sales of our Flexitouch Plus products in the VA channel. Fourth quarter VA sales grew 37% year-over-year and represented approximately 18% of our total revenue compared to approximately 17% in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Recall that in September 2018, we were awarded a new federal supply schedule contract for our Flexitouch Systems earlier than expected. The inclusion of Flexitouch Plus on the FSS contract is an important milestone for our business, because it allows VA clinicians and staff to easily order the device, enabling us to begin offering it to our existing VA customers and their patients.

We were pleased to see very strong adoption from our VA customers in response to the introduction of the Flexitouch Plus, which resulted in higher than expected VA sales during the fourth quarter.

In conclusion, we were able to bring the year to a very strong close with sales performance that exceeded our expectations during the most important quarter of our year.

With that I'll turn the call over to Brent for a review of our fourth quarter financial results and a review of our guidance for 2019, which we introduced in this afternoon's press release. Brent?

Brent A. Moen -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Jerry. Our total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 33% to $46.4 million compared to $34.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Our revenue performance in the quarter was driven by sales of our Flexitouch System, which increased $10.3 million or 32% year-over-year to $42.7 million. The increase in Flexitouch System sales was largely driven by expansion of our sales force, the successful rollout of our new Flexitouch Plus system, growth in the Veterans Administration channel, increased physician and patient awareness of the treatment options for lymphedema and expanded contractual coverage with national and regional insurance payers. In addition as Jerry discussed, we experienced increased volume from the new large player contract, that was effective July 1st 2018 as the expanded coverage benefits of that contract will realize faster than we initially anticipated.

Flexitouch sales accounted for 92% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 93% last year. Entre and ACTitouch Systems sales increased approximately $1.3 million or 51% year-over-year to $3.7 million in the quarter.

This performance was better than expected and reflects an increase in the productivity related to our strategic shift to manage these orders in-house as well as the contribution from higher-than-expected volume from the new large commercial payer contract.

Fourth quarter revenue by payer was 70% commercial 18% VA and 12% Medicare compared to 77%, 17% and 6% respectively last year. Fourth quarter gross profit increased $6 million or 23% to $32 million compared to $26.1 million last year. GAAP gross margin of 69% of sales in the fourth quarter was compared to 75% of gross margin sales in the fourth quarter of 2017.

The current period gross margin was primarily impacted by four items. First, a $721000 non-cash inventory write-off of our ACTitouch inventory. Second incremental pricing headwinds related to the new large commercial payer contract. Third, mix impacts related to our composition of revenue in the fourth quarter by product as well as by payer when compared to last year. And to a lesser extent non-cash amortization expense related to the intangible assets licensed from Sun Scientific.

Excluding the impact of the non-cash inventory write-off, our non-GAAP adjusted gross margin was 70.5% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 74.7% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Fourth quarter operating expenses increased $8.8 million or 41% to $29.9 million compared to $21.1 million last year.

The increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by an increase of $5.1 million or 40% year-over-year in sales and marketing expenses due to continued investment in field and inside sales team expansion, increased commissions on higher revenue and marketing initiatives.

Operating expenses also included a $1.8 million non-cash impairment charge related to our ACTitouch intangible assets.

Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased $2.8 million or 57% to $2.1 million compared to operating income of $4.9 million last year. Excluding the $2.5 million non-cash impairment charges non-GAAP adjusted operating margin decreased approximately $300,000 or 5% to $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

We recorded an income tax benefit of $84,000 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to an income tax expense of $2.8 million last year. The tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily related to the impact of tax-deductible stock-based compensation activity.

Fourth quarter 2017 income tax expense included approximately $1.2 million of incremental expense associated with the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased approximately $125,000 year-over-year to $2.4 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.2 million or $0.12 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017.

Weighted average shares used to compute diluted net income per share were $19.5 million and $19.1 million for the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 respectively. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased approximately $1.4 million or 21% to $8.2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 19.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. As a reminder, we have provided a reconciliation of certain GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures in our earnings press release.

Turning to a brief review of our fiscal year results for the 12 months ended December 31st, 2018. Total revenue increased $34.5 million or 32% to $143.8 million compared to $109.3 million for the 12 months ended December 31 2017.

Increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $31.6 million or 31% year-over-year in sales of the Flexitouch Systems. Sales of our Flexitouch Head and Neck products performed well and continue to represent low to mid-single-digit percentage of total Company revenue on par with our expectations for this year.

2018 revenue by payer was 71% commercial, 20% VA and 9% Medicare compared to 74%, 18% and 8% respectively last year. Net income for 2018 increased $768,000 or 13% to $6.6 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to net income of approximately $5.9 million or $0.31 per diluted share last year.

Weighted average shares used to compute diluted net income per share were $19.3 million and $18.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31st, 2018 and '17 respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 increased $7.3 million or 74% to $17.2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $9.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2018 increased 290 basis points to 12% compared to 9.1% for 2017. At December 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $45.9 million compared to $43. 9 million at December 31, 2017. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on its $10 million revolving credit facility at year-end.

Let me now turn to review our 2019 revenue guidance which we introduced in our earnings release this afternoon. For 2019, we expect total revenue in the range of $173 million to $175.5 million, which represents growth of 20% to 22% year-over-year compared to revenue of $143.8 million in 2018. This revenue guidance assumes sales of our Flexitouch products increase 20% to 22% year-over-year in 2019, sales of our Entre products increase approximately 23% year-over-year. We expect Head and Neck sales in the low to mid-single-digits as a percentage of total revenue, and further, we expect sales of Airwear to be immaterial to 2019.

Additionally for full year 2019, we expect our gross margin to remain in the low 70% range, our adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 13%, including an expectation of stock compensation expense of approximately $9 million. In addition, our EBITDA margin includes approximately $2 million of expenses related to the planned move to our new corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2019. Of this approximately $400,000 are moving expenses, which will only impact of our full year 2019 P&L. The remaining expense comes from accelerated depreciation on our current facility and higher rent expenses related to the occupancy at both the current and new facility this year.

And lastly for purposes of calculating earnings per share, we expect our fully diluted weighted average share count for the year to be 20 million shares.

With that, I'll now turn the call back to Jerry for some closing remarks. Jerry?

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you Brent. With an enhanced and expanding portfolio of differentiated products, multiple tailwinds in our business and another year of strategic execution, we remain very well positioned to continue to drive strong, sustained and profitable growth. In 2019, we're again committed to growing our revenue by 20% or more, while also continuing to improve our profitability.

Our 2019 revenue growth will be fueled primarily by the market's increasing adoption of our Flexitouch Plus System, along with the recent expansion of our field sales team, which exceeded our hiring goals last year and our commitment to growing our sales headcount by approximately 20% again this year. The impact of our targeted sales strategy as we continue to focus our reps on those clinicians diagnosing the highest number of lymphedema patients and improving our selling effectiveness in the VA and our widespread in-network coverage with commercial insurers.

With respect to our account targeting strategy, we performed another data analysis of medical claims in December of 2018. The data showed there were 1.1 million patients diagnosed with lymphedema in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2018 compared to 700,000 patients in the 12-month period ending December 31, 2013 the first time we performed this analysis. This represents a compounded annual growth rate of 11% over the last four and half years. While we're proud of the strong growth we've reported in recent years and the mounting evidence that the awareness of lymphedema is growing, remember, we remain in the early stages of penetrating the large and addressable market opportunity in the United States. Specifically, the most recent claims data showed more than 4,700 high diagnosing facilities in the United States and nearly 50% of these facilities had at least one clinician doing business with Tactile Medical. This compares to a little more than 40% of the high diagnosing facilities as of the last claims data pool in 2017.

We believe this new claims data not only reinforces the progress we have made in penetrating the market over the last two years, but also shows the significant opportunity that remains as we focus our sales force on the many high diagnosing facilities that are not currently doing business with Tactile Medical. We are intently focused on introducing our differentiated at-home lymphedema treatment option to all of these high diagnosing facilities in the coming years.

In addition to driving further growth in sales of our Flexitouch Plus System in 2019, we will continue to focus on the development and implementation of our strategy to expand the commercialization of Flexitouch Head and Neck outside of our existing call points, while conducting additional clinical studies and publishing a sufficient body of clinical evidence to support our reimbursement strategy. We will also plan and prepare for the limited market release of our new Airwear product in the second half of 2019.

More broadly, we remain convinced that our differentiated business model, reimbursement expertise and industry-leading products supported by strong clinical data, will continue to serve as important tailwinds to our commercial success in the United States lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency markets and ensure our position as the market leader. Not only are we the market leader, but the addressable market opportunity for Tactile Medical continues to grow at an impressive pace as evidenced by the double-digit compounded annual growth rate over the past four and half years. In addition, our addressable patient population remains vastly under-penetrated given that Tactile Medical shipped over 32,000 Flexitouch Systems during 2018.

With this in mind, despite our rapid pace of growth, we're still in the early stages of penetrating our addressable market opportunity in the US.

We also identified that there are more than 2,300 high diagnosing facilities in the US that are not currently customers of Tactile Medical. Thus, we continue to see ample opportunity to expand both our coverage and penetration of these high diagnosing facilities in 2019 and beyond.

In conclusion, for all these reasons, Tactile Medical will continue to lead the US lymphedema market and grow our share of the $4 billion plus opportunity that it represents in 2019 and in the years to come. We would like to thank our shareholders and employees for their continued support of our Company in its mission to help people with chronic disease lives better and care for themselves at home. We appreciate everyone on tonight's call for their interest in Tactile Medical.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question will comes from the line of Will Inglis of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is open.

William Inglis -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst

Hi, guys. Good afternoon. This is Will on for JP. Thanks for taking the questions.

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Hey, Will.

William Inglis -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst

I guess my first question would be regarding the sales force headcount growth you're expecting for '19 above 20%. Just curious just the level of reps you're expected higher for the Head and Neck -- for the Head and Neck group. And that beyond that just maybe any updates on the amount of productivity that you expect to grow in '19 with existing sales force?

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Understood (ph) Will, thanks very much for the questions. Specific to growth in our sales organization, we do intend to add another 20% to the field organization in 2019. We believe that's a number that we can consistently deliver, identify, train and bring up to speed. The way our sales force is currently configured, there are no specific Head and Neck specialists at this point in time. I mentioned on the call that we did hire a sales and marketing executive to help us put together the plan for how we'll reach beyond our current call points with lymphedema clinics and the VA to gain access to the broad market for treating Head and Neck lymphedema, but those plans are still under development and we should be able to update those maybe in the second quarter of this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Chris Pasquale -- Guggenheim -- Analyst

Thanks, and congrats on another strong quarter, guys. Jerry, I think the first question a lot of people are going to have is why growth should drop off in '19 versus the 30% run rate you guys have been putting up for several years now, understanding that the number get bigger each year. Can you quantify a couple of things. One the volume bolus that you thought you saw from this new payer contract just to help us gauge how difficult the comparison that sets up in the back half of 2019? And then maybe speak to what you're assuming for pricing overall in 2019 as you get a full year of that new payer contract flowing through? Thanks.

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

You bet. Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. First of all, we're very confident in the growth outlook and expect the primary drivers in 2019 to be the addition of our sales reps to our base as well as the access or exposure of this compelling new technology in Flexitouch Plus. You actually hit upon one of the three items that I would point out are not assumed in our 2019 guidance.

The first is that volume bolus, that was your terminology we consider to be the large payer contract dynamic that we experienced in the fourth quarter related to getting in-network coverage from all of those added plans that this large payer was able to deliver for us.

The net result of that timing that we signed the contract and brought it on board in July was that and then they got opened up their other plans to us. The net impact for the patient was that we went from being an out-of-network provider to an in-network provider in a time period, where many of these patients had already met their deductibles. So we went from a very expensive piece of equipment to a very inexpensive piece of equipment.

The second dynamic is really around pricing. And interestingly, we have historically seen pricing headwinds in the mid-single digits. In 2018, we were actually in the low single digits. And our guidance going forward to your question assumes mid-single digit headwinds normalized for our more long-term trend of what we have seen historically.

I think the third driver that we wanted to point out that was not assumed in our 2019 guidance is the fact that Entre growth this year was significantly more of a contributor than we anticipated. You may remember our original guidance for 2018 assumed pretty flat Entre growth for the year. We ended up driving an incremental $3 million in growth in 2018 from that product. That came to us because we moved the responsibility for processing those orders from our field team so they could focus on Flexitouch, and because the backlog was building up of those Entre orders that weren't being addressed. We don't expect that backlog to repeat itself in 2019.

Brent A. Moen -- Chief Financial Officer

Say -- just to back that one question, Chris hold on, I just want to make sure that we addressed Will's second question yet and his second question related to productivity for rep in 2019, and just to make sure that we cover off on Will's open question, I will tell you that we do have modest improvement relative to rep productivity in 2019 relative to 2018. So I just want to make sure we covered up on Will's question. Sorry Chris didn't mean to interrupt.

Chris Pasquale -- Guggenheim -- Analyst

No. That's OK. Thanks, Brent. And my second question was just around the next steps for the Head and Neck indication. You've got two studies published now. I believe you have a third one that has completed enrollment. So what's the timing around that? And does that complete you think the clinical work that you're going to need to get these new codes when could those actually be in place? Thank you.

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. Thanks Chris. We -- first of all, just level set everyone, the Head and Neck progress that's being made is we actually thought in 2018, we'd be exactly where we are from a revenue perspective. I have to say though it's taken us little longer to establish these commercial plans and get these clinicals published than we anticipated.

We would like to had our sales and marketing executives hired by mid-year. It actually happened later in the year. And we've had to your point two studies published, but we've had a third one complete for more than six months now. So I think we're a little behind in where we thought we'd be on the Head and Neck development.

You're correct two clinical publications to date with one of them happening in January of this year, two more expected in '19. Our focus in 2019 for the Head and Neck is to continue to invest in clinical evidence development.

I do not believe we have enough clinical evidence in place today to go get coding coverage for that Head and Neck accessories or the Head and Neck garments. So I think we have to continue to invest in that Head and Neck evidence development. We're going to continue to educate the market as we're the only ones with a solution for that particular indication and as well as finished the definition of our go-to-market strategy outside of our current call points.

So we're expecting it to be a contributor again in 2019, but in the low to mid-single-digits is what we are looking for contribution from Head and Neck.

Your next question comes from the line of Anna Nussbaum of William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Anna Nussbaum -- William Blair -- Analyst

Hi. Can you hear me?

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes now.

Anna Nussbaum -- William Blair -- Analyst

Sorry about that. This is Anna in for Margaret. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch base again on guidance relative to the volume benefit seen in the fourth quarter. Are you essentially assuming these benefits are continuing into 2019? And then what are you assuming in guidance in terms of those VA contribution given the new supply schedule for Plus and then any changes in commercial contracts? Thanks.

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

So we've got VA, commercial and volume from the new contract. Let me start with VA. Our growth in last year was about 42%, which pushed the total sales to 20% of revenue. The VA specialists that we've put in place have been extraordinarily helpful for our local sales team in supporting them and navigating the VA channel. We think there is a tremendous opportunity to continue going deeper into the accounts we've already opened and as we included in our 10-K this afternoon, we've gone from 140 to 150 of the VA hospitals being active in terms of ordering product from us.

I think the biggest addition is the Flexitouch Plus to the federal supply schedule. So we anticipate that's going to be a nice tailwind for us coming into 2019. So we expect it to be a contributor in that 20% range in 2019 as well that's the VA piece.

On the commercial payer piece, we actually are on contract with all five of the top payers, so don't anticipate a big movement from any new payer. We still have some regionals that we're working with to try to get on contract as an in-network provider. But I think a lot of that work is already done. So might expect them we're going to see a big impact on adding new lives -- new covered lives to our queue. We do expect we're going to have more volume coming from the new payer. I think what we were trying to get across is because of the timing and because of the fact that we were out of network last year, we got an unexpected bolus of orders in the third and fourth quarter mostly in the fourth quarter as a result of our contract with that payer.

The patient that might have seen our product before we got on contract, pretty much didn't buy it, because the co-payments were too high or the deductible plan -- their deductible or their out-of-pocket costs were too high. And we had a number of those as we came through the fourth quarter with literally zero deductibles. So that's the part that we don't think is going to repeat. We do expect that volume will continue, but remember, we gave this pair a pretty sizable reduction in price. So we expect the volume to offset that deduction in 2019.

Anna Nussbaum -- William Blair -- Analyst

Okay. That's helpful. Yeah. Thank you. And then just on adjusted EBITDA, margins came in pretty strong roughly 18% in the quarter, though, it looks like that it did benefit from about $2.5 million in impairment and inventory write-offs. Can you just remind us some of the puts and takes there and how we should think about profitability throughout 2019?

Brent A. Moen -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Anna, I'll help you with that one. So you're right we did have nice adjusted EBITDA performance for Q4 and for the full year and that does exclude the impairment charge that we did take relative to ACTitouch. Probably the biggest put and take relative to our adjusted EBITDA was the gross margin impact that I alluded to in my remarks.

Our GAAP gross margin came in at 68.9%, but if you add back the inventory impairment associated with ACTitouch that we took our adjusted margin is 70.5%. And then we're certainly within our full year kind of guidance range, but the delta between this year and last year really ends up being the pricing impact from the large player contract that Jerry was talking about as well as mix that we're experiencing on payer and product differences between 2018 and 2017. So those are the biggest items that impacted our adjusted EBITDA.

Anna Nussbaum -- William Blair -- Analyst

Okay. Thanks. And then just how we should think about that going into this year?

Brent A. Moen -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. No. Happy to help. Our 2019 guidance that we set forth was we expected adjusted EBITDA to come in at 13%. So a step up of approximately 32% year-over-year compared to our revenue growth expectations of 20% to 22%. So we should see some leverage certainly in our adjusted EBITDA. And just keep in mind as I pointed out in my comments, to that 13% includes some incremental rent expense as we plan to move from our existing headquarter facility into the new facility later this year.

Anna Nussbaum -- William Blair -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you.

Brent A. Moen -- Chief Financial Officer

You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills of Canaccord Genuity.

David Westenberg -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Hey. It's David on for Jason. Can you hear me alright?

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Hey, David.

Brent A. Moen -- Chief Financial Officer

Hi, David.

David Westenberg -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Hey. First of all, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong quarter. First question I want to ask is around FY '19 guidance. Could you provide any color around -- additional color around the assumptions kind of baked in specifically regarding the cadence of sales rep hires in the year and as well as where you kind of see any propensity to deliver on the upside and what kind of drivers then your assumptions are kind of have the highest opportunity to deliver on the upside?

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

So you may remember from last year, we got out of the gate rather slowly in our hiring. And in fact, we're behind in our hiring plans for certainly the first half of the year and made most of our hires in the second half. We learned a lot from that experience. We brought on a new Chief Human Resources Officer, a couple of dedicated sales recruiters, we've revamped our approach as to how we go about bringing on new folks, and I believe it served us very well. So that explains all the way up to the beginning of 2019.

Our plans for 2019 is to do as much as we can in the first two to three quarters, so that we don't have to bring anyone else on in the fourth quarter. That's the way we built our plan, that's what we've been able to executive in years past other than 2018, and that's the way we would prefer to see it done.

We're pretty comfortable with the growth outlook that we've put in place other than the things I mentioned that we did not assume are in our plan, our biggest drivers are Flexitouch Plus, the attractiveness of that product versus our competition, and more importantly, allowing over physicians and clinicians to think about Flexitouch for more of the patients I think will be the biggest driver and then we just talked about the sales reps. Those are the two things that I would point to as the biggest drivers for our success in '19.

David Westenberg -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

All right. Thanks. And then maybe touching on the Aero-Wrap product. Looking, I guess into 2020, if it's not going to contributing to 2019. Could you provide any color on kind of what type of cross-selling opportunities you see with the product given that it kind of gives you the ability to accept patients earlier kind in that continuum of care and then maybe and so far as if you quantify kind of the size of the opportunity you have maybe of the middle and long-term with the product? Thanks.

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yeah. I'd be happy to. We are really excited about the Airwear technology. We're in the midst of securing the supply chain. We think it is the best of all of the static compression systems that are on the market today in terms of addressing patients ease of use and ability to put on and take off the static compression system that they inevitably need to treat their chronic swelling problem. We're excited about it, because all payers require a trial of conservative therapy before they'll move a patient up to considering one of our pneumatic compression systems. And thus Airwear is a potential solution for those patients with lower extremity swelling that they can get into right away. Once we get to know that patient we believe we can pull through some additional sales of our Entre and Flexitouch products once we've had exposure to that patient which we currently don't have today.

The market itself, we're really relying on that pull through to be significant in 2020, because we're not planning a launch, it will do a limited launch which is our usual cadence in the second half of 2019 and then roll it out to the rest of the sales organization toward the end of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia of Northland Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Suraj Kalia -- Northland Securities -- Analyst

Sure. Good afternoon, everyone. Can you hear me all right?

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Yes, Suraj. Thank you, and welcome.

Brent A. Moen -- Chief Financial Officer

Hi, Suraj.

Suraj Kalia -- Northland Securities -- Analyst

So Jerry, congrats on a great quarter. Couple of questions from my side and I know you have provided qualitative commentary. I was wondering, if you could put some boundaries around specifically this contract payer in a way you all are going direct. I heard a $2 million ASP impact in fourth quarter. Obviously, there is a bolus. Forgive me if I missed the exact dollar amount that came through from this contract payer and at what margin specifically this contract was provided?

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Sure. So the reference to the $2 million was what we talked about at the end of -- in our third quarter earnings call and we were forecasting forward that because of the pricing that we gave away if you will to get on this contract, it could have an impact of $2 million in the fourth quarter. The good news is we were able to make up that whole revenue impact by increased volume in the fourth quarter.

As we mentioned then Suraj, the pricing that we agreed to with this payer was roughly in line with other pricing from large commercial payers. So we don't see it being, it came down to what I would consider to be a more normal level than where it was previously. So we don't release gross margins by payer. Obviously, that's a confidential negotiation between us and them, but I would say they are more in line with the others than they were previously.

Suraj Kalia -- Northland Securities -- Analyst

And finally Jerry just to follow up on that for FY '19, I heard a low 70s gross margin. Can you help us reconcile the FY '19 gross margin guidance with expected contribution from this contract there and forgive me maybe it sounds unfair, because you don't want to give specifics on this payer. Just help us put some goalpost somewhere so that we can triangle it and at least make some assessment from a modeling perspective. Thank you again, and congrats.

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Thank you. This new payer we now have at what I would say normal pricing levels. So that's one of the drivers of why we feel comfortable about 70-plus percent gross margin in 2019. We build into our assumptions for that for 2019 mid single-digit price erosion. So we've already built in what our expected impact is for this payer in that assumption of mid single-digit price erosion. So we're very confident we can get to that and deliver on that 70-plus percent gross margin going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Mitra Ramgopal of Sidoti. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Mitra Ramgopal -- Sidoti -- Analyst

Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Jerry, I was wondering as you look out to remainder of '19 and even beyond, any plans in terms of trying to do more on the outside of the US? I know that's something you've talked in the past and I'm just wondering if we are closer to getting there?

Gerald R. Mattys -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

Hey, Mitra, thanks for the question, and let me address it specifically. As -- we've talked about the desire to expand beyond the US borders for quite some time now. The gating item has been and continues to be the changes in the quality system that will be required of Tactile to be able to meet the European regulations. We are still scheduled for that audit or that visit here in the first half of this year. After which we can self apply the CE Mark to our product and get going, selling products internationally. In 2019, we have no revenue assumed for international. We built in some costs as we expect to explore how we go about international distribution, but I harken back to the fact that we are so under-penetrated in the US market that, that is our laser focus for 2019.

We sold 35000 units last year -- 32,000 sorry, units last year and that's on 1.1 million patients diagnosed. So this is a vastly under penetrated market that we're in now and we want to try to focus our efforts there.

Mitra Ramgopal -- Sidoti -- Analyst

Okay. Thanks. That's great. And then just a quick question on the reimbursement front, as you look at gross margin continue to expand, any potential headwinds there?

Brent A. Moen -- Chief Financial Officer

Hi, Mitra. It's Brent. Actually in our gross margin for 2018, I kind of went through a little bit earlier on the call, but the impact that we had from a large payer certainly had an impact in our overall 2018 gross margin. As Jerry pointed out, we do have that booked into our expectation for 2019, and we feel confident that we should be able to hit our low 70% gross margin for 2019.

The one thing that I will be just mindful of is in the first half of the year some of that pricing headwinds, because we haven't anniversaried it yet, will impact our first half of the year versus the second half when the contract came into play.

Mitra Ramgopal -- Sidoti -- Analyst

Okay. Thanks again for taking the questions.

206,Empty,2019-02-26T21:38:12Z,"Jagmeet Singh won Burnaby South through hope and hard work, but it masked crushing defeat and poor shows elsewhere","The morning after three federal byelections was like an elementary school sports day, with all the party leaders wearing their participation medals — “If you had fun, you won” — and claiming victory.

In the B.C. riding of Burnaby South, the NDP’s Jagmeet Singh celebrated a win that paves his way, after 16 months as leader, to a seat in the House of Commons.

To be fair to him, he won the prize through hope and hard work, and no one can ever take his newly won legitimacy away from him (at least not until October).

But the festivities did rather mask a crushing defeat in Outremont where the NDP lost the Quebec seat held by Tom Mulcair in three successive general elections. It also ignored a poor performance in the York-Simcoe byelection in the commuter belt north of Toronto, where the party recorded just 7.5 per cent of the vote.

The Liberals claimed the win in Outremont, taking an opposition seat for the third time in this Parliament — a feat not matched since 1908. It seems that Quebecers do appreciate the Herculean efforts being made by this Prime Minister to place their interests ahead of the rest of the country, on issues ranging from pipelines to the current SNC-Lavalin saga.

If the 18 point drop in support for the NDP in Outremont is repeated across the province in October, the Liberals could add another 10 to 15 seats to their tally. Yet there was a notable enthusiasm gap between 2015 and now that bodes ill for the party. In York-Simcoe, the Liberal vote share slipped significantly (to 29 per cent from 38 per cent) even though the candidate, Shaun Tanaka, was the same.

The Conservatives earned themselves a victory lap in York-Simcoe with Scot Davidson’s win. They will be delighted that Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party earned just 2 per cent of the vote in that riding and in Outremont.

If the 18 point drop in support for the NDP in Outremont is repeated across the province in October, the Liberals could add another 10 to 15 seats to their tally

But they will be disconcerted by the 11 per cent of the vote won by the PPC’s Laura-Lynn Thompson, a former Christian talk show host, in Burnaby. The average People’s Party vote across the three by-elections was 5.6 per cent — potentially the difference between victory and defeat for Andrew Scheer, if replicated in a general election.

Bernier professed himself “disappointed” with the results in Ontario and Quebec but said overall there were signs of progress for his five-month-old party. “This is the beginning of our journey. We are in it for the long haul,” he said.

That would be a fair prediction were it not for the fundamental contradiction at the core of Bernier’s populist party: it is led by a libertarian free-marketer and supported by anti-globalists. One day soon, his followers may realize they don’t share the same agenda as their leader.

Even the Greens could afford to be triumphant. Their candidate in Outremont, Daniel Green (bien sur), picked up 12.5 per cent of the vote, indicating an openness to trying something new among voters tired of a Liberal Party that has broken too many promises, a Conservative Party that is apathetic about climate change and an NDP that has appeared to be in disarray.

While all parties (except the Bloc) had something to cheer about, the real loser was Canadian democracy.

The York-Simcoe byelection is the first I can find on the Elections Canada website where voter turnout dipped below 20 per cent. Fewer than one in five eligible voters bothered to go to the polls, which is a pretty miserable state of affairs.

Outremont was only marginally better, at 21.4 per cent. Rachel Bendayan is now a member of the Canadian parliament having won just 6,086 votes. Every single councillor but one on Toronto city council received more votes in the 2018 municipal election.

The York-Simcoe byelection is the first I can find on the Elections Canada website where voter turnout dipped below 20 per cent

This reflects a level of disillusionment apparent among voters since the sunny ways of 2015, when turnout in the general election reached 68.5 per cent, 10 points up on the record low of 2008.

There is a debate among academics about the declining support for democracy among millennials.

One disconcerting graph that appeared in the Journal of Democracy in 2016 suggested that young people in Western countries like the U.S. and Great Britain are losing faith in democracy, with only one in four Americans born in the 1980s believing that “it is essential to live in a democracy.” That survey has been criticized for its methodology but even the critics agree that, on average, younger people assign lower value to democracy than the generation who lived, or whose parents lived, through the Second World War.

Canada wasn’t included in that study — and the 57 per cent turnout of 18-24 year olds in the 2015 election (up from 39 per cent in 2011) suggested it might be a beacon of hope.

But there has been decline in voter turnout since then, even judging by the historically low rate seen in byelections. One suspects the Liberals’ failure to deliver on specific promises like electoral reform and the more general pledge to “do politics differently” have not enamoured them to younger voters. Neither has the Conservative Party’s apparent disinterest in climate change inspired millennials to head to the polls.

Elections are determined by the people who show up. Studies done after the 2015 election suggest the Conservatives had — and likely still have — an advantage among voters older than 60.

Those people voted in large numbers in 2015 (78.8 per cent of 65-74 years olds voted) and electoral history suggests they will do so again this year.

That prospect may cheer Conservatives. But nobody should be upbeat about the fact that enthusiasm for government of the people, by the people, for the people is waning, and putting our democracy in peril.

A clarification: in Monday’s column, I quoted former judge Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond as calling for an RCMP investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair. She writes to say she supports such an investigation, if there is any evidence Jody Wilson-Raybould was fired as attorney general because she refused under pressure to change her position in favour of a deferred prosecution agreement.

In a heavily improvised speech that lasted over two hours, the 72-year-old former (future?) reality TV star hit every greatest hit in his repertoire (""Crooked Hillary,"" ""build the wall,"" ""America is winning again,"" and more all made appearances) while riffing on everything from the Green New Deal to his own advanced age and weird hair to the wisdom of soldiers over generals. At times, it was like listening to Robin Williams' genie in the Disney movie Aladdin, Howard Stern in his peak years as a radio shock jock, or Don Rickles as an insult comic. When he started making asides, Trump observed, ""This is how I got elected, by going off script."" Two years into his presidency and he's just getting warmed up.

First and foremost, Trump was frequently funny and outre in the casually mean way that New Yorkers exude like nobody else in America. ""You put the wrong people in a couple of positions,"" he said, lamenting the appointment of Robert Mueller as a special prosecutor, ""and all of a sudden they're trying to take you out with bullshit."" He voiced Jeff Sessions in a mock-Southern accent, recusing ""muhself"" and asked the adoring crowd why the former attorney generally hadn't told him he was going to do that before he was appointed.

Democrats backing the Green New Deal (GND) ""are talking about trains to Hawaii,"" he said. ""They haven't figured out how to get to Europe yet."" He begged the Democrats not to abandon the GND because he recognizes that the more its details and costs are discussed, the more absurd it will become. ""When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your energy,"" he said at one point. ""Did the wind stop blowing, I'd like to watch television today, guys?"" ""We'll go back to boats,"" he said, drawing huge laughs when he added, ""I don't want to talk [the Democrats] out of [the GND], I just want to be the Republican who runs against it.""

He railed against Never-Trump Republicans: ""They're on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,"" he said, adding ""they're basically dishonest people"" that no one cares about. He joked about being in the White House all alone on New Year's because of the government shutdown. ""I was in the White House and I was lonely, so I went to Iraq,"" he said, recounting that when his plane was approaching the U.S. airstrip in Iraq, all lights had to be extinguished for landing. ""We spend trillions of dollars in the Middle East and we can't land planes [in Iraq] with the lights on,"" he said, shaking his head in disbelief. ""We gotta get out."" He then riffed on the generals he met there who, contrary to the Pentagon brass he dealt with, said they could vanquish ISIS in a week. He claimed to have talked with a general named ""Raising Cane,"" which might be Brigadier Gen. J. Daniel Caine, but Trump is the farthest thing from a details guy, right? ""Sometimes I learn more from soldiers than I do generals,"" he said, deftly moving from jokes to more-substantive discussions of policies or issues.

In all seriousness, this is quite a performance from Trump: he is just about two hours into this speech and shows no signs of flagging. And far as I can tell, the CPAC crowd is still with him. — Alexander Nazaryan (@alexnazaryan) March 2, 2019

You can cover a huge amount of material in two-hours-plus, and Trump certainly did that. After speaking sympathetically of immigrants who want to come to the United States and saying that we need more people because the economy (well, his economy, as he takes credit for it) is doing so well, he immediately dismissed the Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans traveling north in caravans across Mexico. In a bizarre display of simultaneous empathy and contempt, he talked at length about how female migrants are being systematically ""raped"" but also how the caravans were filled with criminals and drug dealers. It was ""sad to see how stupid we've become"" to think that the caravans are filled with good people. As he has been doing since his State of the Union address, he has been laying out a partial, inchoate case for a skills-based immigration program. He explained walking away from the table with North Korea even as he noted yet again that he has a great relationship with the dictator Kim Jong Un. In a long riff on trade policy, he invoked the ""Great Tariff Debate of 1888"" and how China ""and everyone else"" had been taking advantage of us until he started pushing back. He took time to talk about how no, really, the crowd at his inauguration was in fact historically large despite all publicly available evidence.

All in all, it was, in the words of Daniel Dale, the Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star, ""one of the least-hinged speeches Trump has given in a long time."" It was indeed all over the place but like the weirdly wide-ranging and digressive speech in which he declared a national emergency, it was also an absolute tour de force, laying out every major point of disagreement between Republicans and Democrats (abortion, the Second Amendment, and taxes, among other things) while tagging the latter aggressively as socialists who will not only end the private provision of health care but take over the energy sector too. Those charges take on new life in the wake of the announcement of the GND and comments, however short-lived, by Democrats such as Kamala Harris, who at one point recently called for an end to private health care. And over 100 House Democrats have signed on to a plan that would end private health insurance in two years. For all the biting criticism and dark humor in today's speech, Trump has mostly ditched the ""American Carnage"" rhetoric that marked his first Inaugural Address, pushing onto liberals and Democrats all the negativity and anger that used to surround him like the dust cloud surrounds Pigpen in the old Peanuts cartoons. ""We have people in Congress right now who hate our country,"" he said. ""We can name every one of them. Sad, very, very sad.""

At moments, he seemed to be workshopping his themes and slogans for 2020. ""We believe in the American Dream, not the socialist nightmare,"" he averred at one point. ""Now you have a president who finally standing up for America."" The future, he said ""does not belong to those who believe in socialism. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I've said it before and will say it again: America will never be a socialist country."" That's a line that may not work forever, but it will almost certainly get the job done in 2020.

None of this is to suggest that this speech wasn't as fact-challenged as almost every utterance Trump has given since announcing his candidacy for the Republican nomination (go to Daniel Dale's Twitter thread for a running count of misstatements of fact). He hammered trade deficits in a way that will remind anyone with an undergrad economics course under their belt that he fundamentally doesn't know what he's talking about. He misrepresented both NAFTA and the new trade bill he crafted with Mexico and Canada, and at the exact moment that hundreds of wearied listeners started leaving the ballroom at The Gaylord Resort and Convention Center, he claimed that not a single person had left their seat.

But the 2020 presidential race is not going to be decided based on which candidate is more tightly moored to reality. It's going to be decided, like these things always are, by the relative health of the economy and the large vision of the future the different candidates put forward. As the economy continues to expand (however anemically compared to historical averages) and he continues to avoid credible charges of impeachable offenses, Trump is becoming sunnier and sunnier while the Democrats are painting contemporary America as a late-capitalist hellhole riven by growing racial, ethnic, and other tensions.

Trump isn't the creator of post-factual politics in America, he is merely currently its most-gifted practitioner (oddly, his ideological and demographic counterpart and fellow New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may become a challenger to him on precisely this score). Trump may have next to no credibility in profoundly disturbing ways, but American politics has been drifting away from reality for the entire 21st century, when the 2000 election was essentially decided by a coin flip, the United States entered the Iraq War under false premises, and Barack Obama took home Politifact's 2013 ""Lie of the Year"" award and dissembled unconvincingly in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations.

That Trump didn't invent the current situation doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned about it, but if he can continue to perform the way he did today at CPAC, it remains to be seen what Democratic rival can rise to that challenge.",Trump Just Might Have Won the 2020 Election Today,Reason.com,https://reason.com/blog/2019/03/02/trump-just-might-have-won-the-2020-elect

While apparently not technically illegal, Trudeau's efforts are widely seen as interference in the judicial process.

Canada's golden boy prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is embroiled in a serious scandal involving one of Quebec's top construction firms and the interference by his office in legal troubles being experienced by the firm.

Chicago Tribune:

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,"" the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit the cabinet this month, also said she faced ""veiled threats"" about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement. Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau's team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall's election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events. The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party's past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau's path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

Lavalin is accused of corrupt practices. It's been reported that the company supplied the son of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi with prostitutes in order to get favorable consideration on a contract.

Trudeau was asked about the matter during question time.

Daily Caller:

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau equated the procurement of prostitutes as one way his government can ""stand up for Canadian jobs,"" in a Wednesday Question Period exchange with the Official Opposition Conservatives. In response to a question from Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel about a report that the embattled Quebec contractor SNC-Lavalin paid $30,000 (CND) to entertain Muammar Gaddafi's son with prostitutes, Trudeau appeared to not only confirm the story; he also tried to exonerate the company. Rempel was quizzing Trudeau in the House of Commons about the unfolding scandal that threatens to take down the Trudeau government. Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould says she was instructed by numerous high-ranking officials in the Prime Minister's Office to block the prosecution against Quebec mega-contractor SNC-Lavalin on fraud charges. Referring to the ""$30,000 worth of Canadian prostitutes that were given to Muammar Gaddafi's son,"" Rempel noted ""this is the so-called victimless crime that our quote 'feminist' prime minister is moving mountains to cover up. When did the prime minister learn that SNC-Lavalin paid for prostitutes for Muammar Gaddafi's son?"" Trudeau answered, ""Every step of the way, we will stand up for Canadians workers, we will stand up for Canadian jobs right across this country and we will do so in a way that is consistent with our values ..."" Rempel told The Daily Caller on Friday that she was shocked at Trudeau's response to her question. ""He needs to resign,"" she said. ""He's a disgusting failure that no longer has the moral authority to govern. He needs to go.""

So playing pimp for the son of a dictator is ""consistent"" with Canadian values? That might come as a shock to a lot of Canadian citizens.

Trudeau is being exposed as an empty suit, and the more people get to know the rock-star prime minister, the more they see through the carefully crafted façade. He's a pretty face in over his head, and with most opinion surveys now showing his Liberal Party trailing the conservatives for the fall election, Canadian voters may finally be waking up.",Justin Trudeau equated procuring prostitutes with supporting Canadian workers,Americanthinker.com,https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2019/03/justin_trudeau_equated_procuring_prostitutes_with_supporting_canadian_workers.html

(Photo: LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP/Getty Images)

How far the international community’s approach towards Israel has reversed trajectory over the past half century can be gauged simply by studying the fate of one word: Zionism.

In 1975 much of the world broke ranks with the United States and Europe at the United Nations general assembly to declare that Zionism, Israel’s founding ideology, “is a form of racism and racial discrimination”.

Western publics were generally shocked. Zionism, they had been told, was a necessary liberation movement for the Jewish people after centuries of oppression and pogroms. Its creation, Israel, was simply the righting of terrible wrongs that had culminated in the horrors of the Holocaust.

But Zionism looked very different to those countries around the globe that had been exposed to centuries of European colonialism and the more recent advent of US imperialism.

The long history of crimes against Jews that led to Israel’s establishment took place mostly in Europe. And yet it was Europe and the US that had sponsored and aided the arrival of Jews in another people’s homeland, far from their own shores.

To the global south, the great purges of native Palestinians carried out by European Jews in 1948 and 1967 looked all too reminiscent of white Europeans cleansing indigenous peoples in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

A colonial anachronism

By 1975, the time of the UN vote, it was clear that Israel had no intention either of handing back to the Palestinians the occupied territories it had seized eight years earlier. Rather, Israel was entrenching the occupation by illegally transferring its own civilian population into the Palestinian territories.

Across much of the globe, these Jewish settlers looked like an anachronism, a reminder of the white “pioneers” heading westwards across the supposedly empty lands of the US; the white farmers who seized vast tracts of South Africa and Rhodesia as their personal homesteads; and the white newcomers who herded the remnants of Australia’s Aboriginal peoples into reservations or turned them into a sideshow at its tourist sites.

The UN’s “Zionism is racism” resolution lasted 16 years – until the fall of the Soviet Union and the emergence of the US as the world’s sole superpower. After a lot of diplomatic arm-twisting by Washington, including promises that Israel would engage in a peace process with the Palestinians, Resolution 3379 was finally scrapped in 1991.

Decades later, the pendulum has swung decisively the other way.

US and European elites have moved on from their once-defensive posture that Zionism is not racism. Now, they are on the attack. Their presumption is that anti-Zionism – the position of much the international community 44 years ago – is synonymous with racism.

Or more specifically, it is increasingly being accepted that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are two sides of the same coin.

Apartheid-style system

That trend was consolidated last week when Emmanuel Macron, the centrist French president, went further than simply reiterating his repeated conflation of anti-Zionism and antisemitism. This time he threatened to outlaw anti-Zionism.

Macron’s confusion of anti-Zionism with antisemitism is patently nonsensical.

Antisemitism refers to the hatred of Jews. It is bigotry, plain and simple.

Anti-Zionism, on the other hand, is opposition to the political ideology of Zionism, a movement that has insisted in all its political guises on prioritising the rights of Jews to a homeland over those, the Palestinians, who were already living there.

Anti-Zionism is not racism against Jews; it is opposition to racism by Zionist Jews.

Of course, an anti-Zionist may also be antisemitic, but it is more likely that an anti-Zionist holds his or her position for entirely rational and ethical reasons.

That was made only clearer last summer when the Israeli parliament passed a basic law defining Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people (PDF). The law asserts that all Jews, even those with no connection to Israel, enjoy a right to self-determination there that all Palestinians are deprived of, including the fifth of Israel’s population who are Palestinian and formally citizens.

In other words, the law creates two statuses in Israel – and implicitly in the occupied territories too – based on an imposed ethno-religious classification system that entitles all Jews to superior rights over all Palestinians.

In constitutional terms, Israel is explicitly operating an apartheid-style legal and political system, one even more encompassing than South Africa’s. After all, the apartheid rulers of South Africa never claimed that theirs was the homeland of all white people.

Criminalizing BDS

Macron’s threat to outlaw anti-Zionism is the logical extension of existing moves across Europe and the US to penalise those who support BDS, the growing international solidarity movement with Palestinians that calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.

Many members of the BDS movement, though not all, are anti-Zionists. A proportion are anti-Zionist Jews.

The movement not only leapfrogs western policy elites’ decades of complicity in Israel’s oppression of the Palestinians but highlights the extent of that complicity. That is one reason it is so reviled by those elites.

France has gone furthest so far in this direction, criminalizing BDS as a form of economic discrimination. It thereby conflates a state, Israel, with an ethnic group, Jews – precisely as antisemites do.

Such legislation makes as much sense as France outlawing a boycott of apartheid South Africa back in the 1980s on the grounds that it discriminated against whites.

Israel lobbyists in action

France, however, is simply at the head of the curve. In the US some 26 states have enacted laws to punish or sanction individuals and organisations that support a boycott. Similar legislation is pending in a further 13 states.

None seem concerned that they are violating Americans’ much-cherished First Amendment rights, and making an exception to the right to free speech in one case only – that of Israel.

This month the US Senate joined the fray by passing a bill to encourage states to inflict economic punishments on those who support a boycott of Israel.

These victories against the non-violent BDS movement are the result of vigorous and malevolent efforts behind the scenes by Israel lobbyists to confuse anti-Zionism with antisemitism.

As Israel’s standing among western publics has plummeted with the advent of social media, endless videos of violence by the Israeli army and settlers caught on phone cameras, and Israel’s starvation of Gaza, Israel’s lobbyists have moved to make it ever harder to speak out.

Redefinition of antisemitism

Their coup was the recent widespread acceptance in the west of a redefinition of antisemitism that intentionally confuses it with anti-Zionism.

Israel’s fingerprints are all over the work of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). It is therefore hardly surprising that the lengthy and vague definition of antisemitism devised by the IHRA has been supplemented by 11 examples, seven of which refer to Israel.

One example, stating that Israel is a “racist endeavour”, suggests that the 72 UN member states that voted for 1975’s “Zionism is racism” resolution, as well as the 32 that abstained, were themselves espousing, or turning a blind eye to, antisemitism.

Western governments, local authorities, political parties and public bodies are now racing to adopt the IHRA definition.

The result has been a growing fear among western publics about what can be said any longer about Israel without eliciting accusations of antisemitism.

That is the goal. If people become afraid that others will think them antisemitic for criticising Israel, then they will keep quiet, giving Israel greater leeway to commit crimes against Palestinians.

‘Self-hating Jew’ trope

Were Macron and the IHRA right – that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are all but indistinguishable – then we would have to accept some very uncomfortable conclusions.

One would be that Palestinians should be uniformly damned as antisemites for demanding their own right to self-determination. Or put another way, it would be impossible for Palestinians to demand the same rights as Jews in their homeland without that being declared as racist. Welcome to Alice Through the Looking Glass.

Another conclusion would be that a significant proportion of Jews around the world, those who oppose Israel’s self-definition as a Jewish state, are also antisemites, infected with an irrational hatred of their fellow Jews. This is the “self-hating Jew” trope Israel has long relied on to discredit criticism from Jews.

On this view, those Jews who want Palestinians to enjoy the same rights as Jews claim for themselves in the Middle East are racist – and not only that, but racist against themselves.

And if Macron’s efforts to criminalise anti-Zionism prove fruitful, it would mean that Palestinians and Jews could be punished – maybe even jailed – for demanding equality between Palestinians and Jews in Israel.

Preposterous as this reasoning sounds when laid out so bluntly, similar approaches to dealing with antisemitism are being readily accepted by actors across Europe and the US.

The extent of this insanity was evident in the decision of Germany’s Bank für Sozialwirtschaft, or Bank for Social Economy, to shut the account of a Jewish anti-Zionist group, Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East, over its support for a boycott of Israel. It was the first time a German bank had closed down a Jewish organization’s account since the Nazis were in power.

The bank took the action after complaints that Jewish Voice was antisemitic by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a group that masks its fervent support for Israel behind campaigning for Jewish rights.

Eliding the left and far-right

Macron’s antipathy to anti-Zionism – shared by many others seeking to confuse it with antisemitism – has an explicit cause as well as a more veiled one. Both are related to the political crisis he faces. After two years in power, he is the most unpopular president in the republic’s history.

According to Macron, the rise of anti-Zionism, or more broadly growing opposition to Israel, is swelling the ranks of those who want to harm Jews in France, whether through attacks, the scrawling of swastikas on Jewish graves or the polluting of public discourse, especially on social media.

Two groups that he and French Jewish lobby groups have identified as at the core of the problem are French Muslims, often recent immigrants who are seen as importing with them supposed racist Middle Eastern attitudes to Jews, and secular leftists who have taken the lead in supporting BDS.

Although a small number of French Muslims have adopted extremist positions, most feel hostility towards Israel because of its role in displacing and oppressing Palestinians. That sentiment dominates among BDS activists too.

But the implication of Macron and the lobby is that these two anti-Zionist groups are actually closely aligned with the antisemitic far-right and neo-Nazi groups, whatever their obvious respective differences in ideology and attitude towards violence.

The blurring by Macron of anti-Zionism and antisemitism is meant to sow doubt about what should be obvious distinctions between these three very different ideological constituencies.

Macron’s sleight of hand

Macron’s sleight of hand has a related and more specifically self-serving agenda, however, as has become clear in the wider misuse – or weaponisation – of antisemitism slurs in Europe and the US.

Macron is faced with a popular revolt known as the Yellow Vests, or Gilets Jaunes, that has taken over high streets for many months. The protests are rocking his government.

Like other recent grassroots insurrections, such as the Occupy movement, the Yellow Vests is leaderless and its demands difficult to decipher. It represents more a mood, a spreading dissatisfaction with an out-of-touch political system that, since the financial meltdown a decade ago, has looked chronically broken and unreformable.

The Yellow Vests embody a grievance desperately searching to hitch its wagon to a new political star, a different and fairer vision of how our societies could be organised.

The movement’s very inarticulateness has been its power and its threat. Those frustrated with austerity policies, those angry at an arrogant, unresponsive political and financial elite, those craving a return to a clearer sense of Frenchness can all seek shelter under its banner.

But equally it has also allowed Macron and the French elite to project on to the Yellow Vests any kind of malevolent motive that best serves their efforts to demonize the movement. A charge spokespeople for the movement deny.

And given the rising tide of nativist, far-right movements across Europe, casting the Yellow Vests as antisemitic has proved difficult to resist for the embattled French president.

Just as Macron has presented leftwing and anti-racism activists supporting BDS as in cahoots with neo-Nazis, he has lumped together the Yellow Vests with far-right white nationalists. Much of the French media have happily recycled this mischief.

Centrists’ love of authority

For those who assume that centrist leaders like Macron are acting not out of naked political self-interest but from a concern to eradicate prejudice and protect a vulnerable community, it is worth pausing to consider recent research on global political attitudes.

Last year the New York Times published a commentary by David Adler showing that, contrary to popular wisdom, centrists were on average significantly less invested in democracy than the far left and far right. They were least supportive of civil rights and “free and fair elections”.

These trends were particularly pronounced in the US, Britain, France, Australia and New Zealand, but noticeable in many other western liberal democracies.

Additionally, in most western countries, including France, support for a strongman and for authoritarianism was much stronger among centrists than on the far-left. British and US centrists also outpolled the far-right in their love of authority figures.

Adler concluded: “Support for ‘free and fair’ elections drops at the center for every single country in the sample. The size of the centrist gap is striking. In the case of the United States, fewer than half of people in the political center view elections as essential. … Centrists …seem to prefer strong and efficient government over messy democratic politics.”

Lobbyists’ stranglehold

It is therefore perhaps not surprising that centrist leaders like Macron are among the most ready to disengage from fair and open debate, smear opponents and readily blur the ideological distinctions between those to their left and their right.

And similarly, supporters of centrism are most likely to lap up unfounded accusations of antisemitism in the service of maintaining a status quo they perceive as benefiting them.

That process has been starkly on show in Britain and the US of late.

For decades the centrists in Washington have dominated politics on both sides of a supposed political divide. And one issue that has enjoyed especially strong bipartisan support in the US is backing for Israel.

The reason for a narrow Washington consensus on a whole range of issues, including Israel, has been the stranglehold on the US political process of corporate money and paid lobbyists.

Lobbies prefer to operate in the dark, wielding influence out of public view. In the case of Israel, however, the lobby has become ever more visible to outsiders and its defences of Israel ever harder to sustain as abuses of Palestinians are readily displayed on social media.

That, in turn, has spurred the growth of the BDS movement and a new, if still small, wave of insurgency politicians.

Ilhan Omar attacked

Muslim Congresswoman Ilhan Omar showed how the established system seeks to tame wayward freshmen after she tweeted an obvious point that the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC – like other lobbyists – uses its money to enforce political orthodoxy in Washington in its chosen field. Or as she expressed it, “It’s all about the Benjamins” – slang for $100 bills, which feature an image of Benjamin Franklin.

She was quickly submerged in an avalanche of claims that her comment was evidence of antisemitism. They came from across the so-called political spectrum, from the grandees of her own Democratic party to President Trump. Weighed down with the criticism, she apologized.

Omar justified her decision, saying it was up to Jews to decide what is antisemitic. In an age of rampant identity politics, this sounds superficially plausible. But it actually makes no sense at all.

Even if a clear majority of Jews do in fact think criticism of Israel or its lobbyists is antisemitic – a highly questionable assumption – they don’t enjoy some special or exclusive right to make that determination.

Israel victimises Palestinians, as has been endlessly documented. No one has the right to claim the moral high ground as a victim of racism when they are using that same high ground to obstruct scrutiny of Israel’s crimes against Palestinians. To think otherwise would be to prioritise the defense of Jews from a possible racism over the vast evidence of concrete racism by Israel against Palestinians.

But more to the point, Omar’s apology assumes that those Jews with the loudest voices – that is, those with the biggest platforms and the most money – represent all Jews. It makes organised American Jewry, whose vigorous support for Israel has proved unshakeable even as Israeli prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu has driven the country to the far right, the arbiter of what all Jews think.

In fact, it does more. It makes the Israel lobby itself the one to determine whether there is an Israel lobby. It gives the lobby permission to shield itself entirely from view, allowing its influence to become even more entrenched and opaque.

Omar is far from alone. Other prominent critics of Israel, often black, have found themselves singled out for accusations of antisemitism over the criticism of Israel, including recently Marc Lamont Hill and Angela Davis.

Through a drip-drip of accusations that Omar is expressing “antisemitic tropes” when she speaks out, the aim is to make sure she starts to self-censor, becomes as “moderate” as her fellow politicians, and joins the bipartisan consensus on leaving Israel to get on with abusing Palestinians.

If she doesn’t, it is assumed, she will be finished politically, kicked out either by her own party bureaucracy or by voters.

Corbyn on the back foot

That process is much further advanced in Britain with a concerted and long-running campaign to stigmatise Jeremy Corbyn with claims of antisemitism since he became leader of the Labour party more than three years ago.

Corbyn is both a throwback to a socialist tradition in Britain that was killed by Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s and a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause. In fact, he is a major anomaly: a European politician in sight of power who prioritises the right of Palestinians to justice over Israel’s policy of oppressing Palestinians.

The Israel lobby has a great deal to fear from him in changing the political climate in Europe towards Israel.

In the UK, the ruling Conservative party has moved relentlessly to the right in recent decades, leaving the Labour party in parliament to occupy the centrist ground carved out for it during Tony Blair’s leadership in the 1990s.

Although enjoying huge support among Labour members that propelled him into the leadership, Corbyn is at war with most of his MPs. The centrists there have happily weaponised antisemitism to damage Corbyn and the hundreds of thousands of members behind him, just as Macron has against his own political opponents.

Corbyn’s own MPs have publicly accused him of indulging an “institutional antisemitism” in Labour, or even of being antisemitic himself.

They have done so even though all evidence suggests that there is very little antisemitism among Labour members – and less than in the ruling Conservative party.] Labour members, however, have felt liberated by Corbyn to be much more outspoken in criticizing Israel.

Appeasement fails

This month a group of eight Labour MPs split from the party to set up a new faction, the Independent Group, citing Labour’s supposed “antisemitism problem” as one of the main reasons. Highlighting their centrist agenda, three “moderate” Conservative MPs joined them, opposed to prime minister Theresa May’s hardline on exiting the European Union, known as Brexit. More MPs from both sides may follow.

In response, Corbyn’s deputy, Tom Watson, another centrist, backed the defectors and scorned his own party members, reiterating claims of an antisemitism crisis in the party and saying it was time to root it out.

Corbyn has repeatedly tried to appease the centrists, as well as pro-Israel lobby groups in the UK – both those inside his party like Labour Friends of Israel and the Jewish Labour Movement, and those outside like the Board of Deputies, BICOM and the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism.

Over apparent opposition from members, the Labour party has even accepted the IHRA definition of antisemitism, including the examples meant to shield Israel from criticism – all to no effect.

In fact, the more Corbyn has conceded to critics, the more his critics have trumpeted a supposed antisemitism problem in Labour.

Corbyn is slowly learning, as others are in the US and Europe, that this is not a good-faith disagreement and that there is no middle ground.

The smear industry doesn’t want safeguards on antisemitism, they want a return to a political culture in which their power was left unchallenged and unscrutinised.

For the Israel lobby, that means the revival of a political climate that existed before the discrediting of the Oslo process, in which criticism of Israel was publicly shunned and the Palestinians were treated chiefly as terrorists.

For the centrists, it requires the entrenchment of a managerial, neoliberal politics in which major corporations and the financial industries have the freedom to dictate economic and social policies and their failures are unquestioningly bailed out by the public through austerity programmes.

The concerns are being raised days before the province is set to stop accepting comments on an examination of the Endangered Species Act.

The Progressive Conservative government says the act — implemented over a decade ago — hasn't accomplished what it needs to on a number of fronts.

""The act has been criticized for being ineffective in its aim to protect and recover species at risk, for being unclear, administratively burdensome, time consuming and costly for applicants, and for creating barriers to economic development,"" the government said in a discussion paper released when it opened consultations in January.

The government said its review was being conducted to improve protections for species at risk, as well as to look for ways to streamline approval processes and provide clarity to support economic development.

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said the government appears poised — based on the contents of its discussion paper — to loosen rules and allow for greater development that could hurt the province's 243 species at risk.

""The paper seems to be suggesting that the Endangered Species Act is getting in the way of development,"" he said. ""I think that's a false narrative.""

Schreiner said the province has a low unemployment rate and there has been strong economic growth in recent years, all while the current species protections have been in place.

""I want to make sure that if they do make any changes to the ESA that they actually strengthen it instead of weaken it,"" he said.

'We have not been doing our part'

Anna Baggio, director of conservation planning for the Wildlands League, said the government discussion paper appears to suggest a rollback of species protections is coming.

In 2013, the previous Liberal government created industry exemptions in the act that environmental groups slammed as a watering-down of the rules. It was a stark change from when the bill was first introduced and praised as a gold standard for species protection, she said.

""We have not been doing our part to protect and recover the species in spite of this law which was really good when it first came in,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, with implementation it's gone backwards.""

Baggio said the government offers little evidence that the law has impeded development or hurt the economy and has provided no data to measure its overall effectiveness.

But a spokesman for the Environment Ministry said that after a decade of implementing the Endangered Species Act, the government has learned what works well and what can work better.

""By undertaking a review of the Act, we are consulting to identify opportunities that balance the protection of species at risk and their habitat with our government's commitments to find efficiencies and streamline processes,"" Gary Wheeler said in a statement Friday evening.

Some farmers support revisions of existing law

Last month, six environmental groups — including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund-Canada, and the David Suzuki Foundation — issued a joint statement raising concerns about the review of the act.

""The government says it wants to reduce barriers to economic development,"" the groups said. ""But an overemphasis on creating greater efficiencies for industry could subject the province's at-risk species — and our natural heritage — to even greater threats. Further weakening of the act could push many of these species over the brink.""

Some sectors, however, are calling for the government to make changes to the act.

The Ontario Federation of Agriculture said it would like to see some of the regulatory burdens placed on farmers by the law lifted.

""The fact that many of the species on the risk list have habitats on and around farms shows the suitability of agricultural land as a favourable habitat for species that are endangered, threatened or of special concern,"" OFA director Larry Davis said in a statement.

""For some outside our industry, the habitat locale seems to argue for habitat protection at all cost — even over food production. That's just not a sustainable solution.""

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going.

After the United Kingdom outlawed all of the terrorist entity Hezbollah last week, Germany’s government refused to ban the political wing of the Lebanese Shi’ite organization.



A spokesman for Germany’s interior ministry (BMI) wrote The Jerusalem Post: “The BMI does not comment on concrete prohibition considerations in general; this applies regardless of whether there is reason to do so in individual cases.”

The BMI has provided the same answer to Post queries since 2008 about whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration plans to outlaw all of Hezbollah, while the EU has banned its military arm since 2013.According to 2018 German intelligence reports analyzed by the Post, there are 950 Hezbollah operatives in the federal republic who raise funds, recruit new members and spread Hezbollah’s lethal antisemitic ideology.“According to the case law of the Federal Administrative Court the entire Hezbollah is against the idea of international understanding in the sense of the Basic Law, because it fights the right of existence of the State of Israel with terrorist means,” the BMI’s spokesman said. “Such an objective is antisemitic in nature.”The UK government announced on Friday: “An order laid in Parliament on Monday (February 25) to proscribe the terrorist organizations Hezbollah, Ansaroul Islam and Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Muslimin (JNIM) has now come into effect, following debates in the Houses of Parliament.”“Under the Terrorism Act 2000, being a member – or inviting support for – these groups will be a criminal offense, carrying a sentence of up to 10 years’ imprisonment,” the statement continued. “All three groups have been assessed as being concerned in terrorism.”Germany, like the UK, is within its rights to unilaterally outlaw Hezbollah’s political wing. It is merely a matter of political will from Germany’s interior minister Horst Seehofer, from the Christian Social Union Party, and Merkel, who has described Israel’s security as “non-negotiable” for her government.The German government has banned radical Islamic associations over the years without waiting for a consensus among the EU member states. Take the example of the The True Religion (Die Wahre Religion), which was banned in 2016. Germany also banned the radical group Tauhid Germany in 2015.The Merkel administration has also banned the websiteof an extremist left-wing group and right-wing extremists entities over the years.A US State Department representative told the Post last year when asked about Germany’s refusal to ban all of Hezbollah, “They should designate Hezbollah – in its entirety – as a terrorist organization.”According to US sources familiar with Germany’s position toward Iran and Hezbollah, Germany rejected the US demand to outlaw all of Hezbollah, because the Lebanese militia “is linked to Israel-Palestinian peace talks.” The sources also told the Post last year that Germany considers the Trump administration as too pro-Israel.Germany has long been a hot-bed of Hezbollah activity. The Al-Mustafa Community Center, in the northern German city-state of Bremen, is a major hub for raising funds for Hezbollah in Lebanon, according to a German intelligence report reviewed by the Post in 2018.The Bremen intelligence agency’s report from last June stated, “The Al-Mustafa-Community Center supports Hezbollah in Lebanon, especially by collecting donations.” Berlin’s mayor, Michael Müller, permits the Hezbollah and Iranian-regime sponsored al-Quds Day rally to take place each year in the heart of Berlin’s shopping district. Al-Quds Day calls for the destruction of the Jewish state. Iranian regime institutions in Germany send Hezbollah members to the anti-Israel event.Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan wrote on Twitter: “All who truly wish to combat terror must reject the fake distinction between ‘military’ & ‘political’ wings. Now is the time for the EU to follow suit!”The EU merely banned Hezbollah’s so-called military wing in 2013 after Hezbollah blew up an Israeli tour bus in 2012 in Bulgaria. The terrorist attack murdered five Israelis, their Bulgarian Muslim bus driver, and injured 32 Israelis.The Netherlands prescribed the entire Hezbollah a terrorist organization in 2004. The United States, Canada, the Arab League and Israel all classify Hezbollah’s entire organization a terrorist entity.Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, praised the Conservative government’s move to sanction all of Hezbollah because, “the separation between the political and armed wings is a false and artificial separation, because both are controlled and supported by Iran and enable the organization to continue to raise funds on European soil.”“We will continue to lead the struggle for the Security Council to recognize Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, and mobilize the international community against it, as it serves as an arm of Iran to spread Tehran’s aggression,” Danon said.

Wilson-Raybould described what she considered an inappropriate attempt by political staffers, and even the most senior bureaucrat in the country, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, to pressure her to overrule the director of public prosecutions and negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin so it could avoid a trial over allegations it used bribery to secure government contracts in Libya.

The former justice minister told the committee that she believes the sustained pressure was inappropriate and amounted to ""political interference"" but that it wasn't illegal.

Here are some key moments from the former attorney general's committee appearance:

1. 'Sustained pressure' and 'veiled threats'

After Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions, decided in September 2018 that she would not make a deal and would proceed with a trial against SNC Lavalin, Wilson-Raybould said she reached a similar decision on the matter — and made it clear to all in government that she would not intervene in the PPSC process.

The former minister said despite that position, she still fielded 10 phone calls and sat for 10 in-person meetings with members of the PMO, including Mathieu Bouchard, Trudeau's adviser on Quebec issues, and special adviser Elder Marques, among others.

Despite attempts to convince her to reconsider her stance given the possible economic consequences, Wilson-Raybould said she was undaunted in her position and that she should take no further action.

She also said she faced pressure from Ben Chin, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's chief of staff, and Gerry Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, to consider the consequences. Butts resigned last week while saying he acted ethically.

Wilson-Raybould said she was reminded by these staffers of the political consequences for both the provincial and federal Liberal parties if SNC-Lavalin folded or laid off workers.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she said.

""Within these conversations, there were express statements regarding the necessity for interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential for consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

2. 'I am an MP in Quebec'

When Wilson-Raybould raised her discomfort with the pressure she said she faced with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a September meeting, she said Trudeau told her he, too, was worried about SNC-Lavalin layoffs and the company's continued viability if it were convicted of the criminal charges.

A conviction could bar the firm from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years, a key source of revenue for the company.

""At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am an MP in Quebec — the member for Papineau.'""

""Are you politically interfering with my role as the attorney general,"" Wilson-Raybould says she asked Trudeau. ""I would strongly advise against it."" 1:15

""I was quite taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

""My response — and I remember this vividly — was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye — I asked: 'Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.' The prime minister said, 'No, No, No – we just need to find a solution,'"" Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters after her testimony, Trudeau denied any wrongdoing and said his government was principally concerned about job losses, namely for the 9,400 Canadians who work for SNC-Lavalin, when there were discussions about the DPA.

3. 'Partisan political considerations'

Wilson-Raybould said after she told the prime minister in September that she had made a decision on the matter, all lobbying efforts by his staff and others should have immediately stopped.

""Various officials urged me to take partisan political considerations into account — which it was clearly improper for me to do,"" she said, citing talk from PMO staffers about the upcoming Quebec provincial election where the Quebec Liberal Party was facing a strong challenge from the Coalition Avenir Quebec, the right-of-centre party that ultimately prevailed.

""We either have a system that is based on the rule of law, the independence of the prosecutorial functions, and respect for those charged to use their discretion and powers in particular ways – or we do not,"" she said.

PMO staffers Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques were ""kicking the tires, I said no, my mind had been made up and they needed to stop, this was enough,"" Wilson-Raybould said. 0:41

Wilson-Raybould said she then met with Butts on Dec. 5, 2018, to discuss the ""barrage of people hounding me and my staff.""

4. 'Need to find a solution'

Wilson-Raybould said that Butts told her that, despite her misgivings, there needed to be some sort of ""solution on the SNC stuff.""

Butts is then said to have told her that he didn't like how the former Conservative government had created the Public Prosecution Service of Canada in the first place — a prosecutorial arm separate from other lawyers in the justice department.

After the meeting and amid her clear reluctance to ""find a solution,"" on Dec. 18, 2018, her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, was ""urgently summoned"" to meet with both Butts and the prime minister's chief of staff, Katie Telford, to discuss a DPA.

In a text message exchange said to have been sent immediately after that meeting, Prince told Wilson-Raybould about the conversation.

""Gerry said 'Jess, there is no solution here that doesn't involve some interference,' Wilson-Raybould said, reading the text message from Prince to the committee Wednesday.

Her chief of staff said that Butts told her, “There is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#cdnpoli</a> <a href=""https://t.co/5mfsNSqN65"">pic.twitter.com/5mfsNSqN65</a> —@PnPCBC

""At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do! Don't care about the PPSC's independence. Katie was like 'we don't want to debate legalities anymore.' … They kept being like 'we aren't lawyers, but there has to be some solution here,'"" Prince said in a text to Wilson-Raybould.

5. 'Saturday Night Massacre'

Then, on a phone call with Wernick on Dec. 19, Wilson-Raybould said the clerk made it clear to her that the prime minister was ""quite determined, quite firm"" on the matter and that he wanted to know why the DPA route ""isn't being used.""

Wernick told her that Trudeau was ""a bit worried.""

Wilson-Raybould said Wernick told her that Trudeau is ""gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.""

The clerk said the prime minister was not asking her to do anything ""outside of the box of what is legal or proper.""

Wilson-Raybould said she was quite sure she was making the right decision and that Wernick's messages on the matter were ""treading on dangerous ground here.""

""And I issued a stern warning because as the AG ... I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. And all of this screams of that,"" she said.

When Wernick told her that Trudeau understood it was Wilson-Raybould's decision alone to make and she should be aware of what the prime minister wanted on this matter, the former minister said she had thought of the ""Saturday Night Massacre.""

WATCH | 'I was having thoughts of the Saturday night massacre.'

""I was confident that I had given the prime minister my best advice to protect him."" 1:15

Wilson-Raybould was referencing a series of events in 1973 when former U.S. president Richard Nixon, during the Watergate scandal, ordered justice department officials to fire the special prosecutor probing the matter.

The attorney general, and then the deputy attorney general, resigned when asked to take this action by the president.

Wilson-Raybould said she thought she, too, would have to resign instead of following through with a direct order from the prime minister to sign a DPA or else.

6. 'I did not consider resigning'

Asked why she didn't resign from her position as attorney general and justice minister during the time she said improper pressure was being applied, Wilson-Raybould said:

""I was, in my opinion, doing my job as the attorney general. I was protecting a fundamental constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence and the independence of our judiciary. That's my job. That was my job, rather, as the attorney general.

7. 'It is not illegal'

Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday that despite the pressure she felt, she did not believe what transpired was illegal. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has asked the RCMP to investigate the matter.

Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his aides of improperly pressuring her to seek a financial settlement with SNC-Lavalin, The Globe and Mail first reported in early February. The construction and engineering giant holds multiple contracts with the Canadian government and employees approximately 9,000 Canadians.

In her Wednesday testimony before the House of Commons' Justice Committee, Wilson-Raybould said the government pressured the Justice Department to settle with SNC-Lavalin after prosecutors charged the company in 2015 with bribing the Libyan government during the reign of dictator Muammar al-Ghadaffi.

If found guilty of the charges, the company could be banned from doing business with the Canadian government for a decade, potentially leaving the 3,400 Quebec residents employed by SNC-Lavalin out of a job. One of Quebec's pension funds is also one of the largest shareholders in SNC-Lavalin, owning a 20% stake in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Wilson-Raybould and other officials said the possible economic implications of the indictment were fair considerations. François Legault, Quebec's current premier, recommended a financial settlement over concerns that the indictment would push the company to leave Canada altogether, according to the Journal.

But some Justice officials suggested that Trudeau also had political motivations to interfere with prosecutorial proceedings in order to save jobs in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Trudeau and his Liberal Party to carry in order to maintain control over the government in this October's federal elections.

Wilson-Raybould testified that she ""experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion"" over the course of several meetings and conversations with Trudeau himself and his advisors, including top aide Michael Wernick.

Both Trudeau and Wernick have forcefully denied putting political pressure to drop the charges on Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from her position in Trudeau's cabinet after she was moved to a lower-level role in the veterans affairs' department amid the fallout of the scandal.

""I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of these events,"" Trudeau said of Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.

Wernick also disputed Wilson-Raybould's testimony that he also applied pressure on her to drop the charges, but said that he communicated to her that ""a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.""

While Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating the matter to formally determine whether Trudeau improperly interfered in the probe, the scandal may already be hurting his electoral prospects.

A recent Ipsos poll found Trudeau's approval rating declining, and the Conservative party pulling ahead of the Liberals on the generic ballot.

Trudeau responded that he ""completely disagrees with the former attorney general's characterization of events.""

The lawmakers are due to hold an emergency debate on the scandal on Thursday.

Firm bribed Gadhafi government

The scandal has rocked the Trudeau administration as the Liberal party leader prepares to run for re-election in October. It centers around allegations that SNC-Lavalin bribed officials in the Libyan government under strongman Muammar Gadhafi between 2001 and 2011.

The company was formally charged with corruption in 2015, with prosecutors saying that it had paid Gadhafi's regime 130 million Canadian dollars (US$99 million) for lucrative government contracts, including the Great Man-Made River Project, the biggest irrigation project in history.

SNC-Lavalin heavily lobbied the government to settle the corruption case out of court. The firm has repeatedly claimed that anyone responsible for the wrongdoing has since left the company.

'Serious red flags'

Wilson-Raybould testified that ""the prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution for SNC, citing that if there is no DPA (deferred prosecution agreement), there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal.""

Jody Wilson-Raybould she was ""barraged"" and faced ""hounding"" over the case

She said 11 other top officials, including Finance Minister Bill Morneau, raised concerns that the firm would move to London if it did not face favorable legal conditions in Canada.

They ""urged me to take partisan political considerations into account, which was clearly improper,"" she said, adding that while ""not illegal,"" it had ""raised serious red flags.""

Wilson-Raybould resigned in January, along with Trudeau's longtime ally and principal secretary Gerry Butts, who has been vague about his reasons for leaving the government.

Freeland closes ranks with Trudeau

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer said that the prime minister should step down over the scandal, claiming Trudeau ""can no longer and in good standing with a clear conscience lead this nation."" He also called for a federal investigation into the possibility that government officials obstructed justice.

""The matter at hand appears, on its face, to be a gross violation of the law,"" Scheer wrote in a letter to federal police.

Trudeau disputed the nature of the discussions in a news conference, saying that ""our government will always focus on jobs"" and that his administration was merely debating the impact the case could have on the company's Montreal workforce.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared at Canada's CBC broadcaster to pledge her full support to the 47-year-old prime minister.

""Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent,"" said the popular minister, whom some see as a possible successor of Trudeau.

""I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,"" she added.

The Progressive Conservative government says the act — implemented over a decade ago — hasn’t accomplished what it needs to on a number of fronts. “The act has been criticized for being ineffective in its aim to protect and recover species at risk, for being unclear, administratively burdensome, time consuming and costly for applicants, and for creating barriers to economic development,” the government said in a discussion paper released when it opened consultations in January.

Further weakening of the act could push many of these species over the brink.” Some sectors, however, are calling for the government to make changes to the act.

Mr. Penn added, “Despite my misgivings about the Mueller investigation, let me be clear as a lifelong Democrat under no circumstances would I work paid or unpaid for President Trump nor was this meeting about that in any way.”

Reached late Friday night, however, Mr. Stein said he invited Mr. Penn to the meeting specifically to discuss polls with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Penn was one of three advisers who helped Mr. Clinton navigate toward the political center when he battling a newly empowered Republican majority in Congress led by Newt Gingrich, then the House speaker. He stuck with the Clintons longer than some of Mr. Clinton’s other political gurus, like Dick Morris and Douglas E. Schoen, who became highly vocal Clinton antagonists. Mr. Penn also helped Mrs. Clinton win a New York Senate seat in 2000.

But his fallout with the onetime reigning brand in Democratic politics began during Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, where he clashed with other advisers and was ultimately removed as the chief strategist. Over the past year, like Mr. Schoen and Mr. Morris, he too has won praise on the other side of the political spectrum as he has become seen as a heretic on the left.

Mr. Penn has been praised internally at the White House, and by the president himself, for his fulsome attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. In his appearances on Fox News — he last appeared on MSNBC in September 2017 — and in his opinion pieces in the conservative-leaning opinions pages of The Hill, Mr. Penn has accused Mr. Mueller of overreaching in his investigation.

But an actual sit-down meeting with the president in the Oval Office was, for some former colleagues of Mr. Penn, the inevitable outcome of what they see as his rightward lurch. “Some people are loyal to Republican red, some people to Democratic blue and some capitalism green,” said Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Mrs. Clinton, who served as her gatekeeper in the Senate and at the State Department.","White House Memo: Mark Penn, Ex-Clinton Loyalist, Visits Trump, and Democrats Are Not Pleased",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/us/politics/mark-penn-trump-clinton.html

Assembling a presentation for sympathetic political donors, they listed points of weakness for Mr. Trump such as “tweeting/temperament” and “criminality/corruption.”

The group concluded that Mr. Trump’s scandals were not yet badly damaging him with Republican-leaning voters: “Even relatively high information voters aren’t paying particularly close attention to day-to-day scandals,” the presentation stated. But it added that there was “room to educate voters” on the subject.

Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, may have begun that education on Wednesday.

With Mr. Cohen’s appearance before a House committee, the public airing of ethical transgressions by Mr. Trump reached a new phase, one that may be harder to ignore for friends and foes alike. The spectacle of Mr. Trump’s onetime enforcer denouncing him in televised proceedings, detailing a catalog of allegations of cruelty and crimes, signaled the pressure the president’s already strained coalition could feel in the coming months as Congress scrutinizes him, and as the special counsel Robert S.

219,Empty,2019-02-25T19:00:57Z,Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination must come out against the filibuster.,"It would take decades before senators realized that without such a motion, there was no way for a simple majority to forcibly end debate, what we now call “cloture.” It was possible for a single member to block anything he opposed, and it took unanimous consent to stop him.

The filibuster was born. But the small size of the Senate and informal rules around deliberation meant it wasn’t used in earnest until the late 19th century, as American politics became more polarized around party and ideology, and informal rules around speaking and debate could not accommodate the increased pace of activity in the chamber.

The modern filibuster began to take shape in 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson used war demands to pressure the Senate into adopting cloture and a supermajority threshold for ending debate (at the time, it required two-thirds of the Senate ). But even with reform, the filibuster remained a powerful tool for “tedious delays” and “contemptible compromises of the public good.”

In the 20th century, recalcitrant senators used the filibuster to block or delay anti-lynching laws, bans on poll taxes, bans on literacy tests, and other civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was nearly killed by a filibuster. In recent decades, routine use of the filibuster has made it difficult for presidents to pursue their agendas and for Congress to pass major legislation. In turn, it has obscured democratic accountability and made voters feel less efficacious — when voting majorities to power isn’t enough to change the way things are, it’s fair to wonder if electoral politics is worth the trouble.

We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won’t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies — to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care — will go entirely through the Democratic Party.

As it stands, Democrats would be lucky to win a Senate majority in 2020, much less the supermajority needed to end a filibuster. For the party to have any hope at actually implementing its agenda, the filibuster needs to be either reformed or eliminated. And the first step toward that is litigating the issue in public to help voters see the cost of preserving this rule, which could put pressure on other senators if a movement forms to end it.

The Senate was built to govern, not to spend its time in endless deliberation, and the legislative filibuster makes that difficult, if not impossible. It does so in ways that typically disadvantage progressives and reformers, and which will cripple the next Democratic administration, as it nearly did the previous one. Any potential political danger — Republicans could easily attack an anti-filibuster push as the first step toward taking away our cars, cows and airplanes — is outweighed by the power that comes with being able to credibly connect the election outcome to a particular policy. Give me the votes, and I’ll give you this plan.

If Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand or any of the other Democratic candidates are actually serious about their policy agendas, the only choice they have is to abandon their attachment to this arcane procedure and lead their party to a firm consensus against a rule that was never supposed to exist.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of half a dozen Democratic senators running for the White House, is reintroducing a bill on Thursday that would fundamentally end the federal government's prohibition on marijuana.

The Marijuana Justice Act, which was first introduced by Booker in August of 2017, seeks to make marijuana legal at the federal level by removing it from the list of controlled substances, while also expunging the convictions of previous marijuana drug offenders and reinvesting in low-income and minority communities that were particularly hard hit by the federal government's war on drugs.

Some other senators running for president are co-sponsors of the legislation, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as well as Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, who is considering a bid.

Two key senators from the Midwest are not listed as co-sponsors: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who's also running for president, and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who is mulling a 2020 bid.

Ten states plus Washington, D.C., have legalized some amount of recreational marijuana, and 33 states plus D.C. allow medical marijuana.

Warren introduced a bipartisan piece of legislation last year with Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., to prevent the federal prohibition on marijuana from applying to states that had already legalized it. But Booker's legislation, which she supports, is a more sweeping change.

The bill is retroactive and would apply to people currently serving time for marijuana-related offenses.

The support for Booker's proposal among fellow Senate Democrats vying for the White House is a sign of how much the party has shifted in recent years, and the degree to which candidates feel they need to bolster their progressive credentials in a crowded Democratic field.

It's also an indication of the overall appetite for progressive policies in the 2020 Democratic primary race.

Sanders re-introduced the Raise the Wage Act last month, which would increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour. It was co-sponsored by nearly every Democratic senator considering a run for the presidency: Booker, Brown, Gillibrand, Harris, Klobuchar, Merkley and Warren.

He is not alone in questioning if he is the man for the moment.

The clamor for Biden to join the pack seeking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump has quieted as the Democratic field has grown more crowded and diverse, according to interviews with more than two dozen strategists, activists, party organizers and voters.

Opinion polls show Biden, a former U.S. senator from Delaware who served two terms as former President Barack Obama’s vice president, remains popular. But the Democratic Party may no longer need him in order to be competitive against Trump.

“I love Joe Biden. He’s a great guy and a great politician,” said Jerry Shriner, a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho. “I wish he were the president right now. But I’m not sure I wish he is president in 2021.”

Democrats are in the early stages of an internal debate about how best to challenge Trump in next year’s presidential election, weighing factors like electability, ideology and identity.

The strength of the field - expected to include at least six sitting U.S. senators, plus several current or former governors, U.S. House of Representatives members and a former Cabinet secretary - is a factor in Biden’s calculations, those close to him say.

He will be more likely to remain on the sidelines if he feels a strong candidate capable of beating Trump is emerging.

But a source close to Biden said: “If I had to guess, he’s probably going to do it.”

Biden associates have held discussions with potential staffers and supporters who could serve political strategy, grassroots organizing and digital campaign roles, according to two sources. One source said those conversations were necessary to quickly ramp up a formal campaign operation should Biden decide to run.

Some party activists say, however, that Biden has not reached out to broad donor networks to gauge the level of monetary support he could expect.

Biden, who mounted failed presidential campaigns in 1998 and 2008, said at an event in Delaware on Tuesday that he did not want a third bid to be “a fool’s errand.”

“What I don’t want to do is take people’s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee,” he said. “I think I can.”

‘TOO OLD’

Biden chose not to run in 2016 when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was widely considered the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination. Some political analysts have since speculated he could have won industrial battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that proved crucial to Trump’s surprise victory.

Biden’s high name recognition among Democratic voters means he likely can afford to wait longer than lesser-known candidates to enter the 2020 race. But even that comes with a risk.

“The longer he waits, the more people are going to start to want to follow some of the new and younger voices they’re hearing,” said Bret Niles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa.

Biden’s age, ideology and record already are drawing scrutiny. If elected, he would be 78 when he was sworn in.

“Joe Biden is too old,” said Mary Donough, 60, a Democrat from Des Moines, Iowa, who plans to participate in her state’s crucial nominating caucus next year and wants a younger candidate to challenge Trump.

“There is just more energy there,” she said.

Biden’s backers will argue his age represents experience, said a former aide who asked to speak on background in order to explain internal talking points.

“Voters look at Donald Trump and they look at what we’re missing, which is someone who understands the institution, someone who is an adult, someone who is seasoned, someone who respects the institutions,” the former aide said.

If Biden does run, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, said on Thursday that Trump and the Republican Party would attack his work as vice president under Obama.

“Go ahead and run,” McDaniel told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. “Run on your record of stagnant wages, of jobs leaving this country, of manufacturing jobs fleeing United States of America, of bad trade deals, of bad foreign policy.

The Democratic Party undoubtedly has moved left since the last time Biden appeared alone on a ballot in 2008, when he was re-elected to the Senate by Delaware voters for his seventh term.

“Times have changed,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “Does he meet the moment?”

Green, whose group supports the candidacy of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, lumps Biden in with white, male, moderate Democrats who have faltered in recent elections, like Phil Bredesen, who lost his U.S. Senate race in Tennessee last year.

Biden also will have to answer for his record.

He chaired the 1991 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and was criticized for not doing enough to protect Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Biden has since apologized and said he should have done more to shield Hill from attacks by Republicans.

Unions remain unhappy about the free-trade deals advocated by the Obama administration, and liberal progressive groups point to the bailout of Wall Street banks during the financial crisis that provided no help to distressed homeowners.

Sharon Holle, who has been working to organize for Biden in Iowa ahead of his decision, argued his experience would appeal to Democrats nervous about the country’s direction under Trump.

“People are scared,” Holle said. “We’re in a crisis right now. We need somebody we can trust.”","As Biden weighs 2020 bid, Democrats ask: 'Does he meet the moment?'",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-idUSKCN1QH1EX

Ms. Preckwinkle, 72, has spent most of her career immersed in Chicago government, climbing from Fourth Ward alderman to Cook County Board of Commissioners president and chairwoman of the county Democratic Party. Along the way, she has built a reputation as a true progressive and a founder of the Progressive Caucus on the City Council. She has favored criminal justice reform, affordable housing, repairing relationships between police and communities, and economic development in neglected neighborhoods in Chicago.

In February, she was narrowly surpassed in votes by Ms. Lightfoot, 56, who has never held elected office and has promised “a new progressive vision for the city.”

Ms. Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor and former president of the Chicago Police Board, an oversight group, is not far apart ideologically from Ms. Preckwinkle on many of the issues facing the city.

But she is trying to define herself as the true progressive in the race partly by highlighting Ms. Preckwinkle’s time in government, especially her relationship with Edward M. Burke, a Chicago alderman who has been charged with attempted extortion and held a fund-raiser for Ms. Preckwinkle. She returned the money and stripped Mr. Burke of his role as chairman of a county committee. (In things that haven’t changed when it comes to Chicago elections, Mr. Burke was re-elected in February despite facing a criminal charge.)

In February, when she knew she was headed for a runoff, she reflected on Chicago’s shifting political order. “I remember when ‘progressive’ wasn’t a positive,” she said. “It was at best a euphemism for ‘unelectable.’ Those of us who proudly claimed it had to fight to transform the political landscape.”",Chicago’s Political Order Was Upended This Week.

Is nothing sacred? Democrats want to take away hamburgers from the American people, an ex-Trump aide has warned.

The wild claim about a supposed plot to ban the national food came from onetime White House aide Sebastian Gorka at a conservative political jamboree.

The humble ground-beef patty has become ammunition in a US cultural food fight since a Democrat dared to suggest Americans eat fewer of the sandwiches.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been touting a climate change plan.

Railing against Democrats, Mr Gorka told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland on Thursday: ""They want to take your pickup truck.

""They want to rebuild your home. They want to take away your hamburgers.""

Perhaps even more dubiously, he added: ""This is what Stalin dreamt about but never achieved.""

Ms Ocasio-Cortez provoked conservative scorn this month when she along with Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, unveiled the Green New Deal.

Their policy paper proposed to overhaul the US economy to tackle climate change.

But it was a reference to ""farting cows"" in a since-retracted accompanying document that invited the ridicule of eager critics.

""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero, emissions in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast,"" the offending section said.

There is no reference to banning cows in the text of the Green New Deal itself. So, as Washington politicos used to say, where's the beef?

But Republicans seized on it as evidence of a radical far-left agenda within the Democratic party.

President Donald Trump suggested at a rally in El Paso, Texas, that ""you're not allowed to own cows anymore"".

Republican members of the House Natural Resources Committee took to eating hamburgers on Capitol Hill to protest against the Green New Deal.

The issue was quickly taken up on social media by conservatives, who shared photos of themselves cooking and eating beef.

Addressing the controversy, Ms Ocasio-Cortez told a late-night talk show that nobody would be forced to ""go vegan"", but that ""we've got to address factory farming"".

""Maybe we shouldn't be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch, and dinner,"" added the New York City congresswoman, a self-described democratic socialist.

While bovine flatulence is often connected to climate change, a cow releases more greenhouse gasses through burping (around 600 litres of methane a day).

Some suggested that even if the Green New Deal did call for a ban on burgers, it would be worth it to ""save Earth"".

Hamburger-gate raged on this week after Ms Ocasio-Cortez was photographed having dinner at a Washington restaurant with a colleague, who was caught eating the now-controversial meal.

The photograph went viral, with some suggesting the congresswoman was a hypocrite.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, joked that the photo proved a ""vast conspiracy"" to allow Americans to eat burgers.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history. President Donald Trump has invoked national emergency power to secure federal funds for a wall that Congress refused to pay for. He has done so based on an alleged crisis at the border that almost no reputable expert agrees is real.

""The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates,"" proclaimed 58 prominent ex-national security officials who oppose what the President is trying to do. They made this assertion -- to be entered into the Congressional Record -- in a 13-page joint statement issued Monday.

Even some Republican loyalists understand that if President Trump takes this step to finance a border wall, future presidents in both parties will have sufficient justification to enact policy to tackle their goals, including initiatives on climate change, without congressional support.

Congress has the power to stop President Trump if it wants to; it doesn't need the courts to step in. If the House and Senate vote for a resolution revoking this use of emergency power, with sufficient votes to override an expected presidential veto, Trump has to back down. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , Congress gave itself the power to restrain the president.

But President Trump is tweeting out warnings to his fellow Republicans. ""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" he tweeted Monday morning. In a follow up , he asked: ""Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?""

The good news for President Trump is that the odds are on his side. Most Republicans won't go along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Although a handful of Republicans have indicated they opposed the emergency declaration, most have not. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass legislation reversing Trump's emergency order, but it is not even likely that the resolution will make its way through the Senate, where the Republicans hold power.

This vote is the latest in a series of critical moments since January 2017 in which congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be the foundation of the Trump presidency rather than passive bystanders. Republicans have made active decisions that strengthened the President's hand or allowed him to use his authority in unprecedented fashion because it seemed to serve their political interest.

When Republicans did not censure President Trump after his stunning failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the party showed that it had the President's back . When the party ended his controversial first year by voting in favor of Trump's massive corporate tax cut, it handed him a crucial legislative victory at a key point in his presidency -- one that greatly improved his standing with the Republican electorate.

When then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes released a memo making pointed accusations about the motives of the FBI, he and the Republicans on his committee joined in on the President's ongoing assault on law enforcement institutions -- an apparent attempt to discredit the investigations into his campaign and presidency.

Most recently, the Republicans allowed President Trump to shut down the federal government for the longest period in American history , even though the Senate had reached an agreement over the budget, so that the administration could score political points with the base. Government workers went without pay so that the party could start setting up for the 2020 campaign.

In announcing the deal to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the President turning to emergency power -- only days after expressing his staunch opposition to such a move.

This week's vote might be the most important of all these enabling moments. If the Republicans don't vote to stand between Trump and this aggressive use of presidential power, they are giving consent to the President to unilaterally siphon money from programs that Congress has funded into a program that Congress refused to support.

The agency wrote that the task force will be staffed with career officials and is modeled on the 2002 Merger Litigation Task Force, which had roles in reviewing both hospital mergers and enforcement in retail business. FTC officials did not discuss specific companies that might be examined by the new force, the Journal wrote:

The new task force will be drawn from existing staff, and include 17 FTC attorneys. While FTC officials said they couldn’t discuss specific cases they would be examining, they said they would consider breaking up deals that are creating harms. “In general with consummated mergers we have the full panoply of remedies,” said Bruce Hoffman, the director of the FTC’s competition bureau. That could include breaking up merged firms or requiring a spinoff of specific units, he added, assuming the FTC can meet its legal burden of showing harm.

However, obvious potential targets are tech titans like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. The former has bought up numerous competitors such as WhatsApp and Instagram, and the FTC is reportedly mulling slapping it with a massive fine for potential violations of a 2011 deal with the agency on user privacy. Google has rapidly bought up swathes of the digital ad business and owns YouTube, and along with Facebook is estimated to control well over half of the U.S. digital ad market. Amazon has regularly faced accusations of anti-competitive behavior. All three companies, as well as other major tech firms, have faced calls to break them up or at least soften their edges.

“The FTC, if it is to remain relevant, needs some way of assessing the evident competition problems in the tech sector and taking action when necessary,” Columbia University law professor Tim Wu told the Journal. “The FTC needs to get past its laser-focus on consumer prices, and figure out what competitive harm means in today’s tech markets.”

Donald Trump’s administration threatened to investigate Facebook, Twitter, and Google last year, accusing them of silencing and discriminating against conservative voices online.

While claims of bias and censorship by big tech companies are by no means exclusive to any one side of the political spectrum, the narrative coming from Trump and the broader GOP has included repeated and baseless accusations tech companies are controlled by liberals and serve as de facto arms of the Democratic Party. (Trump, for one, has promoted this idea with wild-eyed claims of “SHADOW BANNING” on Twitter, doctored videos purporting to show Google blacklisting his speeches, and diatribes against Facebook.) Last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of federal and state law enforcement officials, reportedly trying to focus their energy on investigating those claims of left-wing bias instead other concerns like handling of user data.



Those efforts, so far, have amounted to little more than empty threats, and there’s no indication at this moment that the FTC’s new commission has anything to do with them. (In fact, the FTC has been examining these issues separately for some time.) Per Wired, there is actually some concern from tech critics that the agency won’t even rouse itself to do much of anything on the more legitimate antitrust concerns.

Matt Stoller, a fellow at the anti-monopoly Open Markets Institute, told Wired that the FTC has taken no real antitrust action to date on big tech and he was “scornful of the new seating arrangements, because the FTC has consistently proven they do not want to wield power.”

“They want to hold hearings. They want to get their friend economists and antitrust lawyers to fly into DC and talk to each other,” Stoller added. “They don’t want to do their No. 1 job, which is to police markets for unfair and anticompetitive behavior.”

The Global Strategy Group's sixth annual Business and Politics Survey found that Americans are now associating lots of brands with political parties — and many even expect corporations to take a stand on big political issues.

While consumers have boycotted brands over their actions or their inaction on key political issues, the GSG report ultimately concluded companies face a greater reward than a penalty for staking out positions on prominent social and political subjects, such as race and gender equality.

79% of Americans surveyed for the report said companies should take action on important issues, and 87% agreed that brands have the economic and social capital to drive change.

Consumers also associate brands with either the Democratic or the Republican Party based on their public stances.

229,Empty,2019-03-02T11:00:00Z,The party hopes to restore and extend key provisions of the Voting Rights Act.,"The Voting Rights Advancement Act is written to “restore and bolster the Voting Rights Act, and undo the damage done by the Shelby County decision,” Sewell said in a press release. In that decision, Chief Justice John Roberts invalidated the Voting Rights Act’s “coverage formula,” a list of jurisdictions that had to seek federal preclearance for any changes to elections laws. In Roberts’s reckoning, racism in the country had been pared back, and continuing to require special scrutiny of those jurisdictions—despite the numerous laws they proposed over the years that failed preclearance tests and resulted in litigation—was unconstitutional.

Since then, voting-rights advocates and several Democrats argue that the country has been mired in a new—and predictable—age of accelerated voter suppression and restrictive voting laws. “We’ve just seen since Shelby an onslaught of more restrictive voting laws,” Sewell told me a few weeks ago in her office.

She often speaks on the voter-ID laws in her home state. They have grown tighter over time in ways that seem to uniquely disadvantage elderly black voters, who may not have or need a driver’s license, and who, having grown up in the rural Jim Crow South, may not have ever had the official documentation to get some strict forms of ID. Sewell cites her own father, who died in 2017 and had a series of strokes that left him wheelchair-bound near the end of his life. “He didn’t have a driver’s license but he had been voting—until Alabama changed its law in 2014—with a validly issued federal ID called a Social Security card,” she told me.

Alabama is one of several states that have rapidly created more restrictive voting laws post–Shelby County, and also where gerrymandering, voter purges, and zealous campaigns against the specter of noncitizen voting by a wave of pro-Trump state attorneys general and secretaries of state have dominated the political process. In North Carolina, GOP legislators have fought to maintain power with gerrymandered maps, enacted a voter-ID and elections-law package that one federal court said discriminated against black people “with almost surgical precision,” and have leveraged just about every antidemocratic measure to maintain power. The past few months in North Carolina have culminated in a so-called legislative coup by the GOP, aimed at disempowering a newly elected Democratic governor. The State Board of Elections decided last week to redo the congressional race in the Ninth District in light of evidence that election fraud on behalf of the Republican candidate Mark Harris influenced the result.

Not to be outdone, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp won his election against Democrat Stacey Abrams after a mass campaign of voter suppression, including hundreds of thousands of voter purges that disproportionately affected people of color—in an election that he administered as secretary of state. In Texas, gerrymandering, voter-ID laws, and court rulings have been at the center of politics for years, and almost got the state placed back under federal preclearance. A North Dakota voter-ID law in place in 2018 seemed to specifically target the state’s Native American population. Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an architect of the post–Shelby County Republican elections-law strategy, lost his bid for governor after facing allegations of voter suppression. And places like Maricopa County, Arizona, have seen purges and Election Day lines over the years that have disproportionately affected Latinos and other minorities at incredibly high rates.",The Democrats’ New Voting Rights Moment,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/democrats-hope-restore-key-section-voting-rights-act/583969/
230,Empty,2019-02-26T11:00:04Z,Is it time for the U.S. to confront other great powers — or to retreat?,"Mr. Trump shares some of these inclinations. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” he proclaimed in the State of the Union. He has pledged to pull most ground troops out of Syria and is pursuing negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan. On the whole, though, most advocates of restraint find little to like in Mr. Trump’s militarized foreign policy. They see a president who has attempted to assert American dominance over the world, boosting the defense budget, escalating military interventions in the Middle East and Africa, and imposing new sanctions on Iran and now Venezuela.

Yet they also see an opportunity to constrain the United States’ military adventurism by opposing the war powers of an unprincipled and unstrategic commander in chief. On Feb. 13, antiwar forces scored a victory when the House voted to end military support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. If the resolution passes the Senate, it will mark the first time Congress has invoked the 1973 War Powers Act in order to bind the president to remove American forces active in hostilities abroad.

The bill also offers a template for further withdrawals, according to its Senate sponsors, Democrat Chris Murphy, Independent Bernie Sanders and Republican Mike Lee. “Since 9/11, politicians have become far too comfortable with American military interventions all over the world,” they have written. The next step may be to repeal the Authorization for the Use of Military Force passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, which successive presidents have used to justify almost unlimited warmaking in the greater Middle East.

Restraint is advancing on the left of the Democratic Party, but it’s not yet clear whether it can pierce the center as domestic proposals like Medicare for All have done. Calls to cut military spending, advanced by Mr. Sanders and House progressives, have not quite become a core principle of the progressive movement. And advocates of restraint tend to become less vocal and unified when they turn beyond the Middle East. The sponsor of the House’s Yemen resolution, Representative Ro Khanna, has distinguished himself by supporting diplomacy with North Korea and opposing regime change in Venezuela, but he stands apart. The restraint coalition would benefit from taking a similarly global view if it is to advance a comprehensive alternative to the status quo.

The Coming Clash?

Does the future belong to great power competition or restraint? Partisans of each camp have good reason to feel the wind at their back. Decades of policy failure have converged with the daily eruptions of President Trump to throw open the question of what America’s place in the world should be.

What’s more, the two camps have not quite trained their sights on each other. That is partly because advocates of great power competition in the establishment remain obsessed with Mr. Trump, while advocates of restraint have been marginalized for so long that they need to pick their battles. One can even glimpse the outlines of a tacit bargain between them, breaking down geographically: As restrainers try to end wars in the Middle East, centrists pivot toward the Pacific, where the adversaries are larger but war less likely.

For now, savvy politicians can adopt both positions at once. Ms. Warren, for example, denounces Chinese and Russian behavior at the same time that she promises to remove troops from Afghanistan and “cut our bloated defense budget.” And Democrat-leaning experts not previously outraged by America’s Middle East entanglements now bemoan them as distractions. Before long, it will be only anti-Iran, pro-Israel hard-liners — members of the Trump administration and Democratic leadership included — who will strongly defend America’s posture in the region.",2020 Will See a Monumental Clash Over America’s Place in the World,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/opinion/2020-foreign-policy.html

Despite the numerous controversies that have enveloped the administration since its inception – and the risk that the drumbeat of negative coverage could turn off supporters in 2020 – new presidential rally data, shared with Fox News, is boosting campaign hopes.

OPINION: THIS IS TRUMP'S BEST MESSAGE GOING INTO 2020 (AND HE DIDN'T EVEN WRITE IT)

""President Trump’s clear record of accomplishment for the American people should appeal to all voters, including those who did not vote in 2016,” said Kayleigh McEnany, newly named press secretary for the Trump campaign. ""Thanks to President Trump, Americans are now benefiting from new jobs, bigger paychecks, leadership on the world stage, and the confirmation of Constitution-abiding judges.”

The Republican National Committee’s analysis of data from the president’s rally in El Paso last month — his first of the year — showed nearly a quarter of those who attended did not vote in any of the past four elections, including 2016. The numbers also showed that another 25 percent of those who attended the rally only voted in one out of the past four elections.

Of those who RSVP’d to the rally, 70 percent were Hispanic and nearly 50 percent were female. Additionally, 60 percent were between 26 and 55 years old, according to the RNC. Party officials see them as new voters available to them in 2020, especially since they were interested enough in Trump to attend a rally.

""Enthusiasm for President Trump's successful agenda is reflected in the tens of thousands of new and non-traditional voters who attend his rallies and donate to us,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement. ""Once these voters show up, the RNC works hand-in-glove with the campaign to keep them involved and ensure they show up for President Trump on election day as well.”

FOX NEWS POLL: MAJORITY THINKS DEMOCRATS HAVE A CHANCE TO UNSEAT TRUMP IN 2020

The RNC is continuing a practice from 2018 to follow up with those who RSVP to rallies with a text, which is usually sent the next day. The text typically includes a link either to voter registration information or a particular policy issue on the GOP’s website.

Republican strategists in key states agree that they’re seeing the potential for new Trump voters, including places like Pennsylvania and Florida.

""In Pennsylvania, there are a significant number of voters who didn’t turn up in 2016 that will show up at the next presidential election [and] will show up in favor of President Trump,” said Charlie Gerow, longtime Republicans strategist in Pennsylvania. Gerow said that some voters may have been unsure of Trump in 2016, but appreciate the administration’s emphasis on opioids, energy and manufacturing jobs and could be persuaded.

In Florida, strategists say that Trump’s strong language against socialism and tough stance against disputed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro will do him favors in a state with a high immigrant population from socialist countries.

""Some of the things that are starting to define 2020 campaign -- and were in the State of the Union speech -- were things like the showdown over socialism,” said Adam Goodman, a Florida Republican strategist. “That gives the president an opening and opportunity.""

To be sure, the embrace by several Democratic presidential candidates of big-government policies like the Green New Deal has emboldened Republicans, arming political operatives with a potent rhetorical weapon going into 2020.

Republicans will certainly have challenges to contend with, though, including the enthusiasm on the Democratic side that won them back the House of Representatives last fall. One Democratic strategist said it’s expected that voters who didn’t engage in 2016 will be more involved in 2020 amid renewed activism, particularly among progressives.

“Look no further than the Women’s March after Donald Trump’s inauguration,” the strategist said. “We’ve engaged a ton of folks that didn’t engage in 2016 and that carried through to 2018 when Democrats made sweeping gains in the governor’s mansions and statehouses.”

The Democratic National Committee is also preparing its ground game early – looking beyond the primary states – so that they have an infrastructure in place for whoever is the nominee. The DNC announced plans to recruit and train college students who are expected to graduate by June 2020 as field organizers across the country, calling it Organization Corps 2020.

“We know that the key to defeating Donald Trump in 2020 is to organize early and put the best team in place to motivate Democratic voters to make their voices heard,” DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement announcing the new initiative.

Another concern for Republicans remains the president’s polling numbers, with his approval ratings rising but still underwater at 44 percent, according to Gallup. The partial government shutdown was widely seen as a reputational blow for Republicans, including the Trump administration.

Other recent polling reflects a mixed picture. A Fox News poll in December, taken before the shutdown began, showed a strong 67 percent of Trump voters would definitely vote for him again in 2020. Still, up to 10 percent said they would probably or definitely vote for someone else – meaning the Trump re-election campaign could lose a fraction of its 2016 support, even as it identifies and wins over new supporters.

Democrats are already pointing to the president’s approval rating as evidence the president’s re-election outlook looks bleak.

“As we head into 2020, it's clear that Donald Trump will struggle with his re-election campaign with an approval rating barely breaking 40 percent,” said Sabrina Singh, a DNC spokesperson. “We will continue to harness that same energy we saw in 2018 by putting organizers on the ground early to engage in their communities and expand the electorate.""","Trump campaign sees potential for new 2020 supporters, in rally turnout - Fox News",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-sees-potential-for-new-2020-supporters-in-rally-turnout

While the issue of marijuana legalization and decriminalization was once a source of division among the Democratic Party, it has since become a mainstream stance among most Democrats, especially those running on platforms revolving around criminal justice reform.

Recreational marijuana is now legal in 10 states and the District of Columbia. A total of 33 states have approved marijuana use for medicinal purposes.

Under the Trump administration and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice has aggressively cracked down on marijuana operations in states that have legalized the drug — making marijuana a prominent issue in the 2020 presidential election.

So far, nearly every single declared Democratic presidential candidate and one potential Republican contender have come out in support of both decriminalization and legalization of marijuana at the federal level.

New Jersey Senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker formally introduced the Marijuana Justice Act, an ambitious piece of legislation that aims to de-classify marijuana's status as a schedule one drug and expunge thousands of federal marijuana possession convictions.

Other presidential candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Bernie Sanders, signed on to the legislation as co-sponsors.

Michael Cohen, once the president’s personal lawyer, told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform of misbehavior and possibly criminal conduct on the part of his former client ranging from paying off mistresses and lying about a real estate deal in Moscow to inflating the value of his assets for insurance purposes and deflating them when paying his taxes.

Yet Mr. Cohen testified that he had no evidence of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia and was never explicitly ordered by Mr. Trump to lie to Congress. Mr. Cohen had inferred, however, that Mr. Trump wanted him to lie. Mr. Cohen’s lies under oath are one of the reasons he is headed to a federal prison.

For all the sensationalism and political excitement of Mr. Cohen’s testimony, it is worth remembering that Mr. Trump has not, in fact, been found guilty of any crime, something that cannot be said about his former lawyer. Would any of the president’s critics credit Mr. Cohen’s veracity if he were testifying in support of his former employer, rather than against him? Whatever you think about Donald Trump, Michael Cohen simply is not an honest person. The idea that he suddenly becomes one as soon as he has something bad to say about the president is far-fetched, to say the least.

High-profile congressional hearings are show business, and this one was no exception. It bears comparison with the highly politicized hearings that a Republican-controlled Congress held during the Obama administration, looking into such matters as arms sales to Mexican drug cartels as part of a botched sting strategy by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (Operation Fast and Furious) and conflicting State Department claims about the circumstances of the 2012 attack by Islamist militants on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Maybe you heard: Communist Cuba is on the road to freedom.

That’s what Cuba’s rulers want you to think after the Cuban people overwhelmingly approved a new constitution on Sunday. But the opposite is true. Cuba’s rulers have only cemented their control, and the Cuban people are no closer to freedom today.

Just look at the process that created this new constitution, which was anything but democratic. It began last summer when the National Assembly established a commission to draft the text. The Assembly claims to represent the Cuban people, but its most recent election fielded a party-approved candidate in each of its 612 races. The electorate could only vote yes or no. Every Communist candidate won.

As for the commission, it consisted of 33 hardline Communist loyalists, chaired by none other than First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Raul Castro. Its only goal was to safeguard the tyrannical one-party state, which it accomplished by drafting a charter that makes socialism in Cuba “irrevocable.”

Ultimately, the new constitution is little more than a public-relations stunt. Like the Soviet constitution of old, it has freedom-friendly language on paper that disappears in reality.

More commentary: Venezuela was my home, and socialism destroyed it. Slowly, it will destroy America, too.

Green New Deal’s 55 promises that have little to do with climate change: The full list

Are you really into socialism? You're probably not.

For example, the document ostensibly recognizes private property for the first time. This is a meaningless clause considering the constitution also reiterates the “irrevocable” role of central planning and state control over production and land use. Nor can there be any meaningful protection of private property in a country that refuses to recognize the concept of individual rights.

Cuba's fake rights

Similarly, the text appears to restore the presumption of innocence in Cuban courts and the right to legal representation. This, too, is a dead letter. All lawyers and judges serve at the pleasure of the Communist Party and follow its dictates. The regime also routinely ignores those due process obligations that already exist in Cuban law, including the right to petition the authorities with grievances, and has arrested and imprisoned thousands of political prisoners without formal charges in recent years.

Finally, the constitution seems to place constraints on Cuba’s president, restricting the position to two consecutive terms and creating a new and co-equal office of prime minister. But the true ruler of the country — as in all Marxist systems from China to North Korea — is the party’s first secretary. In Cuba, it’s Raul Castro. There are still no checks and balances on this all-powerful position; the Castro family continues to control every facet of Cuban life.

These and other so-called reforms are little more than a colorful new paint job on the same rusty old Communist architecture. The structure underneath is still a totalitarian state that bans political parties, imprisons and harasses dissenters, and denies the Cuban people’s most basic human rights.

Nothing will change

Tellingly, the constitution omitted any reference to the freedom of conscience. The regime actively tried to prevent Christians from speaking out or even participating in the referendum.

Then again, the referendum itself was a ploy by Havana to legitimize its rule and disarm foreign critics. It left pro-freedom Cubans in a lose-lose situation. They could either vote no in an election with a pre-ordained outcome or refuse to participate altogether, giving the regime a lopsided victory either way. The U.S. media is lauding the 9% who voted no — a historic high — but that number is highly suspect for a dictatorship that craved a democratic veneer. Havana could very well have pulled it out of a hat.

Meanwhile, for the Cuban people, nothing will change.

The regime will laud this new step in the revolution’s struggle, even as its subjects struggle to survive in a nation defined by poverty. Last week, I spoke with Rosa María Payá, a Cuban activist whose father Oswaldo Payá founded a movement opposed to the Communist Party. The regime assassinated him in 2012, and now his daughter tells me the new constitution only “guarantees the perpetuation of the dictatorship.”

Rosa María believes the Cuban people deserve a real referendum, which she advocates through an initiative known as Cuba Decide. Tens of thousands of her fellow citizens have joined her to call on Havana to hold a yes-or-no vote — not on a Communist constitution, but on the Communist Party itself.

The regime will never let such a vote happen because it fears nothing more than the Cuban people. Instead, it staged a rigged referendum to fool the world and fortify its rule. The new constitution is a charter of renewed tyranny, not liberty, and so long as the Communist Party reigns in Havana, Cuba will never be free.

The poster displayed in the capitol rotunda depicted newly elected Democratic congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota underneath the twin towers burning on Sept. 11th with the caption “’Never forget’ — You said… I am the proof you have forgotten.”

The poster sparked a furor in the capitol and “caused the resignation of at least one staff member and left another reportedly injured when things got physical as the altercation spilled into the chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates,” the Washington Post reports. “Photos of the poster showed it next to a placard promoting ACT for America, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated an anti-Muslim hate group.” ACT for America said on Twitter that they were not responsible for the display that led to the resignation of Sergeant at Arms Anne Lieberman, who Democratic legislators said called all Muslims “terrorists” during the chaotic aftermath.

No wonder why I am on the “Hitlist” of a domestic terrorist and “Assassinate Ilhan Omar” is written on my local gas stations.

By Susan Cornwell

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Freshman Democrats determined to walk a centrist path in the U.S. House of Representatives are testing party harmony between moderates and liberals, just as work on major issues including gun control and healthcare policy is getting underway.

Democrats took control of the House from President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans in January thanks in part to party moderates who won seats formerly held by Republicans in November's midterm elections.

But these centrists already have upset some Democratic elders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party's liberal wing by voting on occasion with the Republicans during their first couple of months in office. Republicans are in the minority in the House, but control the Senate.

Tensions flared this week after House Republicans managed to successfully amend a gun control bill with votes from 26 Democrats. Many of the Democrats who broke with the party line on Wednesday represent swing districts that had voted for Trump in 2016.

""How did Nancy Pelosi let this happen?"" Justice Democrats, a liberal political action committee that helped elect new Democratic star Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York in November, asked on Twitter after the vote.

The episode highlights the political tightrope being walked by several dozen freshman who helped to clinch the House majority for Democrats in November by expanding into Republican territory. There currently are 235 Democrats, 197 Republicans and three vacancies in the 435-seat House.

The centrists have not gotten as much attention as Ocasio-Cortez during their first months in office, and their differing positions from the party's liberals on policies such as government-run healthcare have at times put them at odds.

They also already have Republicans on their backs for the next election in 2020. Many of the 55 seats Republicans plan to target next year are held by freshman Democratic lawmakers who captured a previously Republican-held seat last year or prevailed in districts Trump won in 2016.

Representative Joe Cunningham, 36, did both when he won a South Carolina district in November that had not elected a Democrat to the House since before he was born. Cunningham defeated Republican rival Katie Arrington by less than 2 percentage points in a district Trump won by 13 percentage points in 2016.

On Wednesday, Cunningham was among the Democrats who supported the Republican amendment calling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency criticized by liberals like Ocasio-Cortez, to be notified when an illegal immigrant in caught trying to buy a gun.

Cunningham, a gun owner, said the next day he saw the amendment as minor. He added that it should not detract from the fact that the House had passed a gun control measure for the first time in two decades, calling for universal background checks on gun purchases.

In an interview on Tuesday, Cunningham was unapologetic for sometimes siding with Republicans. He has done it around a dozen times since January, mostly on procedural votes.

""I will be an independent check and not toe the party line whenever I disagree,"" Cunningham told Reuters. ""I'm not going to let the national party or the national message drive my message at home.""

Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, another Democratic freshman, said, ""I just do what I think is right,"" after straying from his party's line on a previous Democratic proposal banning funding for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall. Van Drew also supported the Republican gun amendment.

'JUST VOTE NO'

The House Democratic leadership was divided this week on members breaking with the party line. Pelosi told reporters on Thursday she did not approve, even on procedural votes.

""Just vote no, because the fact is, a vote yes is to give leverage to the other side,"" Pelosi said.

Other Democratic leaders took a more relaxed view.

""It's OK to vote your district,"" said Representative James Clyburn, a member of the House Democratic leadership who, like Cunningham, represents a South Carolina district.

""We have a very diverse caucus,"" Clyburn added. ""I wish people would not compare us to the Republicans, where everybody looks alike. We've got varied backgrounds and experiences that we have to take into account.""","Centrist Democrats stray on votes, roiling House majority party",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/centrist-democrats-stray-votes-roiling-house-majority-party-180216861.html

“There’s a consensus,” Biden told an excited crowd during an appearance at the University of Delaware. “The most important people in my life want me to run.”

Andreas Gebert / Reuters Former Vice President Joe Biden says his family wants him to run for president in 2020 but he hasn't made up his mind yet.

He did not explicitly say he was running. In fact, the 76-year-old lifelong politician conceded he may not be popular enough to win over the Democratic Party of 2020. Yet roughly 10 months before the first primary votes are cast, Biden sent an unmistakable message to prospective rivals and voters alike that the already-crowded Democratic field is far from set.

Should he run, he would instantly become a front-runner, the best-known option for primary voters and perhaps the best-respected by elected officials and donors, who in many cases have a decadeslong relationship with the longtime Democratic leader. Biden’s potential rivals had little to say publicly about his latest comments on potentially joining the field, but in private, their camps conceded that he would be a political force who could scramble the evolving field.

Biden could erode Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ popularity with working-class voters in the Midwest, California Sen. Kamala Harris’ standing with African-American voters in South Carolina and New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s claim to the political center.

“Uncle Joe is absolutely beloved within the Democratic Party and for good reason,” said Zac Petkanas, an aide to former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “However, this isn’t a popularity contest. Not only is he going to have to prove he’s got fresh, bold ideas, but that he’s tough enough to stand up to Trump.”

While he would be the oldest U.S. president ever elected, toughness has never been an issue for Biden, a native of working-class Pennsylvania, who suggested last year that he would “beat the hell” out of President Donald Trump for his comments about women if the two were in high school.

It is unclear, however, if Biden’s profile, politics and policies are in line with today’s liberal base, a relatively small slice of the electorate that holds outsized sway in presidential primary elections.

Biden would stand out as an old white man just months after Democratic voters sent the most diverse class to Congress in history. He would also be viewed as an establishment-minded moderate unwilling to wholly embrace litmus test issues like free universal health care, free college and the so-called Green New Deal.

“He is the biggest, best-known candidate in the race,” said veteran Democratic strategist Gary Pearce. “Personally, I have mixed feelings. For all the respect I have for him, I don’t know if he’s the right thing for the Democratic Party right now.”

Still, Trump allies have long considered Biden among the most formidable possible general election opponents given his working-class appeal. Despite more than four decades in Washington, most of it as a Delaware senator, he has long played up his upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Biden also has far more international experience than his would-be Democratic opponents — and the president. At a global security conference in Germany this month, he told an international audience that an American leader “stands up to the aggression of dictators.”

Yet he has struggled to develop a strong base of political support in two previous presidential runs.

Veteran Iowa Democratic strategist Brenda Kole noted that Biden has never run as a former vice president — particularly one so closely associated with popular former President Barack Obama.

“Ultimately, if he can make the case that he is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump, and I haven’t heard a convincing case yet from the vast field of candidates so far, he could break through,” Kole said.

With his family behind him, Biden said Tuesday he’s still determining whether he can mount a high-powered campaign to win the nomination and defeat Trump. He acknowledged that he’s not sure his “alleged appeal” is real.

“I don’t want this to be a fool’s errand,” he said, noting that his personal decision not to align his candidacy with a super PAC could create financial challenges.

Biden told The New York Times he’d launch his campaign after March if he decides to get in.

In the meantime, Biden allies are reaching out to campaign operatives in early-voting states including New Hampshire and South Carolina to gauge their willingness to join Biden’s team. On Tuesday, operatives in both states said chatter continues, though no formal job offers had been extended.

South Carolina Democrat James Smith, the party’s nominee for governor in 2018, said Tuesday that he’s compiled a list of possible hires for the former vice president.

“I believe he’s getting ready to say the word,” said Smith, who was endorsed by and campaigned with Biden last year.

In Iowa, Biden is the most recognized and preferred in early polls. Yet activists report a hunger for new faces, as evidenced by big crowds at recent events for Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Midwesterners such as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown are also making a play for Iowa voters, though Brown has yet to announce whether he’s running.",Joe Biden Says He’s ‘Close’ To Making Decision About 2020,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-2020-decision_n_5c760fd2e4b08c4f5555466b

What does the Alabamian writer Rick Bragg mean when he says in the introduction to your new book, Bending Toward Justice, that there are too many ghosts in Alabama?

There is often an undercurrent of racial tension in the state that people have a hard time getting over. And they really have a hard time talking about.

Just this month there was an editorial in an Alabama newspaper calling for the Klan to ride again. How can this be?

The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now

It’s like the ghost that appears in your worst nightmare. It comes to the front, and you realize that yes, we have gone very far, but we’ve got a ways to go. There are people in this state, and this country, that have feelings about race that are very, very strong.

Your book is about the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963, which resulted in the deaths of four girls, and your role in bringing some of the bombers to justice as a prosecutor. Why write a book about this now?

It’s important with cases like this to have a written history of how it all came together and how things have changed so people can look at it and understand it. Second, I think we are backsliding on civil rights and voting rights. We saw it in the courts with the Shelby County v. Holder decision [which struck down part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act], but we’re also seeing it in a broader sense.

A cynic might say that you’re publishing this book now to remind voters of your civil rights bona fides. Would you like to address that?

Well, yeah, I can see that. But this book has been in the works for a long time.

You won your Senate seat in a close special election against Roy Moore, a controversial figure facing sexual-assault allegations. Do the Republicans just have to nominate a normal person in 2020 to defeat you?

That underestimates the people of Alabama. It’s a fairly tribal state, but you’re basically saying to folks that they don’t think, and they’re not going to look at candidates. Anybody I run against is going to run so far to the right, they will essentially be a lapdog. There will be people who want that, but I just give the people a lot more credit.

Given that your time in public office may be short, why did you choose to make your first speech on the Senate floor about gun violence?

To bring attention to the fact that there are measures that we can do while we still respect the Second Amendment, with regard to background checks, the “boyfriend loophole” and reporting. I thought that message coming from a gun owner and an avid hunter might resonate more than the usual suspects’.

Do you think Donald Trump will be re-elected in 2020?

I think folks will underestimate him, simply because of the way he conducts himself. I do worry that there’s too many in the Democratic Party who think, “Oh, we can’t lose this.” Well, we can.

Do you have a favored candidate to beat him?

You’ve got to have a candidate that talks to the heartland of America. It’s no secret I think Joe Biden fits that bill better than anyone. We tried the chaos thing and I just don’t think it’s working. We’re looking for a transitional candidate, who respects the institutions of government, who believes they work for all people, not just himself.

Is it true, as your book’s intro claims, that you’re a terrible fisherman?

I love Rick Bragg, but he says some things that you just can’t rely on. There is an element of jealousy with him.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House put on a display of Democratic priorities this week with two bills to bolster background checks on firearms purchases, showing just how quickly the politics of gun control have turned.

Just a few years ago, says Kris Brown, the president of one of the nation's leading gun violence prevention groups, there was a ""sense of hopeless"" after a divided Congress tried — and failed — to change gun laws following the mass shooting of 20 young children and six adults at Newtown Elementary School in Connecticut.

But a new generation of teen leaders ""flipped"" public sentiment after the shooting last year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, she said, helping to elect lawmakers in 2018 who are willing to buck the powerful gun lobby, including the National Rifle Association.

""We're at a completely different time,"" said Brown, the president of the Brady, the group formerly known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The group changed its name this week on the 25th anniversary of implementing its landmark background check bill.

Parkland ""reignited something in people,"" she said in an interview after the House votes on Thursday. Democrats — and some Republicans — ""understand this is where American sentiment is going and what people want.""

On Thursday, the House approved legislation to allow a review period of up to 10 days for background checks on firearms purchases.

Democrats led passage, 228-198, with a handful of defections and scant Republican support. The bill stems from the 2015 shooting at Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina, where nine black worshippers died at the hands of a white supremacist. A faulty background check allowed the gunman's firearm purchase after the required three-day review period expired.

On Wednesday, the House approved a more ambitious measure — bipartisan legislation requiring federal background checks for all gun sales and transfers, including those sold online and at gun shows. A handful of Republicans crossed over to join Democrats. It's the most substantial gun violence prevention bill in more than a decade.

Not all Democrats helped in passing the bills, and some broke with their party to back a Republican counter-effort Thursday to maintain the three-day review period for victims of domestic violence seeking guns.

But the outcome showcased a turn of events as Democrats — and some Republicans —more fully support gun control measures they were hesitant to tackle even a few years ago.

The NRA acknowledges the challenges ahead. But the Second Amendment group also downplays the momentum of the gun control advocates, especially since the White House has threatened to veto the bills. The measures are likely to languish in the Republican-controlled Senate.

The NRA's Chris Cox said in a statement that the group ""will continue to fight to preserve the constitutionally protected right to self-defense.""

The NRA spent more money than ever to help elect Trump, who in 2017 became the first president in decades to speak at their annual convention. And while the group was outspent by gun-safety advocates in the 2018 midterm that ushered Democrats into power in the House, it says its deepest asset is the millions of Americans who are Second Amendment advocates.

""The strength of the NRA has always been with our grass roots,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Baker, ""and our tens of millions of members and supporters who consistently go to the polls and vote on this issue and actively engage with their elected officials.""

Polling, though, shows attitudes are shifting. A survey conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research last year found that nearly 7 in 10 adults favored stricter gun control measures. That was the strongest level of support since The Associated Press first asked the question five years ago.

Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona lawmaker who was severely wounded in a 2011 shooting and now runs a gun advocacy group bearing her name, said in a statement that the votes this week show ""how serious the new majority in the House of Representatives is about taking action to make our communities safer from gun violence.""

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to run for president.

Buffett made the comments on Monday morning in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box.

Both men are among the richest people in the world.

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to announce a 2020 presidential bid.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say, 'I'm for him,' and I think he would be a very good president,"" he said in an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick.

""He and I disagree on some things, but I think that he knows how to run things. I think that he's got the right goals for America, he understands people, he understands the market system, and he understands the problems of people that don't fit well into the market system.""

Buffett, who on Saturday released his annual letter to shareholders, told CNBC that he wasn't a Democrat through and through, though over the last three decades he's voted for more Democrats than Republicans.

""I'm not a card-carrying Democratic, but I never have been,"" Buffett said. ""I've voted for a fair number of Republicans, I've given money to Republicans.""

Both Buffett and Bloomberg are among the richest people in the world, according to Forbes. Buffett's net worth, as of Forbes' 2018 ranking, was $84 billion, while Bloomberg's was $50 billion.

While it's long been rumored that Bloomberg would run for the highest US office, he told the Associated Press in early February that he would decide by the end of this month if he would enter the race. He officially registered as a Democrat — again — last October.

Bloomberg has rejected the notion that he likely wouldn't enter the 2020 presidential race if Joe Biden, the former vice president, announced a bid.

""My decision doesn't depend on what other people are going to do,"" Bloomberg told the AP. ""My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference.""

In his interview with CNBC Buffett also voiced his displeasure about Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, announcing he would consider running for president in the upcoming election.

""If he ran as an independent, I think he would take votes away from any Democrat, including Bloomberg, if he were running, so I think it would be a real mistake for him to run,"" Buffett said. ""I think, generally, third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view.""

He added: ""I hope no third-party candidate runs that pulls any significant amount of votes. I mean, there will always be a couple of people that file, but I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

243,Empty,2019-02-25T13:35:03Z,Britain's parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.

With just 32 days until the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU, the options include a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit or no Brexit at all.

May is pursuing a renegotiated deal, but faces a growing threat that she will need to choose to delay Brexit or be forced to do so by British lawmakers.

Below is a summary of what is due to happen next:

“HIGH NOON”- FEB. 27

On Tuesday, May will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Wednesday to debate and vote on the way forward.

Several lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party, including some ministers, have indicated this will be the last chance they give her to find a way through the impasse.

Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Yvette Cooper plans to use that debate to seek lawmakers’ support for legislation that would force the government to decide between leaving without a deal or extending the Article 50 negotiation period if it has not had a deal approved by March 13.

VOTE ON A REVISED DEAL - BY MARCH 12

May has promised to bring back a revised deal to parliament and hold a vote on whether to approve it by March 12.

Before a vote on the exit agreement in January, which May lost heavily, parliament held five days of debate. It is not clear whether there would be another lengthy debate this time.

May is required by law to get parliamentary approval for any exit deal.

EU SUMMIT - MARCH 21-22

EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels. This could be an opportunity for an eleventh-hour deal or it would be the last chance to agree an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period and delay Brexit to avoid no-deal disruption. If the summit goes badly and there is still no deal in sight then May will have to decide whether to delay or go for a no-deal Brexit.

LAST WEEKEND - MARCH 23-24

If a deal is seen as viable at the summit, officials could work through the weekend to nail down the details with a final deal - and a possible extension to June 30 conditional on British parliamentary approval - announced on Sunday, March 24-Monday, March 25.

FINAL WEEK - MARCH 25-29

If a deal could be clinched, then the British parliament could vote on it, possibly on March 26. The European Parliament could ratify the deal that week.

EXIT DAY - MARCH 29?

If May does not get a deal approved by parliament by March 29, Britain faces a disorderly exit or may be forced to seek an extension of Article 50 to give more time to reach an agreement. It is not certain the EU would agree to this.

Some lawmakers, including opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have said it is now “inevitable” that the government will have to seek an extension, as there will not be enough time to pass the legislation for Britain’s exit before March 29.

The leader of Britain’s lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, has said the date might need to be pushed back by a couple of weeks.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS

The bloc will vote to elect a new European Parliament on May 23-26. The new chamber would sit from July 2, a date that is shaping up to be the EU’s limit for any extension of Article 50.

The EU says Britain would have to organize European Parliament elections on its soil if it were to delay Brexit beyond that as otherwise its people would be deprived of their democratic representation while still being in the EU. The bloc fears Britain would not do that.

Some in the EU also fear that, should Britain vote, it would elect a staunchly eurosceptic representation to the European Parliament that is already expected to have a larger contingent of EU critics influencing the bloc’s policies.

The main centre-right group, whose leaders include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could also lose its place as the biggest in the European Parliament; UK Labour seats could help the European Socialists overtake the People’s Party, from which British Conservatives broke away to sit separately.

DELAYED BREXIT - JUNE 30 OR LATER

If a Brexit extension is sought, one date being talked about in Brussels is June 30, the Sunday before the new European Parliament sits at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on July 2. Some argue for an exit before May 23, the day Britain would otherwise be due to hold an EU election.",Factbox: Through the Brexit Looking Glass - What happens next?,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-whatnext-factbox-idUSKCN1QE1P3

Politicians love introducing tax-cuts, because they're reliable vote-getters, even if they're structured to blow up later by giving massive breaks to the super-rich and more modest breaks to middle-class voters, resulting in mounting deficits and eventual service cuts.

But Trump has managed the impossible: he signed trillions of dollars of tax-cuts into law and lost in the polls as a result.

Trump managed this feat by handing middle-class and poor people tax bills instead of refunds, while cutting in a tiny number of super-rich people for unbelievably large breaks (and the 99% will get stiffed even harder in 2027, when their taxes go up again).

Bill Black proposes a tantalizing thought-experiment: what if Trump had spread the tax breaks around, giving, say, $5,000 to every household with a combined income of less than $75,000? What if he tailored the breaks to his base, farmers, old people, blue-collar workers (while stiffing poor people)?

Not only would this have stimulated the everloving fuck out of the US economy -- wage stagnation and austerity has left the US with tons of underutilized labor and plant that could churn out tons of goods for these people to buy without any inflation to speak of -- but the Democratic leadership would have hated it, because Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the ""paygo"" crowd are crazy deficit hawks who don't want any unfunded liabilities in federal budgets.

The result would have been a huge PR win for Trump and a massive PR hit for the Democratic establishment. It might have even cost Pelosi the speakership, leaving Trump with a less canny adversary over the next two years.

More importantly, it would have given Trump -- who is much broker than he lets on, and dependent on shady lenders for his funding because no real bank will touch him after all those bankruptcies -- a solid base of his own, separate from the plutocrats who benefited from the tax breaks.

The last sentence understates the scale of political benefits that would have come to Trump had he fulfilled his campaign promise to slash middle-class taxes. It leaves out how much the so-called Democratic centrists’ opposition to such a tax cut would have added to Trump’s popularity while reducing support for Democrats in the 2018 congressional elections. The ‘New Democrats’ and the House Democratic leadership are fervent supporters of “paygo” limitations on budget expenditures. They are far to the right of Republican members of Congress on this issue. More precisely, Republican members of Congress overwhelmingly pretend to care about budget deficits and federal debt only when the President is a Democrat. ‘New Democrats,’ ‘Blue Dog’ Democrats, and Democrats who join “Problem Solvers” and other groups religiously oppose deficits even when increasing the deficit is the best economic action. The result of the ‘centrist’ Democrats’ war against even desirable deficits is that they would have fought and died to oppose a real middle-class Trump tax cut. They would have predicted that it would produce a disaster. Their predictions about the grave and imminent peril of increasing the deficit, as always, would have proven false. Trump would have emerged with his own popularity greatly expanded and enhanced as his greatest rival’s popularity greatly diminished. The Republicans would have held the House, and possibly expanded their majority there and added to their Senate majority. Trump would have demonstrated that he was the expert on the economy, taxes, and the deficit. Pelosi would have demonstrated her recurrent failure to understand the economy, taxes, and the deficit. She would likely have been defeated in 2018 in the Democratic vote for minority leader. Pelosi is a skilled legislative leader, with terrible, closely related, blindspots on deficits and the urgency of dealing with climate change. She acts as if we cannot afford to save the planet by acting decisively against global climate change now. That view is horrific economics and public policy. Similarly, she would have been at her worst in arguing that Trump was endangering the Nation by creating a real trillion-dollar middle-class tax cut. She would have been the face of the Democratic Party in the 2018 elections – the woman and her Party that tried to keep your middle-class family from receiving a $5,000 tax cut. When the economy reacted positively to the resultant stimulus, her humiliation, and that of her Party, would have been complete. Given what Trump knows now about Pelosi’s skill in legislative infighting he should be able to weigh the “opportunity cost” of not using a real middle-class tax cut to maintain control of the House and to discredit and ultimately cause the Democrats to remove Pelosi from leadership. Trump’s cowardly and corrupt surrender to his puppet masters on the tax cut and infrastructure allowed the Democrats to gain control of the House. That made it possible for Pelosi to become Speaker again and to rain down the blows on Trump that have made his life miserable.

In a congressional testimony before the US House of Representatives committee, Cohen accused Trump of being “a racist”, “a conman” and “a cheat”.

The testimony is part of an investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is looking into ties between Trump’s campaign officials and Russia. It is also looking into other ways Russia may have influenced the 2016 presidential polls. Russia is also accused of attempting to meddle in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for multiple offences, including lying to the US Congress and for facilitating bribes to two women who allegedly had affairs with Trump. In August 2018, Cohen had pleaded guilty in a New York court to eight counts of tax crimes, making illegal campaign contributions and admitted that he made pre-election payments.

Cohen claimed that Trump’s longtime political advisor Roger Stone in July 2016 had told him that he had been speaking to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and that there would be “massive dump” of emails that would affect Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton’s, presidential campaign.

He also claimed that Trump wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow amid his presidential campaign for 2016 elections. “At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing,” Cohen said. “In his way, he was telling me to lie.”

Cohen claimed that Trump had also asked him to pay off an adult film star, Stephanie Clifford, with whom Trump had had an affair, Reuters reported. Cohen submitted a copy of $130,000 wire transfer made during the closing days of the presidential campaign to Clifford, whose screen name is Stormy Daniels.

Cohen said while Trump has publicly courted white supremacists and bigots, “in private, he is even worse”. “He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole’,” he told the committee, according to BBC. “This was when Barack Obama was president of the United States.”

He claimed Trump had also said that black people would never vote for him “because they were too stupid”. Since becoming the president, Trump has become the worst version of himself, Cohen said, adding that Trump is “fundamentally disloyal”.

“Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,” Cohen said. “He had no desire or intention to lead this nation – only to market himself and to build his wealth and power.”

Meanwhile, the US president, who is currently in Vietnam to attend a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, hit back at Cohen saying the lawyer was “lying in order to reduce his prison time”.","'Trump is racist, a conman and a cheat,' says his former lawyer in US congressional testimony - Scroll.in",Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/latest/914855/us-trump-is-racist-a-conman-and-a-cheat-says-his-former-lawyer-in-us-congressional-testimony

Given the serious risks of rising global temperatures, Inslee…","Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee jumped into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary Friday with a promise to put climate change front and center in both his campaign and his potential presidency.

Given the serious risks of rising global temperatures, Inslee told TIME in an interview ahead of his announcement that climate change cannot be one item “on a list of things to do.” He pledged to coordinate an unprecedented effort to tackle the issue.

“Beating climate change has to be the first priority of the United States,” he said. “It has to be the paramount duty. It has to be the organizing principle of the next administration throughout all its agencies.”

The two-term governor, who previously served seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, enters a crowded field of candidates, many of whom have better name recognition and more buzz, and he hasn’t featured prominently in Democratic primary polling to date.

But Inslee is betting that voters in early states will be drawn to his record and message on climate change. Inslee pointed to a poll from the Center for American Progress, a progressive group, showing that tackling climate change is a key concern for primary voters in five early voting states, an issue equalled only by universal health care.

To be sure, Democrat candidates all have noted the importance of tackling climate change, but so far none have put it as front and center as Inslee promises to do. Most candidates have endorsed a resolution from the progressive wing of the party calling for a Green New Deal that would seek to supply all of the country’s power by zero-emissions sources by 2030, although some do not necessarily endorse all elements of the plan.

And the topic comes up frequently in speeches and campaign messaging, often as a way of hitting President Donald Trump, who announced in 2017 that the U.S. will leave the Paris Agreement on climate change and previously called climate change a hoax.

Still, none of the other candidates in the field have signaled that climate change will be the centerpiece of their campaign the way that Inslee plans. Inslee will host a series of climate change-related events in Iowa next week before heading to Nevada and California.

Inslee referred to his record on a range of policies from the state’s clean energy standard to a program for electrifying the transportation sector and touted his leadership of an alliance for cities and states to commit to the Paris Agreement. And more than a decade before the Green New Deal entered the national lexicon, Inslee authored a 2007 book calling for a massive spike in government funding for research and development and investment in clean energy that would create so-called green jobs.

While endorsing a Green New Deal has emerged as a litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates hoping to win the support of the party’s progressive wing, some say ranking climate change as the top issue may prove more important down the road.

Scientists say meaningful action on global warming cannot wait — whatever solution a future president may choose to pursue, and an incoming president typically faces a narrow window to burn political capital and enact sweeping new legislation. Trump enacted a tax cut early in his administration, but has struggled to notch legislative victories since then. President Barack Obama chose to put his energy behind the Affordable Care Act early in his presidency rather than his party’s major climate change bill, which passed the House but never received a vote in the Senate.

“You have to be willing to spend your political capital on it,” says Inslee. “I would be willing to do that, and that is the only way this is going to get done.”

Inslee declined to lay out the specific planks of a policy platform, but he said he was looking at a combination of direct investment to stimulate clean technologies and regulations to mandate emissions reductions. Carbon pricing mechanisms should not be taken off the table but are not part of his current thinking, he said, adding that his current work in Washington state will accomplish the same emissions reduction goals as the carbon tax that failed to pass a statewide ballot initiative last year would have.

“Our environmental laws have been extremely successful when we’ve applied them,” he says. “We just haven’t applied them to the most dangerous pollutant at the moment, which is carbon dioxide and methane.”

247,Empty,2019-02-25T14:32:08Z,Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC Monday that he would support New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for president.,"Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he would support fellow billionaire and former three-term New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for president.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say I'm for him,"" Buffett told Becky Quick in a ""Squawk Box"" Interview from Omaha, Nebraska. ""I think he would be a very good president.""

Buffett said he's never been a card-carrying Democrat, pointing out that he's voted for Democratic candidates and Republican candidates over the years. He said neither party has an edge on virtue.

Without elaborating, Buffett said he and Bloomberg disagree on some things.

However, he added, ""I think that he knows how to run things. I think he's got the right goals for America. He understands people. He understands the market system. And he understands the problems of people"" not in the market.

Bloomberg, 77, is seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Bloomberg ran as an independent during his last successful campaign, when was re-elected mayor for a third term in 2009. He was a Republican in his first two terms. Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from independent to Democrat in October.

In a recent email to CNBC, top Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson hinted at how much his boss would look to invest into his own potential campaign.

""Mike spent more than $100 million in his last mayor's race. Last time I looked, NYC is a fraction of the size of the country as a whole,"" Wolfson said.

For years, Bloomberg had flirted with an independent run for president. But he now believes it would be a mistake. In a January statement, after former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz floated a possible third-party run, Bloomberg said, ""In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That's a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford to run it now.""

In Monday's interview, Buffett said he agrees with Bloomberg that a Schultz third-party would take votes away from any Democrat.

Making no evaluation of Schultz as a potential candidate, Buffett added, ""I think generally [that] third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view, and so they pull more people away that would otherwise go with the second-best with that view.""

""So I hope no third-party candidate runs,"" he added. ""I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

Buffett was interviewed from the floor of the Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart, following Saturday's release of his widely read annual shareholder letter.

Correction: This story was revised to correct when Bloomberg registered as a Democrat. It was last year.

248,Empty,2019-03-01T16:54:00Z,Washington State Governor Jay Inslee’s campaign will tell a lot about Democratic views on climate change—and about the future of single-issue candidates.,"Updated on March 28 at 12:33 p.m. ET

There’s a new candidate in the Democratic race, though you might be forgiven for thinking she was already running.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York officially launched her campaign on March 17, but unlike some other candidates—former Representative Beto O’Rourke, for example—she seemed certain to get into the race for months. In fact, her January announcement of an exploratory committee was a de facto launch, complete with the requisite campaign video and Rachel Maddow appearance.

But the chance to formally launch is probably good news for Gillibrand. While she has the résumé of a blue-chip candidate, she has struggled to gain much purchase thus far. Though it’s still very early in the primary race, her trajectory seems to illuminate the challenges of the crowded field. Among a range of splashy Democratic candidates, it’s just hard to get much attention.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Gillibrand has spent years working up to a run. She’s transformed a fairly conservative voting record—rooted in the upstate–New York district she used to represent in the House—into one that’s more liberal and fits today’s party. She’s become a champion of sexual-assault protections and gun control. She comes from a powerful, populous Democratic state with strong fundraising capacity. She’s also not a white man, the demographic that was expected to struggle in the current Democratic Party landscape.

So far, that hasn’t translated to much prowess in attracting voters. RealClearPolitics’ poll aggregator has her at the back of the pack, with 0.5 percent—even with Washington Governor Jay Inslee and behind former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. The margins at that end of the polls are small, but the problem is that she’s at that end of the polls. She has struggled to attract Empire State endorsers. Gillibrand also incurred some donor wrath for calling on Senator Al Franken to resign over sexual-harassment accusations, and for criticizing former President Bill Clinton. Yet Politico reported this month that Gillibrand was slow to handle accusations of sexual harassment in her own office.

Mostly, she seems squeezed out of the way. Gillibrand is not a fringe candidate, nor is she a one-issue campaigner like Inslee, who’s focused on climate change. But there are other Democrats in the race from blue-collar areas, other Democrats who espouse similar positions, other Democrats who fit her demographic profile. The official launch provides a mulligan for Gillibrand, and a fresh shot at grabbing attention. But her slow start is a sign that even traditionally strong candidates have a tough task ahead of them in this Democratic primary.

There are nearly 30 announced or possible Democratic candidates. On the Republican side, former Massachusetts Governor William Weld is considering a challenge to President Donald Trump, and other GOP candidates might run. There will be independent candidates and third-party contenders as well.

As the presidential primaries progress, this cheat sheet will be updated regularly.

The Democrats

KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND

Who is she?

Gillibrand has been a senator from New York since 2009, replacing Hillary Clinton. Before that, she served in the U.S. House.

Is she running?

Yes. She launched her campaign officially on March 17.

Why does she want to run?

Gillibrand has emphasized women’s issues, ranging from sexual harassment in the military and more recent #MeToo stories to equal pay, and her role as a mom is central in her announcement video. Once a fairly conservative Democrat, she has moved left in recent years.

Who wants her to run?

Gillibrand could have fairly broad appeal among mainstream Democratic voters, and she hopes that her time representing upstate New York gives her an advantage with nonurban voters. She has, however, earned the enmity of the Clinton world for her criticisms of Bill.

Can she win the nomination?

Perhaps. Her campaign hasn’t managed to gain much traction thus far.

Bernie Sanders on Saturday returned to Brooklyn, his birthplace, for the first rally of his second presidential campaign and sought to tie his working-class background to his populist views that are helping reshape the Democratic Party.

He predicted he would win the nomination in a field of now-double digit rivals and then defeat President Donald Trump, “the most dangerous president in modern American history.”

After falling short in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, the Vermont independent told supporters at a rally at Brooklyn College, which he once attended, that his campaign is saying “loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, hatred and lies. It will not be racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia and religious bigotry. That is going to end.”

Sanders pledged to fight for “economic justice, social justice, racial justice and environmental justice.”

He had begun his 2016 campaign in Vermont, which he has represented in the Senate for nearly two decades. But this time, as he tries to showcase more of his personal story, Sanders kicked off his 2020 bid in the New York City borough where he grew up as the son of a Jewish immigrant and lived in a rent-controlled apartment.

Campaign priorities include “Medicare for all,” a $15-an-hour minimum wage and addressing climate change. And Sanders is focusing on his working-class roots and how his family’s financial struggles have shaped his views. In those reflections is an implicit contrast to another New Yorker, Trump, a billionaire who hails from Queens.

After Brooklyn, Sanders planned to travel to Selma, Alabama, where he will be among the politicians commemorating the anniversary of the 1965 clash known as “Bloody Sunday,” when peaceful demonstrators were beaten back by Alabama state troopers as they attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. A second campaign rally this weekend was set for Chicago, where he attended the University of Chicago and was involved in civil rights protests.

Sanders had previously frustrated some aides and supporters with his reticence to share more of his personal story.

Sanders joins the 2020 race not as an outlier but as one of the best-known candidates in an large and expanding field. He also has a strong base of small-dollar donors: In the first week of his campaign, Sanders raised $10 million, far outpacing his rivals.

The political moment that he faces in his second bid, however, is far different than when he ran four years ago. A number of the liberal positions that Sanders has championed, in some cases for years, have been backed by other Democrats in the field, notably Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is campaigning with similar populist notes.

The details—whether there is an income cap for eligibility; whether the government covers tuition costs up front before grants; whether there are merit or GPA requirements—will determine who will benefit the most, and who will pay for such a plan.

A subtle tweak from Kamala Harris this past January encapsulates the coming debate over the scope of the party’s proposals. The senator from California, while making formal what many had suspected—that she would be running for president—tweaked her language in a slight but potentially significant way. She was supporting free college, but not just any free college: She was pushing for debt-free college. “I am running to declare education is a fundamental right,” she said, “and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college.”

What was the difference? Free college is a catchall term for a range of college-affordability plans. There are “tuition-free” programs, where the government—or an institution—covers tuition but not the other expenses, such as books, housing, or food; then there are debt-free college plans, which aim to address all those other costs. Harris was getting specific; and she was doing so with the kind of free-college idea—debt-free—that equity advocates tend to prefer.

Oftentimes, tuition-free models are “last dollar,” which means that the government covers tuition after all other grant aid—such as Pell Grants, which are federal grants for low-income students—is applied. Oftentimes those grants cover the full tuition at community colleges, and students aren’t able to use that money for things like books, housing, or food. These are things that they may ultimately have to take on debt to afford. “Progressive candidates need to be talking about debt-free college instead of just free college, and going beyond tuition for low-income students,” Tiffany Jones, the director of higher-education policy at the Education Trust, an advocacy group for low-income students, told me.

Harris’s declaration was a departure from her language in 2016, when she first introduced a plan, toward the end of her Senate campaign, to make community college tuition-free for all, and four-year college tuition-free for families making less than $140,000 a year; it was even a departure from weeks prior, when she pushed for tuition-free college. Her development signaled, perhaps above all, how the Democratic Party has evolved on college affordability.

Read: Why is college in America so expensive?

The United States has a long history of college-access and -affordability policies—the first Morrill Act, the GI Bill, etc.—that did not provide equitable access or universal affordability, particularly for minorities.

The 76-year-old former military ruler took 56 percent of votes against 41 for his closest challenger, businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party.

Atiku, 72, said he would go to court to contest the results due to a litany of “premeditated malpractices”.

Buhari has a daunting to-do list, from reviving an economy still struggling to recover from a 2016 recession to quelling a decade-old Islamist insurgency in the northeast.

Some 327 people died in election-related violence since the campaign began in October, 67 of them during or after Saturday’s vote, according to the Situation Room monitoring group and security sources.

The violence included insurgents’ attacks to disrupt voting, and clashes between gangs and security forces around poll centres.

Buhari, of the All Progressive Congress party, said he would reform the economy, combat graft and improve security, and urged supporters not to gloat or “humiliate” the opposition.

“We will continue to engage all parties. Our government will remain inclusive and our doors will remain open,” he said while receiving his election certificate.

Atiku rejected the outcome, saying one obvious red flag was that states in the northeast ravaged by insurgents’ attacks generated much higher voter turnouts than peaceful states.

“It is clear that there were manifest and premeditated malpractices in many states which negate the results announced,” he said.

That presaged a legal battle in a terrain where Nigeria’s most senior judge was controversially suspended by Buhari last month after allegations he breached asset declaration rules.

The move brought criticism that the government was meddling with judicial independence.

OVERTURNING RESULTS “VERY UNLIKELY”

The opposition’s fraud accusations have heightened tensions in the region’s most populous nation and biggest oil producer where six decades of independence have seen long periods of military rule, coups and secessionist wars.

But the controversy could also just peter out, as happened recently after a presidential vote in Democratic Republic of Congo. “A legal challenge is very unlikely to overturn the official result,” said John Ashbourne, economist at Capital Economics in London, of the Nigerian election.

The president garnered 15.2 million votes to Atiku’s 11.3 million, on turnout of just 35.6 percent, the electoral commission said.

The vote was delayed by a week after the commission was unable to get ballots and results sheets to all areas.

U.S. observers said that probably reduced turnout.

Buhari campaigned on pledges to fight corruption and overhaul Nigeria’s creaking road and rail network.

Analysts said he may find it easier to pass policies after Bukola Saraki, the former Senate president, lost his senatorial seat in local elections also held on Saturday.

Saraki nominally controlled parliament under the ruling party banner, but bitter disputes with the presidency saw the lawmaker often working to frustrate bills and budgets proposed by Buhari. He decamped to the opposition last year.

“Buhari is likely to get a friendlier Senate president, which could mean more efficient executive-legislative coordination,” said Amaka Anku, Africa director at Eurasia Group.

Buhari also has to deal with the threat from militants in the oil-rich southern Niger Delta region. The Niger Delta Avengers, whose attacks in 2016 pushed the economy into its first recession in 25 years, want their area to get a greater share of oil revenue it produces and had backed Atiku.

The Avengers had warned on Feb. 14 that they would cripple the economy if Buhari was re-elected. The group has not carried out any substantial attacks since January 2017.

“We would have to see if the Avengers will act on their threat. However, these militants are up for sale, so as long as they are granted their privileges they may not be a problem,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, West Africa analyst at Teneo.","Buhari re-elected as Nigerian president, Atiku vows legal challenge",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-election-idUSKCN1QG11U

It’s home not just to the wave of IT offshoring firms of the 1990s and early 2000s, but also to some of the most interesting unicorn tech startups in the world, including Freshworks, Paytm, Oyo and of course Flipkart, which sold to Walmart last year for $16 billion.

India though is also at something of an economic crossroads. Unlike China, which as we discussed yesterday faces a conflict between open entrepreneurship and strict party control in its next stage of development, India must build up its indigenous startups while also opening up to the global economy.

That economic balancing act will be tough. As James Crabtree, a long-time writer of the Financial Times based in Mumbai, argues in his book The Billionaire Raj, India faces a triple threat of “inequality and the new super-rich, crony capitalism, and the travails of the industrial economy” as it seeks to move the country into middle-income status.

You’re reading the Extra Crunch Daily. Like this newsletter? Subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates.

Crabtree, who built up access among India’s traditional business elite over many years, sees a nation that is starving for more government capacity. India has transitioned in a few short decades from a moribund economy languishing under a sclerotic and byzantine bureaucratic model (sometimes referred to as the “license raj”) into an increasingly open and competitive market for goods and services.

Yet, success outside of a scant few industries — namely IT services — has been undergirded by political access and the trading of favors. Crabtree chronicles a whole crop of entrepreneurs from across the country in industries as far afield as mining to liquor to aircraft to show the constant intermixing of Indian business and Indian politics.

That crony capitalism is at the heart of what he dubs today’s “billionaire raj” — a government that isn’t for the ultra-rich so much as it lacks any capacity whatsoever to stand up to its worst excesses and corruption. The book is one part travelogue, one part analysis, and one part biographical bookshelf that together paint a complicated portrait of India’s growth ambitions and challenges to scale.

Given where India’s fortunes have been made the past few decades, the book mostly ignores the tech industry, save for fleeting mentions scattered about. But I asked Crabtree in an interview last week where he saw the country headed, and how technology might underpin that.

“People thought that India was going to become the next hot market for Silicon Valley tech money after China, but it doesn’t look like that will be the case,” he explained. Unlike China, which created friction in market entry for foreign tech companies, India has been reasonably open. “The biggest search engine in India is Google, the biggest social network is Facebook,” he noted. “They don’t make much money in India, but they have spectacular user growth.”

“When I lived in Mumbai, there was a big tech investment wave in the after wave of the Alibaba IPO,” he explained. “There were these great hopes that India would follow the sort of hockey stick growth” seen in China. Yet, the country’s demographics don’t back that up. “India has a tiny middle class — 10-20 million” using a reasonable definition of the term “middle class.” That group is simply not large enough to support the valuation dreams underpinning some of India’s most-discussed unicorns. “Growing users is really easy, but growing revenues is just much more challenging,” he said.

The challenge ahead for India is that a form of economic nationalism is increasingly popular in Delhi. We have covered a bit of this change around data localization / sovereignty, but it is certainly much wider than those policies. “I think there is a slow but steady trend toward closure that is partly to do with India’s domestic politics” and partly due to international climate, Crabtree explained. The thinking is that, “China has produced Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu [… but] India hasn’t produced any major global stars yet.”

Fueling that rift is a sense that foreign tech giants “don’t pay much in the way of tax, they are not Indian companies” and that they “haven’t behaved particularly well.” Crabtree was referring specifically to Facebook’s Free Basics program, which became deeply controversial in the country, although those feelings are not limited to just Facebook.

India has a massive election coming up in just a few weeks, which will decide whether current Indian prime minister Narendra Modi stays in power. Beyond just policy, Crabtree sees a major challenge for all foreign tech companies, but particularly those operating social networks. “The stakes are very high for how social media manages the stresses and strains of a competitive and potentially nasty Indian political campaign,” he said. “If they are blamed for something that went wrong… this would be immensely damaging.”

India has the potential to be the single largest democratic free market economy in the world. But it needs to simultaneously cut down on its corruption, create jobs for millions of new entrants to the labor economy every year, stand up a new generation of digital-first behemoths, all the while balancing the needs of an incredibly diverse and cacophonous democracy buffeted by global markets and tastes. That’s ultimately a tall order, but if India wants to migrate from a “billionaire raj” to an “entrepreneur raj,” it will have to do all of that — at once.

In a prime example of the connection between immigration policy and technology leadership — the FT put out a deep-dive analysis on the rapidly growing Toronto tech and startup scene, with much of the expansion attributable to Canada’s talent-friendly immigration policies.

Canada applies the “give grads a visa with their diploma” approach many have preached for in the US, providing multi-year work visas to foreign students upon graduation. And while the US continues to make the individual application process more difficult, Canada has streamlined its process. Applications for highly-skilled workers, as well as their families, are processed within just a couple weeks.

While there are clearly several intertwined factors behind the growth of Toronto as a tech hub, talent is certainly one of them, with the city having added nearly 100,000 jobs in a five-year period. Toronto offers a case-in-point precedent of how cities can use immigration to gain a technological edge, and why the United States’ misdirected crackdown is undermining its own.

Intel cancels agreement with China chipmaker in fight for next generation chip dominance

Written by Arman Tabatabai

Intel continues to shift its strategy as it tries to improve its position for next-generation chip leadership. At the MWC conference in Barcelona, Intel announced that it was terminating a multi-year partnership with one of China’s premier state-backed mobile chipmakers, Unisoc. As part of the original agreement announced roughly a year ago‚ Intel would share its new 5G modem chips with Unisoc to help Intel increase its lagging market share in China, while providing Unisoc technological know-how needed for it to compete with more-advanced competitor offerings.

Like many breakups, the two sides are saying the decision was mutual and not a result of the political tension between the US and Chinese governments. However, the Nikkei Asian Review reports that insiders say the US’ recent harsh tone with Chinese tech and semiconductor companies definitely played a role in the decision.

As we discussed yesterday, Intel has a lot of catching up to do after years of complacency and will now have to find a different avenue to make up ground in the Chinese market. Unisoc is also certainly feeling the pain of the lost knowledge transfer, as market share can disappear quickly in a highly competitive industry where IP is often the secret sauce. The cancellation of what seemed to be a mutually beneficial deal reinforces the fact that the fight for next-generation semiconductor dominance is just as much political as it is financial, if not more so.

Facebook’s censors are struggling at work

Casey Newton at The Verge offered us a deep-dive into the horrific working conditions and post-traumatic stress of working as a censor for Facebook and its contractors. While artificial intelligence and advances around computer vision may allow more of this to be automated in the future, Newton brings up a key question: what are we doing right now to help the working-class workers who keep social networks safe for users?

Could corporate VC unlock the Japanese startup market?

Pavel Alpeyev at Bloomberg has a deep-dive highlighting the rapid expansion of Japanese corporate venture capital. The trend is permeating the country’s largest companies across all industries, with the number of Japanese corporate venture arms increasing by more than 8x since 2015. The Japanese market has traditionally been viewed as an unfriendly environment for startups, but the growing availability of capital and support from Japan’s all-powerful incumbent corporations makes building a company seem more feasible. ~ Written by Arman Tabatabai

Mobile usage gender gap reinforces the social obligation for big tech

Leading mobile companies from around the world have been aggressively competing for ownership of emerging market populations. In a recent analysis, Yomi Kazeem at Quartz Africa highlighted the tremendous gender gap that exists in emerging market mobile usage — with female use up to 30% lower in some cases — which represents a significant untapped user base that Quartz estimates could generate $140 billion in revenue over the next five years.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces has slowed down its offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw at least 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist bastion.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped inside less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, said thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali told AFP.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes Monday's arrivals would be the last.

""We want it to be over,"" one of them, 29-year-old Mazloum, told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Potent threat' -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar said the SDF would announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Iraq's President Barham Saleh warned Monday the jihadist threat remains high, despite gains made against IS over the past year.

""We've seen in the past that the mission is yet to be accomplished,"" Saleh said in a Paris speech, evoking the infamous 2003 Iraq claim by former US president George W. Bush.

""You have many, many extremists in many pockets in Syria, causing a potent threat to Syria, Iraq and the Western world,"" he said.

- Secret transfers -

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" said Omar, describing Al-Hol as overwhelmed by the arrivals.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, according to the International Rescue Committee.

The Observatory on Monday said 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq during the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

The Iraqi president said Monday his country's courts would prosecute 13 suspected French jihadists, who were turned over to Iraq after being captured by the SDF.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-162952545.html
255,Empty,2019-02-26T15:03:38Z,The New York City mayor addressed 40 people at a union hall—and stepped on Bernie Sanders’s toes.,"This time around, it’s Bernie Sanders he’s rebuffing. In 2018, he asked Sanders to administer the oath of office for his second term and repeatedly gushed about him, and even attended a gathering of the Sanders Institute last November in Burlington, Vermont. His response to Sanders announcing his second run last week: scrambling a trip of his own to Sioux City and Des Moines.

Read: The equalizer—Bill de Blasio vs. inequality

De Blasio could have been prepping to introduce Sanders as a favorite son in Brooklyn on Saturday for what will be the kickoff rally of the second campaign, not far from where the senator grew up and near the neighborhood the mayor used to represent on the city council. The senator’s campaign probably would have been open to that and to the buzz it would have produced about the strength of his 2020 campaign. Or he could be looking to horse-trade his endorsement with one of the many other candidates seeking to prove their own progressive credentials, and build up his power that way.

Instead, de Blasio ducked behind the doorway, just out of sight, until he could make his entrance in the union hall where those 40 people had come to see him on Sunday afternoon. He’d spent the morning doing a photo-op meeting with Tom Vilsack, the former governor and part-time Democratic gatekeeper and elder statesman, and another with Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie, who later pointed out that New York City is bigger than 41 states and that the mayor comes with an “everyday perspective” of how government affects people’s lives.

Reihan Salam: Bill de Blasio and Gavin Newsom may give restrictionism new life

He waited for his big introduction, piping up “I’m ready!” at one point, and then walked in from the back of the room.

“It’s a very personal reality,” de Blasio explained to reporters about his decision to come to Iowa on Saturday. He didn’t have a timetable for deciding whether he would run, he added on Sunday. He has to talk to his family.

He urged the people who came to the event hosted by the Asian & Latino PAC to invest in wind power (there are turbines all over the state), told them to stop talking about Donald Trump (most Democrats running haven’t been mentioning the president much at all), and recommended that Democrats reach out to farmers (other Democratic presidential hopefuls have been doing events at farms).

It was a New Yorker’s view of what’s happening in Iowa and the rest of the country, and his insistent sense that he knows what to do about it from the people he’s talking to more than a thousand miles away.

He drew the biggest applause when he said Democrats need to get smarter about being bolder, for the sake of their politics and their values. Tax the rich, he said. Don’t let Republicans make Democrats out as the party of the elites.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari won a second term to lead the most populous country in Africa, the country's elections authority said Wednesday, while his main opponent promised to challenge the result in court.

Buhari defeated Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and businessman, by about 4 million votes.

Turnout was nearly 35 percent of Nigeria's 82 million registered voters, the electoral commission said.

""I thank the millions of Nigerians who voted to re-elect me as your president for the next four years,"" Buhari said in a statement. ""I am deeply humbled and profoundly grateful to you for judging me worthy of continuing to serve you and for your peaceful conduct.""

Just hours before it was set to begin on Feb. 16, the electoral authority delayed the vote by a week, citing logistical challenges. Turnout likely fell after many Nigerians took lengthy bus rides across the country to vote in their hometowns, but could not afford to return the following weekend.

On Wednesday, Abubakar called the election result a ""sham"" and said he would challenge it in court. He accused soldiers in some Nigerian states of turning ""their guns on the very citizens they were meant to protect."" He also said it was a ""statistical impossibility"" that there was higher voter turnout in areas ""ravaged by the war"" against terrorist groups, like Boko Haram, and there were voting disruptions in his party's strongholds.

Abubakar's party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), called for fresh elections in four states.

""I think it's very unlikely that the election may be repeated, but it depends on the courts,"" political analyst and editor-in-chief Mannir Dan-Ali of Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper told NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton. ""But it's sometimes long drawn, it can take quite a while before the whole challenge is seen through.""

At least 53 people have died in election-related violence, according to a report by SBM Intelligence and cited by The Associated Press. Buhari said the ""elections were relatively peaceful,"" but that ""troublemakers in a handful of states attempted to disrupt an otherwise orderly process"" and he was ""very sad at the grievous loss of lives.""

In his victory statement, Buhari said his priorities for his next term would be to intensify efforts to bolster Nigeria's security, restructure the economy from its dependence on oil and fight corruption.

With a population of more than 200 million, Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and largest economy, but it remains heavily dependent on oil revenues. ""The country is still emerging from a recession and needs to jump-start the economy,"" Quist-Arcton reports from Abuja.

Buhari, 76, was first elected in 2015 on an anti-corruption platform. He previously ruled the country as a military strongman in the 1980s before re-emerging in politics, saying he embraced democratic values.

Despite Buhari's attention to corruption, Nigeria continued to rank high in perceptions of corruption in the last few years, according tracking group Transparency International's 2018 index. The group said Buhari ""took a number of positive steps in the past three years,"" but ""these efforts have clearly not yielded the desired results. At least, not yet.""

The other pressing issue for Buhari to address is the ongoing violence in the country's northeast connected to the Boko Haram insurgency and conflicts between herders and farmers in central Nigeria. Twenty-nine bodies have been recovered after the latest fighting between herders and farmers on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, while a group claiming affiliation with Islamic State said it attacked a town on election day.

By Ginger Gibson and James Oliphant

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said this week he was ""very close"" to deciding whether to make a 2020 White House bid and will run only if he thinks he can win the Democratic Party's nomination.

He is not alone in questioning if he is the man for the moment.

The clamor for Biden to join the pack seeking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump has quieted as the Democratic field has grown more crowded and diverse, according to interviews with more than two dozen strategists, activists, party organizers and voters.

Opinion polls show Biden, a former U.S. senator from Delaware who served two terms as former President Barack Obama's vice president, remains popular. But the Democratic Party may no longer need him in order to be competitive against Trump.

""I love Joe Biden. He's a great guy and a great politician,"" said Jerry Shriner, a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho. ""I wish he were the president right now. But I'm not sure I wish he is president in 2021.""

Democrats are in the early stages of an internal debate about how best to challenge Trump in next year's presidential election, weighing factors like electability, ideology and identity.

The strength of the field - expected to include at least six sitting U.S. senators, plus several current or former governors, U.S. House of Representatives members and a former Cabinet secretary - is a factor in Biden's calculations, those close to him say.

He will be more likely to remain on the sidelines if he feels a strong candidate capable of beating Trump is emerging.

But a source close to Biden said: ""If I had to guess, he's probably going to do it.""

Biden associates have held discussions with potential staffers and supporters who could serve political strategy, grassroots organizing and digital campaign roles, according to two sources. One source said those conversations were necessary to quickly ramp up a formal campaign operation should Biden decide to run.

Some party activists say, however, that Biden has not reached out to broad donor networks to gauge the level of monetary support he could expect.

Biden, who mounted failed presidential campaigns in 1998 and 2008, said at an event in Delaware on Tuesday that he did not want a third bid to be ""a fool's errand.""

""What I don’t want to do is take people’s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee,"" he said. ""I think I can.""

'TOO OLD'

Biden chose not to run in 2016 when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was widely considered the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination. Some political analysts have since speculated he could have won industrial battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that proved crucial to Trump's surprise victory.

Biden's high name recognition among Democratic voters means he likely can afford to wait longer than lesser-known candidates to enter the 2020 race. But even that comes with a risk.

""The longer he waits, the more people are going to start to want to follow some of the new and younger voices they're hearing,"" said Bret Niles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa.

Biden's age, ideology and record already are drawing scrutiny. If elected, he would be 78 when he was sworn in.

""Joe Biden is too old,"" said Mary Donough, 60, a Democrat from Des Moines, Iowa, who plans to participate in her state's crucial nominating caucus next year and wants a younger candidate to challenge Trump.

""There is just more energy there,"" she said.

Biden's backers will argue his age represents experience, said a former aide who asked to speak on background in order to explain internal talking points.

""Voters look at Donald Trump and they look at what we’re missing, which is someone who understands the institution, someone who is an adult, someone who is seasoned, someone who respects the institutions,"" the former aide said.

If Biden does run, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, said on Thursday that Trump and the Republican Party would attack his work as vice president under Obama.

“Go ahead and run,” McDaniel told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. “Run on your record of stagnant wages, of jobs leaving this country, of manufacturing jobs fleeing United States of America, of bad trade deals, of bad foreign policy.","As Biden weighs 2020 bid, Democrats ask: 'Does he meet the moment?'",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-weighs-2020-bid-democrats-ask-does-meet-110250067.html

In the GOP-majority Senate, three Republicans already back the measure, just …","(Bloomberg) -- Senate Republicans must now decide whether to stop President Donald Trump from using an emergency declaration to pay for his border wall, and support from just four GOP members might be enough to send him a measure blocking his plan.

But Trump has promised to issue his first veto if a resolution of disapproval reaches his desk, and Congress appears far short of the votes for an override.

The Democratic-controlled House voted 245-182 Tuesday for a resolution designed to stop Trump from taking billions from other parts of the federal budget to build his promised wall. In the GOP-majority Senate, three Republicans already back the measure, just one short of the number needed to adopt it if the 47 Democratic caucus members stick together. Neither chamber is close to the two-thirds majority needed for an override.

By law, the Senate will have 18 calendar days to consider the House measure, H.J.Res. 46, or act on its own version.

The issues underpinning the emergency declaration likely will feature prominently in the 2020 elections -- with Trump asserting Democrats don’t want to secure the U.S. border with Mexico, and Democrats saying the president is wasting money on an ineffective and purely symbolic tool to keep undocumented immigrants out of the U.S.

The resolution also highlights a power struggle between Congress and the White House over how much control the legislative branch should cede to the executive branch.

Diverting Funds

Republicans leaders defended Trump’s emergency declaration to redirect Defense Department funds without congressional approval as necessary to defend the southern border. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California called the resolution a “purely political statement.”

“Not only does the president have the legal authority to declare this national emergency under two federal statutes, the move is far from unprecedented,” McCarthy said in a statement, noting 31 national emergencies that are still in effect.

Presidents have issued almost 60 declarations since the National Emergencies Act was enacted by Congress in 1976. The law requires Congress to review the declaration as a check on executive power, and Senate adoption of the House resolution would be the first time Congress has voted to end an emergency declaration.

There has been bipartisan unease with Trump’s move to shift money outside of the normal congressional process to fund a border wall he promised supporters during the 2016 campaign.

Setting Precedent

Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky was one of 13 House Republicans who joined Democrats in backing the resolution.

He said he supports Trump and agrees with the need for a border barrier, but supported the resolution “in order to be consistent in preserving the constitutional structure of our republic.” Massie and other Republicans have warned about the precedent set by Trump’s declaration, which future presidents could use to redirect government funds to their preferred policy goals.

“There is a crisis at our border, but it’s not an emergency when Congress doesn’t spend money how the President wants,” Massie said on Twitter. “The President’s constitutional remedy is to veto spending bills that aren’t suitable to him, yet he has chosen to sign many bills that did not fund the wall.”

Trump signed the first spending bill of his presidency last year, even though he complained that Republican majorities in both chambers didn’t appropriate enough for the wall. He then surprised GOP leaders in December by rejecting a Republican spending bill that included $1.3 billion for a border barrier, which caused the 35-day lapse in government funding that forced some federal agencies -- including the Department of Homeland Security -- to close.

That impasse was resolved when Trump agreed to sign a bipartisan spending bill that provided the $1.4 billion for physical barriers on the border, including 55 miles of new construction. At the same time, he signed an emergency declaration to shift $3.5 billion from military construction accounts to the border wall.

Trump is also attempting to tap $600 million from the Treasury asset forfeiture fund, and $2.5 billion from a Defense Department anti-drug program -- moves that don’t rely on the emergency order.",Republican Senators’ Choice: Back or Oppose Trump on Border Emergency,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/house-votes-block-trump-apos-233428611.html

“I don’t think any of them have,” the California Democrat told the magazine.

She had it wrong, though: The committee’s nine Democratic members took a combined $198,000 from fossil fuel industry political action committees connected to oil, gas, mining and utilities in the 2018 midterm elections, as HuffPost previously reported. The bulk of that sum, $117,000, went to Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), making up 6 percent of all his contributions, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.

The committee, created after the Democratic Party won a majority in the House of Representatives last year, aims to promote policies to combat climate change. No Republicans have opted to serve on it. Activists believe members should refuse fossil fuel money as a sign of their independence from the industry that has attempted to stall climate action while contributing greatly to the problem.

“This is about [finding] people who care very much about the issue and know very much about the issue,” Pelosi said of the panel.

Some committee members have made efforts to distance themselves from fossil fuel companies. Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) signed a pledge promising not to take money from those or any corporate PACs, with others planning to follow suit. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) divested up to $100,000 worth of shares of a mutual fund with fossil fuel utility holdings in January after a watchdog group called her out.

“We’re thinking big on this,” Pelosi said. “We’re not holding [it against] somebody if she got a utility contribution within her lifetime.”

She added: “I mean, my daughter is really on everybody’s case about taking contributions, so I know the program. But I just want the best possible people.”

According to Castor, the committee will work “in the spirit of the Green New Deal,” progressive Democrats’ proposal to move to 100 percent renewable energy over a decade with a jobs guarantee.

The poster featured a meme that depicted Omar under a photo of the burning Twin Towers and the words, “‘Never forget’ - you said..I am the proof - you have forgotten.”

Chaos broke out at the West Virginia Capitol on Friday after an anti-Muslim poster linking Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar to the 9/11 terror attacks was displayed as part of a celebration of the state’s Republican Party, leading to a resignation and a reported injury.

This poster is in your Capitol on a booth sponsored by @WVGOP “When someone shows you who they are, believe them”

According to WV News, the poster was put up by ACT for America, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed “an anti-Muslim hate group.”

The organization reportedly denied it was theirs, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News.

Several House Democrats gave public remarks condemning the display, WV News reported.

“It’s ugly; it’s hateful; and there’s absolutely no place for it in American politics,” Democratic Del. Mike Pushkin, who tweeted a photo of the poster, said. “Not in the country that I love. Not in the state that I love.”

Republican Del. Dianna Graves called it a “freedom of speech” issue, but did not directly condemn the poster at the time.

“While I may not agree with everything that is out there, I do agree that freedom of speech is something we have to protect, even if we don’t agree with it,” Graves said. “Maybe especially because we don’t believe in it.”



But in an email to BuzzFeed News on Saturday, Graves said she does “not condone hate speech” and has “great respect for every American, regardless of their religion.”

“I believe Muslim Americans are just that — Americans. Period. And anything that spreads hate is personally distasteful to me. Deeply,” she told BuzzFeed News.



House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, called on the delegates to “do better,” but did not directly condemn the poster or its message.



“We are supposed to have disagreement here. We are supposed to engage in high-minded debate. We are suppose to air out things that are sometimes uncomfortable — that’s OK,” Hanshaw said. “That’s what makes our country great.”

At one point, Del. Michael Angelucci, a Democrat, alleged that he’d heard Republican Sergeant-at-Arms Anne Lieberman say that “all Muslims are terrorists.”

“That’s beyond shameful — and that’s not freedom of speech,” Angelucci said. “That’s hate speech and it has no place in this House — the people’s House — and I am furious.”



In an interview with West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Lieberman disputed the claim but declined to comment further.

By Friday afternoon, though, Lieberman had resigned. In a statement shared on Facebook on Sunday, she suggested that Angelucci had “misheard or misunderstood” her. “I know for certain that I said — verbatim — that ‘Not all Muslims are terrorists,’ but that THOSE (9/11) terrorists WERE all Muslim, trying to bring the discussion back to his original complaint,” she wrote.

During the arguments over the poster, one lawmaker even injured a doorkeeper, WSAZ reported. It was not clear who was involved in the scuffle, and police did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News about the nature of the injury.

Graves, the Republican who initially referred to the incident as a “freedom of speech” issue, told BuzzFeed News that “a person was so angry over the display in front of our Chamber yesterday they may have cracked the rib of our doorkeeper trying to get into the room.”

On Saturday, the West Virginia Republican Party released a statement saying it does “not approve, condone, or support hate speech.”

The group said once it learned of the sign, it asked the exhibitor to take it down.

“Our Party supports freedom of speech, but we do not endorse speech that advances intolerant and hateful views,” West Virginia Republican Party officials said in their statement.



On Twitter on Friday evening, Omar blamed the Republican Party for the threats she has received.



“No wonder why I am on the ‘Hitlist’ of a domestic terrorist and ‘Assassinate Ilhan Omar’ is written on my local gas stations,” Omar wrote. “Look no further, the GOP’s anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist rocks in state capitols and no one is condemning them!”

Omar became one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in November, along with Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib.

It's time to wake up and smell the coffee.

Since late January, Twitter has suspended several accounts that pretend to support Howard Schultz's political ambitions but are actually pushing other agendas. On Thursday, Twitter suspended three more accounts for violating its policies.

Schultz hasn't officially announced he's running for president, but the businessman has said he's considering an independent run for the White House. Since his announcement in late January, several accounts pretending to support the former coffee shop executive have popped up on Twitter.

On Thursday, Twitter suspended the accounts @GaysForSchultz, @PresSchultz2020, and @HowardJSchultz. The @HowardJSchultz account described itself as ""Millennials for Schultz."" Before they were suspended, all three accounts were posting content from the ""alt-right,"" a loosely knit movement of white nationalists and neo-Nazis.



The @GaysForSchultz account responded to tweets about Ruth Bader Ginsburg conspiracy theories, while the @PresSchultz2020 account posted anti-Muslim content alongside posts supporting Schultz's presidential ambitions.



The three accounts violated Twitter's ""Fake Accounts"" policy, according to a person familiar with the suspensions. While parody accounts of Schultz are still on Twitter, these three accounts were considered ""fake and misleading.""

Schultz didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Creating fake social-media profiles tied to politics isn't new. During the 2016 US presidential election, Russian operatives made fan pages on Facebook and accounts on Twitter supporting third-party candidates, such as Jill Stein, with the intention of pulling votes away from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate.

In late January, Twitter suspended the accounts @Blacks4Schultz and @GOP4Schultz, the former for operating multiple accounts. The @Blacks4Schultz account had a stock-photo image of an African-American man with ""Howard"" edited onto his shirt.

The most prominent account was ""@Women_4_Schultz,"" an account created by Jacob Wohl, a conservative activist who bragged to USA Today about his plans to create fraudulent Twitter profiles and promote candidates considered less likely to defeat President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.



Wohl's fake accounts, along with his own Twitter profile, were suspended last week for violating the social network's policies, ""specifically creating and operating fake accounts,"" a Twitter representative said.



The strategy was taken right out of Russia's disinformation playbook, by setting up fake accounts to allege support for candidates who have a weaker shot at the White House, Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's digital forensic research lab, said.

The other suspended Schultz accounts aren't tied to Wohl, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Some accounts pretending to support Schultz are still active on Twitter. The social network allows parody profiles as long as they don't violate Twitter's rules.



That could be why Wohl's @Women_4_Schultz account was suspended while @WomenForSchultz, a parody of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen's ""Women for Cohen"" account, still remains.

Social networks are gearing up for a flood of disinformation as the 2020 US presidential election draws closer.



It proved to be an effective tool for Russian operatives in 2016, and US intelligence officials now consider disinformation a global threat.



The slow drip of Schultz accounts getting suspended is just a small example of the flood of disinformation social networks are expecting over the next year.

""One of the main worries after the Russian operation was exposed was that users in America would copy it,"" Nimmo said. ""We've already seen reported attempts in the Alabama special Senate election, targeting potential Republican voters. Now it looks like we're seeing similar activity targeting Democrats. It's a bad sign before 2020.""

A record 14 candidates are on the ballot.

Most of the candidates announced they were running after two-term Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced in September that he wouldn’t seek a third term. The field includes eight people of color and ten who have never held elected office.

Here’s what you need to know about Tuesday’s race:

1) Tuesday’s vote is likely just the beginning.

Under Chicago’s election rules, if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off in an April 2 runoff.

No candidate is polling at more than 14 percent, according to a survey published Sunday by 270 Strategies. Six candidates were within the poll’s margin of error of 3.7 percent of finishing in the top two.

If the race is as close as polling suggests, it could take the Chicago Board of Election some time to sort out winners and losers.

2) At least six candidates appear to have a legitimate shot.

The top three candidates – former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot, former U.S. Commerce Secretary Bill Daley and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle – finished within less than half a percentage point in the 270 Strategies Poll.

Lightfoot, who served as president of the Chicago Police Board and the city’s Police Accountability Task Force, has cast herself as a reformer and independent who will take on a culture of corruption in city hall.

Daley, who was commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton, chief of staff under President Barack Obama and a top executive at JP Morgan, says his high-level experience in government and business makes him the ideal candidate to confront the city’s financial problems. Chicago has $28 billion in unmet pension obligations. Daley is the son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley and brother of former Mayor Richard M. Daley.

Preckwinkle has the backing of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union. She’s also the president of the county’s Democratic party, giving her a strong base of support.

Three other candidates – Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, former Chicago school board president Gery Chico, and businessman Willie Wilson – are within striking distance of the frontrunners, according to the 270 Strategies poll.

Mendoza, who the poll shows at 10 percent, has focused largely on reducing violent crime, checking property taxes and improving schools.

Gery Chico, at 9 percent, has served in a variety of high-level city positions and ran a lucrative law practice that has represented clients doing business with Chicago. He was chief of staff to former Mayor Richard M. Daley, head of the city’s school board and president of Chicago’s park district.

Willie Wilson, the son of a Louisiana sharecropper, grew up in poverty and had only a seventh-grade education, but went on to own several McDonald’s franchises and found a medical supplies company. Wilson, at 9 percent, has cast himself as a pro-business candidate who would work reduce taxes for city residents and corporations.

3) Corruption is casting a shadow over race.

Chicago is no stranger to corruption. More than 30 city aldermen have been convicted of political corruption since 1973.

But the political scandal unveiled by federal prosecutors in January has cast a shadow over Tuesday’s mayoral election.

Authorities say Democratic Alderman Ed Burke, a 50-year veteran of the City Council and chairman of its powerful finance committee, tried to shake down officials of a company that operates dozens of Burger King franchises in Illinois.

Four of the most competitive candidates in the race – Preckwinkle, Mendoza, Chico and Daley – have all drawn scrutiny for longstanding ties to Burke. They've all sought to distance themselves from the longtime power broker.

Preckwinkle received more than $100,000 from a Burke-sponsored fundraiser last year. Mendoza was married at Burke’s home. Burke endorsed Chico, who worked as an aide to the alderman 30 years ago. Daley's family has received about $30,000 in political donations from Burke over decades.

4) Rahm opts not to try for third term.

Emanuel amassed more than $10 million campaign contributions for this election, but would have faced a difficult campaign had he decided to seek a third term.

Emanuel entered office in 2011 with one of the most impressive political resumes of any big-city mayor: He was a top adviser to President Bill Clinton, served three terms in Congress, chaired the House Democratic Caucus and became President Barack Obama’s first White House chief of staff.

As mayor, he boasted of record high school graduation rates in the city last year, significant investment in the Chicago Transit Authority, and success recruiting several large corporations to relocate to the city.

But he saw his standing in the city’s sizable African-American community sink following the court-ordered release of chilling police video that showed a white officer, Jason Van Dyke, firing 16 shots at a black teen, Laquan McDonald, on a city street.

Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery. He was sentenced last month to 81 months in prison.

5) The winner could make history.

Lightfoot, Preckwinkle or Amara Enyia would be Chicago’s first black female mayor. Lightfoot would be the city's first openly gay mayor. Mendoza or Chico would be the city's first Latino mayor.

A win by Daley would continue the dynasty of one of the nation's most powerful political families. Bill Daley’s father, Richard J. Daley, was mayor of Chicago for 21 years, and his older brother, Richard M. Daley, spent 22 years as mayor.

In explosive public testimony before Congress, Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen cast the president as a “racist” and a “conman” who engaged in criminal activity after taking office as president to cover up an illegal hush money payment to an adult film actor.

Appearing before the House oversight committee on Wednesday, Cohen became the first Trump associate to allege that Trump had prior knowledge that his longtime adviser, Roger Stone, was communicating with WikiLeaks during the 2016 election regarding the release of hacked Democratic Party emails.

He also said Trump was aware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting between members of his presidential campaign, including his son Donald Trump Jr, and a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, which was arranged under the pretense of receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Cohen’s testimony marked a rare opportunity for millions of Americans to bear witness to the account of a central player in multiple investigations ensnaring the president and his inner circle. Cohen acted for more than a decade as the president’s fixer – a role in which he became intimately familiar with both Trump’s personal and professional affairs.

It highlighted how the US president faces legal and political peril on at least two fronts – the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, as well as a criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws through the payment of hush money.

“Today, I am here to tell the truth about Mr Trump,” Cohen said in his opening statement.

“I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience,” he added. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.”

Cohen pleaded guilty in November to crimes that including lying to Congress and is scheduled to go to prison in May to begin a three-year sentence. Speaking in a measured tone, Cohen described his testimony as a step on “path of redemption” and apologized to the panel for his previous lies.

Trump, who arrived in Hanoi this week for a summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, accused Cohen of “lying in order to reduce his prison time”.

[Trump] wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws Michael Cohen

Cohen testified publicly for the first time in detail about a six-figure sum that was paid to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to prevent her from speaking out about an alleged an affair with Trump. Cohen presented checks he said were signed by the president and his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, to reimburse him for the hush money payments totaling $130,000.

“The president of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws,” Cohen said.

He told the panel Trump knew of and approved each step of the payments, and said the president committed other illegal acts that he was unable to discuss because they were under investigation.

Cohen added that he was instructed by Trump to lie about the alleged affair to the president’s wife, Melania Trump, stating: “Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets because she is a kind, good person.”

The finding that Donald Jr was directly involved in the scheme to pay off Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, could mean the president’s son faces legal jeopardy. Federal prosecutors in New York, who have had copies of the checks and other records for months, say the payments violated campaign finance laws.

That investigation, which is being overseen by the southern district of New York, is also examining a six-figure payment made to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who also alleged an affair with Trump, by the National Enquirer. The tabloid, which is owned by the president’s close friend David Pecker, purchased the exclusive rights to McDougal’s story and then refused to publish it in a practice known as ‘catch-and-kill’.

Cohen said he presided over ‘several’ similar arrangements, while telling the committee: “These catch-and-kill scenarios existed between David Pecker and Mr. Trump long before I started working for him in 2007.”","Donald Trump 'a racist, a conman' who committed crimes as president – Cohen",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-apos-racist-conman-184232983.html
266,Empty,2019-02-26T23:30:39Z,It’s the one downside to running for president a second time.,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.

Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign launched like a rocket. Within 24 hours of his official kickoff, the Vermont senator had raised a staggering $6 million, quadruple the previous known first-day record, and within a week, his campaign had signed up more than 1 million volunteers. All that excitement is already showing up in the polls, where Sanders had been running second in a still-hypothetical field for most of the past year. According to Morning Consult, which is surveying primary voters daily, Sanders picked up 6 percentage points in the past week and, as of Tuesday, clocked in at 27 percent support nationally, moving him into a statistical dead heat for first place with Joe Biden, who remains on the sidelines. Bernie’s closest declared rival, meanwhile, is Kamala Harris, who sits in a distant third place with 10 percent support.

Sanders’ impressive start would not have been possible without the foundation he laid during his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was then that the self-styled democratic socialist amassed the network of supporters that begat last week’s initial burst of donations and volunteers. And it was then that he transformed himself from a Phish Food–flavored fringe character into a national politician with near-universal name recognition.

But unfortunately for Sanders, he’s carrying over something else from his remarkable 2016 campaign: baggage.

Over the weekend, Sanders felt compelled to make a semipublic plea for his allies to be on their best behavior during the Democratic primary, or in his words, to “engage respectively with our Democratic opponents—talking about issues we are fighting for, not about personalities or past grievances.” It served as a tacit acknowledgement of something Sanders conceded more openly in the 2016 campaign but that continues to dog him: that some of his most ardent supporters have a nasty streak that Clinton die-hards have not forgotten and the political press corps cannot get enough of. “I want to be clear that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space,” Sanders wrote in his recent email.

It’s not entirely clear that the festering 2016 resentment matters outside the Beltway.

The lingering bad blood between the Sanders and Clinton camps then spilled more fully into public view Monday by way of a Politico story headlined “Ex-Clinton Staffers Slam Sanders Over Private Jet Flights,” in which former Clinton staffers complained that the campaign had to pay to fly Sanders on private jets while he was stumping for Clinton in the general election. Much of the sniping was done under cover of anonymity, but the harshest words were on the record. “I’m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,” said Zac Petkanas, who led Hillary’s rapid response team in 2016. Michael Briggs, Sanders’ 2016 campaign spokesman, fired back, calling Clinton’s team “total ingrates” and “some of the biggest assholes in American politics.”

The insult-slinging was ostensibly about private jets, but in reality it was a proxy for the larger debate that continues to bubble up inside the Beltway in Year 3 of Donald Trump’s presidency—namely, how much Sanders’ primary challenge damaged Clinton’s candidacy and whether he subsequently did all he could to heal the intraparty wounds before the general election. The fact that Monday’s spat was about Sanders’ mode of travel to Clinton rallies illustrates how unproductive this feud is. It’s about whether Sanders did enough to help the first female nominee of a major party in U.S. history—not whether he helped her at all. Likewise, it calls to mind the running debate over Bernie Bros, who simultaneously exist and don’t exist in the numbers Sanders’ critics suggest: Did Bernie do enough to rein in the worst impulses of his most combative fans, and is he doing enough now? As narrow as these rifts are, they’re unlikely to ever be bridged by the two entrenched sides.

The good news for Sanders is that it’s not entirely clear that the festering 2016 resentment matters outside the Beltway. His favorability rating within the Democratic rank and file suggests the vast majority of primary voters have either forgiven, forgotten, or never noticed the rift in the first place. In the Morning Consult poll, for example, 75 percent of Democratic voters said they had a favorable opinion of Sanders, while just 15 percent said they had an unfavorable one. Those numbers are nearly as good as Biden’s (76 percent to 12 percent) and far better than every other potential rival, none of whom have faced the same kind of he’s-not-even-technically-a-Democrat complaints that get lobbed at Sanders from the party faithful.

If the old Clinton and Sanders camps continue to relitigate those old grievances, however, the squabbles could complicate Sanders’ attempts to defend himself from the more specific criticisms leveled at his first presidential campaign, which include the alleged mistreatment of female staffers and his lackluster appeals to black voters, particularly in the early nominating contests back when his leadership team was predominantly white. Sanders has taken steps to address both—he apologized to his female campaign staffers publicly, and he’s now more explicitly drawing a connection between economic inequality and racial inequality than he did in 2016—but the complaints will almost certainly re-emerge in a primary where gender, race, and identity are dominant themes. Sanders may have to lug his 2016 baggage with him into 2020, especially if a candidate of color and/or a woman emerges as his most direct challenger. The question, though, is whether his campaign will have so much momentum that he won’t feel the weight of it.",Bernie’s Baggage From 2016 Could Drag Down His 2020 Bid,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/bernie-sanders-campaign-clinton-2016-baggage.html

Or will the party remain as divided as Republicans were in 2016?

One indication will be whether Democratic elected officials and other influential party members seek to winnow the field by endorsing a narrow range of candidates. Confronting a similarly large field in 2016, Republican “party elites” never achieved any sort of consensus, with many potential endorsers sitting on the sidelines or not offering more than tepid support for establishment-friendly candidates such as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Donald Trump emerged as the GOP nominee despite not receiving a single endorsement from a sitting Republican governor or member of Congress until after his wins in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.

So as we did in 2016, FiveThirtyEight will be tracking endorsements for the Democratic presidential nomination. We’ll also add the Republican nomination if it eventually appears that someone will give Trump a real run for his money, but we aren’t doing that just yet. Instead, we’ll be focusing on a universe of more than 900 potential Democratic endorsers, a more comprehensive list than we evaluated in 2016, including at least a few possible endorsers in every U.S. state and territory.

We’ll detail the procedures for tracking endorsements separately, but here’s some background about why we’re doing this and why we think it’s valuable both as a journalistic exercise and as a tool to help predict which Democrat will win.

Despite 2016, the party still mostly decides

The 2016 Republican campaign raised questions about the value of endorsements as a measure of success in the presidential primaries. Indeed, we raised a lot of those questions ourselves after being unduly skeptical of Trump’s chances of winning the nomination until around the time of the Iowa caucuses.

In our coverage of the 2016 primaries, we were heavily invested in the hypothesis articulated in the book “The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform,” by the political scientists Marty Cohen, David Karol, Hans Noel and John Zaller. The book, which is also backed by other political science scholarship, argued that the preferences of party elites, as expressed by endorsements, tend to lead voter preferences. If party elites achieve consensus on a candidate, that candidate tends to win the nomination, even if he or she initially receives only tepid support in the polls, the book argues. And even if those elites can’t achieve consensus, parties rarely nominate candidates who aren’t at least minimally acceptable to the party establishment, it implies.

Trump was an extremely problematic data point for this hypothesis, as well as for our own expectations about how the nomination process was supposed to work. In the past, parties usually went for candidates who could be entrusted to enact the party’s agenda, but who also helped to maximize the chances of winning the general election. Trump was just the opposite of that: He bucked Republican orthodoxy on many issues, but he also polled poorly among independents and swing voters. So given the information available in early 2016, Trump looked like the worst of both worlds to the Republican establishment.

So why bother tracking endorsements at all? Well, partly because whether or not they predict anything, we think it’s useful descriptive data — creating a fossil record of how the Democratic Party was behaving in 2019 and 2020. It also makes for a good reality check. One can make assertions about which candidates are backed by the party establishment and which ones aren’t, and these claims are common in media coverage of the campaigns. Tracking endorsements raises the bar by requiring tangible evidence for those claims, however. It’s potentially noteworthy, for instance, that the supposedly establishment-friendly New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand doesn’t have any endorsements yet, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders already has almost as many as he did in 2016.

But also, to put it bluntly, we think a lot of political analysis is dumb. And a lot of the reason it’s dumb is because people are too quick to draw conclusions from just one or two cases. In fact, the “Party Decides” hypothesis has a fairly good track record overall. As poorly as the theory fared in the 2016 GOP nomination, it had done exceptionally well in the 2012 Republican race, when the party-backed Mitt Romney fought back a series of insurgent candidates (Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain) who surged in the polls but didn’t have staying power. That doesn’t mean the candidate leading in endorsements will automatically win the nomination, or even necessarily be an odds-on favorite. But endorsements are one of the more useful instruments to have in your toolkit if you’re taking a multifaceted approach to covering the primary.

The modern presidential nomination system emerged in advance of the 1972 election, when the Democrats’ McGovern-Fraser Commission adopted a series of reforms that gave voters a more direct say in electing delegates to the national convention through primaries and caucuses. From 1972 to 2016, the parties went through 16 nomination processes — nine for Democrats and seven for Republicans — that did not involve their own incumbent president running for re-election.

The argument of “The Party Decides” is that, despite the McGovern reforms, voters usually agreed with the party elites anyway. Indeed, in these 16 elections, the candidate who was leading in endorsements the day before the Iowa caucus won 10 nominations, or 63 percent of the time.

The endorsement leader usually wins Leaders in endorsement points in nomination processes where no incumbent president was running for that party, 1972-2016 Year Party Endorsement leader before Iowa Did they have a clear endorsement lead?

Endorsement leaders in 1972 and 1976 are based on “The Party Decides.” Sources: “The Party Decides,” News accounts

But look at the data in more detail, and a more subtle pattern emerges. In 11 instances since 1972, there has been a clear front-runner in endorsements as of the Iowa caucuses. That front-runner won the nomination nine times, the lone exceptions being Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Ed Muskie in 1972. In five other instances, there was no clear consensus among endorsers, and the endorsement leader was at best a first among equals. Only one of these five candidates (John McCain in 2008) won the nomination.

So in some ways, the question is not so much who gets the most endorsements but whether a consensus forms. Sometimes, party elites’ preferences are murky initially, but a clear front-runner emerges before Iowa: The most notable examples of this are Mitt Romney in 2012 (who at earlier points in time was neck-and-neck with Texas Gov. Rick Perry in endorsements) and Bill Clinton in 1992. A consensus can also emerge after Iowa and New Hampshire and potentially predict how contentious the rest of the nomination process will be. John Kerry got a huge surge in endorsements after winning Iowa and New Hampshire in 2004 and went on to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease; in contrast, the Iowa and New Hampshire results in 2016 only seemed to freeze Republican endorsers, and the outcome of the GOP nomination remained fairly uncertain until late April or early May.

And although endorsements aren’t perfect, they do roughly as well as polls at predicting the nominee. Below is a comparison of the endorsement leader before Iowa and the leader in national polls at the same point in time.

Endorsement leaders in 1972 and 1976 are based on “The Party Decides.” Sources: “The Party Decides,” News accounts

In 11 of the 16 nomination races, the pre-Iowa polling and endorsement leaders were the same. Differences have become more commonplace in recent years — in three of the five incumbent-free nomination processes since 2008, the polling and endorsement leader was not the same — which may suggest an increasing divide between voters and elites, especially within the Republican Party, or which may just be a fluke of a small sample size.

In the five cases where polls and endorsements differed, endorsements were right twice (Romney in 2012 and McCain in 2008), polls were right once (Trump in 2016), and in the final two instances (the Democratic nominations in 1976 and 1988) a third candidate who was neither the polling nor the endorsement leader won. Given the small sample size, I wouldn’t call that a “win” for endorsements over polls, but I would say it’s at least a draw.

So the party usually does get its way. But it also usually agrees with voters in the first place — or at least it can live with their choices — and it’s not so clear what happens in the event of a disagreement. Maybe the voter-centric model of the 2016 Republican primary is the new normal, but we’ll need to see more evidence of that before we can say for sure. In Democratic primaries for governor and Congress in 2018, establishment-backed candidates prevailed a high percentage of the time, despite the media’s fixation on exceptions such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York’s 14th Congressional District.

I haven’t talked much about which Democrats have received the most endorsements to date because it’s awfully early in the process and so far less than 10 percent of all Democratic endorsement points have been claimed. Furthermore, the large majority of the endorsements that have been made so far are from within the same state as the candidate, e.g. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz backing Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. So far, however, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has the most endorsement points, with Klobuchar and California Sen. Kamala Harris essentially tied for second. Sanders’s initial total, while well behind the other three, is also fairly promising for him given that he received so few endorsements in 2016.

That pretty much covers it. If you have any questions, or see any endorsements we’ve missed, please drop us a line. Otherwise, we hope you’ll check in regularly to see who’s winning the endorsement primary.",We’re Tracking 2020 Presidential Endorsements.

Read more: Live updates and analysis from Michael Cohen’s testimony to Congress.

Cohen is also making public copies of checks he received that he and federal prosecutors in Manhattan have said are reimbursement for hush money he paid to silence adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed an extramarital affair with Trump. At least one of the checks, dated August 1, 2017, was personally signed by Trump.

Cohen said the check was written from the president’s personal bank account, after he took office, “to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign.”

Cohen has pleaded guilty to charges of illegal campaign contributions related to the payments.

Read Michael Cohen’s prepared testimony.

As the House Oversight and Reform Committee opened its hearing on Wednesday, Cohen also was poised to tell the panel that Trump knew during the 2016 presidential election that his ally Roger Stone was talking to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks about a release of hacked Democratic National Committee emails.

“I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is,” Cohen intends to tell the committee at a public hearing on Wednesday, about the man who he once said he’d take a bullet for. “He is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat,” Cohen said in the prepared testimony.

Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to nine felonies, including lying to Congress, and is headed to prison, also is planning to tell the committee that Trump “did not directly tell me to lie to Congress” about the timing of talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

“That’s not how he operates,” Cohen said in the prepared remarks.

Campaign Conversations

But Cohen asserts that in conversations with Trump during the 2016 campaign, “at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing.”

“In his way, he was telling me to lie,” he wrote.

“I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016,” Cohen wrote in his statement. “That was false -- our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.”

Cohen, in his testimony, says he has first-hand knowledge of -- and even some documentary evidence for -- a number of questionable and even potentially illegal Trump activities.

One of the biggest accusations involves the 2016 WikiLeaks release.

Telephone Call

“He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails,” Cohen plans to say, recalling a telephone call to Trump from Stone when he was in the room that was put on speaker.

“Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Cohen writes. “Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of “wouldn’t that be great.”

So, too, he is planning to provide the committee three years of Trump’s financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills.

Inflated, Deflated

Cohen intends to testify that “it was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.”

He described his role in the Trump circle as “always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life.”

“Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I,” Cohen said. “He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.”",Cohen to Call Trump a Liar and Offer Documents to Back His Story,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/cohen-plans-tell-house-panel-065231973.html
269,Empty,2019-02-28T14:43:02Z,Activists and politicians in Europe think they've finally found a way to help stop the spread of false information on social media.,"An overwhelming majority of Europeans would support a radical new measure that would require social media companies to direct all users who have seen false information toward fact-checks, according to new polling from global advocacy group Avaaz. The initiative is intended to prevent the spread of “fake news” on Facebook and Twitter as governments come under growing pressure to regulate social media.

Research shared exclusively with TIME shows that 86.6% of people support Avaaz’s new proposal known as Correct the Record, which activists and politicians say could be the most effective way to stop “fake news” from spreading online.

Under the Correct the Record initiative, social media companies would have to make sure that all users who see false information on their feeds are also later presented with fact-checks — whether in the form of a notification telling them something they’ve seen may have been misleading, or a pinned post in their newsfeed with a link to a fact-check by a “verified” organization.

The proposal is one of the first concrete suggestions for how to combat the spread of disinformation online, at a time when false news is increasingly affecting the outcome of elections and fueling violence around the world.

The international activist network Avaaz, in collaboration with the polling group YouGov, surveyed more than 5,000 people in Germany, France, Spain and Italy on the subject of Correct the Record. In each country, at least 81% and as many as 92% of respondents said they either “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that social media companies should “work with independent and trusted fact checking organizations to provide all users who have been exposed to widespread false or misleading content with verified corrections.”

“Correcting the record is a legal responsibility that newspapers have to meet in many countries,” Ricken Patel, the executive director of Avaaz, tells TIME. “When they print false information, they have to print corrections. Part of Correct the Record is just bringing that journalistic tradition of correction into social media.”

European Union officials have also welcomed the Correct the Record proposal. “We need rapid corrections, which are given the same prominence and circulation as the original fake news,” said Julian King, the E.U. security commissioner, after being briefed on the proposal late last year.

Facebook, one of the key targets of the proposal, has not yet provided a formal response to a TIME request for comment. The company does already have partnerships with fact-checking bodies around the world. “Misinformation is bad for our community and bad for our business. It’s why we’re investing significant time and resources to fight it,” the company wrote in a 2018 blog post.

But the matter is increasingly urgent as European Union elections approach in May, and activists say Facebook is not doing enough. Of the Avaaz survey’s respondents, 77.8% said they believed fake news and “politically motivated disinformation” posed a threat to the legitimacy of those elections, and 84.8% said they believed social media companies should be regulated.

“We have found a tremendously receptive audience for Correct the Record as an idea, across the spectrum, from academics to regulators to experts, to the social media executives themselves, to political party leaders,” Patel, tells TIME. “You name it, I have not found strong arguments against this solution.”

But some activists raised concerns that Facebook could not be trusted to partner with fact-checking organizations. “This measure is a good starting point, but only as long as there’s democratic accountability,” says Kyle Taylor, the director of the campaign group Fair Vote U.K. “It’s not safe to outsource truth to a private company.”

Snopes, the popular online fact-checking website, pulled out of a fact-checking arrangement with Facebook earlier in February, citing dissatisfaction that the arrangements were benefiting Facebook at the expense of the “whole web.”

“The work that fact-checkers are doing doesn’t need to be just for Facebook — we can build things for fact-checkers that benefit the whole web, and that can also help Facebook,” Vinny Green, Snopes’ vice president of operations, told Poynter. Others raised concerns about reports that Facebook had hired a PR firm to spread anti-Semitic tropes about George Soros. “They’ve essentially used us for crisis PR,” Brooke Binkowski, a former Snopes editor, told the Guardian.

Christoph Schott, a campaign director at Avaaz, says Facebook’s current fact-checking arrangements are a step in the right direction, but are not enough. Only a small percentage of those who see “fake news,” he says, ever come into contact with a post debunking it. “They don’t inform the other maybe 95% of users,” he tells TIME. Correct the Record, he says, would change that.

Damian Collins, the U.K. lawmaker who eviscerated Facebook in a 111-page report published in mid-February and called for regulation to limit “fake news” on social media, also supports the proposal. (In response to that report, Facebook said it was open to “meaningful regulation.”)

“Support for the Correct the Record measure highlights the growing concern about disinformation on social media and the threat this poses to our democracy,” Collins tells TIME. “The big tech platforms should do more to act against known sources of disinformation and to warn users when they may have been exposed to it. We know they have the technical capability to do this.”

It remains unclear how Correct the Record” can be implemented in practice. Avaaz has presented the proposal to Facebook, Twitter and Google executives, as well as to governments — who could use the idea as a basis for new laws. Social media companies may also attempt to avoid regulation by self-imposing such measures.

In plans submitted to the E.U., NATO, and European governments, Avaaz suggests a five step plan of “define, detect, verify, alert and correct.”

They suggest that social media companies should provide a way for users to flag content for checking, and that a piece of disinformation should be flagged when independent fact-checkers verify that content is misleading. Once they have debunked the content, “each user exposed to verified disinformation should be notified using the most visible notification standard,” according to a policy document presented to E.U. and NATO leaders.

“Facebook has always said ‘we’re open to legislation, if it’s the right legislation,’” Patel, the Avaaz executive director, says. He hopes the company will soon see that it’s smart to rebuild trust in the brand. “This is Facebook’s moment of truth. The E.U. elections are coming. Is it going to be another version of the U.S. election in 2016?”

270,Empty,2019-02-25T19:33:38Z,Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are trying something different.,"Barack Obama before attending fundraisers in 2012. (AP Photo/David Tulis)

Wealthy donors were a big part of how Barack Obama became president. Employees of Goldman Sachs were rivaled only by those of the University of California in powering his record-breaking fundraising totals in 2008. As the insurgent candidate wrestled control of the Democratic Party from the establishment—including frontrunner Hillary Clinton—that year, his inspiring speeches and consistent opposition to the Iraq War were obviously defining elements of a historic candidacy. But so were the eye-popping donations. He broke and then broke again the records for fundraising in a given month, setting the tone for the general election against John McCain with a $66 million haul in August of that year. And while small-dollar donors and the activist base they symbolized were instrumental in his success, Obama also glad-handed at plenty of fancy, exclusive receptions for rich donors both during and after his 2008 victory.

For Democrats hoping to follow in his footsteps, that path toward victory now looks a lot less appealing.

When Bernie Sanders ran for president four years ago, he made a point of largely shunning traditional high-dollar fundraisers, insisting he didn't need or want billionaires' money. It also might have been true that he couldn't get it: The self-declared democratic socialist from Vermont wanted to break up big banks like Goldman, hike taxes on the rich, and dismantle some of the late capitalist infrastructure that he argued was behind soaring income inequality and a broken, for-profit healthcare system. Sanders actually did have the occasional supporter on Wall Street, but with populist anger at Obama's failure to prosecute bankers behind the financial crisis still raging, and the lingering effects of the mortgage crisis and Great Recession still tangible, Sanders could forgo the most lucrative fundraising events and rely on a steady stream of mostly online support from fans. That strategy already seems to be panning out for him this go-around: Sanders raised nearly $6 million in the first 24 hours after announcing his 2020 candidacy last week.

Now Elizabeth Warren is making a point of joining him on the high road. As the New York Times reported Monday, the 2020 contender announced she would skip private, VIP-style fundraisers. She also plans to avoid the ""call time,"" the term for the common practice of politicians working the phones to plead for money from rich people.

""That means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren said in an email to her fans. “It means that wealthy donors won’t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.""

This makes sense given that Warren has for years positioned herself as opponent of the ultra-wealthy and Wall Street.

""Her ceasing VIP fundraisers with mega donors is consistent with the messaging she's been using in campaign, and at this early point in the race, the energy is focused on generating excitement from the base and distinguishing each candidate's campaign from the rest of the pack,"" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the influence watchdog the Center for Responsive Politics.

As Krumholz noted, it's also fair to assume she isn't actually passing on all that much money here; the party's wealthiest donors might be predisposed to back, say, Kamala Harris, or Kirsten Gillibrand, or Cory Booker, or (if and when he gets in) Joe Biden. All of them have been dinged by the left for relatively neoliberal stances on some issues, even if they have also inched leftward and embraced policies like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal to stay abreast of activist orthodoxy. (Gillibrand also declared she wasn't going to take money from corporate PACs, though she'll apparently still take money from individuals connected to the finance industry.)

Which brings us to what this is really about: Warren is sending a message, like the one Sanders has been sending for years now, to the party's most engaged partisans. After all, her move came just a week after the Times reported that a coterie of her rivals, including Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, and Cory Booker, ""auditioned"" before super-wealthy Obama donors, hoping to win their support.

It remains to be seen how much the larger universe of Democratic voters actually cares about who a candidate's donors are. But polling for years now has tended to find large majorities of Americans think the government is too focused on the needs of the rich and not enough on the poor and middle-class, and that money holds too much sway in their democracy.

Warren and Sanders are helping lay down a marker for their competitors, who will have to defend their own practices of holding fundraisers and taking money from industries the Democratic base isn't a fan of. Fundraising has been a consistent issue among those involved in Democratic politics, with a contentious fight over donations from the oil and gas industry unfolding last year in the Democratic National Committee. (The DNC ultimately decided to accept such donations.) In 2008, Obama made a show of skipping out on corporate PAC and lobbyist money, though he obviously wasn't actually missing out on all that much. In 2016, Clinton seemed to be on the side of accepting donations from anyone who would give them, leading to attacks from Trump about her family foundation's work and her paid speeches before audiences of bankers—even as he soaked up dark money donations from self-interested financial titans.

Whether Trump's attacks were fair, this time around the Democratic nominee may be someone who rejects the whole system of donors that Clinton was enmeshed in. If nothing else, the party is set for a real debate—with Warren and Sanders in particular poised to pressure their rivals—about who gets a voice in their government, and how much that voice costs them.

""It's a battle,"" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, VICE contributor, and critic of the party's coziness with entrenched financial power, said in an email when I asked if Warren's move meant Obama donors were losing control of the party. ""To paraphrase Churchill: It isn't the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning.""

DES MOINES, Iowa ― “Can you tell me your mother’s name?” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) asked from across the table. The woman she was speaking to, Monica Reyes, a 28-year-old with DACA status, had traveled to the Iowa Capitol on a blustery Saturday morning in February to let the senator know how much her immigrant mother had done for her growing up. And now Reyes wanted to know what the senator could do for people like her mother if Harris is elected president. Harris would eventually give Reyes her position on the matter, criticizing the Trump administration for “trying to create a scapegoat” out of Mexicans and reiterating her support for comprehensive immigration reform, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). But before she did that, she wanted to know the name of Reyes’ mother. It’s Brenda, Reyes said. “I think it’s important,” Harris replied, “that we speak her name.

Flipboard “Her story is the story of so many people, and I applaud her.”

Stephen Maturen via Getty Images Sen. Kamala Harris is positioning herself more as a common-sense fighter, but her trip in Iowa made clear that voters are still expecting their candidates to have detailed policy ideas and know the issues inside and out.

The audience applauded as well. Over the course of her first full-on tour around Iowa this weekend, Harris’ ability to boil such political moments down to the personal garnered many of her largest cheers. The next day in Bettendorf, she spoke about the pain of watching her mother battle colon cancer before she died in 2009. “It requires physical strength, emotional strength, mental strength, but what that should not require of anyone is that you also have to figure out how you’re going to pay those medical bills,” she said to loud applause. Dan Audi, a 54-year-old maintenance supervisor who is considering Harris, Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), said after the Bettendorf event that he appreciated Harris’ “positive, happy persona.” “You can be a fighter without being angry,” he added. But after the previous morning’s event, Reyes said, she couldn’t help feeling that Harris’ answer fell short. The former California attorney general is positioning herself more as a common-sense fighter, sans the wonkiness of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), but her trip in Iowa made clear that voters are still expecting their candidates to have detailed policy ideas and know the issues inside and out. “I felt like she maybe needs to know a little more about the current and past policies on immigration to be able to better answer the question that I gave her,” said Reyes, a co-founder of the immigration advocacy group Dream Iowa, as Harris stood nearby. “Not just her but all of the presidential candidates.” Iowans have long taken their responsibility seriously as the first state to hold a Democratic nominating contest every presidential election. Elementary schools teach children about the complicated caucus process, instilling in many of them a sense of democratic duty, said Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of the Polk County Democrats. “It is ingrained in you, as an Iowan, that one of your roles in America is to vet and screen and vote for presidential candidates,” he said. But a year out from the 2020 Iowa caucuses, many feel an even higher sense of obligation to make sure they put the correct candidate on track in the presidential primaries, peppering candidates — including Harris, Warren and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) — with questions that can border on the uncomfortable. “The whole country is depending on us to have smart, wide-open conversations,” said Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic Party chair. Regardless of the various shifts in the primary process, the state’s influence remains indisputable. Every Democrat to take first in Iowa has gone on to win the primaries after 1992, when an Iowa native, Tom Harkin, bested an Arkansas governor named Bill Clinton at the caucuses. The stakes are also more than clear with a wide-open Democratic field and growing ideological fissures in the party, not to mention President Donald Trump. Democrats around Iowa appear to understand the urgency of the moment as well. Bagniewski said he recently helped set up a last-minute event for another presidential candidate, Gillibrand, and 50 to 60 people were expected to attend, but about 300 showed up.

This weekend, it was Harris’ turn to cycle through Iowa, and crowds once again turned out in droves for her first full tour around the state. According to one of her aides, 760 people braved the cold to watch her speak in Ankeny on Saturday ― so many that the organizers had to rush out more chairs as the event began. The next day, 750 showed up in freezing temperatures to watch her speak in Bettendorf. Early polls of likely Iowa caucusgoers have placed her far ahead of Gillibrand and roughly in the top tier with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Some who attended the events, like 20-year-old Jordan Milligan of Upper Iowa University, have already decided Harris is their candidate. “She’s the one,” he said. But many other attendees were undecided, there more to vet than to cheer. That even included some who attended the gatherings in Harris T-shirts, like Justin Comstock, a self-employed 43-year-old who said he was “window shopping” last Saturday. “I’m coming into it with an open mind and expecting to see if the hype’s there or not,” said Comstock, who said he’s also intrigued by Klobuchar. “We’ll probably go see everyone,” said Jim Woods, 67, who spent 25 years at the Davenport Fire Department before becoming a teacher. “This is Iowa. They just come through.” As much as Iowa Democrats have high expectations of themselves to pick the right contender, they expect even more of their candidates. Like Reyes, many Iowans take pride in their willingness to ask tough questions, said Jeff Link, one of the state’s top Democratic strategists. That isn’t exactly new. He still remembers riding around the state with then–Vice President Al Gore as his state director during the 2000 presidential election. “It was just mind-boggling the kinds of questions he would get,” Link said. “They’re not just going to ask about corn.”

Some of the questions thrown at Harris were light, like the man in Ankeny who preceded his question by telling her he also puts hot sauce on his greens, and she received loud applause for her shots at Trump (“The first thing is to not conduct trade policy through tweets,” goes one well-practiced line) and for toeing the Democratic line by pushing for universal background checks for gun sales, free college, “Medicare for all” and her proposed LIFT Act, which would hand middle-class households up to $500 per month. But over the course of the weekend, she also fielded pointed questions on topics such as Puerto Rico, agricultural technology, foreign policy and the environment. In Ankeny, a young man asked whether she would support abolishing the Senate filibuster, adding, “Just give me a really articulated defense on wherever you come down on that issue.” “That’s a great question!” Harris replied, before joking, “Let’s change the subject!” (She then said she felt conflicted on the issue.) In Bettendorf, a man in the crowd wanted to know where she stood on Israeli-Palestinian relations and whether she would release off-the-record comments she made to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee last year. When she didn’t answer the AIPAC part of the question, he yelled it out again, leading her to say, “Sure,” while the microphone was away from her mouth. (Her team later released a transcript to HuffPost.) Even an opening question from a young girl named Nora, who was sporting a “Future president” T-shirt, proved far from a softball, as she asked Harris how she would deal with the $22 trillion national debt. “It’s like not being invited to a birthday party but still having to bring a gift,” the young woman said. The last time Harris touched down in Iowa, in January, one of her answers to a question led to a small national controversy, when she suggested at a CNN town hall that she supported eliminating private health insurance. (A spokesperson said a day later that she is open to more moderate health insurance fixes as well.) This time around, she impressed many of the people who spoke to HuffPost. “She’s done her homework,” said Mary Campos, 89, a co-president of the Brown and Black Presidential Forum. “She’s ready to answer questions.” Richard Lynch, 51, said he supported Sanders in 2016. While he said that Harris “sidestepped” some of the questions she was asked, he added that he welcomed all candidates moving into Sanders’ space. Asked if he believed Harris had done that, he cited her support of “Medicare for all,” saying, “It sounds to me like the answer is, yes, she’s moving into the space he created, and frankly, I’m not sure it should be his space, per se.”

By Andy Sullivan

(Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller and other U.S. prosecutors have been investigating whether President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign conspired with Russia and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia interfered in the presidential election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States and damage the Republican Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Russia denies it. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction of justice.

Here are some key figures in the investigation.

DONALD TRUMP JR.

Trump's eldest son set up a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and other Russians who had offered damaging information on Clinton. In an email after being promised the Clinton ""dirt,"" Trump Jr. wrote ""I love it."" When news of the meeting broke in July 2017, Trump Jr. issued a statement saying the meeting was set up to discuss adoption policy, not politics, before later admitting he had been expecting intelligence on Clinton.

President Trump's advisers eventually said the president dictated the misleading statement put out in his son's name, after initially denying his involvement.

JARED KUSHNER

Trump's son-in-law has served as a senior adviser to him as both candidate and president. Kushner initially did not list any Russian contacts on his application for a White House security clearance, but subsequently revised those forms to reveal he had participated in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and discussed setting up a secure communications line at the Russian Embassy in Washington after Trump won the November 2016 election with Sergei Kislyak, then-Russian ambassador to the United States.

JEFF SESSIONS

Sessions, a longtime U.S. senator from Alabama, served as a campaign adviser and then Trump's first attorney general. During his Senate confirmation hearings he said he did not meet with Russian officials during the campaign, but later admitted he had met at least twice with Kislyak. Under pressure, he recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, which at the time was led by the FBI and later by Mueller. The recusal angered Trump, who eventually fired Sessions in November 2018.

MICHAEL FLYNN

A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, Flynn was a top campaign adviser and served as Trump's first national security adviser until he was fired after only weeks on the job for lying about his conversations with Kislyak in December 2017, after Trump won the election but before he took office. Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia and asked the ambassador for help with a U.N. vote, according to court filings. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and has been cooperating with investigators.

Before he joined Trump's campaign, Flynn sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Moscow dinner in December 2015 celebrating RT, a pro-Kremlin Russian-owned English language media channel.

PAUL MANAFORT

Manafort served on Trump's campaign from March to August 2016, including three months as chairman, ensuring Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination during the party's convention in Cleveland. During that time, the Republican Party softened its support for arming U.S. allies in Ukraine.

He participated in the Trump Tower meeting with Russians who offered damaging information on Clinton.

Manafort's lawyers said that after the convention he shared election polling data and discussed a way to end the Ukraine conflict with Russian Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business associate who Mueller's team has called an agent of the Kremlin.

Manafort faces decades in prison for crimes relating to his work earning millions of dollars as a political consultant and lobbyist for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. He was found guilty of bank and tax fraud and has pleaded guilty to separate lobbying violations. A judge ruled on Feb. 13 that Manafort violated his plea agreement with prosecutors by repeatedly lying to Mueller's team.

RICK GATES

Manafort's longtime lobbying associate served as deputy campaign chairman and worked on the transition after Trump was elected. Gates pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and was a star witness in Manafort's 2018 trial, testifying that he helped his boss file false tax returns and hide millions of dollars offshore. Gates has continued to cooperate with the investigation, according to court filings.",A scorecard of key players in U.S. special counsel Russia probe,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/scorecard-key-players-u-special-counsel-russia-probe-180655001.html

Prospective candidate Sen. Kamala Harris is among the top targets. | AP Photo/Elise Amendola 2020 Elections Top Democrats want 2020 candidates to sign non-aggression pact Early state chairs lead effort to lay out norms and rules Democratic presidential campaigns should follow with regard to disinformation tactics.

Democratic Party chairs in the four early presidential states are working to convince the 2020 presidential candidates to avoid waging social media disinformation warfare against each other.

The effort began this week with a letter to state party chairs across the country broadly laying out the issue with an ultimate goal of establishing what amounts to a non-aggression pact, according to a copy of the letter obtained by POLITICO.

Story Continued Below

“We would like your support in recommending the ASDC [Association of State Democratic Committees] work towards developing a collaborative approach to battling disinformation, illicit campaign tactics, bots, trollfarms, fake accounts, altered text, audio, and video, any and all inauthentic speech in our Presidential Primary process,"" wrote the four chairs, including New Hampshire's Ray Buckley, Iowa's Troy Price, South Carolina's Trav Robertson and Nevada's William McCurdy.

""The Association of State Democratic Committees, the Democratic National Committee and the Presidential campaigns can and must work together in preventing the pollution of our discourse.""

The letter continues: ""Further, we want the campaigns to commit to report illicit activity they uncover to social media platforms, and when necessary, to law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.""

The letter marks a significant attempt to shape the tactics and tenor of political discourse as the Democratic primary plays out on digital platforms. The intent is to forge an agreement laying out norms and rules the campaigns should follow with regard to disinformation tactics and cybersecurity.

Collectively, the four early state chairs — in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — play an outsized role in the presidential primary campaign. They hold considerable political clout with the campaigns, which are attempting to build followings and curry favor in each of those states.

Last week, POLITICO reported a widespread disinformation campaign targeting 2020 candidates is already underway on social media. An analysis of Twitter data showed the main targets over a 30-day period appeared to be Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), four of the most prominent announced or prospective candidates for president.

The campaign included fake, racist and sexist memes targeting the candidates over various social media platforms, some of it designed to divide and sow chaos within the party.

The move this week by the early state chairs aims to spur a broader discussion among the 2020 contenders about the issue, and to convince them to refrain from targeting one another in similar ways. The goal is to have 2020 campaigns agree to forego illicit online campaign tactics like those used against Democrats in the 2016 presidential campaign, including the use of fake social media accounts, the spread of disinformation, hacking and the use of hacked materials.

There’s also discussion about candidates calling out supporters for taking part in that activity.

Mary Mancini, state chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party, said she received the letter and welcomed the discussion. She added that she hopes any pact would go beyond just 2020 presidential campaigns.

“I think that’s a critical problem in our country and just another way that our voting rates, the franchise, gets polluted and corrupted,” Mancini said. “It’s just one in a long list of issues that negatively affect people who are trying to vote.”

Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said he and other party chairs have discussed a variety of ways to avoid the use of illicit tactics by the 2020 campaigns.

“I think after what happened in 2016 and what we saw of the foreign state actors play in the race, we want to make sure our process is as fair and transparent as possible,” Price said. “We’re wanting to make sure the primary is really, truly a conversation about the values of our country. We want to make sure that continues to be the case throughout the primary.”

Simon Rosenberg, who ran the campaign to counter disinformation for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2018 midterms, has led the call for the pact among the 2020 campaigns and the Democratic National Committee. Rosenberg noted that political parties in Europe recently agreed to such a non-aggression pact with regard to disinformation warfare.

“If we know the campaigns aren’t doing it, it’s going to be much easier to find it and make it go away. If this becomes widespread, it will become truly impossible to root out what’s coming from foreign powers,” Rosenberg said in an interview.

“There’s something bigger than all of us here, and that’s our democracy. Democrats should make a clear stand, understanding that if we don’t set clear norms and rules soon, we could see a proliferation of this illicit tactics that could do permanent and lasting harm to our democracy and other democracies throughout the world.”

274,Empty,2019-02-27T01:03:36Z,Remember when Republicans frequently mounted their high horses to gallop into war against what they said was an imperial President Obama?: Our view,"Remember when they frequently mounted their high horses to gallop into war against what they said was an imperial Obama presidency?: Our view

Not long ago Republican senators could be counted on for thunderous speeches and scathing statements condemning an imperial and lawless president.

Arkansas' two Republican Senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman accused the president of ""unprecedented executive overreach"" when his administration offered government support for a wind farm in their state.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, irked over an executive order on immigration, took to mocking the president in a speech that quoted the Roman senator Cicero: ""How long is that madness of yours still to mock us?"" Cruz demanded. ""When is there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now?""

Today, however, many of those same senators have lost their sense of outrage. Their efforts to stand against presidential overreach have been muted. Their principled statements in defense of Congress as a coequal branch have been forgotten. Their high principles, their keen sense of right, their proud defense of democracy — well, never mind all that.

What prompted this abrupt and jaw-dropping reversal is the simple fact that a Republican president, Donald Trump, has succeeded a Democratic one, Barack Obama.

As early as this week or next, the Senate is expected to vote on a plan to block President Trump's declaration of a national emergency to fund his border wall (the one Mexico was supposed to pay for.) That declaration is far more of an abuse of power than any committed by Obama, including his sweeping action granting protection from deportation to roughly a third of all undocumented immigrants. That order, which went by the acronym of DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents), was quite rightly struck down in court.

Trump's move runs roughshod over Congress' power of the purse. Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to decide how and where federal tax dollars are spent. Trump's emergency declaration takes federal tax dollars for military construction and other purposes and retargets them at Trump's border wall, a priority Congress has declined to fund at anything like the level Trump demands.

So far, four Republican senators have said they would vote to block the president's power grab. One of them, Rand Paul, of Kentucky, says that at least 10 would eventually. If so, that would be a far stronger showing than the mere 13 of the 197 Republicans in the House of Representatives who already voted to block Trump.

Regardless of the stronger showing of backbone among Republican senators, their votes are not expected to be enough to override Trump's certain veto. A strong showing by Republican senators will be a rebuke to the president and hopefully a sign of things to come if the president continues to defy constitutional norms.

But the fact remains than the overwhelming majority of Republicans are likely to cave. They can't help it. They are afraid of Trump.

If a future Democratic president declares an emergency on gun control or climate change, it will be hard for these Republicans to take principled stands without invoking laughter. On that day, it will be clear that when Republicans sided with Trump, after mounting such a stink about Obama, they not only wounded their party, they undermined their country and the Constitution.

275,Empty,2019-03-02T19:05:43Z,"The Ohio Democrat is recruiting staff, has his family on board, and still doesn’t think any Democrat can talk to workers the way he can. View Entire Post ›","FLORENCE, South Carolina — Sen. Sherrod Brown is not impressed with his potential 2020 rivals’ efforts to amplify a pro-worker message and said Saturday that he’s been identifying staff in early-voting states to help him scale up quickly if he launches a presidential campaign later this month.

The Ohio Democrat, completing his Dignity of Work listening tour in the state that holds the first primary in the South, also told BuzzFeed News his family is “absolutely on board” with a run.

“There’s no hold-up,” said Brown, who set a March deadline for deciding. “There’s just sort of crossing every ‘t’ and dotting every ‘i’ and deciding, are we willing to do all this in this race?”

Brown had said previously that his decision would hinge in part on whether other Democrats were making proper overtures to working-class voters. In recent weeks, at least three announced candidates — Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — have echoed Brown’s dignity of work message.

“It has surprised us that this many people, including Republicans — that this many people have begun to talk about the dignity of work,” Brown told BuzzFeed News in an interview. “I don’t think they flesh it out well enough yet or extensively enough. I think they mean it. I don’t mean there’s any insincerity in it. But I think we can’t do it enough.”

So does he still believe he’s the best messenger on those issues?

“I think, yes, I carry it better than anybody else because it’s who I am,” Brown added, “and it’s my career, and nobody can question my authenticity or my genuine feel for this.”

The two-day South Carolina trip was the last on his initial foray into the first four primary and caucus states. As during previous visits to Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, a social media team closely circled the senator and the people he met, gathering footage that works not only for Twitter and Instagram but, theoretically, would fit seamlessly into any campaign announcement video. (“I’m Teresa Harper, and I believe in the dignity of work.”)

Brown confirmed to BuzzFeed News that he has been recruiting staff nationally and in these early states. He wouldn’t disclose names of prospective hires but said he’s “totally confident” he’d be able to activate a professional operation on day one, between his existing team of longtime loyalists and new people.

“We knew that if we decided yes that we’d have to have people in place or about to be in place from organizing to fundraising to field to communications,” he said.

He announced previously that Sarah Benzing, his Senate chief of staff, would be his national campaign manager and mentioned how his 2018 reelection campaign manager — Justin Barasky, a veteran of Priorities USA, an organization that backed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign — will remain close to the political operation.

“If we get in,” Brown said, “we’ll run the best campaign.”

South Carolina is a state that could be pivotal to Joe Biden’s chances if the former vice president decides to run. He remains well-liked in the state, and many activists here compare him to Brown because of their similar appeal to working-class voters. Asked by a reporter Friday evening if Biden’s plans had any impact on his own, Brown replied bluntly.

“Zero,” he said, before lightening the mood.

“Between slim and none and slim left town, I don’t know? That’s not my original line.”

His latest trip offered Brown encouragement, but also evidence of a mid- to lower-tier candidate who will need some breaks to break out in a large field of Democrats. An event Friday evening at a hotel in downtown Florence had both. The city’s mayor, Stephen Wukela, enthusiastically endorsed Brown. But about half the crowd was a boys tennis team from North Carolina that had its match rained out and had nothing else better to do. (Some of their teammates were trapped in a malfunctioning hotel elevator while Brown held his meet-and-greet.)

“Listen, I support Sen. Brown,” said Wukela — whose father, like Brown — grew up in Mansfield, Ohio. “I hope he decides to run for president, and I know if he does, he’ll be elected. Sherrod’s my favorite. He is a product of the same kind of politics that I’m a part of, which is Midwest liberalism. It’s a liberalism that is founded in economic issues rather than, frankly, issues of identity.”

Saturday’s agenda brought a breakfast stop at a crowded Florence diner — “Who’s the man in the suit? Is he running for president?” — and a Women’s History Month luncheon speech to the Democratic Women’s Council of Darlington County in Hartsville. Later Saturday, Brown and Booker both spoke at an oyster roast put on by the Dorchester County Democrats in Summerville.

There are signs that Brown is making inroads with the Democratic organizers he meets. Earlier Friday, he attended a house party in Columbia hosted by prominent Democratic activists Don and Carol Fowler. Their home was packed during a torrential afternoon downpour. Don Fowler, a former state party chair and Democratic National Committee national chair, said afterward that he and his wife also have hosted Klobuchar, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, but that Brown had the best connection with his guests.

“This crowd in this weather in the middle of the day is really something,” Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, who is evaluating all of the candidates in anticipation of issuing a potentially influential endorsement, told BuzzFeed News outside the Fowler home. “This is a strong crowd.”

Benjamin said he was impressed with Brown and his wife, nationally syndicated columnist Connie Schultz, as a team.

“He and his wife are a power couple,” the mayor said. “They connect well. A policy wonk with good working-class roots and connections and just has the ability to communicate with every man and woman.”

Schultz continues to show she’s ready to play a big part in a presidential campaign. She introduced her husband at several events this weekend, sticking to a stump speech she has honed carefully over the last month. Brown on Saturday laughed when recalling how his wife used to joke how much she loved being married to the only senator who didn’t look into the mirror every morning and see a president smiling back.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's crusade to take on the Washington establishment is now a comic book specially crafted for the cross section of comic fans and political junkies. Alexandria Cortez and the Freshman Force: New Party Who Dis, out May 15 from Devil’s Due comics, features the stories of AOC and other progressive women shaking up the halls of Congress, created by dozens of artists from across the country.

“The stories run the gamut from cute and sweet, to cathartic venting stories, to just irreverent fun plots, all with the general theme that this is a pro-AOC, pro-new Congress project,” Devil’s Due publisher Josh Blaylock told VICE. As of yet, there's no over-aching plot the stories build toward, but each give their own interpretation of this current moment in politics. In a page given to TMZ, AOC is a super-jacked wrestler who defeats her former Democratic opponent Joe Crowley in the ring and then bumps into an even-more-jacked Nancy Pelosi with a six-pack in the locker room.

Ocasio-Cortez wasn't involved in making the book, but when TMZ tracked her down in the halls of Congress on Wednesday to get her take she said, ""It’s an honor people would put so much of their time and talent into that all on their own. I’m especially honored that they’re donating the proceeds to Raices Texas [a non-profit that provides legal services to immigrants and refugees] for immigration protections. So that part of the project, if it can benefit communities that need it, that’s really amazing."" When asked what she thought about being a wrestler in one of the stories she said, ""I’m just a normal person doing her best. If I can be that for a little girl somewhere where she can see herself being a superhero, I think that’s important for all of us to see we all have a super hero inside of us.""





The comic's subtitle, ""New Party Who Dis,"" is from an AOC tweet she sent in January responding to old-school former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman, who told Fox Business he “hopes she’s not the future” of the party.

""That was an awesome lightning-in-a-bottle moment,” Blaylock said. ""It was hilarious to see Joe Lieberman, a perfect example of this tired old outdated system, commenting on the future, and Ocasio-Cortez with such a millennial response."" But what really “lit a fire” under Blaylock to work on this project was a tweet from AOC in which she quotes the popular Watchmen graphic novel, sending comic fans into a frenzy. The tweet was in response to a quote tweet that linked back to a Politico article with the headline ""Exasperated Democrats Try To Reign In Ocasio-Cortez."" She wrote: To quote Alan Moore: ""None of you understand. I’m not locked up in here with YOU. You’re locked up in here with ME.”

""When I saw her Alan Moore quote, on top of her jumping into a feed of a guy playing Donkey Kong 64 to talk about trans rights, and seeing that she’s a League of Legends fan, I thought there’s too much nerd press going on here,"" Blaylock said. ""If we don’t do this right now somebody else is going to beat us to it.""

Blaylock got the book on the radar of comic book stores just in time for a May release and started calling up dozens of friends in the comic world. ""The response was immediately great. We have a great diverse group of talent,"" he said. ""We have people from all over the country, and I’m excited to see everything coming in."" Contributing artists are also some of the biggest heavy-weights in the industry, like Jill Thompson, known for her work on Wonder Woman comics, and Tim Seeley, whose working on G.I. Joe and Transformers comics.

The comic, which according to the website is printed on recycled unpaid medical bills, features witty references and hot takes on a cast of political characters, from entrenched players like Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, and Mitch McConnell, to Ocasio-Cortez’s fellow wave-makers Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts's first black congresswoman, Kyrsten Sinema, the first openly bisexual Senator, and Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, the first Muslim women elected to Congress. The first two Native American congresswomen, Sharice Davids and Debra Haaland, are also part of the ""Freshman Force."" It's currently a one-off project with two different cover image options, one where AOC rocks a superwoman-esque 'fit tackling an elephant to the ground, and another where she hits the same moves in a power suit.



The book is meant to capture the excitement of those ready for a change of guard in Congress. “I feel like we’re having an intervention, like someone sitting a family member down saying, ‘Look we have a problem and we need to fix it right now. There’s no more tip toeing around these issues,’” Blaylock said.

“There are so many issues that so many of us have wanted to see addressed that have been completely ignored by all politicians it seems,"" added Blaylock. ""And now to have 100 people in there—obviously we haven’t heard from all of them—but just to see such a good mix of representation and hear conversations happening now about topics we’re really all concerned with, I like to say it’s been a jolt of smelling salts to a comatose system.”

Michael Cohen on Wednesday delivered a sharp warning to Donald Trump and the Republican party that the president faces legal and political peril on at least two fronts.

First, the Trump-Russia investigation.

Cohen became the first Trump associate to allege that, in 2016, Trump knew in advance that his eldest son, Donald Jr, was meeting Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton – and that WikiLeaks would be releasing emails stolen from Democrats by Russian operatives.

Moreover, Cohen hinted that Robert Mueller, the special counsel currently wrapping up a two-year inquiry into whether Trump’s team coordinated with Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, may have proof.

Cohen was asked by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Democrat forced to resign as party chairwoman over the WikiLeaks disclosures, how they could corroborate his explosive allegations, which are based on remarks he says he overheard in Trump’s office.

“I suspect that the special counsel’s office and other government agencies have the information you’re seeking,” Cohen said. Trump denied both allegations in his written answers to questions from Mueller.

Cohen also reiterated that Trump lied repeatedly to the American public during the 2016 campaign by saying he had no dealings with Russia. In fact, Cohen has told prosecutors, Trump was keenly pursuing a lucrative tower in Moscow until June 2016.

Trump’s former fixer cautioned that he could not prove the “collusion” with Moscow that the president vehemently denies. Still there was, Cohen said, “something odd” about the affectionate back-and-forth Trump had with Vladimir Putin in public remarks over the years.

“There are just so many dots that seem to lead in the same direction,” he said.





Michael Cohen was a lawyer for Donald Trump from 2006 until 2018. He was a vice-president of The Trump Organization, and was part of Trump’s campaign team for the 2016 presidential election. Considered a close friend and confidant of the US president, Cohen faced criminal charges for his work for Trump.

In August 2018 Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud, admitting that on the eve of the 2016 presidential election he made a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, and arranged for a $150,000 payment to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal.

Cohen also admitted lying during campaign about a Trump property deal in Russia. He is one of of five of Trump’s presidential aides to have been found to have broken the law.

He was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2018, and was also ordered to pay nearly $2m in fines and restitution requirements.

Having previously described himself as “the guy who would take a bullet for the president”, when sentenced, Cohen said “I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired. I know now, in fact, there is little to be admired.”

The 52 year old is married with two children, and has, over the years flipped between being a member of both the Democrats and the Republicans. He is expected to report to jail in May 2019.

Martin Belam









The extent to which Mueller’s findings will be made public is unclear. Justice department policy is that a sitting president may not be charged with crimes. But Democrats have vowed to get their hands on the full report – and launch impeachment proceedings if necessary.

Second, Cohen continues to implicate Trump in a criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws – and on Wednesday dragged Donald Jr in as well.

Cohen released copies of cheques signed by both Trumps that, he said, were reimbursements for payments he made to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a pornographic actor who alleged she had an affair with Trump.

Federal prosecutors in New York allege the payments amounted to an illegal scheme, using undisclosed funds to protect Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen, who is due to go to prison in May for three years, pleaded guilty to involvement in the scheme – and alleged that Trump directed him to commit the campaign finance crime.",Cohen's explosive allegations suggest danger for Trump on two fronts,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/cohen-apos-explosive-allegations-suggest-183909245.html

Not only is Ocasio-Cortez facing a lot of pushback from Republicans and some Democrats, she’s even being criticized by people who are actually further left than she is.

According to Green Party member Howie Hawkins, Ocasio-Cortez didn’t even come up with the idea of the Green New Deal. In an interview with the New Republic, Hawkins said, “I’m the original Green New Dealer.” Dario Hunter, another party member, accused the freshman congresswoman of severely watering down the language of the proposal, saying, ""It pales in comparison to ours.”

I’m like, “Man, I do do a lot of Instagram stories, but I don’t remember doing that.” But it speaks so much to the work that we still have to do when it comes to women’s rights. When the president says that he has sexually assaulted women, they just shrug their shoulders, but when there’s a rumor that a woman may have had the audacity to take a photo of herself, they’re up in arms. I’d like to say ‘Don’t respond to it,’ but we cannot pretend that these far-right outlets are not driving some of the most subversive and destructive narratives, and we cannot pretend like those narratives have not gained steam. They have hijacked the presidency.

And the political conversation.

Exactly. And so I may not want to respond to it. We may not like the fact that these things that were not worth our time 10 years ago are worth our time now, given the subversive power they’ve built. But I think that they are worth a response.

In your ability to galvanize your supporters through social media, you have been compared to Donald Trump.

Well, I think that there’s this rush to make that comparison, but any time media fundamentally changes, the first movers to recognize that change — and to learn it and to adapt to it — tend to have that first-move advantage. So this is less about personality, less about Trump, and more about who has had the first-mover advantage. But there are similarities. People who succeed in social media follow similar tenets. In order to resonate with people, you have to tell them what you mean, you have to be willing to make mistakes, you have to be willing to be vulnerable and learn as you go.

You originally wanted to be an OB-GYN. Why did you make the switch?

I had spent time living in West Africa while I was an undergrad, helping midwives deliver babies in the Sahara, and I contracted malaria while I was there. In the developing world, malaria is an economic disease. It’s a disease that impacts so many people as to be actually impacting national GDP, so I started thinking about these health issues as more macro-economic public-policy issues.

But I was personally impacted when my father passed away in the heat of the financial crisis, and I graduated college and was waitressing. The thing that people don’t understand about restaurants is that they’re one of the most political environments. You’re shoulder-to-shoulder with immigrants. You’re at one of the nexuses of income inequality. Your hourly wage is even less than the minimum wage. You’re working for tips. You’re getting sexually harassed. You see how our food is processed and handled. You see how the prices of things change. It was a very galvanizing political experience for me.

When you quit your waitressing job, what did you tell your boss? Were you like, “I’m quitting because I’m gonna be in Congress”?

Yeah, I was keeping mum about my campaign for a long time but…

You were doing double duty.

Oh, yeah, probably a whole year, at least. Some of the people that I worked with knew because they were my friends, and one day the general manager of the restaurant overheard somebody talking about me running, and he came over and said, “Is it true?” I kinda nodded. And he just gave me this big hug and was like, “Let me know what you need.”

You’ve taken the mantle from Pelosi when it comes to absorbing the heat for the Democratic Party. Does it get to you?

I was cracking up because I was actually talking to a Republican House member on the floor, and he’s like, “Are you a communist?” And then he was like, “It’s OK if you are.” And I just started laughing because that is exactly how Fox News wants to go.

But do you court the controversy? Are you trying to engage in a dialogue where you are going toe-to-toe with Trump?

I do think that we’ve been taking it too much. I think we’ve been tolerating the intolerable. And I remember, you know, just being a constituent, like, “Where’s the fight back on some of these issues?” What the president is trying to do is undermine truth itself. Just because I’m pushing back on reporters calling women unlikable doesn’t mean that I think their outlet itself is “fake.” There’s a huge difference between checking a narrative and checking an actual institution. That’s how you get climate deniers being treated just as seriously as venerable scientists.

So when it comes to welcoming [controversy], I think it’s fine. Frankly, part of change is conflict. And I told this to other members too: If they want to direct their firepower to me, then whatever. I’m in a very blue district. Better me than someone else. For the most part, it doesn’t bother me. The last 24 hours have gotten to me because their hysteria is now getting manifested in sexism and bigotry. That’s where I will fight back.

Would you vote to impeach Trump?

Yeah. No question. No question. I don’t even know why it’s controversial. I mean, OK, it’s not that I don’t know why it’s controversial. I understand that some people come from very tough districts where their constituents are torn. But for me and my community in the Bronx and Queens, it’s easy.

Everyone wants it.

Yeah, everyone wants it.

You have only been here about a week or so, but have you had any conversations with Republicans about why they stick by him?

Well, in the Republican Party, there’s a hostage situation going on. There are a lot of Republicans that know what the right thing to do is — not just on impeachment but on a wide range of issues — and they refuse to speak up.

Because it would be political suicide.

Because to them, yeah, they can’t do it. To me, it’s an unacceptable position, because we’re not in the realm of politics anymore. These are not questions of politics. These are questions of society. These are questions of equal treatment. These are questions of civil rights.

Wouldn’t you rather have Republicans in office who know what the right thing is behind closed doors versus those people speaking up and losing their seats to people who are truly in agreement with Trump?

The problem is that if they vote the same way, what does it matter? I don’t care what’s in your heart if how you are voting is the same as someone who is actually racist. At the end of the day, they think that their intentions are gonna save them, but the actual decisions you make matter. I am tired of people saying, “I’m gonna vote the same way as bigots, but I don’t share the ideology of bigots.” Well, you share the action and the agenda of bigots. We need to hold that accountable.

How much of what you’re talking about is trying to move the Overton window [the range of ideas accepted in public discourse] so that Democrats can compete with the way Republicans have moved it?

A huge part of my agenda is to move the Overton window, because it’s a strategic position. I’m a first-term freshman in an institution that works by seniority. Procedurally, it is kind of like high school. You’re the new kid on the block. So, as a freshman, you have to look at the tools available to you, and in my first term, if we have the opportunity to frame the debate, then that is one of the ways to have the most power. If I’m here for four days, then the most powerful thing I can do is to create a national debate on marginal tax rates on the rich.

How much have you hung out with Bernie Sanders since you’ve been here? Have you gone out to get a beer?

Well, we haven’t gotten a beer since I’ve gotten here, but [during my campaign] I was able to pick his brain and ask him for advice.

What was his advice?

One of the functional pieces of advice was just that you spend a lot of time in your committee, so it’s really important to pick a subject that you’re passionate about.

And you just got named to the Financial Services Committee.

Yeah, it’s not official yet, but it’s looking pretty good. That was in my top three picks. It’s a pretty powerful committee in terms of what it can regulate. I’m excited about it.

What would you like to see accomplished in 2019?

What we have to do is redefine what the climate movement is about, and we have to re-define it in the scope of environmental justice. For so long, people have thought of climate-change legislation as saving polar bears, but they don’t think of the pipes in Flint. They don’t think of the air in the Bronx. They don’t think of coal miners getting cancer in West Virginia. When we talk about defining the scope, we have to talk about climate as a social-justice issue, as an economic-justice issue and as an environ-mental issue. We really want to lay some stakes in the ground that say, “If your legislation is not dealing with jobs, if it’s not dealing with infrastructure, if it’s not dealing with bringing justice to frontline communities, then it’s not a Green New Deal.” And we have a majority in the House, so why not swing for the fences?

I hope that works.

I know, me too. Call your representative.

You are my representative! [Laughs]

Yeah, that’s right!

Don’t worry, I’ll be calling. You initially said that you wanted to see more options when it came to House leadership. When and how did that change?

Well, no real options came up. And then I started to see a resistance to then-leader, now-Speaker [Pelosi] coming from the more conservative flank of her party, trying to take this narrative of “Oh, yeah, we need change,” but trying to take this change into a more kind of corporate-sponsored direction. Nancy Pelosi was the most progressive candidate in that field. That, first and foremost, is what I’m going to support.

Do you see common ground?

Absolutely. One thing that is notable about the speaker is that she does believe that the Democratic Party should be a progressive party. She is in the difficult position of having to juggle all of these different wings within the party, but her personal politics are very progressive. I have not found an issue where we are really opposed.

Have you had some one-on-one interactions with her?

Yeah, I have sat down with her several times and emphasized how important climate is to the agenda. She was one of the first Democrats to really push this issue years ago.

Do you worry that she’s been in politics so long that she will be too quick to compromise?

I do think that as a party we compromise too much. I don’t think it’s necessarily all on her, because she can only push as much as she can coalition-build. That’s why I see a special responsibility in my role in kind of shifting the conversation, so that all the members feel a little bit more pressure, because we’re amplifying what voters already feel. I was running in a district that was deep blue, and the representation that we were getting was not as progressive as the actual electorate. When [congresspeople] start feeling more of that conversation coming from their districts, they’ll have more liberty to move, which will then give the speaker more liberty to compromise less and push harder. Especially when it comes to the environment, but also on a wide range of issues.

What would you be willing to compromise on?

I don’t want to compromise where we’re going, but I’m willing to compromise on how we get there. I believe in single-payer health care, so that every American is covered with physical, mental and dental health care that is free of cost. That’s my vision. If I lobby the caucus enough so that our most conservative members fight for a public option, that’s a huge win.

Do you worry about splintering the party, this idea that you’re not just trolling Republicans, you’re also trolling Democrats? You’re doing all kinds of trolling! [Laughs]

Well, I don’t worry about splintering the party, but as I’ve said in the past, we can’t just be a party of the most basic rights. It shouldn’t be a political statement to say we should all be treated equally. The fact that that is partisan upsets me. I believe that both parties need to be on the same page when it comes to racial justice, queer rights, marriage equality, all of it. These should not be partisan issues, they should be universal rights. And so we need to champion those things, but we need to go a lot further. Especially when it comes to expanding our rights to economic dignity.

Many Americans are really worried about the economic state of this country, where people working full-time jobs cannot support their families. It’s astounding to me that this is not seen as a national crisis.

Well, we have never gotten out of desperate situations in this country with a scarcity mindset. We have never austerity’d our way to prosperity, ever. It’s never happened. The only way we got out of the Great Depression is through a massive injection of public investment, and also a massive expansion in public ambition and the idea of what is possible in America. We’re not gonna get out of this through incrementalism. We need moonshots.

What do you think you know that the old guard doesn’t?

One of the things that I bring to the table is a visceral understanding that people under 40 have been shaped by an entirely different set of events. We’ve literally grown up in different Americas. They were shaped by a Cold War America, a post-World War II America; and we are an Iraq War America, a 9/11 America, a hyper-capitalism-has-never-worked-for-us, Great Recession America. People are used to talking about millennials as if we’re teenagers. We’re in our thirties now. We’re raising kids and getting married and having families, and we have mortgages and student-loan debt. It’s important that [Congress is] in touch. People tend to interpret this as me railing against older people and being ageist. But that’s not what this is about. It’s a problem of representation. We don’t have enough intergenerational representation. We largely have one generation. That’s not to say that one generation should be out of power, it’s that others should be here as well.

Do you still have student-loan debt?

Of course I do, yeah! I’m 29 years old.

What’s the last thing that made you really angry? And how do people harness that anger so that we can make it productive?

Especially women. Because we’re not allowed to be angry.

Exactly. Or ugly or fat or opinionated.

Yep. You’re just allowed to be pretty and quiet. And then as a woman of color, too, it’s even more of a stereotype. Where even if you’re not being angry, they’ll attribute anger to you.

Right.

The last time I was pissed was the president’s bullshit border address, watching this guy just be racist from the Oval Office. I saw it as a defilement. In terms of how we channel it, we just take that anger and that energy and use it to say, “This is why we need the moonshot.”

Do you worry that in pushing the Democratic Party more left, you’re only going to polarize the country more?

I think it’s wrong to say that what I’m proposing is polarizing the country. What we are seeing now is a ruling class of corporations and a very small elite that have captured government. The Koch brothers own every Republican in the Senate. They own ’em. They don’t cast a vote unless their sugar daddies tell ’em what to do. But 70 percent of Americans believe in Medicare for all. Ninety percent of Americans believe we need to get money out of politics. Eighty-something [percent] believe that climate change is a real, systemic and urgent problem. Sixty-seven percent of Americans believe that immigrants are a positive force in the United States of America. I believe that I’m fighting for the American consensus.

You told Anderson Cooper you want people to underestimate you because that’s how you won your primary. When is it safe to let that go and unabashedly take charge?

People like to make these disparaging statements, like, “Oh, she’s good at Twitter. Is she gonna be an actual legislator?” I think it’s fine at the outset to be underestimated in that capacity. Where I do tell people to come correct is when they try to paint me as unintelligent, as unsubstantive. That’s when you see me fire back. When you call Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris “unlikable,” that’s an unsubstantial, unsubstantive, fluff, bullshit, misogynistic word to use. Unlikable? What is that? It’s not a policy critique. Paul Ryan was a con man for 10 years, and he was called a wunderkind for policies that were designed to just gut working families dry. But I’m the charlatan. So . . .

You’re 29, and you’re in Congress. Where do you go from here?

I have no idea. I mean, I go where people tell me to go, and I mean, like, the People.

Not just any people.

280,Empty,2019-03-01T17:46:29Z,The 37-year old pastor with little political experience moved to the US after winning the visa lottery in 2003,"In the last two elections, the contest for Nigeria’s presidency has felt like it’s been split into two different races.

While the country’s two dominant parties—the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP)—have won a vast majority of the votes, the country’s several other parties largely scrap to finish third. As Quartz Africa has reported, the dominance of two major parties makes the chance of a “third party” candidate winning the vote very slim.

Yet, even the race of the underdogs threw up a surprise this year with a little-known US-based pastor, Nicholas Felix of the People’s Coalition Party (PCP), finishing third behind the top two parties. The 37-year old pastor is originally from Edo state in southern Nigeria and holds a doctorate degree in divinity from CICA International University and Seminary in New York. He had little political experience when moved to the United States after winning a US visa lottery in 2003 and now leads New York-based church, Miracle Center International.

Felix’s win is both surprising and embarrassing for the much higher profile candidacies of other “third party” aspirants, including Kingsley Moghalu, a former deputy governor of Nigeria’s central bank, Fela Durotoye, a popular motivational speaker and coach and Yele Sowore, activist and publisher of Sahara Reporters. None of them finished in the top seven positions.

For his part, Felix has described his unexpected third place finish as sign of “a progressive adjustment in paradigm” in Nigerian politics.

But most political analysts have a much more plausible theory: voters might have made a mistake.

Given that ballot papers for presidential elections in Nigeria list all the parties fielding candidates (73 in this case) in alphabetical order, Felix’s PCP party was placed just above the leading opposition party PDP (People’s Democratic Party), led by former vice president Atiku Abubakar. Further, the colors of PCP’s party logo are exactly the same as the PDP’s. And with party logos, rather than candidate photos or names listed on the ballot paper, PCP’s conspicuous placement and colors are likely to have been a big factor.

But regardless of how his votes came about, Felix’s “victory” is Pyrrhic, as the elections were the latest reminder of just how much work third party candidates need to do to match the two major parties. One often suggested way to try to do that is for third party candidates to pool resources and form a coalition. It’s a move that has borne some success in the past: the ruling APC was itself formed after a merger of four independent political parties two years before it won the 2015 presidential elections.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have slowed down their offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw more than 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children, approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist redoubt.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped in less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, told AFP that thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali said.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes that Monday's arrivals would be the last one.

""We want it to be over,"" Mazloum, a 29 year-old SDF fighter told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Secret' transfers -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar told AFP on Monday that the SDF will announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

The Observatory on Monday said that 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq over the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied that the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

Fourteen suspected French jihadists were among those transferred, an Iraqi government source told AFP on Monday.

Hisham al-Hashemi, an Iraqi expert with intimate knowledge of the issue, said the transfer had taken place in coordination with the US-led coalition fighting IS.

- Criticism of international response -

The mass outpouring of men, women and children from the IS foothold has overwhelmed the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp, six hours north of Baghouz.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" Omar said.

The International Rescue Committee said Friday that new arrivas had pushed the camp's population to over 45,000, exacerbating already dire conditions at the crammed facility.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, the IRC said.

A warehouse fire on Friday caused by a gas cylinder explosion ""destroyed 200 family tents"" and five larger ones and injured 16 workers, it said.

The UN's humanitarian coordination office OCHA on Friday warned the camp was struggling to keep up with the flood of evacuees.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-144732631.html

SAN FRANCISCO — In a show of force aimed at locking down support in California — an early primary state critical to her 2020 hopes — Sen. Kamala Harris on Tuesday announced the backing of a score of Democratic California statewide officers.

The Harris campaign Tuesday is set to announce the backing of Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, state Secretary of State Alex Padilla, State Treasurer Fiona Ma, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, POLITICO has learned.

Story Continued Below

Harris’ latest endorsements in delegate-rich California, provided to POLITICO, come just weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced his backing of her 2020 bid.

The crowd of endorsements is just the latest in Harris’ aggressive efforts to dominate California, the nation’s most populous state — in which a potential mother lode of delegates is at stake on March 3 in the Super Tuesday early primary. Harris, the former state attorney general, is the only Californian in the 2020 White House race, but Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell — who has family roots in Iowa and has visited the state more than 15 times — has edged closer to a run that he has hinted could be official by the end of April.

Last week, Rep. Ro Khanna, a prominent Democrat from Silicon Valley, announced he would co-chair the 2020 campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

From California’s political ATM, Harris has been scooping up campaign cash in recent weeks at high-dollar fundraisers in Hollywood and the San Francisco Bay Area, but she must also compete with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who have both been highly successful fundraisers in the state, for California donors’ attention. And California is now being crisscrossed by candidates like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was in Silicon Valley last weekend.

Earlier his month, Harris’ team rounded up the endorsements of 20 state Senate Democrats, including Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins.

Along with the endorsements of four California members of Congress — Barbara Lee, Ted Lieu, Nanette Barragan, and Katie Hill — Harris now has the support of 21 of the state Senate’s 28 Democrats, 75 percent of the caucus. Newsom, Lee and labor/civil rights leader Dolores Huerta serve as California co-chairs for Harris’ campaign.

Kounalakis, the former ambassador to Hungary in the Obama administration, and California’s first female lieutenant governor, said in a statement, “Kamala paved the way for women, including myself, to run for elected office, and win. I couldn’t be more enthusiastic for her presidency.”

State Secretary of State Padilla said Harris, the former state AG, “has been out front on the issues that matter, including defending our right to vote, strengthening our nation’s security, and protecting immigrant communities. As president, she will uphold the American dream.”

Political observers said that Harris‘ early efforts to show her dominance in California are aimed at sending a message to other Democrats in the crowded 2020 race about her strength in the nation’s most populous state.

But some, including veteran Democratic strategist Garry South, have said that Harris’ aggressive efforts to rack up a show of support in her home state don’t guarantee her an advantage in the race, even with the early primary.

“The last [Democratic] Californian who ran for president and won the primary was Jerry Brown — in 1976,’’ he said.

Even as a former governor, Brown, who ran for president three times, failed to win the primary in 1980 and 1992. A more crowded Democratic field and lively competition from four other women in the race so far — Warren, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard — will make it even more challenging for Harris, he said.

The class of Democratic governors that swept to victory in three key Midwestern states has some advice for Democratic presidential candidates: Keep it simple. Don’t overpromise.

And most important, don’t ignore their states.

Story Continued Below

Democratic Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania and Tony Evers of Wisconsin aren't known for fiery rhetoric. But in interviews with POLITICO on the sidelines of the National Governors Association’s winter meetings, the three Democrats — all from states President Donald Trump pried out of the Democratic presidential coalition in 2016 — stressed in uncharacteristically pointed language the importance of drilling down on issues that affect people every day, like health care, education and infrastructure, to reassemble a winning Democratic electoral map in 2020.

The governors’ incremental recommendations put them at odds with the ascendant left in the Democratic Party, which is pushing expansive environmental and health care policies like the Green New Deal and “Medicare for All.” But most of all, Whitmer, whose direct “fix the damn roads” campaign slogan helped her to an easy victory in 2018, said 2020 Democrats need to start just by showing their faces in the states that sent Trump to the White House. Hillary Clinton infamously spent little time campaigning in Michigan or Wisconsin after the primaries in 2016.

“What any candidate should do in any race, frankly, is to show up,” Whitmer said. “There’s no special, secret sauce there. It’s about having real conversations with real people, and when you do that you stay tethered to the things that matter. And that’s what people want.”

Wolf, who coasted to a second term in Pennsylvania, said Democrats need to make that face-to-face pitch to rebuild trust in their party.

“I think before anybody starts talking about issues we’ve got a trust problem,” Wolf said, adding: “If I’m 100 percent of where you want me to be on policy but you don’t trust me you won’t support me.”

“People voted in ’16 to blow it up,” Wolf continued. “And it’s up to either party to come back in 2020 with candidates who can convince voters that they can put it back together.”

Evers, the former education superintendent in Wisconsin who beat Republican incumbent Scott Walker by less than 30,000 votes last year, urged fellow Democrats to home in on health care, education, and infrastructure — and not to promise the moon.

“I think the important thing for me is someone that is willing to address those issues in a proactive way but also make people feel comfortable that they can actually accomplish something,” Evers said.

“Treat[ing] people with dignity and respect and not being hard-edged about everything — I think it’s important,” Evers added. “People like their leaders to be reasonable and find common ground.”

Winning back these three Midwestern states, which went Democratic in six straight presidential elections from 1992 to 2012 but flipped to Trump by less than 1 percentage point apiece in 2016, is the clearest path back to the White House for Democrats, though the party will also target some fast-changing states in the South and Southwest.

Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar has made her electoral success in Minnesota a key piece of her campaign, while appealing to white working-class Midwesterners is central to the rationales of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and former Vice President Joe Biden as they consider presidential campaigns.

They would face intense competition from more strident ideologues in the Democratic presidential field, as did the governors now offering their advice to the candidates. Evers was never regarded as the most exciting candidate among eight in his Democratic primary in Wisconsin last year. Whitmer, meanwhile, fielded criticism for being too conservative on health care compared to her opponents for the Democratic nomination in Michigan, and Wolf has forged a relatively low national profile in his fifth year as governor of Pennsylvania, where he has largely stayed out of intraparty policy fights.

But even as their party gears up for an ideological and potentially divisive presidential primary, the governors preached unity among Democrats.

“I don’t think there’s a big fundamental disagreement of what we ought to do,” Wolf said.

Evers noted that health care was a winning issue for Democrats of all stripes in the midterms. “I’d continue that,” Evers said.

Their states have not gotten a huge amount of personal attention from Democratic presidential candidates so far this year, though Klobuchar recently made a stop in Wisconsin. But Whitmer said she will offer as much help as she can to candidates who want to come to her state.

“I’m going to invite every Democratic candidate who wants to come into Michigan, we’ll make sure they've got all the same access to all the same tools and they should show up and talk to people,” Whitmer said. “And that way, the people of Michigan can make a decision based on who they think is really going to show up for them in the White House.”",Midwest governors to 2020 Dems: ‘Show up’,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/midwestern-governors-2020-advice-1189400

From the halls of Congress to the presidential campaign trail, Democratic moderates are beginning to push back against the wave of liberal energy and shoot-the-moon policy ideas that have captured the party’s imagination over the past two months.

They worry that the sweeping proposals and hardball tactics of liberal firebrands could alienate centrist voters in the 2020 election, even as they hold out hope that Democratic primary voters, focused on defeating President Trump, will check the party’s move to the left.

The moderates’ concerns came to a head this week when one of the newest Democratic stars appeared to threaten colleagues who would not toe the liberal line, raising the specter of a fracture in the party between moderates and purists, similar to a long-standing divide in the Republican Party.

At a closed-door meeting of House Democrats on Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said some of her colleagues could find themselves “on a list” of primary election targets, after they voted for a Republican amendment requiring that undocumented immigrants who try to buy guns be reported to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to people in the room who were not authorized to comment publicly.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a co-chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, said he has confronted party leaders about such threats, which have also come from the Justice Democrats, a liberal group that backed Ocasio-Cortez’s primary campaign.

“Being unified means ensuring that Democrats aren’t primary-ing other sitting Democrats,” Gott­heimer said. “Since when is it okay to put you on a Nixonian list? We need to have a big tent in our party or we won’t keep the House or win the White House.”

Some warned that imposing purity tests could lead to a Democratic version of the conservative tea party revolt that transformed the GOP in recent years. That surge has brought Republicans new energy and new voters, but it’s also cost the GOP some congressional races and legislative victories.

Several Democratic presidential candidates, including many of the early entrants, have quickly endorsed sweeping liberal policies, including a Medicare-for-all health plan, a “Green New Deal” to combat climate change, and reparations for African Americans. Recently, however, some prospective candidates have been offering an alternative vision.

Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), who is contemplating a presidential run, said U.S. politics needs to return to a more civil place. He referred to the House Freedom Caucus, a group of purist Republicans that often opposes legislative compromises.

“We don’t have to settle for disgraceful politics. We don’t have to settle for being as terrible as Donald Trump,” Bennet said during a visit to Iowa on Feb. 21. “We don’t have to settle for Freedom Caucus tactics — those guys are tyrants. We don’t have to accept that.”

Liberal Democrats, including many new to Capitol Hill or national politics, argue that the party has been too timid, caving to Republican pressure and failing to inspire voters with calls for sweeping change. The surge of new voters in the midterm elections, they say, shows the excitement and support generated by such proposals.

The centrists counter that liberal ideas and candidates have more power online and among the grass roots than at the ballot box and that the passions will probably fade in coming months, both in Congress and the presidential campaign.

John Anzalone, an Alabama-based Democratic pollster, said the perception that the party’s primary voters are enthusiastically liberal is not based on data.

“There is, without a doubt, a myth that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez somehow represents the narrative of Democratic primary voters in the country,” Anzalone said. “Almost half of them identify themselves as moderates or conservative.”

That appears to be at least somewhat borne out by the midterms, when less-ideological candidates often won when facing purist opponents. Thirty-three of the 40 GOP seats that Democrats picked up were won by candidates who had been endorsed by the moderate NewDem PAC.

A November Gallup poll found a pragmatic streak in the party — 54 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted the party to become “more moderate,” while only 41 percent wanted it to be more liberal. That contrasted with the Republicans and their allies, 57 percent of whom wanted a more conservative party.

The centrists do not necessarily argue that the ideologues are wrong but that purity comes at the price of progress. That lesson, said Matt Bennett, a spokesman for the moderate think tank Third Way, is now on display in the House — which just this week held a blockbuster hearing featuring Trump’s former personal lawyer and passed the first significant gun-control bill in a generation.

“Without the people who flipped seats, there is no Speaker Pelosi, there is no Michael Cohen hearing, there is no background-check bill — there is only misery and Republican rule,” he said. “No one in the Democratic Party should be doing anything to jeopardize those seats. No one.”

For her part, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been treading carefully — sidelining the most sweeping liberal proposals, playing down prospects of a Trump impeachment and scheduling weekly meetings to bring together leaders of the moderate and liberal factions.

Thursday’s meeting threatened to open a new breach. After 26 Democratic moderates joined with Republicans to pass an amendment on a key gun-control bill, Pelosi said they should show more “courage” on politically sensitive votes, according to the people in the room. That struck some as tone deaf, as did Ocasio-Cortez’s comments about primary challenges.

Ocasio-Cortez in a tweet Friday said she was not making threats but warning that the Democratic defectors “were inadvertently making a list of targets for the GOP and for progressive advocates” by voting with Republicans.

The eruption followed weeks of growing tension between wings of the party. Freshmen who were elected on platforms of cleaning up big-money politics and fixing the heath-care system have found themselves voting on, and answering for, a different set of issues, and some are feeling the heat from their constituents.

“A lot of people are complaining and expressing concerns about the Democratic Party being portrayed as socialist, or certain voices being louder than others,” said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who unseated a GOP incumbent in a suburban Minneapolis district.

The new liberal energy in the House is coming from candidates, including Ocasio-Cortez, who captured districts that generally favor Democrats. Some party strategists say liberal activists must recognize that their message would not work in more conservative areas.

“People would be wise to remember that, by definition, we have the House majority because people flipped seats from red to blue,” said Tyler Law, a Democratic consultant who helped direct the party’s communications efforts in 2018. “Seats that went from blue to blue did not deliver the majority.”

The Democratic presidential primary contest, meanwhile, has so far been dominated by candidates pushing sweeping liberal policies. But several prospective candidates have begun warning against an overly aggressive liberal platform.

At a house party last month in Waterloo, Iowa, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who is exploring a run for the White House, was confronted by an activist who demanded that he support Medicare-for-all, rather than his current proposal to lower the age of Medicare eligibility.

Brown said that’s not realistic. “My ideology says universal coverage today — just like yours does — but I want to make people’s lives better,” Brown responded, as he stood near the fireplace in a packed living room. “I know Congress won’t pass Medicare-for-all.”

Over the coming weeks, a second wave of candidates could adopt a line closer to Brown’s. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe have all been preparing campaigns that would promise an ability to win over Trump voters.

Each has been crafting campaign plans based on polling that shows an enormous appetite among Democratic-leaning voters for anyone who can defeat Trump, even if they do not hew to strict liberal policies.

“You can be very progressive, liberal and left and also want to elect people to get things done,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is advising Hickenlooper. “Primary voters are very comfortable holding both of those things at the same time. They don’t see it as either-or.”

In the House, moderates like Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) have been speaking up more about the merits of their approach, which tends to attract smaller audiences on Instagram and Twitter.

“There are a lot of people that suck up a lot of oxygen,” Schrader said. “And then there’s the people that do the work. . . . We’re the ones who actually govern and make things happen. And I think we’re content with that.”",DEMS GAMBLE WITH SHIFT LEFT,The Washington Post,http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/centrist-democrats-push-back-against-partys-liberal-surge/2019/03/01/a6674430-3c38-11e9-a2cd-307b06d0257b_story.html

NATIONAL HARBOR, Maryland—It’s 4 p.m. on Wednesday, the first day of the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference—not exactly a prime speaking slot—but a standing room-only crowd has gathered to hear from freshman Congressman Dan Crenshaw. While we wait for the 34-year-old Texan, who is running late due to a vote in the House, the first person I talk to at the back of the Eastern Shore meeting room is Jacob Foster, an 18-year-old high-school student at Gann Academy outside Boston, who is attending CPAC for the third time in his young life. Foster is something of an endangered species at the conference: a conservative who likes a lot of the policies advanced by President Donald Trump yet doesn’t intend to vote for him in 2020 because of Trump’s character. But Crenshaw gives Foster hope.

“The glaring difference is he’s not facing accusations of sexual assault, he hasn’t had three marriages, he didn’t dodge the Vietnam draft,” Foster says. “On policy issues, there are meaningful differences. On trade, he’s not as quick to use tariffs.”

When Crenshaw arrives, the former Navy SEAL speaks about how to inspire “people back home” to embrace conservative values—personal responsibility, limited government, virtue, liberty—over a culture of outrage. “A society full of people who are easily enraged by every tweet they see, or some news story that comes out—so susceptible to outrage culture, so ready to be offended—it’s not a sustainable society. It’s a society at each other’s throats,” he says. Crenshaw doesn’t mention Trump once. The only politician cited by name is John Adams. The Constitution is “wholly inadequate for any other people but a moral people,” says Crenshaw, paraphrasing the Founding Father. Meanwhile, Trump fixer Michael Cohen is across the Potomac testifying to Congress.

Afterward, Foster says it was a “phenomenal” speech that “gets to the core of the more enduring part of conservatism.” But Trump fans find something to like, too. “Crenshaw is kind of like a more youthful version of Trump,” says 20-year-old Jeremiah Childs, a University of Maine student in a red MAGA cap. “He’s a more family-friendly version of Trump,” he continues, searching for the right comparison. Childs calls Trump critics Mitt Romney and Jeff Flake “dinosaurs” whose day is done in the GOP. But Crenshaw? “He’s young. He’s exciting. He has a great story. Like, Trump’s a billionaire, and he’s the soldier, you know?” Childs says. “It’s two different things that are part of the ethos of the Republican Party. And he also sort of has that pop-culture brand.”

That “pop-culture brand” is something Crenshaw attained last November, when his gracious response to “Saturday Night Live‘s” mockery of his war wound went viral. In just the few months since, he has established himself as one of his party’s most prominent communicators. As comfortable on “Face the Nation” and “Morning Joe” as he is on Fox News, Crenshaw has written op-eds for the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. He might not have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s millions of Twitter followers, but his more than 500,000 total followers make him the most popular Republican House member on Twitter, where his tweets—whether he’s slamming his Democratic colleagues, speaking fluent Spanish in a video supporting the Venezuelan people or humble-bragging about his double ax-throwing skills—are frequently shared and “liked” by thousands or tens of thousands of people.

Crenshaw’s social media stardom and his unlikely path to victory—he had no electoral experience and no money when he upset the Texas GOP establishment on his way to win the Republican nomination in his district in 2018—invite comparison to the Democrats’ most media-savvy new member, @AOC. “She always seems like she’s having a good time, and you get that same impression from Dan,” says conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, host of one of the country’s most popular political podcasts. “He’s an authentic person.”

Crenshaw might be the congressional GOP’s best answer to AOC, but he decidedly doesn’t want to be seen as a Republican version of the 29-year-old New York Democrat, who is “always trying to embrace radicalism,” he told me during a recent interview in his new office on the fourth floor of the Cannon House Office Building. He wants to take his party in a more traditional—not radical—direction. “We have to make conservatism cool and exciting again,” is how he described his mission in politics when I first met him a year ago. “We have to bring back that Reagan optimism.”

Crenshaw’s combination of traditional conservatism and rising popularity put him in an unusual position in Congress. He describes himself as a “plain old conservative”—he supports free trade, wants to reform Medicare and Social Security, and thinks American troops should stay in Afghanistan (where an IED took one of the veteran’s eyes) as long as they’re needed to prevent another 9/11. That puts him at odds with Trump, whom Crenshaw has been unafraid to criticize, going so far as to call his rhetoric “insane” and “hateful” during the 2016 presidential campaign. But Crenshaw is more “Sometimes Trump” than “Never Trump.” He is not pushing for a 2020 Republican primary challenge and is not trying to write off Trump’s wing of the party—hence, his warm reception at CPAC. In fact, Crenshaw has praised the president for his policies on immigration, even recently voting in support of Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall, a move many conservatives opposed.

One type of success in today’s Republican Party involves becoming a Trump booster, like Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, a 36-year-old in his second term who unfailingly defends the president on TV. Crenshaw is showing that it’s not the only way. The mainstream conservative is the House GOP’s one rising star to emerge from the midterms, whereas true Trump nationalists like Corey Stewart, Roy Moore and Kelli Ward have met electoral defeat. Crenshaw is only two months into the job, but he might just offer the possibility that the future of the Republican Party could be more conservative than Trumpist—if he can chart his own course in Washington.

When Crenshaw first grabbed the national spotlight, he seemed to succeed, at least for one night, in his improbable mission to prove that a conservative politician could be cool.

The weekend before the 2018 midterm elections, “Saturday Night Live” comedian Pete Davidson mocked Crenshaw’s physical appearance, saying the wounded veteran’s eye patch made him look like a “hitman in a porno movie.” When “SNL” invited Crenshaw on the show the next week, he agreed and, after ribbing Davidson, provided a rare moment of political unity. “Americans can forgive one another. We can remember what brings us together,” Crenshaw said, before telling viewers to “never forget the sacrifices of veterans past and present, and never forget those we lost on 9/11, heroes like Pete’s father,” a firefighter who died trying to save those trapped in the World Trade Center.

“I thought that he had a lot of maturity and gentleness in his response to it, which seems increasingly rare nowadays,” says Foster, the 18-year-old Trump critic at CPAC, who recently accepted an appointment to attend West Point. “Dan Crenshaw started the week as a punchline and ended it as a star,” the headline of a Washington Post profile declared.

By the time the “SNL” spot aired, Crenshaw had already won. But it had not been an easy road. Although he had worked in politics briefly, as a military legislative assistant for Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, he was still a relative outsider, having taken a medical retirement from the Navy in 2016 and then completed a master’s degree in public policy at Harvard. In the fall of 2017, John Noonan, a Senate aide to Tom Cotton of Arkansas, persuaded Crenshaw to run for a seat that had opened up with the retirement of Representative Ted Poe.

“We were building the plane as we were heading down the runway,” Crenshaw campaign consultant Brendan Steinhauser says of the candidate’s brief GOP primary campaign in Texas’ 2nd Congressional District, home to parts of Houston. With no money for TV ads, Crenshaw relied on digital and earned media. In February 2018, he ran 100 miles through his suburban district to draw attention to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts and his own campaign. He made it to the GOP runoff by 155 votes—his margin over multi-millionaire Kathaleen Wall, a self-styled “female Trump” who spent $6 million of her own money and had the backing of Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Greg Abbott.

“He’s proof that personal story and charisma can overcome just about any amount of money in a primary setting,” says David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. “Voters just liked him.”

In the runoff, Crenshaw’s GOP opponent, state Representative Kevin Roberts, focused on a December 2015 Facebook post in which Crenshaw had blasted candidate-Trump’s proposed ban on all Muslims entering the United States. “Trump’s insane rhetoric is hateful,” Crenshaw had written. “On the one hand you have idiots like Trump, and on the other you have equally ignorant liberals.” In response, Crenshaw emphasized that he had supported Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But he never recanted. He went on to defeat his GOP opponent 70 percent to 30 percent and won the general election by 7 points. In Harris County—part of his district that is increasingly diverse, young and wealthy—Crenshaw ran 12 percentage points ahead of Cruz.

When I asked Crenshaw recently whether he regretted the “idiot” remark or anything else he had said about Trump, he replied: “Do I regret it? I don’t know. That’s not a useful emotion. You know, you learn lessons. That’s a better way to look at life.”

Crenshaw was sworn in as a new member of Congress on January 3 in the midst of the government shutdown. The standoff wasn’t exactly conducive to producing moments of unity like his “SNL” appearance. Nor does Crenshaw seem particularly interested in forging friendships with his young, progressive counterparts. “The new face of the Democratic Party is coming out in favor of [Venezuelan dictator] Nicolás Maduro. It’s anti-Israel,” he says. “And that’s a change. That’s a new normal. These are the ones who get elevated.”

But now that he’s in Washington, Crenshaw has also continued to criticize his own—whether Congressman Steve King of Iowa (“We don’t need guys like that,” Crenshaw told me when asked whether King should leave Congress) or Donald Trump.

Two weeks before he took office, Crenshaw wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post urging the president to reverse his decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from the fight against ISIS in Syria. “I have a background in this. I have experience in this,” Crenshaw told me. “I understand pretty well what the mission is and why it should continue.” Crenshaw also believes, in defiance of Trump, that Congress should take back the authority it ceded long ago to the executive branch to impose tariffs.

But Crenshaw is happy to support the president, or challenge his critics, when the two agree. “He has taken, from what I can see, the same approach that I have taken,” Ben Shapiro says of the congressman. “He’s not going to be in the business of pretending Trump is something he’s not, but he’s also not going to dump on Trump for the sake of a little bit of strange new respect from the left.”

Crenshaw, who has met with Trump once at the White House, greets talk of a potential 2020 Republican primary challenge with a rhetorical shrug. “It’s democracy, so it’s going to be what it’s going to be. Do I have any real thoughts on that and how it turns out? I don’t know,” he says. “I think it’s pretty safe to predict he’ll be our nominee, and I think that’s perfectly fine. We know what we’re getting with the president.” In addition to saying he is “proud to stand with the Trump administration” in support of the Venezuelan people, Crenshaw has been an enthusiastic advocate for Trump’s push to build a wall on the Southern border. In videos on Twitter and in TV appearances, he has made the case for a physical barrier as a common-sense security measure, and has pinned Democratic opposition to the policy on hatred of the president.

But when Trump went so far as to declare a national emergency in February in order to divert military and other funding for border-wall construction, many mainstream conservatives objected. The question was no longer simply about the policy of a border wall but whether the president was flouting the rule of law and setting a dangerous precedent that a future Democratic president could use to his or her own ends. Crenshaw seemed to find himself in a bit of a bind.

In a written statement on February 15, he expressed both hesitation and praise for the emergency declaration. “I share his frustration with the position we are in now,” Crenshaw’s statement said. “While I’m hopeful that this option will start to address the problems at our border, I remain wary of the precedent it sets. This is simply the result of Congress not doing its job.”

Crenshaw’s office declined for a week say how he would vote on a resolution rescinding the national emergency, but the congressman had an answer over the phone this past Monday. “I’ll certainly be voting in favor of the president’s policy,” he said.

Through the emergency declaration, he argues, Trump is merely appropriating additional funds to enforce the federal law prohibiting illegal border crossings. “He’s not changing any laws. He’s not changing any policies. He is simply putting more money towards his faithful execution of the law than was allowed by Congress,” Crenshaw says. He argues that a Democratic president closely following Trump’s precedent wouldn’t be so bad, as long as he or she were only putting more money toward the enforcement of existing laws.

A significant number of conservatives sharply disagree with Crenshaw’s support for the emergency declaration. “The same congressional Republicans who joined me in blasting Pres. Obama’s executive overreach now cry out for a king to usurp legislative powers,” Michigan GOP Congressman Justin Amash wrote on Twitter. “If your faithfulness to the Constitution depends on which party controls the White House, then you are not faithful to it.” When the roll was called in the House to terminate the national emergency declaration, Amash was one of just 13 Republicans to vote for it. Crenshaw was among the 182 Republicans who sided with Trump.

Crenshaw is still getting settled into his new job. He is pleased to have landed assignments on the Homeland Security and Budget committees. He has a fresh coat of navy blue paint on the sparsely decorated walls in his office. He has found a small apartment near Navy Yard and works out at the gym there (he doesn’t want to pay the fee for the members’ gym and says the group that does P90X gets up too early). His wife, Tara, sometimes travels with him to D.C., but they haven’t yet gotten into a rhythm.

Stuck in the minority, Crenshaw seems less intent on passing legislation than being an effective messenger for his party, including trying to convince younger voters that conservatism and Trump aren’t one and the same. “It’s my goal to help them see: Think what you want about him, but please focus on the policies and the general approach to governance we’re taking,” Crenshaw says. It’s a role he is carefully cultivating; none of his social media posts go up without his involvement, he told me.

So far, Crenshaw has managed to earn praise from both Republican Trump loyalists and skeptics in Washington. Andrew Surabian, a former Trump White House official who worked under Steve Bannon, says of Crenshaw: “While he has some views that are different from the president, he has put himself in a position where he is still an ally to the administration on the whole.” Liz Mair, a NeverTrump Republican consultant, says politicians who share Crenshaw’s ideology “struggle to get traction a lot of the time because they just seem like boring, mainstream, conservative Republican dudes,” but Crenshaw “could become a much bigger player in the party if he chooses to.”

As his experience on the national emergency shows, however, it’s not easy taking a middle-ground approach to Trump. The president will surely present Crenshaw with more opportunities to alienate Trump supporters or opponents. And it remains to be seen whether Crenshaw can navigate his first two years in office without turning off voters who backed both him and Beto O’Rourke, Ted Cruz’s Democratic Senate opponent, in 2018.

But the Trump-skeptical conservatives left in the Republican Party don’t seem to have written off Crenshaw because of his support for the emergency declaration. Ben Shapiro, who supports rescinding the emergency, wrote in a text message: “There’s a legitimate difference of opinion on the issue.” At CPAC, Jacob Foster, who also opposed the emergency declaration, told me he thinks Crenshaw was representing his constituents and wouldn’t set such a “dangerous precedent” if he were president.

“I think he’s got an incredible future,” says Shapiro, who would be happy to see Crenshaw launch a presidential campaign before turning 40. “Why the hell not?” he says. “The more good people running in 2024 the better.”

The Republican National Committee has finalized its senior staff for the 2020 election cycle with a focus on disrupting the Democratic presidential primary and continuing to build up the party’s field and digital infrastructure, the party told POLITICO.

“Our team will be working hand-in-glove with the Trump campaign to ensure President Trump is re-elected and to grow our Party in 2020,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement on Friday. The RNC leadership team is a mix of internal promotions, outside hires and people staying in their roles from the 2018 cycle.

Michael Ahrens, the RNC’s rapid response director for the 2018 cycle, who brought a “troll the libs” approach to his work, will be promoted to communications director as the party tries to roil the Democratic presidential primary. Mike Reed, the party's research director last cycle who was heavily involved in Elizabeth Warren's 2012 race as research director for the GOP's Senate committee, will be the RNC's Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications.

The RNC and America Rising PAC have worked together to place full-time video trackers for Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to follow the Democrats vying for the White House. The RNC’s research team, which will be headed by Joe Ascioti, a former assistant research director, is busy creating video libraries and opposition files on every candidate and blasting out potentially damaging snippets.

The RNC’s moves are part of a larger effort to integrate with the Trump reelection campaign instead of operating as totally separate entities. The two groups are combining their field and fundraising efforts under a single banner dubbed Trump Victory, as POLITICO first reported. The RNC said that the combined efforts have already borne fruit in 2019 as they have had four days with small-dollar donations surpassing $1 million through the Trump Make America Great Again Committee (internally referred to by its acronym TMAGAC, which RNC officials pronounce “T-Magic”).

Josh Fisher, the former chief financial officer for Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, will be the party’s CFO for the 2020 cycle with Sarah Robinson continuing her role as finance director. Kevin Zambrano, the new chief digital officer, will lead online fundraising efforts.

In addition to fundraising and grassroots organizing, the party will support the Trump campaign through its data operation, which it has invested more than $250 million in since 2013 and which Democratic National Committee leaders have been trying to match.

Ideas From The Atlantic

Two Views of a Single Presidency, by David Frum

288,Empty,2019-02-25T06:42:23Z,Elections are the hinge connecting social dynamics to India's liberal democratic structures.,"The paradox of the coexistence of democracy and mass poverty is deeper in India than in many other societies. Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

First of all, the institutional design of Indian democracy (parliamentary system, asymmetrical federalism, flexible Constitution amendment) is not “demos-constraining” in that it does not put significant obstacles to the democratic popular will. There are not too many veto points that might account for the failure of floor-securing social policies to be legislated and implemented.

Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

Second, the party system is intensely competitive with very high electoral volatility. The first-past-the-post system accentuates the effect of voters’ volatility into dramatic change in seats and government formation. Though the level of volatility has come down in this decade as compared to the previous one, a ruling party in an Indian state has just about a 50% chance of coming back to power. Parties cannot afford to be complacent and overlook issues that might concern a significant proportion of population.

Third, the state capacity in India is higher than most comparable poor countries; it still commands the force to impose its will and is not crippled by absence of resources to meet some of its key projects. All this makes it even more intriguing that the ruling parties/coalitions should not (be able to) muster adequate political will to carry out anti-poverty policies.

Finally, what makes it truly intriguing is that the poor have not opted out of democratic politics in India, at least not from routine participation in electoral politics.

…

Why elections have gained primacy in Indian democracy

Across countries in terms of the impact of the electoral system, the structure of political choices offered by the party system, the social basis of political preferences, agenda-setting and public opinion formation, the invisible role of issues and ideologies, interests and identities are seen to be the keys to making sense of elections.

Yet we simply assume that elections perform the same role everywhere. The end result of this similarity is that the experience of electoral politics in societies like India is interpreted in the light of the narrow historical experience of Western Europe and North America.

Hence the need to understand the distinctiveness of the Indian experience of elections.

One of the first things that strikes any observer of Indian elections is their centrality in India’s political life. Banners, posters, and crowds fill the streets; massive processions and rallies are a norm; the media is full of election news and every street corner is buzzing with political gossip. Though on a steady decline of late, this kind of visibility in Indian elections symbolises the pivotal role elections have come to play in Indian politics.

If tension between pre-existing social form and borrowed legal-political structure provides the basic frame for understanding Indian democracy, the history of Indian politics is an attempt by millions of ordinary people to write their own political agenda in an alien script.

An election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy.

An encounter such as this, if it is to lead to meaningful outcomes, requires bridges or hinges that connect the two different worlds.

The institution of elections came to perform this crucial role in India. It became the hinge that connected the existing social dynamics to the new political structures of liberal democracy, allowing for reciprocal influence. An election is often the site for a fusion of popular beliefs and political practices with high institutions of governance.

Thus an election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy. This is the moment when the legal-constitutional order of liberal democracy makes contact with the messy social and political reality of India. The “formal” sector is highly visible, it leads a legal-constitutional existence, it involves “civil society” groups and NGOs or a certain segment of political parties, it speaks a familiar modern language, mobilises secular identities and is easy to incorporate into a global register of democracy, even if it draws modest energy and participation.

Every political actor is aware of another “informal” sector, often seen as a source of embarrassment. Political organisations and movements that inhibit this sector speak a homespun hybrid language and fall back upon identity-based mobilisation. Though political practices in this sector lead an invisible, often paralegal, existence below the radar, this sector remains the most happening political site in terms of popular mobilisation and energy. The chasm that separates the two worlds and the absence or non-functioning of the other possible bridges has resulted in the unusual salience of the institution of elections.

This unique role is what accounts for the continued dynamism of the electoral process in India, while a number of other imported institutions and processes are floundering.

A festival of collective identity

Elections in India perform many more functions. For a postcolonial country like India, successful elections are still a symbol of a national political community, something of a festival of collective identity. For the poor and the marginalised, who are excluded from the normal functioning of the state, elections are an affirmation of their citizenship and are seen as a sacred ritual of political equality. Notwithstanding a robust media that routinely uses public opinion polls, elections are still the principal site for the dissemination of political ideas and information and also the only reliable method to gauge public opinion on the big issues facing the country.

Elections force political parties to consider ideas, interests, and entities that do not lend themselves to easy aggregation through instrumentalities of the “organised” sector. Thus, elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections are also an occasion for settling, unsettling or resettling local equations of social dominance and the arena of struggles for social identity and dignity. Elections are a site for contestation for social dominance in a locality, leading to assertion by dominant social groups and protests by subaltern groups.

Attempts by clever political entrepreneurs to manufacture a social majority often involve building a local coalition of castes and communities. This often leads to an invention of community boundaries and sometimes the jerrymandering of settled boundaries. In a micro as well as macro setting, elections are an occasion for distribution and redistribution of resources. This is the time for patronage distribution as well as the occasion for the ordinary citizens to collect their “dues” from the political class.

All this accounts for the festival-like character of the Indian elections and the fierceness with which they are contested here. At the same time, this compression of multiple decisions into a single act also results in an under-emphasis on the representational functions of elections.

Doug Jones could be gifted another unlikely victory.

Moore, 72, a former state judge, made the rounds at last Friday’s Alabama Republican Party dinner gala. A few days later, a new political action committee run by Moore’s son, Caleb Moore, issued an email fundraising appeal.

Republican insiders, including conservative allies of President Trump, fret that Moore — derailed by sexual assault allegations in a 2017 special election that should have been an easy layup — might divide the party in the primary and advance to a rematch with Jones. On Wednesday, a Moore confidant pointedly declined to rule out that his buddy might run for Senate next year.

""That's a good question,” Dean Young, Moore’s close friend and adviser for the past two decades, told the Washington Examiner when asked if the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court was preparing to challenge Jones. ""I'm not at liberty to say anything about that right now.""

If Moore runs, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP campaign arm, would take action to block him from the nomination. Otherwise, the NRSC plans to stay out of the Alabama primary.

[Related: Alabama exploring whether Democratic disinformation cost Roy Moore a Senate seat]

""The NRSC’s official stance is ABRM: anyone but Roy Moore,"" said Kevin McLaughlin, the committee's executive director. ""The only thing Doug Jones and I agree on is that his only prayer for electoral success in 2020 is a rematch with Roy Moore.""

Jones narrowly defeated Moore nearly 15 months ago, earning the right to finish the remainder of the six-year term Republican Jeff Sessions won in 2014. Sessions had resigned to become Trump's first attorney general, a post he has since relinquished.

Rep. Bradley Byrne announced his run for Senate last week, becoming the first Republican to throw his hat into the ring against Jones.

Some conservative activists are hunting for a more Trump-friendly Republican, unhappy with Byrne's ties to the GOP establishment. But like the establishment, many conservatives are desperate to avoid another Moore candidacy. Rep. Mo Brooks, a member of the House Freedom Caucus defeated by Moore in the GOP primary in 2017, could satisfy the concerns. The Huntsville-area congressman is privately exploring another bid, despite public pronouncements to the contrary.

But to avoid the sort of divisive primary that led to his defeat and Moore’s nomination, Brooks would only run if he received Trump's endorsement or a pledge of neutrality. In the 2017 primary, Trump backed Luther Strange, who as Session’s temporary appointed successor was the incumbent and had the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

[Also read: Alabama is already waving goodbye to its 'fluke' Sen. Doug Jones]

""He's very interested in the race,"" a source close to Brooks said. ""He'd be the clear frontrunner."" Moore is a committed social conservative with a fiercely loyal following.

But even in Alabama, among the most pro-Trump states in the country, the former judge has struggled with rank-and-file Republicans uneasy with his brand of religiously infused politics. Moore fell short in GOP primaries for statewide office in the past, before finally winning one — the special Senate primary. He then promptly lost to Jones.

The new PAC launched by Moore’s son, a self-described political consultant, is an example of what worries establishment Republicans, and conservatives, about the judge.

The group is called Conservative States of America — and the graphic logo on an email fundraising appeal passed along to the Washington Examiner by a GOP consultant reads “C.S.A.,” the abbreviation used ubiquitously during the Civil War to refer to the Confederate States of America.

Caleb Moore, in an interview with the Washington Examiner, defended the name of the PAC and the logo. Moore’s son said the group is a multi-candidate PAC that is not affiliated with his father, although he would not rule out running independent expenditure advertising on Roy Moore’s behalf should he run for Senate.

""I don't even think he knows I'm raising money,"" Caleb Moore said of his father. Regarding the name and logo of the PAC, he said: ""People take things that are actually good and turn them into vices.""",Republican nightmare as Judge Moore signals might run again...,Washingtonexaminer.com,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/gop-nightmare-as-alabamas-roy-moore-signals-he-might-run-again

AT CPAC, CONSERVATIVES WARN OF 'RADICAL' DEMS EMBRACING SOCIALISM, TRUMP IMPEACHMENT

“Under the guise of Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal, Democrats are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and stifled the liberties of millions over the past century,” Pence told the CPAC audience outside Washington. “That system is socialism.”

He pointed in particular to the Democratic 2020 presidential candidates, many of whom have backed the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all in some form, and accused them of having “papered over the failed policies of socialism with bumper-sticker slogans and slick social media campaigns.”

“But what they’re actually offering is just more of the same: more taxes, more spending, more government and less freedom,” he said.

The fiery speech by the usually mild-mannered veep is a return to familiar territory for the conservative movement, which spent much of the Obama years warning of the dangers of socialism while calling for limited government.

The recent rise and dominance of a hard-left faction in the Democratic Party has opened the door for conservatives to again sound those warnings -- especially as figures such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have openly embraced the label of “democratic socialism.""

The Green New Deal would seek to eliminate fossil fuels in favor of 100 percent renewable energy, as well as overhaul America’s economy with universal health care, job guarantee programs and other costly items. Meanwhile, a number have called for Medicare-for-all plans, with both Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., not backing away from the idea that their proposals would eliminate private insurance.

Those recent calls have featured prominently in the CPAC summit which lasts through Saturday.

Matt Schlapp, the chairman of CPAC sponsor the American Conservative Union, told Fox News last week that the conference planned to strike a sharp contrast with socialism by focusing on freedom and America's founding principles.

LARRY KUDLOW ROUSES CPAC WITH CALL TO 'PUT SOCIALISM ON TRIAL'

“The Democrats are flirting with this idea that the principles that founded this country are actually rotten and need to be cast aside,” Schlapp said.

Pence urged the CPAC audience to look at Venezuela, currently undergoing an economic and constitutional crisis, as proof of the dangers of the socialist model and said that the Democratic programs would not bring prosperity.

“What Medicare-for-all really means is quality health care for none,” he said. “And the only thing green about the so-called Green New Deal is how much green it’s going to cost taxpayers if these people ever pass it into law.”

""The truth is, we want people to make poor people richer, they want to make rich people poorer. We want to make poverty more rare; they want to make poverty more comfortable,"" he said. ""That’s the choice we face today: between freedom and socialism, between personal responsibility and government dependence.""

Democratic backers of these ambitious programs, however, argue that challenges like climate change and unaffordable health care coverage require bold action by Washington.

“The whole premise of the Green New Deal is that we’re screwed on climate. I’m sorry to break it to you,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a recent Instagram Live video.

But the vice president struck an otherwise positive tone in his speech, hailing the administration’s achievements on the economy, military expenditure and national security, declaring: “America is back and we’re just getting started.”

Perhaps the biggest applause came when he hailed President Trump's efforts to build a wall on the southern border, with Pence promising: ""Before we're done, we're going to build it all.""

This is a week replete with challenges for President Donald Trump.

He faces a second summit with North Korea’s leader, a Democratic challenge to his emergency border declaration and public testimony from a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian election meddling, which could be nearing completion.

Mueller: Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer who has said the president directed him to make illegal hush money payments, is set to testify on what he knows about the 2016 campaign. Border: House Democrats have set a vote for tomorrow on a resolution to block Trump’s emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern U.S. Border with Mexico. The measure will force Republicans to take a stand on whether the president exceeded his authority over federal spending. Summit: The president said yesterday he doesn’t expect to lift sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s regime, as he prepares for a summit with the North Korean leader this week on U.S. demands that Pyongyang end its nuclear program.

Another pressing issue has already been punted. Trump said late yesterday that he’ll extend Friday’s deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, citing “substantial progress” in the latest round of trade talks in Washington.

Global Headlines

Venezuela standoff | U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet opposition leader Juan Guaido in Bogota today and plans to announce new actions against Venezuela that may include forms of economic or diplomatic pressure, according to an administration official. Guaido’s efforts to deliver aid convoys to Venezuela from Colombia this weekend were violently quashed by forces loyal to Nicolas Maduro, but nothing has really changed on the ground. The nation is still hungry, scared and wondering what comes next.

Raising the stakes | Theresa May again put off a final parliamentary ballot on her Brexit agreement, this time until March 12, as she seeks concessions from the European Union. But the delay risks further angering ministers who fear the premier’s strategy is pushing the country to the brink of a catastrophic no-deal departure. They’ll have a chance to force her hand on Wednesday, when lawmakers are due to vote on an amendment to delay Brexit to avoid the economic damage of crashing out.

War and peace | Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War during their summit this week in Vietnam, South Korea said. While the move may help fulfill the U.S. leader's pledge to cease “endless wars,” it also risks undercutting arguments for maintaining the American troop presence on the Korean Peninsula.

Taking a hit | Italian Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio’s Five Star Movement suffered another blow in a regional vote, this time on the island of Sardinia, where exit polls showed the party’s support tumbled. That's bad news for the stability of the alliance with the League because of growing pressure on Di Maio to increase his influence and prove Five Star is getting something out of the governing coalition.

New direction | China’s Politburo laid out a broad outline on how the nation’s more than $40 trillion finance sector should transform itself through supply-side reform – and by further opening up the industry. The government's push to control risk appears to be giving way to a desire to support its economy, as signaled by comments President Xi Jinping made at the gathering of China’s 25 most senior leaders.

What to Watch Today

Nigeria’s electoral commission plans to start announcing state-by-state results from the tight presidential race between the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar.

And finally ... Algerians have been protesting against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to seek a fifth term in elections in April. In response to the peaceful rallies – which started Friday and are the biggest in the North African oil producer in years – the new head of the ruling FLN party, Mourad Bouchared, said God had sent the president, now in his 80s and ailing, to look after the country and reform it. Social media pundits saw the humor and the TweetCommeMouad hashtag appeared.

Ex-Clinton staff…","Mr. Rabin-Havt tried to tamp down long-term financial expectations for the Sanders campaign. “It will be remarkable to emulate those 2015 numbers again,” he said.

Separately, Mr. Sanders said during a town hall-style forum on CNN Monday night that he would release 10 years of tax returns “soon,” suggesting he would provide more transparency into his taxes than he did in 2016 when he only released one year of filings. Mr. Sanders said he did not release more returns then because “I didn’t win the nomination.”

“Our tax returns will bore you to death,” he said. “Nothing special about them.”

Money alone is not determinative in presidential politics. In the 2016 Republican primary, a super PAC supporting Jeb Bush burned through $100 million as Mr. Bush finished no better than fourth in any of the first three states. But money does pay for television ads and field staff, and Mr. Sanders’s fund-raising advantage will allow him to take risks and make investments others cannot afford.

“He can build a ground game not just in the first four primary states but into the Super Tuesday states,” Ms. Psaki said. “He can expand his playing field in places like California.”

The Sanders campaign shared new statistics on its donors so far, which skew younger than is typical. An internal analysis showed more than 108,000 of Mr. Sanders’s first day contributors were 39 years old or younger, and they gave a combined $2.5 million of the $5.9 million raised. The most common age for a Sanders contributor was 30. Relatedly, more than $3 million of the donations that first day came from mobile devices, a sign of both shifting habits and the relative youth of his donor base. The campaign did not provide a breakdown by gender.

Mr. Sanders has closely tracked his fund-raising haul, campaign officials said, and Mr. Rabin-Havt said that the senator wrote much of the campaign’s initial 1,400-word email announcement himself.

The email did not explicitly ask for money, instead directing people to sign a petition supporting Mr. Sanders. Of those who signed, about 40 percent also contributed, his campaign said.","Blows Past $10M Raised, 39% From NEW Donors...",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-10-million.html

However, she has $12 million in the bank left over from her Senate campaign run. | AP Photo/Elise Amendola 2020 Elections Warren creates purity test unseen in modern presidential politics The Massachusetts senator's swearing off of big fundraisers and donor calls puts the rest of the Democratic field in an uncomfortable spot.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s decision to block big donors from having special access to her presidential campaign amounts to voluntary disarmament – a major risk that could send precious dollars to competing campaigns.

But the Warren camp is betting the move to ban donor calls, private donor meetings and high-dollar private fundraisers will elevate her as the principled leader in a crowded primary race, one in which she has issued among the most stringent self-imposed presidential campaign finance restrictions in modern history.

Story Continued Below

“She is an outsider. She is a reformer. She is an anti-corruption candidate, and this is one of many steps she has taken to help cement that in the mind of voters,” a senior Warren aide told POLITICO. “By not doing the traditional big-dollar finance program, she will have a lot more time than other candidates to focus on organizing in the early states and other priorities.”

The self-imposed restrictions will undoubtedly leave money on the table from big donors who've supported Warren in the past.

But they could also help her make the case that she shouldn’t be dismissed as irrelevant or unviable when the first fundraising period closes on March 31. Warren is expected to significantly under-perform Bernie Sanders and other leading candidates.

The subject line of an email from Warren to supporters on Monday seemed to forecast fundraising disappointment: “This decision will ensure I'm outraised in this race.”

Warren already has $12 million in the bank, the amount left over from her Senate campaign run, giving her flexibility to build a nationwide infrastructure. Opposing campaigns privately point out that she raised that money with the help of big donors and the tactics she’s shunning moving forward.

Since 2012, Warren built up an extensive national network of donors that included regular donor-focused trips to the likes of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin or Chicago. She also took part in donor calls and meetings, though she dialed down the practice in 2018. She hasn't held any fundraisers since announcing her exploratory bid on Dec. 31.

Warren’s new position is the most aggressive anti-big money stance taken by a candidate in modern presidential history — extending beyond Bernie Sanders’ 2016 strategy, a transformational moment in small-donor fundraising.

ActBlue reports show Warren raised just under $300,000 in the 24 hours after her announcement. Sanders reported raising $6 million in the day after he jumped in.

Warren's announcement is an implicit concession that she's going to be out-raised, a key measure of strength for a presidential campaign. But her positioning as the true crusader against big money in politics could give her an advantage with voters — and potentially allow her to call out her Democratic rivals for falling short of her standard.

She would have the most difficulty criticizing Sanders, given that he held few private fundraisers during his 2016 run and has not indicated he will hire fundraisers to stage private meetings with donors during his 2020 bid.

Moneyed donors are unlikely to be completely shut out from Warren’s campaign. Her new rules would not preclude her from holding fundraising events with low-dollar entry fees. And Warren’s restrictions wouldn’t prohibit her finance team from calling big donors to ask for money, though those donors won’t be able to leverage time or access with her.

Notably, the policy would be loosened if she advances to the general election. In an email to supporters, she alluded to changing course against Republicans.

“By then we’ll be up against a Republican machine that will be hell-bent on keeping the White House,” she wrote. “They will have PACs and Super PACs and too many special interest groups to count, and we will do what is necessary to match them financially. That means investing — starting now — in each and every one of our state parties, and in our national party too.”

Former President Barack Obama drew a stir in political circles when he announced his own restrictions during his 2008 run, shunning any PAC contributions and those from federally-registered lobbyists.

“It was the first time anyone had done that before. Everyone freaked out about it. There was a lot of uncertainty around how that would play out,” said Ami Copeland, a former deputy finance director to Obama. “It was much more of a potent issue to utilize on the trail as opposed to hurting us.”

Still, Obama didn’t cut off personal access to high-dollar donors, a tactic Copeland called risky, given the desire by donors to have a personal interaction with a candidate. By not meeting with donors privately, Warren could risk losing out on opportunities to build off a donor’s larger local or national networks.

Copeland said Barack and Michelle Obama held 130 fundraising events in just one quarter during the 2008 Democratic primary, events that made up 80 percent of their total fundraising, he said.

Copeland said Warren’s strategy puts even more emphasis on small donors, a potentially volatile stream of financing in a field where more than a dozen candidates might be attempting to stand apart to drive those dollars.

“Operationally it’s going to be a really big challenge for them. It’s hard to put together a budget based on an unknown intake,” Copeland said. ""It’s not just her losing a class of donors, she’s also pushing them to other operations and other campaigns. That in the long-term will be an issue.""

Most candidates fundraise by tapping both small-dollar online donors and high-dollar fundraisers, where donors can cut checks of up to $2,800 during the primary. Candidates and campaign officials can also appear at fundraisers for super PACs, a practice adopted by both Barack Obama and Donald Trump’s campaigns.

Since announcing their presidential bids, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker have all attended or said they plan to attend high-dollar fundraisers held in Hollywood, New York and San Francisco.

“This is bold and innovative and a way to show that you will not be bought by any special interest and that every voice matters,” said Adam Bozzi, communications director for the pro-reform group End Citizens United. “When people run for president, linking fundraising to their time and their attention is something that has happened for a long time.”

Competing campaigns saw her motives differently: In conversations with POLITICO, aides to multiple competing candidates said the Warren campaign was likely maneuvering to shield itself from low fundraising numbers after its launch, and pointed out there were potential holes in Warren’s policy that would still allow her to raise money from large donors. No candidates spoke on the record about Warren’s announcement.

“It’s blatant expectations-lowering” around Warren’s fundraising, said one aide on a Democratic presidential campaign. “If this is a values-driven decision, to then say she’ll revert back to taking big money during the general election feels odd.”

294,Empty,2019-02-27T00:44:44Z,"Although Cubans voted overwhelming to approve the Constitution, Sunday's vote saw a growing portion express dissent.","Cuban voters ratified a new Constitution on Sunday that legalises the free market in a vote that saw a growing portion of the population express dissent compared with the island's last constitutional referendum in 1976.

In Sunday's ballot, 86.85 percent voted in favour of the new Constitution while nine percent voted against it. Spoiled or blank ballots made up 4.15 percent of ballots cast.

Voter turnout was recorded at 84.4 percent, down from 98 percent who turned out in 1976 when 97.7 percent of voters ratified the Constitution.

""There's no longer political unanimity around government proposals,"" Raudiel Pena Barrios, adjunct professor of law at the University of Havana, told Al Jazeera. ""We should see this as an important minority of Cubans who hope for something more in the management of the state.""

The new Constitution legalises private property and promotes foreign investment, bringing it in line with economic reforms the Cuban government has implemented to encourage entrepreneurship and investment over the past several years.

Arturo Lopez-Levy, visiting professor at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota who served as a political analyst for the Cuban government from 1992 to 1994, said such changes resolve a ""legal limbo"" around moves to liberalise the economy. This opens the door for further reform aimed at building a ""comprehensive mixed economy"", he said.

190226002347961

The updated charter also creates the position of prime minister to administer day-to-day state affairs and imposes age and term limits for the president.

Lopez-Levy calls these ""important instrumental changes within the one-party system"". For Pena Barrios, the new Constitution signals ""political continuity marked by novel aspects such as notable economic pragmatism"".

After casting his referendum ballot, President Miguel Diaz-Canel described the new Constitution as a bearer of ""continuity and unity"" in Cuba.

What does the vote mean for the opposition?

Critics argue the reforms are cosmetic. The power of the Communist Party within a one-party system remains untouched and citizens still do not have the ability to directly vote for a president, an issue thousands of voters raised in a three-month public consultation process.

But Lopez-Levy argued that any demands for deep political restructuring were pipe dreams from the outset.

""The process never had the intention of a transition to a liberal democracy,"" he said. ""The opposition and the groups that are pushing for this type of agenda have proven to be very isolated and with very limited political mobilisation capability.""

He cautioned that ""No"" votes, abstentions, or null ballots should not be equated with support for the Cuban opposition.

Pena Barrios doubts the dissident vote will work in the opposition's favour.

""The opposition in Cuba doesn't have sufficient political capital to identify with those who didn't support the text,"" he said.

'New political dialogue'

But many are optimistic the reforms and the process of drafting the new charter will help make room for continued debate among other sectors.

""The result points the way towards new political dialogue, or at least the need for it,"" Miguel Alejandro Hayes, editor of the blog La Trinchera and a contributor to other Cuban alternative media outlets, told Al Jazeera.

He believes it is unlikely such dialogue would include the traditional opposition. Instead, the government could engage with more moderate critics, though political will could still be lacking.

""There's an opposition that doesn't want dialogue, that approves of the blockade on Cuba, and that doesn't care about the cost of toppling the government,"" he said. ""These actors - the majority live outside of Cuba - don't have any credibility, and they are out of the scene,"" he added.

Pena Barrios argued that the official response to polarisation over marriage equality in the run-up to the referendum has demonstrated the government's openness to dialogue.

While an earlier draft of the Constitution legalised marriage equality, the final version left marriage to be defined in a separate referendum.

""Now comes the big challenge,"" Pena Barrios added, ""which is to fulfil the Constitution"".

The Cuban government is expected to implement various measures to complement the charter.

Hayes stressed the need for these new laws to ""be inclusive"" and ensure that ""political ideology is not cause for discrimination.""

""Everything proposed in the Constitution that is not explicit, everything that goes against the orthodox mentality, deserves attention because it is what runs the most risk of being forgotten or excluded,"" he said.

US-Cuba ties

Beyond the island, the Constitution is unlikely to smooth over relations with the United States.

Bilateral ties have deteriorated under President Donald Trump after the historic normalisation of frozen US-Cuba ties under Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro with the opening of embassies in Washington, DC, and Havana in 2015.

Trump has suggested deepening the more than half-a-century-old trade embargo on Cuba.

{articleGUID}

Lopez-Levy argued the time for fruitful debate on Cuba was before the referendum, and the US missed the opportunity. ""Trump doesn't have a policy towards Cuba, he has a policy towards the next election in Florida,"" he said.

Florida is home to two-thirds of the 1.2 million Cuban-American voters in the US. Although Cuban-Americans have increasingly turned towards the Democratic Party for more than a decade, according to the Pew Research Center, Cubans in Florida were twice as likely to vote for Trump compared with other Latinos.

In a statement on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo dismissed the vote as a ""so-called referendum"" and claimed the charter blocked potential for economic reform by enshrining socialism.

""No one should be fooled by this exercise, which achieves little beyond perpetuating the pretext for the regime's one-party dictatorship,"" Pompeo said. ""The entire process has been marked by carefully managed political theater and repression of public debate.""

The new Constitution declares the socialist system ""irrevocable"" and states the state's central goal as ""the construction of socialism and advance towards a communist society.""",Cubans approve a new Constitution: What does the vote mean?,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cubans-approve-constitution-vote-190226224600240.html

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) …","Democrats in both the Senate and House are mobilizing against an effort by Republican leaders to undermine the Green New Deal, momentarily derailing attempts to create division and halt the resolution’s momentum.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) recently pledged to hold a vote on the Green New Deal resolution as soon as this week — rather than a display of support for climate action, the goal was to divide Democrats. In response, Senate Democrats are now rallying behind a unity resolution, separate from the Green New Deal, urging climate action.

Meanwhile, House Democrats are increasingly backing the Green New Deal resolution itself: nearly 40 percent of the caucus now supports the sweeping blueprint mandating rapid decarbonization of the U.S. economy over the next decade.

On Tuesday, all 47 Senate Democrats and independents announced that they will back a resolution calling for climate action separate from the Green New Deal proposal. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE), ranking member on Environment and Public Works Committee, are leading the effort. Although the text of the rival resolution does not seem to be currently available, it reportedly will declare people-driven climate change to be an enduring phenomenon and call for immediate government action, albeit with no timetables or targets.

The move appears to be an attempt to avoid directly voting on the Green New Deal itself, as McConnell had hoped, and as the name suggests, underscores unity over division.

“It doesn’t matter if you are from a coastal state or from a landlocked state, if you care about public health or the environment, or if you care about our economy or national security,” Carper said in a Senate floor speech Tuesday. “The fact is, every person living in this country will eventually see or experience the effects of climate change, if they don’t already today.”

The unity resolution follows several weeks of intense back-and-forth after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) first introduced the Green New Deal resolution on February 7. The blueprint is co-sponsored by a number of Democratic 2020 hopefuls in the Senate, but has failed to gain significant traction with much of the chamber.

In an effort to deepen divides between Democrats on climate action, McConnell declared two weeks ago that the Senate would hold a vote on the resolution. This was originally expected as early as February 28.

Democrats widely panned that tactic as a show vote but initially offered no indicator of how they might proceed. But last Friday, a video live-streamed by the nonprofit youth-led Sunrise Movement went viral, showing Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) engaging in a terse exchange with young activists who back the Green New Deal. The heated conversation sparked furor online and widespread condemnation from climate activists of Feinstein, who dismissed the Green New Deal as largely untenable.

The exchange illustrated divides among Democrats, but it has also served as a turning point for the party. Following the uproar, a number of Democrats indicated their intent to vote “present” during any Green New Deal resolution vote in the Senate — seemingly a ceremonial action to preserve party unity. Feinstein herself said Tuesday that she planned to vote “present” on the resolution.

All of this culminated Tuesday afternoon, however, with McConnell abruptly declaring that the vote would take place at some point before the congressional August recess. A spokeswoman for Carper told ThinkProgress that it was unclear when or if that vote might happen.

Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) have since called on McConnell to hold a full day of debate on climate change before any Green New Deal vote occurs.

“We believe it is imperative the American people hear where both sides stand on this critical issue,” the senators wrote in a letter to the majority leader on Tuesday.

It is also unclear when or if the Senate Democratic unity resolution will see a vote.

Differing views on climate action

While Senate Democrats work to unite in the Republican-controlled chamber, House Democrats are increasingly embracing the Green New Deal. As of Wednesday, the resolution has 89 co-sponsors in the House — 38 percent of the Democratic caucus.

Unified support, however, is still far from guaranteed in the lower chamber. While a number of Democrats on key House committees back the Green New Deal, House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-KY) said Tuesday that the upcoming 2020 fiscal budget non-binding resolution won’t call for a Green New Deal. But Yarmuth noted the climate resolution is important to many Democrats and said that he is still meeting with committee leaders to discuss their priorities.

Some Republicans, meanwhile, are also shifting their approach to climate change. Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich called on the party this week to address global warming and said he will push “centrist” climate proposals appealing to conservatives. Republicans are also increasingly receptive of carbon pricing and other more limited approaches to climate action.

Activists have panned that approach as too narrow in scope — a critique that extends to members of both parties who have been slow to embrace dramatic climate action as captured by the Green New Deal. Following Friday’s confrontation with Feinstein, Sunrise Movement co-founder and Executive Director Varshini Prakash said in a statement that “fundamental change” is needed in the Democratic Party and that those who have not embraced the Green New Deal “are out of-touch with the center of energy in the party.”

But Sunrise didn’t reserve its fire only for Democrats. On Monday, 42 youth activists with the group were arrested while protesting outside McConnell’s office with a group of more than 250 people, including Kentucky high schoolers.

“If I could say anything to McConnell, I would ask him: ‘Does it not weigh on you at all that your own constituents are facing the life or death consequences of climate change all across the state, yet you continue to side with fossil fuel CEOs?'” Destine Rigsby, a 17-year-old from Louisville, said in a statement.

Kamala Harris has nursed connections with the California’s biggest donors during three campaigns for statewide office and two more for district attorney in San Francisco. | Mason Trinca/Getty Images 2020 Elections Kamala Harris elbows out rivals as she courts California donors The California senator is trying to monopolize Democratic money in the donor-rich state, fueling her campaign and cutting off rivals.

Donor-rich California has long been known as the ATM of the Democratic Party. Kamala Harris wants to turn it into her personal armored truck.

The California senator and 2020 presidential candidate has nursed connections with the state’s biggest donors during three campaigns for statewide office and two more for district attorney in San Francisco. Now, Harris is working aggressively to turn those connections into commitments securing those donors before out-of-state presidential rivals have a chance.

Story Continued Below

Before the presidential race even started, Harris spent hundreds of thousands of dollars through her leadership PAC to prospect the California donor scene. She has already held more California fundraisers than any other candidate for president, seeking out the bundlers who raised massive sums for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And with many top Democratic donors waiting for the crowded primary field to winnow before singling out a candidate for support, Harris’ efforts to win over her state’s money could not only boost her campaign but starve some of her rivals.

“She certainly is experienced as an executive, as a district attorney in San Francisco and again as the attorney general,” said San Francisco billionaire Doug Goldman, a donor who bundled money for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. “I think we would do damn well to elect Kamala Harris.”

Harris phoned Goldman, a longtime contact in the Bay Area, several weeks before her announcement to inform him of her plans and ask for his support, which he eventually gave after quizzing Harris on how she would approach the campaign. In addition to donating to Harris, Goldman plans to fundraise for her from his network of contacts, he said.

The stakes for California’s cash grab are immense. California was responsible for $522 million in candidates, parties and outside groups during the 2016 election, more than any other state, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics.

While Harris has home-field advantage in California, other 2020 Democrats are playing off connections of their own. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who got his undergraduate degree from Stanford University, could be a major rival: He has raised money from Silicon Valley investors for both his past campaigns and a startup he helped found while he was mayor of Newark.

Booker attended his first Silicon Valley fundraiser since announcing his bid for president last weekend, at the home of Laura and Gary Lauder, a venture capitalist and member of the Estee Lauder family. Booker also got early support in his campaign from Steve Phillips, a major Bay Area donor who is gathering donations for a super PAC.

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock have made recent fundraised or met with donors while in California recently, too. But Harris already held two February events in Hollywood, hosted by David Cooley, the CEO and founder of the nightclub Abbey, and Jeff Shell, chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group.

In mid-March, Harris will return to Hollywood, when actress Katie McGrath and filmmaker J.J. Abrams are hosting another soiree.

“She’s a first among equals,” said Andy Spahn, a Los Angeles fundraising consultant and adviser who is president of Gonring, Spahn and Associates. “It’s expensive to run statewide races here, it requires a pretty broad network of support. So she’s built that over the course of her campaigns which has enabled her to start quickly here.”

After winning her last election, her 2016 Senate race, Harris laid further groundwork with California contributors through her leadership PAC, campaign finance records indicate. She paid $289,000 to fundraising consultants based in California and spent tens of thousands more at California-based fundraising events in 2017 and 2018, including a $21,000 retreat at the The Lodge at Torrey Pines, a luxury hotel in La Jolla.

Since jumping into the presidential race, a February fundraiser in San Francisco provided an opportunity for Harris, her husband and her sister (campaign chairwoman Maya Harris) to mingle with more than 100 donors at Delancey Street, a foundation and restaurant that helps rehabilitate former prisoners and addicts. Philanthropist Roselyne “Cissie” Swig, a Democratic donor, sat in the front row as Harris spoke to the crowd, according to an attendee, warning them that the Democratic field would be crowded — but she was prepared to stand out.

Harris, like other candidates, is also working to build a following with online donors in addition to bigger donors who attend in-person events. Her campaign raised $1.5 million within 24 hours of its launch online from 38,000 individual donors, according to figures provided by the campaign. The campaign also increased its email list of supporters by 20 percent on its first day.

One of Harris’ earliest big-ticket supporters, major Hillary Clinton donor Susie Tompkins Buell, had known Harris for years but planned — like many other Democratic donors — to stay neutral in the primary. That changed after she attended Harris’ campaign launch.

“I was very hesitant to get involved. I wanted to pace myself, get that pageant going on and see who would be there,” said Buell, the San Francisco-based co-founder of Esprit clothing. “Then when I saw her at the rollout, I realized she’s what we need right now. We need fierce and we need joy and we need her experience.”

Buell now plans to raise money for Harris, and she said she’ll will be teaming up on occasion with Amy Rao, another former Clinton fundraiser who is the CEO of Silicon Valley-based Integrated Archive Systems.

“I think it’s really going to be a good group of candidates, I really do,” said Buell. “But she’s very loved here, Kamala is.”

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Friday morning that he is running for president, pledging to put the environment at the heart of his campaign for the Democratic nomination.

""I am the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation’s number one priority,"" Inslee said in a videolaunching his campaign.

Story Continued Below

Inslee, the first governor to join the 2020 Democratic presidential field, has been building up to a climate-focused campaign for months. The two-term governor chaired the Democratic Governors Association in 2018, when he traveled the country raising money and campaigning for other Democrats, and he has amassed cash in a federal PAC since the end of last year.

Last month, Inslee visited the first primary state of New Hampshire, where he gave a speech touting his record fighting climate change in Washington state and delivered the same line that he used Friday morning to kick off his campaign: “We’re the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we’re the last who can do something about it.”

In recent weeks, Inslee bolstered his political operation for the presidential campaign with new hires, including two Democratic strategists who worked for NextGen America, the climate-focused group founded by Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer. Inslee also brought on Jared Leopold, the former longtime communications director at the DGA.

Inslee, 68, is betting that his relentless focus on climate, a fundamental issue for elements of the Democratic Party now pushing for a “Green New Deal,” can vault him past primary opponents who may share some of his views on the issue — but who lack his singular focus or record of action at the state level.

But the Washington governor begins his campaign less-known and behind in the polls compared to some of his rivals in Congress, though he has had a longer political career than most of them. Inslee was first elected to the House of Representatives for one term in 1992 and then served continuously from 1999 to 2012, when he resigned to run for governor.

In 2009, Inslee played a key role in passing a “cap and trade” bill limiting carbon emissions through the House, though the Senate never took up the bill. As governor, Inslee has pushed to institute a carbon tax in his state.

While Inslee has maintained a strong political base in Washington, home to a healthy aerospace and tech industry, he does not have the network of national small- or large-dollar donors that other 2020 Democrats enjoy.

But he will have support from a super PAC, which other candidates have rejected. Another former top operative at the DGA under Inslee, Corey Platt, last week founded an unlimited-money group called Act Now on Climate that will back Inslee for president.

Inslee’s presidential campaign launch could herald the addition of other Democratic governors to the field, after the party’s high-profile senators beat them into the race in January and February. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock have both hired staff in early states as they look at running for the White House, while former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has also expressed interest in running.

Brasília (AFP) - Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido vowed on Thursday to return home ""in the coming days... despite threats"" from President Nicolas Maduro's regime, as he continues a tour of regional allies to rally international support.

Guaido, recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries, met with Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday afternoon while Paraguay's leader Mario Abdo announced Guaido would be in Asuncion on Friday.

After flouting a travel ban by Maduro's regime, Guaido went to Colombia last Friday where he met President Ivan Duque, US Vice President Mike Pence, Abdo and Sebastian Pinera of Chile.

Guaido was in Colombia to try to force desperately needed humanitarian aid -- which is also stockpiled in Brazil -- into Venezuela but was thwarted by a determined military blockade ordered by Maduro.

Guaido ""wants to show the Venezuelan people that he's being hosted by the president of Brazil... He wants to give the message that he's recognized"" as Venezuela's true leader, Brazil Vice President Hamilton Mourao said in an interview with Globo.

""I've received threats against me and my family, but also threats of imprisonment by the regime,"" Guaido said alongside Bolsonaro.

Guaido was to dine with Brazil's Foreign Affairs Minister Ernesto Araujo and then meet Abdo at 11:00 am (1400 GMT) on Friday at the presidential palace.

Venezuela is wracked by a humanitarian crisis that has seen poverty soar as millions of people face chronic shortages of food and medicine.

After years of economic chaos, its problems have been compounded by hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund says will reach 10 million percent in 2019 -- leaving salaries and savings virtually worthless.

An estimated 2.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2015, the United Nations says.

The latest to join the exodus are members of Venezuela's military -- whose high command still backs Maduro. Colombian immigration officials said that more than 550 Venezuelan military members have deserted and sought asylum across the border.

- Fears of arrest -

Guaido stunned the world last month, proclaiming himself Venezuela's acting president after the National Assembly he leads declared Maduro a usurper and illegitimate over his May re-election which was widely criticized as fraudulent.

Guaido wants to oust Maduro and set up a transitional government ahead of new elections.

""We're fighting for free elections, as stipulated by the constitution, democratic elections,"" Guaido and Bolsonaro said in a joint statement.

Far-right leader Bolsonaro apologized for the support that two of his leftist predecessors -- Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff -- gave to Maduro.

Guaido told reporters that he would return home ""at the latest on Monday,"" although there are fears he might be arrested when he does.

Guaido would have to face justice when he returns because he ignored his ban on foreign travel, Maduro told US channel ABC News earlier this week.

Guaido's supporters were planning a welcome home party at the offices of the El Nacional newspaper in Caracas on Friday.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights exhorted Maduro's government to ensure no harm comes to Guaido, including by ""third parties.""

At the United Nations on Thursday, failure to take action on two competing drafts laid bare divisions among world powers over the way forward in Venezuela.

Russia and China vetoed a US resolution in the Security Council calling for new elections and unimpeded deliveries of humanitarian aid, while Russia's draft urging a political settlement ""through peaceful means"" failed to secure the required number of votes.

- Strengthening relationships -

Guaido arrived in Brasilia on a Colombian military plane early Thursday.

He met European diplomats in Brasilia to ""strengthen relationships with those countries that have recognized our efforts to recover democracy and achieve free elections,"" Guaido said on Twitter.

His team is studying the possibility of visiting Roraima state, the border area with Venezuela where four people were killed in weekend clashes with Maduro's security services, a source in his camp said.

Guaido says 300,000 people face death without the food and medicine supplies, much of them from the United States, stockpiled in its neighbors.

Eight out of 10 Venezuelan households are at risk of food shortages, a study by three Venezuelan universities found.

A concert organized by billionaire British entrepreneur Richard Branson last Friday raised $2.5 million in one week to help Guaido's aid effort, organizers said.","Guaido rallies support, vows to return to Venezuela 'despite threats'",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/guaido-looks-reinforce-brazilian-support-ahead-venezuela-return-180728439.html
299,Empty,2019-02-27T17:30:00Z,"The bizarre election fraud scandal in North Carolina, explained","North Carolina state investigators laid out in detail last week an “unlawful,” “coordinated,” and well-funded plot to tamper with absentee ballots in a US House election that remains uncalled more than three months after Election Day — finally bringing clarity to one of the most bizarre election scandals in recent memory.

The state election board, after hearing four days of evidence indicating fraud and an attempt to conceal the scheme from state investigators, then voted to order a new election. Republican candidate Mark Harris has announced he won’t run in the upcoming campaign.

Now Leslie McCrae Dowless, the local political operative contracted by Harris’s campaign whose activities were at the center of the investigation, has been indicted on three counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, and two counts of possessing an absentee ballot in violation of state law, according to the Wake County prosecutor’s office.

During last week’s hearing, state investigators established their theory of the case — that Dowless directed a coordinated scheme to unlawfully collect, falsely witness, and otherwise tamper with absentee ballots — and workers who said they had assisted him in the scheme delivered damning testimony. The hearing’s first day ended with Dowless, under the advice of his attorney, refusing to testify before the election board.

In the following days, a top political consultant for Harris’s campaign and the candidate’s own son gave remarkable testimony of their own about the decision to hire Dowless. The consultant, Andy Yates, and John Harris both insisted Harris did not know what Dowless was doing and proved too trusting about the operative’s claims. Yet John Harris did say he warned his father that Dowless’s prior work on absentee ballots seemed like it could be illegal, a warning that went unheeded by the candidate. As his son closed his testimony with a few kind remarks about his parents, Mark Harris was in tears.

The proceedings lasted four days, with Harris taking the stand on the final day.

But before he did, the board revealed that Harris’s campaign had produced new evidence the night before Harris was to testify: previously undisclosed contacts between the candidate and Dowless. Harris’s attorneys said they had misunderstood the extent of the investigation’s request. Democratic attorney Marc Elias referred to the documents as “explosively important.” He asked the court to consider the way in which the evidence was released as “adverse interference” by the Harris team.

Harris then spent most of the final day being grilled about his relationship with Dowless, before he made the stunning admission that the evidence demanded a new election be held. He had been the apparent winner on Election Night over Democrat Dan McCready, by less than 1,000 votes.

The election board — made up of three Democrats and two Republicans — had finally reconvened after Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper named new members amid an unrelated legal dispute. They reviewed the evidence in the case over two days and then voted to call for a new election at the hearing’s conclusion.

Under state law, the board was able to call a new election if the basic fairness of the election was tainted. It didn’t matter whether the number of votes in dispute would have been enough to swing the outcome.

There will first be a new primary election, required by a recently passed state law, that will determine the Democratic and Republican candidates. The timing for the new elections will be announced soon.

What we’ve learned about the alleged ballot tampering at the state hearing

It’s important to remember two things about absentee ballots in North Carolina: Anybody can request one, and at the end of every day before the election, state officials publish a file of which voters requested an absentee ballot by mail and whether they have returned it to be counted.

A campaign could check that file every morning to know how many registered Republican, Democratic, and unaffiliated voters had requested and returned a mail-in ballot.

“From a mechanics point of view, this is a gold mine of information for candidates and their campaign,” Bitzer told me previously.

That treasure trove of data would have given Dowless and the people he worked with a detailed picture of how many absentee ballots were coming in every day from Republican, Democratic, and unaffiliated voters — and, by extension, how many absentee ballots they needed from their voters to keep pace with the Democrats.

Indeed, some of the workers who testified before the board Monday described Dowless discussing with other operatives how the state of the absentee ballot count. Harris even allegedly asked Dowless at one point about his apparent confidence in the state of play in the election.

Investigators working on behalf of the North Carolina election board started Monday’s hearing by laying out the contours of the ballot tampering scheme, which they say was led by Dowless, and then questioned Lisa Britt and several other women who worked for him.

Britt, who was Dowless’s stepdaughter for a time and said she remained close to him, said she believed that she and Dowless had done something wrong. But she insisted more than once that the GOP candidate, Harris, had not been privy to the plot.

Between the opening statement from investigators, Britt’s testimony and corroborating testimony from other witnesses, here is what we learned about the alleged ballot tampering scheme:

State investigators said Dowless had used absentee ballot request forms for prior elections to “pre-fill” forms for the 2018 election and sent out workers to find the voters so they could sign the forms and request a ballot — they described this as “Phase One.”

The workers allegedly presented the forms to Dowless and received a payment from him, based on how many they brought in, and then sent the forms to the board of elections.

At least 780 absentee request forms were allegedly submitted by Dowless or one of his workers.

For “Phase Two” of the operation, investigators said, Dowless sent out workers to collect the absentee ballots from voters.

Some of the ballots the workers collected had not been signed by witnesses or had not been sealed and the workers again took those ballots to Dowless and received payment in return.

Dowless held on to the returned ballots and instructed workers to falsely sign as witnesses for some of the ballots he collected, according to investigators.

To avoid raising the suspicions of state officials, the ballots were mailed in small batches, from post offices near the voters’ homes, and the workers made sure that the dates of their signatures and even the ink they used matched that of the voters.

Britt affirmed much of the investigators’ case in her testimony, testifying that she had collected ballots, that Dowless had instructed people to sign ballots they had actually not been there to witness, and that she had signed her mother’s name on some ballots so they would not raise suspicion from the state board.

Britt testified that if the ballots were left unsealed and there were elections left blank, she would fill in some of the empty offices — again, this was done to avoid arousing suspicion from state election officials. (She did say she had never filled in Harris’s name on a ballot, because voters would usually fill in at least the congressional race and a few others.)

Britt also testified that Dowless had reached out to her shortly before Monday’s hearing and provided her with a statement so she could plead the Fifth during her testimony.

Collecting an absentee ballot for another person and falsely witnessing a ballot — two of the allegations made in the witnesses’ testimony — are violations of state law, according to state investigators.

Britt, Andy Yates and John Harris have been emphatic that Harris was not aware of the plan. Investigators and Democratic lawyers still grilled Yates about his failure to identify Dowless’s prior criminal history while he was working for Yates’s firm on Harris’s campaign. John Harris also told the board that he had warned his father that Dowless might have conducted illegal electioneering in previous elections — but his father hired Dowless anyway.

State investigators also said they had not been able to conclude whether early voting numbers were improperly shared with third parties, one of the other allegations that had been made in the sworn affidavits that jump-started the fraud scandal.

The number of not-returned absentee ballots in the Ninth was unusually high

Most of the attention has focused on two counties in the Ninth: Bladen and Robeson, in the southeast corner of the state near the South Carolina border. Notably, each of the affidavits provided by Democratic attorneys involved voters in Bladen County, and one man said that Dowless himself had stated he was working on absentee ballots for Harris in the county.

Bitzer documented the unusual trend in those counties: They had a much higher rate of mail-in absentee ballots that were requested but not returned, compared to other counties in the Ninth District.

And at the district level, according to Bitzer’s calculations, the Ninth had a much higher rate of unreturned absentee ballots than any other district in North Carolina.

Bitzer also found that the share of votes Harris received from mail-in absentee ballots in Bladen was remarkably high. It was the only county where the Republican won the mail-in absentee vote, earning 61 percent to McCready’s 38 percent.

Strangely, though, based on the partisan breakdown of absentee ballots accepted in the county, Harris would have needed to win not only all the Republican ballots but also almost every single ballot from voters not registered with either party and a substantial number of Democratic ballots as well.

In other words, according to the data, Harris seems to have benefited from an oddly high share of votes in these two counties, where an operative of his was allegedly working.

House Minority Leader Kevin…,"The six Republicans named to a House select committee meant to address the mounting threat of climate change range in ideology and reflect the larger Republican Party’s shifting approach to discussing and addressing global warming.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) announced Thursday that Republican Reps. Garret Graves (LA), Gary Palmer (AL), Kelly Armstrong (ND), Carol Miller (WV), Morgan Griffith (VA), and Buddy Carter (GA) will all serve on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.

The lawmakers more broadly reflect a deeply conservative approach to climate change. Many are from states dependent on fossil fuels and are likely to complicate the committee’s work, which has already been curtailed by House leadership. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) formed the committee in January but declined to give the group legislative authority or subpoena power — limiting their ability to actually effect change.

But the selection also offers some surprises. Graves, who will lead the Republican coalition, accepts the science behind climate change and has cited the issue as a place where he breaks with many members of his party. While Graves has only a 3 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), meaning his environmental voting record is relatively weak, he has proven more willing to engage on climate action than many other Republicans.

His state, Louisiana, is an oil and gas hub. But it is also deeply vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

Louisiana’s coastline is sinking under the Gulf of Mexico at a rapid rate, losing around a football field’s worth of land an hour as sea level rise lashes the coast. Devastating hurricanes like Katrina in 2005 have also scarred the state, which will be among those hit first and worst amid the heightening toll of global warming.

Graves’ mainstream climate views are in line with the threat to his constituents and the lawmaker has proven open to measured action. When Graves chaired the Transportation Committee’s Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, he supported programs emphasizing climate adaption and mitigation. He also formerly managed the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, created in the aftermath of Katrina to assist with coastal restoration and hurricane protection.

That past track record, however, doesn’t fully counter Graves’ conservative credentials. A study in contradictions, the Louisiana Republican has seen support from organizations like Environmental Defense Fund, while also receiving the backing of the ultra-conservative Republican mega-donor Koch brothers.

And according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, Graves also received $210,150 from oil and gas donors in 2018 alone.

Some of Graves’ peers on the climate change committee also have strong support from fossil fuel interests. Armstrong, of drilling hub North Dakota, received $217,751 from the oil and gas industry in 2018.

By contrast, the nine Democratic members of the committee took a combined $198,000.

And apart from Graves, all Republican members of the committee have expressed a degree of skepticism about climate change, including Alabama’s Palmer who has twice sought to keep the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating greenhouse gases.

“The EPA has repeatedly claimed fighting climate change as justification for crafting onerous regulations that limit carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other compounds that are both essentially harmless and in fact required for life to flourish,” the congressman claimed in 2015.

Emerging trends, however, would suggest that it is Graves and not Palmer who offers an indicator of where the Republican Party may be moving on climate change. Recent polling shows that the majority of Americans believe in climate change and are concerned about its impacts. That has been compounded new scientific assessments, like the 2018 National Climate Assessment (NCA) and a dire U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released last fall. Both reports warned that climate impacts are playing out now with dwindling time to avert heightened catastrophe.

Lawmakers who express skepticism or outright deny climate change, meanwhile, are on the decline. That trend comes as some Democrats embrace radical climate action. Three weeks ago, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced the Green New Deal resolution, a blueprint for rapidly decarbonizing the U.S. economy in roughly a decade. Reactions to the proposal have varied dramatically even among Democrats — almost 90 House lawmakers and all Democratic 2020 presidential contenders in the Senate have signed on to the resolution, but many remain skeptical.

Republicans, meanwhile, have attacked the resolution as “socialism” and argued it would decimate sectors of the U.S. economy, including agriculture. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) recently pledged to hold a vote on the Green New Deal resolution, in an effort to fracture unity among Senate Democrats. But that effort hit a stumbling block as Democrats rallied behind a unity resolution acknowledging climate change and calling for congressional action to address the issue.

Other Republicans, meanwhile, are moving away from McConnell, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who broke ranks this week to oppose the appointment of EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler over his rollbacks of environmental regulations.

Others, like Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), have acknowledged climate change as its impacts take an increasing toll on their states. More moderate Republicans are also increasingly embracing limited climate action responses like carbon pricing.

This shift toward a potentially more moderate take on climate change is reflected in the choice of Graves, but other omissions show Republicans are far from unified on even incremental climate action. Rep. Francis Rooney (R-FL), arguably the Republican most committed to addressing climate change in the House, failed to make the cut for the climate committee.

And while he called Graves a “pretty reasonable guy,” Rooney told reporters on Thursday that his own exclusion from the committee speaks to a divide between his climate politics and Republican leadership.

“It shows they are not quite where I am yet,” said Rooney, “and it makes me feel really good about being where I am.”",Republicans appointed to House climate change committee reflect party divisions on climate action,Thinkprogress.org,https://thinkprogress.org/republicans-house-climate-change-committee-action-green-new-deal-graves-mcconnell-3e29225decee/

Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris — had said that they are open to the idea of the government paying reparations to black Americans as a restitution for slavery. The two candidates were cautious in their statements on the issue — both to the Times and in a subsequent Washington Post story — primarily emphasizing the history of racial discrimination in the U.S. Neither candidate laid out specific details about how they think a reparations program should work, and I’d be surprised if either of them put out a formal reparations plan — it’s a very unpopular idea. (More on that later.)

But it was notable that neither those two nor several other 2020 candidates contacted by the Times really wanted to firmly oppose reparations either, as past Democratic presidential candidates have. That shift away from outright opposition to reparations is another sign of how the Democratic Party is moving toward more progressive stands on racial issues.

But the reparations news made me curious: On which issues is the racial liberalism of the Democrats in line with the broader public — and where is it not? So I looked at the polling around different policies and rhetoric on racial issues. This is not a comprehensive examination, but an informal look at public opinion research since President Trump’s election.

Before we dive in, I should emphasize two things. First, it’s not new or surprising that ideas that we consider controversial don’t poll well. That’s kind of the point of bold ideas — they wouldn’t be bold if everyone already agreed with them. And, historically, racial liberalism in particular has often been unpopular — Martin Luther King Jr. may be almost universally revered now, but he was not in the 1960s. Secondly, there’s a difference between “unpopular” and “bad policy” and between “popular” and “good policy.” Some ideas that are unpopular may be right or effective — Ta-Nehisi Coates’s 2014 essay “The Case for Reparations” is very well-argued. I don’t want to suggest that just because a racial justice idea is unpopular that it shouldn’t be enacted.

I have divided these results into three categories: ideas or rhetoric that is broadly popular (more than 60 percent support from Americans overall), ideas that are unpopular (less than 40 percent support), and those that are somewhere in between.

Popular

This category includes vague notions of multiculturalism, ones that I assume most Americans support and that it would be hard to tell a pollster that you oppose. The policy ideas that are fairly popular, such as allowing felons to vote after they have finished their sentences, tend to be those that split Republican elites, with some opposing the ideas and others embracing them.

Here are the some of the popular ideas:

Racial and religious tolerance : 86 percent of Americans believe a significant part of being “truly American” is accepting people of diverse racial and religious backgrounds, according to a poll released this month by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic.

Mixed opinions

This section is generally made up of policies and rhetoric that splits the parties at the elite level — i.e., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would likely support most of these items, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy would oppose them. That elite divide mirrors similar partisan divides in the electorate. Not coincidentally, this section includes more issues and policy questions that have been top-of-mind in U.S. politics over the past several years. (Views of the Black Lives Matter movement are a good example.) Similarly, general expressions of tolerance of all races and religions are popular, but Americans are more divided when you get more specific.

Here are some of these somewhat controversial ideas:

Being Christian is not essential to being American : About 56 percent of Americans say being Christian is not an important part of being truly American, according to the February 2019 PRRI report. (Thirty-nine percent said being Christian is important.)

The U.S. should not define itself as a country of Western European descendants : In the PRRI survey, respondents were asked to put themselves on a scale where one end is the statement that they “would prefer the U.S. to be a nation made up of people from all over the world” and the other end is the statement that they “would prefer the U.S. to be a nation primarily made up of people from Western European heritage.” Forty-seven percent said they mostly agreed with the first statement.

Racial discrimination, as opposed to personal actions, is holding back African-Americans who can’t get ahead: 41 percent agreed with this view, according to the 2017 Pew poll, while a plurality said that such Americans were largely responsible for their own condition.

Unpopular

This section is largely made up of ideas that are to the left of the consensus within the Democratic Party. Taking down Confederate monuments in public places, for example, splits Democratic voters, while Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed. This section is shorter than those above in part because pollsters don’t tend to ask about ideas that are not backed strongly by either party, since those have little chance of becoming reality.

Here some very controversial ideas:

Confederate monuments in public spaces should be removed : 39 percent support this view, according to a 2017 Quinnipiac poll.

: 39 percent support this view, according to a 2017 Quinnipiac poll. The number of immigrants in America should increase : 28 percent of Americans hold this view, according to a June 2018 Gallup poll, with 39 percent of Americans wanting immigration levels to stay the same and 29 percent wanting them to decrease.

: 28 percent of Americans hold this view, according to a June 2018 Gallup poll, with 39 percent of Americans wanting immigration levels to stay the same and 29 percent wanting them to decrease. Reparations : A July 2018 survey from the left-leaning Data for Progress found that 26 percent of Americans supported some kind of compensation or cash benefits for the descendants of slaves. A May 2016 Marist survey also found that 26 percent of Americans said the U.S. should pay reparations as “a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination.”

A May 2016 Marist survey also found that 26 percent of Americans said the U.S. should pay reparations as “a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination.” Abolishing the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency: 25 percent of Americans said they supported this idea, according to a July 2018 Politico/Morning Consult poll; 54 percent wanted the agency to remain.

Reparations, along with abolishing ICE, are very unpopular. This was not surprising to me, which is why I was surprised when I first saw the headline, “2020 Democrats Embrace Race-Conscious Policies, Including Reparations” in the Times. But the candidates’ actual comments were more in the vein of our first two categories — somewhat vague acknowledgements of the inequality that black Americans face. The challenge for Democratic elected officials, as the party leans into its racial liberalism, will be how to translate the public’s general pro-minority proclivities into policy. I suspect that Democratic presidential candidates will end up pushing policies that limit how aggressive ICE can be and that address the wealth gap between black and whites — but fall short of explicit calls for abolishing ICE or giving reparations.

But I think there is another potential outcome — Democratic elites moving Democratic voters and then the broader public toward more racially liberal positions. There are many factors behind the growing support for marijuana legalization, but one may be that liberal activists have successfully convinced the public that aggressive policing of marijuana use has resulted in unfair treatment of black Americans.",What Americans Think About Reparations And Other Race-Related Questions,Fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-reparations-and-other-race-related-questions/

Jay Inslee is about to take climate change politics to the next level.,"poster=""https://static.politico.com/e6/b9/7550c2814cfd8094aabbb0ff5614/inslee-thumbnail.png"" true While Washington Gov. Jay Inslee barely registers in presidential polls, the issue he's attempting to corner is showing signs of traction with likely primary voters. 2020 Elections ‘Climate warrior’ jolts 2020 presidential field Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is about to take climate change politics to the next level.

No one has ever won a major statewide race, let alone a presidential nomination, with a single-issue, climate-focused candidacy. But Jay Inslee is about to try.

The Washington state governor launched a White House bid Friday that stands to have a significant effect on the electoral politics surrounding climate change.

Story Continued Below

For years, despite scientists’ warnings of the calamitous consequences of a warming world, climate change was relegated to a backwater in America’s political campaigns. Presidential candidates rarely mentioned the issue in debates or put money behind it in campaign ads. Even politicians supportive of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions largely skirted the issue, convinced it resonated less with voters than health care, education or other concerns.

But while Inslee barely registers in presidential polls, the issue that the Washington governor is attempting to corner is showing new signs of traction with likely primary voters. The subtle shift — expressed in public opinion polls and in renewed focus on climate change in the Democratic-controlled House — is providing Inslee a small opening. And it is forcing other, higher-profile Democratic presidential contenders to address climate change more explicitly than in any previous presidential campaign.

Politically, climate change is “in a completely different place,” said Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and Democratic activist who announced in January that he would not run for president. “There was one question asked about climate in the Democratic primary debates and zero in the general election debates in 2016. Are we in a better place than that? … A million times.”

In recent weeks, the introduction of a “Green New Deal” in Congress — a 10-year plan to decarbonize the American economy — refocused public attention on climate change. While Republicans lambasted the nonbinding resolution and welcomed debate on what they framed as a far-left overreach, several Democratic presidential contenders quickly signed on, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, has made climate change and gun control the pillars of his platform as he considers a run.

Recent polling suggests Democrats have good reason to campaign on climate — especially in a contested primary. While climate change continues to rank low among concerns of registered voters overall, liberal Democrats listed environmental protection third and global warming fourth among issues of importance in the midterm elections last year, according to a survey by researchers at Yale and George Mason universities.

“It’s a very different environment now than we’ve seen in well over a decade,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. For liberal Democrats, he said, climate change “is a top-tier issue, and that is the base of the Democratic Party.”

For climate change activists, the timing of the 2020 campaign appears fortuitous. Trump infuriated Democrats when he announced plans to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. But the formal withdrawal will not occur until immediately after the 2020 general election, likely forcing the issue back into the presidential debate.

Because of the timing, said R.L. Miller, founder of the super PAC Climate Hawks Vote, “This will literally be a referendum on the place of the United States on climate change in the world.”

If he qualifies for the first Democratic primary debates — likely, given the Democratic National Committee’s relatively low threshold for appearing on stage — Inslee will press the issue. He has laced climate change into every aspect of his campaign — from staffing to finance to policy.

Two of his political advisers — Sky Gallegos and Ben Unger — spent time working for Steyer’s NextGen America group. Some of the major early donors to Inslee’s federal political action committee, Vision PAC, come from the green energy or environmental industry. And where other candidates have written autobiographies, the book Inslee wrote while in political office, “Apollo’s Fire: Igniting America’s Clean Energy Economy,” is about the environment.

And it is not just Inslee raring for a climate debate. A super PAC supporting Inslee, Act Now on Climate, is set to back the Washington governor and emphasize the environment and climate change. But if Inslee drops out of the race, the PAC plans to shift to pressuring other candidates to focus on the issue.

Steyer, a major Democratic donor, said “there’s no way we’d support somebody who wasn’t absolutely crystal clear and credible on climate. If they’re not a climate warrior, we’re not for them. Period. Period, the end.”

Inslee met recently with former California Gov. Jerry Brown, a longtime champion of efforts to address climate change who has run for president three times himself. Ahead of the 2020 election, Brown said he plans to “do some things, do writings and maybe appearances to wake people up and get the topic on the presidential campaign … I do want to get this topic injected into the debate.”

Brown said the timing for climate change as an electoral issue is “getting better because the science keeps getting clearer and more ominous, and more people are responding.” Still, Brown said, climate change is “not the main story yet … No one other than Bloomberg and the governor of Washington have highlighted it.”

“Will the presidential candidates just concentrate on other stuff?” he asked. “Trump and race and gender and single-payer and inequality — those are all issues that are worthy of discussing. But climate change is going to make all of them worse. So, I will do what I can to get it on the agenda. It kind of boggles my mind that it’s getting the rather minimal treatment that it’s getting.”

Inslee is likely to bring a singular focus to the issue. As part of his campaign roll out, Inslee is laying out principles on the environment and climate change that he plans to support. He’s supportive of the principles of a Green New Deal, and Inslee aides are eager to mix his positions on climate change with his tenure as the only sitting governor running in the Democratic primary.

Inslee’s team points out that under his leadership, Washington significantly increased wind and solar energy in the state and quadrupled the number of electric vehicles on the road while overseeing a $100 million investment fund in clean energy development and deployment.

“His credentials on the issue are better than anybody else’s,” said Ron Dotzauer, a Democratic strategist who is based in the Pacific Northwest and is not affiliated with Inslee. “On the environment — not just climate change but on the environmental issues, the green economy, Jay’s been there. He was there before it was politically fashionable.”

Dotzauer added that Inslee is “going to get some environmental money, absolutely, but there’s so many other quote-unquote candidates that also have some quasi environmental credentials, maybe not quite as deep and as broad as his, but at this point they might be considered more viable.”

Inslee’s fortunes may depend on whether he can harness that energy, said Kelly Steele, a Seattle-based veteran of multiple Democratic statewide campaigns.

“He needs to articulate climate and link it back to a broader set of issues in a way that makes it that other candidates can’t simply just check the box,” Steele said.

Less than a year ago, few candidates of either party were focused heavily on climate change, and even Inslee acknowledged, in an interview in September, that the issue was not “predominate” in the midterm elections compared with other campaign themes.

But even in the midterms, there were signs of changing public attitudes about climate. In Southern California’s Orange County, a former Republican stronghold that Democrats seized in 2018, internal focus groups and polling suggested Democrats campaigning on climate change could make inroads with Republican women, according to a source familiar with the public opinion research.

Now-Rep. Harley Rouda, who ran on climate change as an issue in Orange County as early as the primary, said, “I just believe it’s the right thing to do. I truly believe it is the No. 1 issue facing humankind. And while it is difficult to measure on any given day the impact of climate change, the cumulative effect of it is ever increasing, and if we don’t get in front of it, we’re going to be the victim of it.”

As to its salience in 2020, Rouda said, “It’s just simple leadership, having those who are running for or elected to the highest offices in America making this a front-and-center issue.”

For Inslee, the focus on climate is more than just an exercise in messaging in a crowded field, said Tina Podlodowski, chairwoman of the Washington Democratic Party. “I think Inslee is really serious about making a shift and thinking about this issue as a lens through which we view other issues moving forward.

Welcome to Jezebel’s Midweek Madness, where local menace Joan Summers has crashed Vanity Fair’s Oscars After-After-After-After Party to stage a one woman protest against Fit Tea Federation leader Kris Jenner. If I don’t return from the front lines alive, let them know that I did it against the better judgement of my editors, lawyers, and every single person I know.

Let’s dive in!

In Touch:

Skimming right past the news about somebody named Blake Shelton and former Harajuku girl Gwen Stefani, let’s start with my favorite gossip of the week! Amidst the news that her fraud-obsessed husband might get deported, Teresa “Prostitution Whore!” Giudice was spotted with a 26 year old named Blake Schreck in Miami last weekend. While there isn’t much to this developing story, I’ve discovered that he:

There’s also a blurb on the Jussie Smollett case that centers the word of the Chicago Police Department. I’ll be abstaining from discussing this further, but would like to note that the CPD has fabricated evidence, murdered innocent civilians, and (allegedly) refused to further investigate the strangulations of 75 women since 2001. The speed at which this case has moved should not only worry you, but prove that the police have a vested interest in disproving the existence of this and future hate crimes. My third eye is open and I will not be fooled!



I’d also like to point out that the Tristan Thompson cheating rumors surfaced alongside the allegations that chaos merchant Kim Kardashian was in cahoots with Fashion Nova to rip off designer clothing. One could argue Kris Jenner leverages her children’s personal secrets in an effort to protect their wealth accumulation! Still, isn’t it sad that denim baroness Khloe Kardashian’s business arrangemen t relationship was shattered on Heterosexual Awareness Day? There’s also allegations that Stefani Joanne Ally Maine Angelina Germanotta’s father refused to support her marriage to Christian Carino in hopes she’d wife up Jackson Maine. I wonder what he thought of the forehead touch seen ‘round the world?

In worse news, Martha Stewart’s assistant organizes her enema closet and Kate Gosselin has a new dating show. Kate Plus Date, airing on TLC this fall, will chronicle her struggles with dating “in the public eye.” Remember, everyone: when you’re Dancing With The Star’s check dries up, reality television is an obvious fallback! I’m also obsessed with a source claiming John Cusack accidentally started a WhatsApp group message with 35 women on Raya. He apparently followed up his blunder with “Weird glitch, sorry!” Who wants to bet that his dating profile includes a “Must Love Dogs” joke?

Ok!:

Something that consistently shocks me about the coverage around the Sussex’s is the language employed by the tabloids. Here, “in their own words” actually refers to secondhand, anonymous sources. From a legal standpoint, it could be argued that “their” and “our” refer to the collective royal tipsters feeding the tabloids this gossip. It could also be debated that it’s a clever manipulation of language to fool you into believing Ok! has an exclusive interview with Harry & Meghan. Despite coming from an anonymous “insider”, here’s the preface to this cover story:

“Now Meghan is finally ready to set the record straight. For the first time, Ok! Can share what’s really happening behind Kensington Palace’s iron gates [...] ‘Meghan doesn’t want to address the rumors in public but feels it’s very important that people know the real story.’”

The sources in this story insist that the tabloid controversy surrounding Kensington Palace is largely fake. Some takeaways:

Life & Style:

As reported last week, the gossip circuit is ablaze with rumors that chaos merchant Kylie Jenner is three months pregnant with Travis Scott’s baby. The bulk of the evidence for this particular rumor is a series of photographs outside a doctor’s office in Beverly Hills. “Insiders” also claim “Kylie’s always said she wants four kids, and she wants to have them all in her early 20s.” There’s also the allegation that Fit Tea Federation leader Kris Jenner refuses to let the SICKO MODE (ft. Drake) rapper marry her youngest cash cow. According to tipsters,

“She’s seen her daughters go through countless breakups and divorces, and being a divorceé herself, she’s skeptical about the idea of a marriage lasting forever.”

To clarify, there have been 5 official divorces and approximately 40 public “breakups” amongst Kris and her Kohorts. Somebody should give this incredibly interesting family with so much public heartbreak a television show!

We’re also told that Jackson Maine and Stefani Joanne Ally Maine Angelina Germanotta are set to “finally go public.” While there was certainly a forehead touch seen ‘round the world, the Oscars came and went without much scandal for the two. Still, Life & Style posits that A Star Is Born has cursed the relationships it touched: Bradley Cooper & somebody named Irina Shayk, Lady Gaga & Taylor Kinney, and now Lady Gaga & Christian Carino. I can’t wait to listen to a podcast on this in 20 years! Even better is a fantastic blurb on the record number of women quitting The Bachelor when faced with the prospect of marrying anthropomorphic bran muffin Colton Underwood. In his own words: “Every time I put myself out there, I get fucking rejected.” Maybe you should Investigate that, Colton!

What else? Melissa Gorga wants her own television show and Sharon Stone stormed off the set of a Chanel West Coast music video. (Who?) Jeremy Piven is allegedly strapped for cash after peddling his Malibu home for $4 million below the original price. Stand-up comedy isn’t for everyone, Jeremy! A few pages later is more fatphobic propaganda against Jessica Simpson and her totally regular pregnancy, proving that society might have progressed (slightly) but the tabloids never will! There’s also an interesting report that Luann De Lesseps, of Countess and Friends fame, might be headed back to jail after failing to prove she’s attending her mandated AA meetings. Please god, keep the cameras rolling!

305,Empty,2019-03-01T12:00:00Z,The Washington governor thinks a focus on climate change will win him the White House.,"“Whatever the situation is now, it’s going to be worse two years from now on the peril side, and it’s going to be better on the promise side through clean-energy jobs,” Inslee said in an interview in Washington, D.C., earlier in the week, after he’d already made his decision to run. “So the dynamic is, wherever we are today, by the time of the November election climate will be a more important issue in the electorate, I believe.”

He’ll call his campaign the “Climate Mission Tour,” and kick it off in Iowa, followed by stops in Nevada and California. Among his early backers: Bill Nye, as in Bill Nye the Science Guy, who’s made fighting climate change a major cause. “He’s a science-based guy,” Nye said of Inslee in an interview on Thursday evening, recalling how he first met him years ago on a kayaking trip when the governor was in Congress. “He can contribute a lot to getting progressives focused.”

Read: The 3 big things that people misunderstand about climate change

Inslee has been preparing to run over the past two months, traveling to New Hampshire and Nevada in January. He’s put together a staff and a launch video produced by a couple whose previous clients include the musicians Ed Sheeran and Macklemore. But Inslee didn’t need to invest in polling or focus groups to see if he’s right about how panicked people are about climate change.

He has a February poll from the Center for American Progress that said the 2020 presidential race is wide open, and that climate change has become, in the survey’s words, “a key motivating issue.” Climate change was the top priority for 46 percent of the Democrats in the poll, behind only health care, at 47 percent. The Green New Deal and moving to 100 percent clean energy by 2050 had huge support, too. Having a clear plan for addressing the climate crisis, the pollsters wrote, “helps voters believe that a presidential candidate is serious and forward thinking.”

Inslee, who has been in politics for 30 years, said polls like that help give him a gut feeling that the voters are with him, and that they want more than just talk. He noted that he’s been focused on reducing carbon-dioxide emissions since his first congressional campaign, in 1992. He went on to win that Republican-leaning district, though he lost the seat two years later in a Republican wave.

“It is the issue; it is the primary issue; it is the foremost issue. This has to be the organizing issue of your administration,” he said of climate change. “It can’t be one agency; it can’t be check the box. It has to be the priority. I think it will be revealed who’s got the chops, who’s got the passion, and who’s willing to take the risk to run on this subject and say it is a priority.”

It’s early in the race, but Inslee starts significantly behind, jumping in as a mostly unknown weeks after other candidates made it official and months after many began seriously sketching out plans to win. He’ll also be behind in fundraising, though he will be the first announced 2020 Democratic candidate with an affiliated super PAC supporting him, despite the energy in the party against the big-money groups that has kept most other candidates from using them.",Jay Inslee Doesn’t Apologize for Being a One-Issue Candidate,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/jay-inlsee-joins-2020-field-climate-change-candidate/583900/

We consider an endorsement to be a public display or pronouncement of support that articulates or strongly implies that a candidate is the endorser’s current No. 1 choice for president. That’s a wordy description, but it makes a few important points:

The endorsement must be made publicly. A New York Times article saying that Senator Y is quietly backing Candidate X would not count, unless Senator Y has said or done something on behalf of the candidate publicly.

The endorsement need not be as explicit as a statement saying “I endorse Candidate X.” Introducing a candidate at a rally would usually count as an endorsement, for instance, depending on the context and tenor of the remarks.

Endorsers can’t cheat by endorsing multiple candidates at once; an endorsement only counts if it indicates a first choice. Endorsers may switch candidates at any time, however.

That first choice need not be someone who has officially entered the race. Hillary Clinton lined up dozens of endorsements before officially announcing her 2016 candidacy, for instance.

When it’s unclear whether someone intended to endorse a candidate, we’ll check with the offices of the candidate and the endorser about the context. We would also encourage candidates and endorsers to contact us directly to let us know about any new endorsements or any that we’ve missed. If the candidate and the endorser disagree about whether an endorsement has occurred, the endorser’s view will prevail.

Often, if you see someone listed as having endorsed a candidate and their public statements seem ambiguous, we’ve done additional reporting to confirm the endorsement. These were the same rules we used in 2016, and they didn’t cause too many problems, but there are always going to be issues we didn’t anticipate. But again, we would encourage both endorsers and candidates, as well as third parties, to contact us about any missing endorsements or any that seem to be in error.

The universe of potential endorsers we’re tracking in the 2020 cycle is larger than what we tracked in 2016, when we included only current governors and members of Congress. Different endorsers are worth different numbers of “endorsement points” to reflect the relative value of various endorsers, although the scale is flatter than the one we used in 2016. Specifically, it includes the following:

Current and former presidents and vice presidents (10 points). Current party leaders: Nancy Pelosi (House speaker), Steny Hoyer (House majority leader), James Clyburn (House majority whip), Chuck Schumer (Senate minority leader), Dick Durbin (Senate minority whip) and Tom Perez (Democratic National Committee chair) (10 points). Current governors, including governor equivalents from the U.S. territories and Washington, D.C. (8 points). Current U.S. Senators (6 points). Past presidential and vice presidential nominees (5 points). Former party leaders (5 points). Former 2020 presidential candidates who appeared in at least one debate and have since dropped out (5 points). Current U.S. representatives, including non-voting delegates from U.S. territories (3 points). Mayors of cities with at least 300,000 people (3 points). Officials holding statewide or territory-wide elected office, excluding positions (e.g. commissioners) that are held by multiple people at once (2 points). State and territorial legislatures’ majority and minority leaders (2 points). DNC members not otherwise covered by this list (1 point).

No set of categories and point values is going to be perfect; it doesn’t necessarily seem right that Hillary Clinton’s endorsement is worth less than that of Delaware Gov. John Carney, for instance. But 12 categories is already quite a few, and we don’t want to make too many one-off exceptions. Endorsers’ point values cannot be increased by qualifying for multiple categories; instead, endorsers are associated with the highest-ranking category they fit into on the list above. For instance, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine is treated as a senator (6 points) rather than a former VP nominee (5 points) because being a senator is worth more points.

Below is the number of current potential endorsers in each category, including both Democratic and independent (e.g. Maine Sen. Angus King) potential endorsers, except independents who are de facto Republicans. Republican endorsers will appear on the list if and when any of them endorse Democratic candidates for president. Note that the list can grow and shrink over time as, for example, vacant DNC positions are filled and offices change hands, since many of these categories assign values only to the whoever currently holds the position in question. If a senator resigns from office, for instance, their endorsement is no longer worth any endorsement points unless they fit into one of our other categories. (An exception: The candidate keeps the points if the endorser dies while holding the position.) Candidates cannot endorse themselves, so people who are currently running for president are removed from the endorsement pool until they drop out.",How Our Presidential Endorsement Tracker Works,Fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-presidential-endorsement-tracker-works/

Last week, Harris ended his bid to be certified the winner in North Carolina’s fraught 9th congressional district election after acknowledging he was the beneficiary of a large-scale election fraud scheme perpetrated by at least one person working for his campaign.

The North Carolina Board of Elections acted quickly, announcing the state must administer a new election to choose the district’s congressperson. Thanks to a new law rushed through the state legislature at the end of 2018, that process will begin with a new set of primaries for each party.

On Tuesday, Harris — who cited health issues in his decision to end the hearings by the Board of Elections — announced that he would not seek the GOP nomination this go around.

“After consulting with my physicians, there are several things that my health situation requires as a result of the extremely serious condition that I faced in mid-January,” said Harris in a statement on Tuesday. “Given my health situation, the need to regain full strength, and the timing of this surgery the last week of March, I have decided not to file in the new election for Congressional District 9.”

Harris’s abrupt conclusion of the Board of Elections hearing last week was curiously timed, coming just as the state was beginning to piece together evidence that Harris was in fact aware of an effort to interfere with absentee ballots in Bladen County. Local officials have suggested Harris might still be a focus of a potential criminal investigation after evidence was uncovered suggesting Harris knowingly sought the services of McCrae Dowless, a GOP strategist with a history of interfering in local elections by manipulating, withholding, or outright stealing absentee ballots.

In addition to his narrow edge in the general election, Harris won the original GOP primary last spring by an even tighter margin, again owed entirely to his performance in absentee votes. Former Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-NC) was unseated in the primary.

Harris also used his statement on Tuesday to throw his support to local Republican county commissioner Stony Rushing, a far right conspiracy theorist and avid gun supporter who was among the more vocal defenders of Harris throughout his legal battle.

In January, Rushing took to Facebook to claim that the elections board hotline received virtually no complaints from voters to report anomalies with their absentee ballots, insinuating that the state Democratic Party concocted allegations of fraud to steal the election. His false Facebook post was then cited by the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, who admitted to disseminating inaccurate information. Rushing repeatedly shared misleading or outright false social media posts related to the district race throughout the fraud investigation.

Akufo-Addo unseated Mahama in a 2016 election, capitalizing on an economy that was slowing due to falling prices for gold, oil and cocoa exports.

Mahama, who succeeded his deceased predecessor in 2012 and defeated Akufo-Addo in an election later that year, accepted defeat immediately in 2016, maintaining the West African country’s record of fiercely contested but peaceful elections.

The National Democratic Congress’s (NDC) ticket designated Mahama its candidate for the December 2020 vote at a party congress over the weekend, its director of elections, Elvis Ankrah, told Reuters.

Akufo-Addo, who is expected to stand for re-election as the candidate of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), campaigned in 2016 on promises to cut deficits following overspending by Mahama’s government that blew a $1.6 billion hole in the budget.

He has presided over an economic recovery, with growth of 6.7 percent in the first three quarters of last year.

310,Empty,2019-03-01T20:43:22Z,"While New Delhi and Islamabad de-escalate tensions, Kashmir, the epicentre of the conflict, finds itself on tenterhooks.","Srinagar, India-administered Kashmir - There is a running joke in Kashmir about India's differing statements regarding its rule in the disputed region. The joke, a part of Kashmiri dark humor, always elicits a smile for its truth, and goes like this:



""While responding on Kashmir internationally, India maintains that Kashmir a bilateral issue, between India and Pakistan. But while speaking to Pakistan, India says Kashmir is its internal problem. And whenever it engages in talk to the Kashmiris, India says there is no problem at all.""

But India's problems in the Indian-administered Kashmir appear to be steadily increasing, despite - and may be because of - trying to force a military solution to a political problem, experts say.

And with the present crisis, as nuclear-armed South Asian rivals are almost at war and major world powers reportedly mediating for calm, Kashmir has again dominated the world news, reminding everyone that the oldest unresolved conflict of the modern world can trigger a nuclear war.

What if tomorrow another 20-year-old Kashmiri blows himself up again? Firdous Syed Baba, a former rebel commander turned political columnist

The stage for the present crisis between India and Pakistan was set by a 20-year-old Kashmiri armed rebel, Adil Ahamd Dar, on February 14 when he rammed an explosive laden vehicle into an Indian paramilitary convoy, blowing up at least 42 soldiers in a rare suicide bomb attack.

While more and more young people are joining the armed rebellion the region, Indian blamed Pakistan for its problems in Kashmir.

190227190606136

Over 190 Kashmiris joined the armed movement in 2018 as compared to 126 the previous year. According to police, the number of fighters active in Kashmir right now is around 250.

While for now the war seems to have been averted with Pakistan's ""peace gesture"" of returning the Indian air force pilot in their custody, the centre of this war, the Kashmir region, continues to remain on the dangerous edge, and its youth - pushed into the abyss of a consuming uncertainty - move perilously close to exploding.

""What if tomorrow another 20-year-old Kashmiri blows himself up again?"" asks Firdous Syed Baba, a former rebel commander-turned-political columnist. ""Won't we be back in the middle of a crisis and a possible war?""



Baba says that the Indian policymakers must understand that the war and peace in the larger region has come to depend on the actions of a young Kashmiri boy from a village.



""And the way India is dealing with Kashmir, with violence and by creating a pressure cooker situation, such actions will only increase in number,"" Baba says.

More violence

Since the February 14 suicide bombing attack, India has responded in Kashmir with more violence and intense psychological warfare. New Delhi airlifted more than 10,000 paramilitary men into the disputed region, adding to the over half a million troops it maintains here in one of the most militarised zones in the world.

190228200217590

At the same time, India cracked down on the region's pro-independence resistance leaders and activists, arresting over more than 300 in the past two weeks.

Government orders were passed to stock up drugs and surgical instruments in the hospitals, ration depots were asked to stay open on a holiday to allow people to stock up food grains, creating the sense that a major offensive was going to be launched against Kashmiris.

""India cannot wish away the Kashmir conflict. Nor can it suppress it by force. With every killing by India, there are going to be more militants,"" said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the Himalayan valley's top Muslim leader and one of the senior resistance leaders.

""The Indian violence has only increased the resilience of the Kashmiris.""

Farooq said that instead of trying to address the sentiment of independence in Kashmir, India was trying to further hollow out the region's autonomous privileges within the Indian Union and paving way for demographic changes in Kashmir.

Only Thursday evening, the Indian cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, decided to bring in an ordinance that makes amendments to Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which establishes the autonomous relationship between Jammu and Kashmir and the Indian Union.

While the amendments themselves may sound minor, they are being seen as a breach, especially at a time when the state of Jammu and Kashmir is under the direct rule of the Indian President.

Kashmiris believe that the amendments are aimed at changing the demography of the disputed region, where the Muslims are the majority.

190227150855681

""There will be massive protests in every way if India acts on that course,"" Farooq said. ""There will possibly be many more acts like the one Dar did two weeks ago.""

Protecting the demography

The present government has maintained that it wants to scrap the Article 35A enshrined in India's constitution that bars Indians from buying land in the disputed region. A case to scrap the Article aimed at protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority region is also being heard in India's Supreme Court.

Each time the hearing comes up at the Indian top court, there is a shutdown in Kashmir and people wait in silence and complete attention to hear the outcome, for it is perceived in Kashmir that the scrapping of the Article would be a landmark moment in the region, that will only increase the confrontation between New Delhi and Kashmir, setting course for a stronger resistance and deadlier violence.

India kills the militants, blinds the protesters, jails the Hurriyat (pro-Independence) leaders, and humiliates us Waheed Parra, the People's Democratic Party leader

In Kashmir, it is not only the pro-independence Kashmiri leaders and activists that are being targeted by the Indian government. As it fails to win any real ground, New Delhi seems to have turned on its ""own people"" too. After the February 14 bombing, the Indian government also removed the security cover of several leaders, including some pro-India politicians as well..

Waheed Parra, a young Kashmiri politician with the People's Democratic Party, is one of them. Parra's party shared power with the Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and ruled Kashmir between 2015 and 2018, till BJP pulled out of the alliance, bringing the disputed region under direct rule from New Delhi.

190227130808599

Parra, like all other Kashmiri ""pro-India"" politicians, is seen in Kashmir as a ""collaborator"" who gives some semblance of legitimacy and ""a handle to the axe"" to India's rule in the region. Always at threat from the rebels and often even from people, Parra had six security guards and a bulletproof vehicle till last week. Now he has none.

""It was criminal on part of India to leave me like this at the mercy of the militants, it was almost like telling me to find out how many hours I would last,"" Parra told Al Jazeera. ""Only because I speak of dignified peace and human rights of Kashmiris. Even that is unacceptable to them, even when I speak within the Indian constitution.""

Parra is from Pulwama in the south of Kashmir, the same district where Dar, the suicide bomber came from, and where the worst bombing on Indian armed forces also took place.

He says he is vulnerable without the security cover considering the kind of work he did, like ""arranging 6,000 Kashmiris for a visit of the Indian Home Minister [Rajnath Singh] to Kashmir,"" a no small feat considering the anti-India sentiment in the region.

""India kills the militants, blinds the protesters, jails the Hurriyat (pro-independence) leaders, and humiliates us,"" Parra says. ""It [India] has only vindicated the stand of those leaders and people who refused to engage in its electoral process and boycotted their elections. We [pro-India politicians] have been used and discarded.""

Parra and the politics his party and other pro-India parties in the region espoused - of getting a few concessions from the Indian government, a ""healing touch policy"" to show the humane face of India, and of a dialogue with India even when the dialogue was an end in itself - lie in dust on the trampled ground in Kashmir.

Parra too sees the writing on the wall, which is more violence from the Indian state and a violent resistance from Kashmir, and the fact is not lost on him that what happens in Kashmir may no longer stay in Kashmir. War hangs on the horizon perpetually, till the oldest running conflict in the world is not resolved.","As India, Pakistan stand down, Kashmir remains on precarious edge",Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/india-pakistan-stand-kashmir-remains-precarious-edge-190301115237414.html

The president's former ""fixer"" has already pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations over hush payments to Ms Daniels, and it raised the possibility that Mr Trump had taken part in a criminal enterprise while president.

In explosive testimony to Congress, Cohen said: ""The president of the United States thus wrote a personal cheque for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.""

The cheque, dated Aug 1, 2017, was ""pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea,"" he said. He received a total of 11 cheques from Mr Trump over a year after making a $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels, Cohen said.

Cohen also claimed Mr Trump knew in advance that Wikileaks was going to release emails hacked from the Democratic Party during the 2016 election.

Cohen further stated that Mr Trump instructed him to lie to Melania Trump about the alleged affair with Ms Daniels.

He said: ""Mr Trump asked me to pay off an adult film star, with whom he had an affair and to lie to his wife about it, which I did.

Cohen broke with the president last year saying his first loyalty was to his ""family and country"" Credit: AP More

""Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly and she did not deserve that.""

He also claimed the president implicitly instructed him to lie to Congress over a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, and suggested that Mr Trump had advance knowledge of a controversial meeting between his son, Donald Jr., and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York during the campaign.

Cohen, who once said he would ""take a bullet"" for Mr Trump went on to deliver a character assassination of his former boss, saying: ""I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.""

He called Mr Trump a ""liar"" who was ""fundamentally disloyal,"" didn't care about the American people, and had campaigned on a ""platform of hate and intolerance"".

Cohen added: ""Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation, only to market himself.

""Mr Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the 'greatest infomercial in political history'. He never expected to win.""

The former lawyer, who has been disbarred, has previously also been convicted of lying to Congress and financial crimes and starts a three-year jail term in May, but said he was seeking redemption by telling the full truth. He added: ""I am no longer your fixer, Mr Trump.""

Cohen voluntarily agreed to a request to appear before the Democrat-controlled House oversight committee.

The committee is investigating issues including the president's compliance with campaign finance laws, and his business practices.

The president, tweeting from Vietnam, accused Cohen of ""lying in order to reduce his prison time"" and Republicans on the House oversight committee furiously accused him of ""trashing"" the president because he didn't get a job in the White House.

Cohen told them how he had been in Mr Trump's office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, a self-described ""dirty trickster"", called the then Republican presidential nominee.",Michael Cohen presents cheque allegedly from Donald Trump to repay Stormy Daniels hush money,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-former-lawyer-reveal-witnessed-015546287.html

Trudeau’s domestic troubles have attracted attention in Chinese state media due to his previous assertion that his government cannot interfere in the case of a senior Huawei executive arrested in Canada and now fighting extradition to the United States.

READ MORE: China wants Canada to overrule courts and release Meng Wanzhou, but it won’t do that, Trudeau says

China has repeatedly called for the release of Meng Wanzhou, the telecommunication giant’s chief financial officer, arrested in Vancouver in December at Washington’s request. In late January the U.S. Justice Department charged Huawei and Meng with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

At a regular daily news briefing in Beijing, China’s Foreign Ministry took the opportunity to take Canada to task over possible double standards, by commenting on a domestic Canadian political issue that does not otherwise involve China.

Trudeau has disputed allegations by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

Asked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Trudeau to say he couldn’t interfere in Meng’s case and yet his government be accused of trying to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he “really liked this question.”

“Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” Lu said.

“In fact on this case you have mentioned, people in Canada are paying it a great deal of attention,” he added. “In fact, not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

In a prescient engraving from 1793, English poet and printmaker William Blake depicted a figure at the base of a long ladder that leads up to the moon. Beneath it, Blake famously carved the words: “I want! I want!”

The historic image offers an apt description of Canada’s space sector for the past year as it has repeatedly urged the federal government, both publicly and behind the scenes, to join a multibillion dollar international effort to build a next generation space station in lunar orbit.

On Thursday, Ottawa finally acquiesced, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada will become a partner in the Lunar Orbiting Platform-Gateway, a facility that the U.S. space agency, NASA, envisions as both a proving ground for space technology and a precursor to an eventual human mission to Mars.

Story continues below advertisement

“Today, we are stepping up,” the Prime Minister said during a press conference at Canadian Space Agency headquarters in Saint-Hubert, near Montreal. “Canada is going to the moon.”

The announcement means that Canada is the first partner to officially commit to the Gateway after the United States, although Europe, Japan and Russia have all indicated their interest and are expected to follow suit in the coming months.

The centrepiece of Canada’s involvement in the new platform will be supplying a robotic arm that Mr. Trudeau called “Canadarm 3,” a successor to the Canadarm 2, the unit that is depicted on the back of the Canadian five dollar bill and that has become crucial to operations aboard the International Space Station.

The commitment is the largest for the country’s space program in over a decade and will inject $2.05-billion into Canada’s space sector over the next 24 years. It also creates a focus for the Canadian Space Agency, which has been seen as adrift in recent years without a long-term plan or direction from political leaders about what happens after the space station.

The agency’s official entry into project, also sets the stage for Canadian astronauts to visit and work aboard the deep space outpost.

“Our objective is to have a Canadian on the Gateway within the next 10 years, as soon as the Gateway is completed,” said Gilles Leclerc, the agency’s director-general of exploration.

Jennifer Sidey-Gibbons, who was selected in 2017 to be a Canadian astronaut, said the prospect of a future mission to the Gateway was an opportunity almost too great for words.

“To hear the moon discussed as something we’re pushing towards is phenomenal,” she said.

Because of its remote location, it is expected that the Gateway will be unoccupied most of the time. The new Canadarm and other systems on board the platform will be more reliant on artificial intelligence with less real-time input from mission controllers on Earth.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Leclerc added that Canada’s partnership in the Gateway would also open the possibility of access for scientists and Canadian companies to use the outpost as a base for conducting robotic mission on the lunar surface.

“It’s a door opener,” said Gordon Osinski, a planetary scientist at the University of Western Ontario. “Now that Canada’s at the table for a return to the moon it creates a way for scientists and engineers [at Canadian universities] to participate too.”

Thursday’s announcement also includes a $150-million allocation to the agency over the next five years for an accelerator program to spur projects by Canadian companies to develop technologies related to the Gateway. The program includes support for remote health technologies – a facet of human space exploration where the space agency hopes to develop a second niche alongside Canada’s established track record building space robotics.

Navdeep Bains, Minister for Innovation, Science and Economic Development, said that up to 200 companies stand to benefit from the initiative. The new funding will be included in the 2019 federal budget that is set to be tabled on March 19.

But the biggest potential winner is likely to be MDA, the company that built and operates Canadarm 2. While MDA is now part of Maxar, a U.S.-based aerospace firm, its robotics division remains in Brampton, Ont.

MDA has already been working on preliminary contracts to develop technologies toward Canadarm 3 and is a likely front-runner for the main contract to build the new arm.

For the past 10 months the company has led a vigorous public relations campaign under the banner “Don’t Let Go” to encourage the federal government to sign onto the Gateway.

When it comes to Canadians’ reactions to the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal, it appears that opinions could not be more starkly different between the provinces of Quebec and Alberta.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent much of his day Thursday in his home province, where SNC-Lavalin is headquartered. His message that his government was standing up for SNC-Lavalin jobs appears to have found some ground there, where the company is widely considered a “crown jewel” of Quebec’s economy.

“I think the economical imperatives here are very important,” a man told CTV News on the streets of Papineau, the Montreal electoral district that has been held by Trudeau for more than a decade.

Yves Boisvery is a columnist with the Montreal digital newspaper La Presse.

“In Quebec, it is more seen as a way to find a solution to save an important strategic company,” Boisvery told CTV News.

SNC-Lavalin employs roughly 9,000 people in Canada, and 3,400 of those jobs are in Quebec.

“There were many and broad conversations about the importance of defending jobs, not just in Quebec but right across the country,” Trudeau told reporters from Quebec on Thursday.

But in the aftermath of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s explosive testimony in Parliament Wednesday, the tone in some editorials has begun to shift.

In the newspaper Le Journal de Montreal, for example, columnist Richard Martineau argued Thursday that Trudeau isn’t trying to save jobs so much as shore up support for this year’s federal election.

THE VIEW FROM ALBERTA

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley appeared before the Senate in Ottawa Thursday to give her take on Bill C-69, which would change how energy projects -- such as pipelines -- are assessed.

“I know that right now, Ottawa is a little consumed with the SNC-Lavalin affair,” Notley said from the capital. “But I need you to know that when Alberta's energy industry is hurting, the whole country pays a price.”

Notley, however, deflected any suggestion that Ottawa is playing favourites with Quebec.

“I don't want to pit the two against each other,” she said.

Some 3,000 kilometres, many Albertans, however, do feel like favouritism is at play at a time when their economy is struggling amid low oil prices.

“Alberta is getting short shifted,” one man told CTV News on Thursday from a Calgary coffee shop.

Another said that the duelling crises have left him resigned and angry.

“Resignation, like there's nothing you can do about it,” he said. “And anger that the central eastern culture could care less, quite frankly.”

Lori Williams, a political scientist with Calgary’s Mount Royal University, says that many in Alberta feel that the system is inherently unfair.

“We give into equalization (payments), Quebec receives from equalization,” she told CTV News. “We have concerns about jobs and Quebec jobs seem to count more.”",From 'solution' to 'anger': Reactions to SNC-Lavalin in Que. and Alta. - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/from-solution-to-anger-reactions-to-snc-lavalin-in-que-and-alta-1.4317874

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Thursday that Canada will be a partner in a NASA-led project to establish an outpost for lunar exploration.

“Canada is going to the moon,” Trudeau declared as he made the announcement at the Canadian Space Agency in the Montreal suburb of Longueuil.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is embarking on the creation of its new Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the moon. The station is expected to be fully functional around 2026.

“The Lunar Gateway will be one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken by human beings to date,” Trudeau said. “Not only will this moon outpost allow for a long-term lunar presence but it will also serve as a launch pad to Mars and beyond.”

The plan calls for a “sustainable lunar architecture” that would allow people and equipment to go back and forth to the moon regularly, NASA says. It is described as a first step toward deeper space exploration.

READ MORE: Trump signs order to create US Space Command

Trudeau said the partnership in the Lunar Gateway will be part of a new federal space strategy that will see the government invest $2.05 billion over 24 years. He said the investment will create hundreds of well-paying jobs and contribute $100 million annually to Canada’s gross domestic product.

Canada’s key contribution to the Lunar Gateway will be developing a smart robotic system, to be known as Canadarm 3. The mechanism will repair and maintain the outpost, which will be about one-fifth the size of the International Space Station.

“Canadarm was essential to the space shuttle, Canadarm 2 built the International Space Station, so it’s only fitting and right that the arm that will repair and maintain the Lunar Gateway will yet again be made in Canada by Canadians,” Trudeau said.

Last November, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine visited Ottawa to make a pitch for Canadian involvement in the moon project. He said at the time that he hoped Canadian expertise in artificial intelligence and robotics could yield a new Canadarm. “If Canadians want to be involved in missions to the surface of the moon with astronauts, we welcome that,” he added.

U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft said in a statement that Thursday’s announcement marks “the beginning of a new era of U.S.-Canada space co-operation.”

He was also mum on whether knowing that would keep him from reversing the decision.

“I had not,” Lametti when asked if he had known about the decision in an interview airing Sunday with The West Block‘s Mercedes Stephenson.

“I was a Montreal MP, as I’ve said, so I was generally aware of the file but I didn’t have any specific knowledge — I mean, I had the knowledge that you and I both had, reading the newspapers and seeing what’s out on the media.”

WATCH: David Lametti, Canada’s new attorney general, says SNC-Lavalin could still get the special deal that Jody Wilson-Raybould refused to approve. As Mercedes Stephenson explains, Lametti says the legal possibility still exists.

Lametti was also asked whether it would have given him pause to know Wilson-Raybould had already said no.

“At that point, I didn’t know all the facts — at this point, I still don’t know all the facts — so it’s a hypothetical question that I can’t answer,” he said.

In the interview, Lametti addressed questions in the wake of explosive testimony from Wilson-Raybould before a House of Commons justice committee earlier this week. In that testimony, she described co-ordination within the Department of Justice prior to the shuffle in order to brief Lametti on the issue as soon as he was appointed so that the new attorney general could speak with the prime minister as soon as possible.

“The clerk tells the deputy that one of the first conversations that the new minister will be expected to have with the prime minister will be on SNC-Lavalin,” Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee when describing how efforts to get Lametti up to speed seemed to begin before she had even been officially removed from the post.

“In other words, that the new minister will need to prepare, be prepared to speak to the prime minister on this file. The deputy recounts this to my chief of staff, who tells me about the conversation,” Wilson-Raybould added.

WATCH: Jody Wilson-Raybould’s full statement to Commons justice committee

Wilson-Raybould was removed from the post of attorney general on Jan. 14, 2019.

She said she was notified of that decision on Jan. 7 and said at the time that she had told the prime minister and his then-principal secretary, Gerald Butts, she believed it to be because of her decision not to intervene to help cut SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid criminal trial and potential conviction on corruption and fraud charges.

“They denied this to be the case,” she told the committee.

Butts is one of three witnesses set to testify before the same committee next week over allegations of attempted political interference.

Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick and Nathalie Drouin, the deputy attorney general, will also appear.

Wernick will likely face questions over the description of a Dec. 19, 2018, conversation he had with Wilson-Raybould, in which he allegedly told her that her decision not to intervene to offer a deal to SNC-Lavalin might not matter.

In the SNC-Lavalin case, they pressure a minister over prosecution, allow criminal charges to lapse and invent bureaucratic ploys to bend and mitigate the law.

But at this end of Canada, the Liberals insist on hyper-respect for every law, regulation, concept, process and social notion that might possibly be used to delay a pipeline.

SNC-Lavalin is a Quebec-based company accused of fraud and bribery while doing business in Libya. Essentially, it’s charged with engaging in corrupt behaviour abroad that it would not employ at home.

As the past couple of weeks have shown, the cabinet and government will contort themselves to keep this company out of criminal court.

A conviction would ban the company from bidding on Canadian projects for 10 years. On Monday, the Globe and Mail reported that officials are now writing rules to allow “flexibility” in the length of a bidding ban.

Two senior officials of the company recently escaped criminal charges because judges ruled that prosecutors took too long to bring the cases to trial.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was unhappy with what she evidently considered undue pressure to drop prosecution. She resigned and will soon appear before a committee.

Now, consider the handling of Trans Mountain by these same people.

The bedraggled project, far more important economically than any possible benefit from SNC-Lavalin, has been subject to endless public scrutiny.

The first proponent, Kinder Morgan, complied with every regulatory demand, completed extensive public consultations and negotiations — including dozens of financial benefit agreements with communities and First Nations — and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

The project won 17 straight court challenges against other Indigenous groups, activists, and the cities of Burnaby and Vancouver.

But the obstruction played out for so long that the company left Canada, selling the project to Ottawa for $4.5 billion.

Construction began. Then, last Aug. 30, Trans Mountain ran into three Federal Court of Appeal judges who decided the permit was invalid.

The decision was not hostile to the pipeline itself. It was mainly critical of some consultation and environmental issues involving killer whales.

At that crucial moment, Ottawa might have applied some SNC-Lavalin-style vigour to the ruling.

Without any secretive actions, Ottawa could have appealed, ordered construction to continue, worked to fulfil the court’s demands and contested every application for an injunction.

The Liberals could also have passed a federal law enabling the pipeline. That was actually promised at one point. But the pledge sank without a bubble in the toxically conflicted cabinet.

Last Friday, the National Energy Board approved the project for the second time, adding 16 recommendations to its long list of previous conditions.

That might have been the moment for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself to promise quick cabinet approval.

But no, there’s not even a commitment to issue a new permit within cabinet’s 90-day guideline.

And all along, the Liberals have been busy erecting more legal barriers to energy and resource projects.

The best single article on this national disaster comes from former columnist Jeffrey Simpson, who recently wrote a long study for the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

It details the impediments the Liberals have created, from giving the environment minister undue control over energy and resources to inferring veto powers for groups that will never agree to a project under any conditions and inventing extra-legal concepts like “social licence.”

Two bills — C-69 and C-48 — are now close to passage. The first would regulate new projects into oblivion. The second would prohibit Alberta products (not B.C. natural gas) from shipping by tanker off B.C.’s northern coast.

Absurdly, the Senate dominated by Ontario and Quebec is the last line of defence against these atrocious bills.

Counting the cost of delays and diversions so far, the C.D. Howe Institute estimates the loss in investment at $100 billion in 2017-18 alone.

Along the way, the Liberals have virtually ceded a key power that holds Canada together, federal control over interprovincial shipping. At the same time, their bills would severely dilute provincial ownership and development of natural resources.

Such is the discriminatory regime the Liberals are creating for Western Canada’s resources. You can be sure they will enforce every nuance.

For SNC-Lavalin, though, existing law is a malleable thing, uniquely adaptable to partisan Liberal needs.

This double standard goes beyond simply hypocrisy. It’s a destructive message to the whole country about who counts, and who doesn’t.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made three changes to his cabinet, and the most high-profile move saw Lawrence MacAulay take over the veterans affairs portfolio.

READ MORE: Trudeau shuffles MacAulay, Monsef, Bibeau to new cabinet roles after Wilson-Raybould’s resignation

MacAulay is the 10th politician to take over the role since February 2006. That turnover rate ranks near the top for ministry positions at the federal level.

Since the Liberals were elected, five MPs have held the title of minister for veterans affairs, matching the five Conservatives who held the position during Stephen Harper’s time in office.

Calgary MP Kent Hehr oversaw the portfolio from November 2015 to August 2017, followed by Seamus O’Regan, who was minister until Jan. 14, 2019.

Jody Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to the position but stepped down after less than a month in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Minister of Defense Harjit Sajjan looked after the portfolio in a temporary capacity until MacAulay was sworn in.

When asked about the high turnover of the position, MacAulay said he’s just honoured that Trudeau picked him for the job.

“Our government has made a lot of changes in veterans affairs, but I’m not going to get into the details,” said MacAulay. “To represent veterans at the cabinet table is a distinct honour.”

Allan Hunter with Veterans Canada said the revolving door of politicians is getting in the way of helping Canadians who have served.

“The constant shuffling of the veterans affairs portfolio tells you that there’s not a big interest from the people in government to deal with the issues,” said Hunter. “Our veterans are in crisis.”

READ MORE: Veterans’ anger at Trudeau government grows after Wilson-Raybould’s resignation

Hunter added that even if MacAulay gets to work immediately, the upcoming election will probably mean more changes.

“There’s a pretty good likelihood we’re going to go to another minister with the new government, regardless of what party is in power,” said Hunter. “Once again, we have a role that’s all about the figurehead and not about (the people) they serve, which are veterans and Canadians.”

There are a few positive points that veterans can take away from Friday’s announcement.

MacAulay is a seasoned cabinet minister with more than 30 years of experience on the hill. He was most recently the minister of agriculture.

LONGUEUIL, Que. – Canada will be a partner in a NASA-led project to establish an outpost for lunar exploration as part of a revitalized national space program, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Thursday

“Canada is going to the moon,” Trudeau declared as he made the announcement at the Canadian Space Agency in the Montreal suburb of Longueuil.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced last summer it is embarking on the creation of its new Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the moon and serve as a springboard for deep-space missions.

The station, about one-fifth the size of the International Space Station, is expected to be fully functional around 2026 and will serve as mission control for lunar missions.

“The Lunar Gateway will be one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken by human beings to date,” Trudeau said. “Not only will this moon outpost allow for a long-term lunar presence but it will also serve as a launch pad to Mars and beyond.”

The plan calls for a “sustainable lunar architecture” that would allow people and equipment to go back and forth to the moon regularly, NASA says.

Trudeau said the partnership in the Lunar Gateway will be part of a new federal space strategy that will see the government invest $2.05 billion over 24 years. He said the investment will create hundreds of well-paying jobs and contribute $100 million annually to Canada’s gross domestic product thanks to the growing space economy.

“It’s a long-term commitment. It demonstrates we’re in it for the long run,” said Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains.

Canada’s key contribution to the Lunar Gateway will be developing a smart robotic system, to be known as Canadarm 3. The mechanism will repair and maintain the outpost.

“Canadarm was essential to the space shuttle, Canadarm 2 built the International Space Station, so it’s only fitting and right that the arm that will repair and maintain the Lunar Gateway will yet again be made in Canada by Canadians,” Trudeau said.

He got a first-hand look at some of the technology while touring the agency with daughter Ella-Grace, manipulating a camera fixed to the space station and testing out a rover in an agency lab. He later spoke to high school students in a town hall setting.

Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques, speaking from the space station where he’s on a six-month mission, said that unlike his current workplace, Gateway will not be able to be operated from the ground. Because of the distance, it will have to be autonomous, relying on robotics and artificial intelligence.

“I’m proud and thrilled that Canada will continue the adventure and join in the next chapter of space exploration,” Saint-Jacques said. “Gateway will be an outpost where humans can live in lunar orbit, where we will learn to work even more autonomously from mother Earth than we have been doing so far.”

Last November, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine visited Ottawa to make a pitch for Canadian involvement in the moon project. He said at the time that he hoped Canadian expertise in artificial intelligence and robotics could yield a new Canadarm. “If Canadians want to be involved in missions to the surface of the moon with astronauts, we welcome that,” he added.

U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft said in a statement that Thursday’s announcement marks “the beginning of a new era of U.S.-Canada space co-operation.”

The Gateway project will provide Canadian astronauts time in orbit, said Gilles Leclerc, director general of space exploration for the Canadian Space Agency. He said the arrangement still has to be negotiated, but he expects it will be similar to the agreement governing the space station. In Canada’s case, it provides the robotics and has the right to conduct experiments and send crew to the space station.

Leclerc said it’s an exciting time in space – particularly with commercial human space flight on the horizon. But the Gateway project fits Canada’s space goals.

“The realistic approach is contributing Canadian technologies that’s not going to only get us flights but give benefits in terms of the science and real benefits on Earth,” Leclerc said.",Trudeau announces Canada will be partner in NASA-led Lunar Gateway project - CanadianManufacturing.com,Canadianmanufacturing.com,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/manufacturing/trudeau-announces-canada-will-be-partner-in-nasa-led-lunar-gateway-project-227964/

The tension traces back to a suicide bombing that killed 40 paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb. 14. India blamed Pakistan for harbouring the terror group responsible for the bombing and launched an air strike into Pakistani territory on Tuesday.

The two sides shot down one another’s aircraft on Wednesday, and shots have been fired on both sides of the disputed region.

“Everyone is worried with respect to the ongoing hostility and the tension that has escalated in the last two, three days,” said Mumtaz Khan, a member of the Kashmiri Canadian Cultural Association who hails from the Pakistani side of Kashmir.

Key moments from Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony:

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s introduction: For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of.

On an interaction with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: PM: I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

On a conversation with Privy Clerk Michael Wernick: He said that the PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate toolbox. The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. He said, “I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

On a meeting with Finance Minister Bill Morneau: Still on September 19, I spoke to Minister Morneau on this matter when we were in the House. He again stressed the need to save jobs, and I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop – that they were inappropriate.

In a text message with chief of staff Jessica Prince about an interaction with adviser Gerald Butts: Gerry said, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do! Don’t care about the PPSC’s independence. Katie was like “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.” … They kept being like “we aren’t lawyers, but there has to be some solution here”.’

“If they don’t get a DPA they will leave Montreal,” Wilson-Raybould said she was told about SNC-Lavalin and the need to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with the Montreal company — Steven Chase (@stevenchase) February 27, 2019

Wilson-Raybould thanks Canadians for their patience during the weeks since The Globe broke the initial story on Feb. 7.

The DPA that Ms. Wilson-Raybould is referencing is a “deferred prosecution agreement” or remediation agreement that provides an alternative to prosecution. In such deals, a company accepts responsibility for the wrongdoing and pays a financial penalty, relinquishes benefits gained from the wrongdoing and puts in place compliance measures. It was introduced in 2018 as an amendement to the Criminal Code.

“It is unfair that the actions of one or more rogue employees should tarnish a company’s reputation, as well as jeopardize its future success and its employees’ livelihoods,” SNC argued in a brief to federal officials in October, 2017.

All bets are now off about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's political survival.

An ethics scandal has plunged Canada's government into disarray, with the prime minister himself facing unprecedented political peril.

Story Continued Below

A flood of new details allege Trudeau and several senior government officials repeatedly pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large construction company and reach a settlement agreement. Trudeau's political opponents sent police a letter Thursday requesting an investigation and called for Trudeau's resignation.

""He can no longer, and in good standing with a clear conscience, lead this nation,"" said Conservative Andrew Scheer, who hopes to replace Trudeau.

The prime minister brushed off that request and said Canadians will have a chance to judge him for themselves in an election this fall.

Until recently, his reelection appeared to be nearly a lock. The latest polls now show him slipping into a tight race — and those surveys don't even capture the latest influx of damaging detail.

""It’s like someone threw the chessboard into the air,"" said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. ""The pieces haven’t landed yet. ... This was already a close race. [Trudeau's Liberals] couldn’t afford to stumble. And, yesterday was much more than a stumble.""

The turning point was testimony Wednesday at a spectacular Justice Committee hearing in the Canadian House of Commons: On the same day Michael Cohen torched President Donald Trump at a committee hearing, a spurned ally of Trudeau's was scorching him too.

Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was dropped by Trudeau but continues to sit in his party’s caucus, broke her silence after weeks of speculation about what she might say.

In painstaking detail she demolished the talking point from the government that Trudeau played no role in pressuring her to cut a plea deal with a Montreal-based company. Wilson-Raybould described and shared notes from about 10 meetings and 10 phone calls with 11 senior members of the government, including Trudeau. She said after she repeatedly fought pressure last fall from officials in Trudeau's office and other departments to deliver a non-prosecution agreement, the prime minister brought it up with her.

She said Trudeau noted in a meeting last September that the company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major, longstanding employer in his home town.

Wilson-Raybould also said the prime minister and others raised the suggestion that cutting a deal could help the provincial wing of their Liberal party in an election last October, which it ultimately lost.

""At that point the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am [a member of Parliament] in Quebec.' ... I was quite taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould said. ""My response — and I vividly remember this as well — was to ask the prime minister a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked, 'Are you politically interfering with my role?'""

She said Trudeau said he wasn't interfering.

But she was soon demoted to a lesser role in the cabinet, replaced with a new attorney general from Trudeau's home town, and she recently quit her cabinet post.

Wilson-Raybould, who remains a member of Parliament, told the committee hearing that she was, ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,"" the Watergate purging of the Justice Department.

The sole bright spot on the darkest day of Trudeau's term came when the former minister was asked whether Trudeau or others had committed a crime.

""I don't believe that,"" she replied.

The opposition seized the moment anyway: The Conservative leader hoping to replace Trudeau in an election later this year sent police a letter requesting an investigation.

Scheer asked the Mounties to investigate whether the acts described violated two criminal code items: one on obstruction of justice, the other against pressuring the attorney general. The RCMP has not commented.

He also called on Trudeau to resign.

“I was sickened and appalled by [the] story of inappropriate, and frankly bordering on illegal, pressure,” Scheer said. ""Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet must now find a way forward, without him. … They have a duty to govern this nation, not help a disgraced prime minister hang onto power.”

Trudeau disputed the characterization of events, but did not deny asking her to spare the company. He insisted he never directed the minister to drop charges.

“There are disagreements in perspective on this,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""But I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

He also sidestepped questions about calling a broader public inquiry, beyond ongoing parliamentary and ethics investigations.

One option available in theory is an early election.

If the opposition wants Trudeau gone, and if Trudeau said his fate is ultimately up to voters, they could call for an early election. The current election is officially set for Oct. 21, but the Canadian constitution allows a vote at any time.

Several members of the Trudeau government dismissed the idea. A spokesperson for the prime minister, Eleanore Catenaro, said Trudeau squashed the idea of an early election call in a December interview.

""His comments still stand,"" Catenaro said.

And asked about early election talk, Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said Thursday: “[There's been] none that I’ve heard.""

Minister of Innovation Navdeep Bains was with Trudeau at a press conference announcing a 24-year Canadian commitment to NASA's deep-space exploration project.

He sounded a similar note.

“We’re just focused on our mandate,"" Bains said in an interview. ""We’re focused on executing our work for Canadians.”

View full coverage on Google News","OTTAWA – Jody Wilson-Raybould has accepted the House Justice Committee's invitation to testify on the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair on Wednesday, now that the government has waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence.

Her appearance will be the first time she speaks publicly and in detail in the 20 days since the allegations of political pressure being placed on her by members of the PMO in regards to an ongoing criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, were reported in The Globe and Mail.

Wilson-Raybould sent a letter to the committee Tuesday afternoon confirming she’d testify at 3:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday, which was the time the committee had requested.

Leaving the building where her lawyer has an office, CTV News asked Wilson-Raybould whether she felt satisfied with the terms under which she’s been permitted to speak, and she did not respond.

In requesting she attend imminently, the committee cited the Order in Council that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued Monday evening. The committee said it now has the clarity on confidence, privilege, and a parliamentary convention known as ""sub judice"" which deals with speaking about cases currently before the courts. These were issues that both Wilson-Raybould and the MPs who are conducting the probe were looking for more legal assurances on before having her appear.

The committee has agreed to a request Wilson-Raybould made in writing on Monday: that she be granted an ""extended opening statement"" lasting 30 minutes during which she would be able to go through everything she recalls about communications she was involved in regarding SNC-Lavalin. Most opening statements at committees are limited to 10 minutes.

The meeting is currently scheduled to span two hours, most of which will be Wilson-Raybould taking questions from MPs, and will take place inside one of the new committee meeting rooms in West Block. Wilson-Raybould is the only witness scheduled for the meeting.

""We're pleased to hear her take on things,"" said committee chair Anthony Housefather. ""I think it's important to the members of the committee to do our work, and to Canadians to hear from Ms. Wilson-Raybould, and I'm happy she’s agreed to come tomorrow,"" he said.

NDP MP Nathan Cullen said her testimony is ""pivotal,"" but expressed frustration that she was appearing in the afternoon, and not before the final prime minister's question period for a few weeks. On Wednesdays when he is in town, Trudeau takes every question asked during question period. Cullen said this could mean that the opposition won't have the ability to put to Trudeau what Wilson-Raybould has to say, until mid-March when the House of Commons reconvenes after a two-week hiatus where MPs are in their ridings.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said she'll be asking Wilson-Raybould whether in her view the pressure was appropriate and for more detail about many aspects of the entire affair from her perspective.

""The unanswered question I have is why did she resign? What was it either in what Mr. Lametti said or in what the prime minister said that caused her to realize she didn't have the confidence of the cabinet any longer?"" Raitt said.

In her Monday letter Wilson-Raybould said that she is ""anxious"" to appear and wrote that she'd be happy to stay for as long as the committee wishes to answer questions. Last week in the House of Commons she rose to say that she hopes she would be granted the ability to “speak my truth,” in relation to the allegations.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on his way to Tuesday morning's cabinet meeting that he is ""pleased"" that Wilson-Raybould will be able to ""share her perspective.""

""It's important that people get an opportunity to testify or share their point of view at committee. As we said, waving the privilege, waiving cabinet confidentiality is something that we had to take very seriously,” Trudeau said.

""It's just important that she speak and that all of the mystery goes. This is important for all of us to get on with our work,"" said Crown Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett on her way out of cabinet on Tuesday. ""There is a view that in terms of the story, we need to hear her side of it,"" she said.

Over the last few weeks the opposition parties have focused in on this scandal, with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calling it a ""textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the prime minister's office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice."" The opposition Conservatives and New Democrats have sought to have Trudeau and several senior PMO staff believed to be central to the story testify, and a public inquiry called, with no success.

Tuesday, Government House Leader Bardish Chagger criticized the opposition and its messaging throughout this ongoing controversy.

""Once upon a time it was a message that 'oh the committee will never meet on this issue.' They're meeting on this issue. Then we started talking about 'oh, witnesses will never be allowed to appear.' Witnesses are appearing. They’re being asked tough questions. 'Oh, the former Attorney General will not be allowed to appear.' Guess what? She is appearing. 'Oh the Prime Minister is not going to let her speak.' The Prime Minister has done whatever he can to work with the current Attorney General to ensure that the opportunity is there,"" Chagger said.

'There were contacts between lawyers'

On his way into cabinet Tuesday morning, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti said that, before waiving attorney-client privilege and cabinet confidence, federal lawyers were in touch with Wilson-Raybould's counsel.

""It is fair to say that there were contacts between lawyers but I won't go any further than that,"" Lametti told reporters Tuesday morning.

In her letter of resignation as Veterans Affairs Minister Wilson-Raybould said she retained former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell to provide advice on speaking publicly about the scandal. Up until now she has maintained solicitor-client privilege as the reason she’s been unable to speak to the allegations.

This specific waiver only permits Wilson-Raybould to speak about the matter to the House Justice Committee, however, as part of its study into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and to the federal ethics commissioner who has also launched an investigation.

""We have, I believe as a government, worked to demonstrate transparency as well as balancing the fact that there is ongoing litigation we do not want to compromise, so we feel we’ve done that with this agreement,"" Lametti said.

The government made the directive in an Order in Council posted Monday evening. The order authorizes her, as well as ""any person who directly participated in discussions with her,"" to speak to the committee and ethics commissioner, about the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The order relates to any information or communications that have to do with Wilson-Raybould's time as the attorney general and exercising her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, and only in regards to the two ongoing probes of the matter, and not a blanket permission for Wilson-Raybould to speak.

As well, the order states that Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel is exempted from this waiving of privilege and any information or conversations between Wilson-Raybould and Roussel cannot be disclosed, ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" the prime minister's office states in the Order in Council.

Recap on the story so far

On Feb. 7, citing unnamed sources, The Globe and Mail reported that Trudeau's office pressed Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general. It was alleged that the PMO wanted Wilson-Raybould to instruct federal prosecutors to change course and pursue a remediation agreement rather than criminal prosecution in the corruption and fraud case against the Quebec engineering and construction giant. CTV News has not independently verified the story.

Remediation agreements — or Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) — can include having the company accept responsibility, denounce the wrongdoing, vow to implement corrective measures, and pay financial penalties.

In contrast, if the company was criminally convicted it would be banned from securing Canadian government contracts for a decade, potentially putting jobs on the line.

When she was attorney general, Wilson-Raybould had the ability to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to take a different route with the charges against SNC-Lavalin but she did not, despite several meetings and conversations before and after federal prosecutors decided to carry on with the criminal case in the fall.

In January, Wilson-Raybould was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, and was replaced as attorney general and justice minister by David Lametti, a Quebec MP. Wilson-Raybould accepted her new position, but then resigned from cabinet days after the Globe story broke amid the opposition framing this as her being demoted for not changing her position on a deferred prosecution.

The House Justice Committee began probing the matter last week. As part of the study the committee has already heard from Lametti, his deputy minister, and top bureaucrat Michael Wernick, who gave blunt and detailed testimony in which he sought to reframe the Globe report, saying that while it's likely Wilson-Raybould could have felt pressured, it's a question of whether that constitutes as ""inappropriate pressure,"" or pressure that comes with being part of the inner circle that makes key decisions with national implications.

Then on Monday the committee heard from a slate of academic witnesses on the underlying legal aspects at the heart of the affair. These include the legal provision known as remediation or deferred prosecution agreements, which were tucked into a recent omnibus bill following heavy SNC-Lavalin lobbying, and the Shawcross doctrine; which has to do with the independence of the attorney general in making decisions.

These witnesses offered their hypothetical perspectives about the propriety of attorney generals making prosecutorial decisions, when the various principles are activated, and the balance of seeking advice from cabinet colleagues without succumbing to or factoring in politics.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a legal counsel with Woodward and Company LLP, and law professor at the University of British Columbia, told the committee that what needs to be understood is how the situation unfolded.

""If the purpose was to persuade the attorney general as chief prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern, and how will we know whether that’s serious or not? Well, obviously you need to hear from those who may have been involved,"" Turpel-Lafond told the committee on Monday.

To date, the government maintains that nothing improper occurred, though Trudeau's principal secretary resigned over the matter on Feb. 18, denying any wrongdoing.

Canada’s Prime Minister is facing intense pressure to reveal exactly what he knows about whether officials from his office inappropriately pressured a former cabinet minister to interfere with a prosecution on construction giant SNC-Lavalin. Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s former justice secretary and attorney general, has said she hopes to “tell her truth” when she appears before the Commons’ justice committee later today amid accusations ‘a line was clearly crossed’.

Ms Wilson-Raybould quit the Cabinet last month and is consulting lawyers as to what she can say on the scandal. Last week, Canada’s top civil servant Michael Wernick denied any wrongdoing when he testified to the justice committee but admitted Ms Wilson-Raybould would likely “express concern” about a series of meetings on SNC-Lavalin when she speaks. Mr Singh, head of Canada’s third biggest party, said his by-election victory “allows me to ramp up the pressure on Mr Trudeau and on the Liberal government”.

Jagmeet Singh has promised to 'ramp up the pressure' on Justin Trudeau

He added: “It allows me to really put into focus the question, ‘Is this Liberal government more interest in helping their well-connected, powerful friends like SNC-Lavalin?’”. The 40-year-old has made waves in Canadian politics as the first person of a minority ethnic group to become leader of a major party. Mr Singh was chosen to replace Tom Mulcair in October last year as the former NDP leader lost a leadership review.

He finally won a Commons seat by seizing Vancouver constituency Burnaby South with 39 percent of the vote this week. The win means he can now face Mr Trudeau in parliament directly, joining opposition Conservative calls for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair. Mr Trudeau has dismissed a full-scale investigation, saying the Ethics Commissioner’s examination into events is enough to answer Canadians’ questions.

A former Canadian justice minister says she faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.

Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed repeatedly to ""find a solution"" for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

PM Justin Trudeau said he disagreed with the minister's testimony and he and his staff acted appropriately.

Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has called on him to resign.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" the Conservative leader told reporters, adding that he was calling for a full police investigation.

What did the former minister say?

Speaking to the House of Commons justice committee, the former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff faced four months of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the Quebec-based engineering and construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

It was an option rejected in September by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada - an independent authority whose main objective is to prosecute federal offences - and one she supported.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said she and her aides were pulled into multiple conversations and meetings - ""a barrage of people hounding me and my staff"" - with Mr Trudeau, senior aides from his office and the finance department, and a top bureaucrat.

In those various meetings, they repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial long after that decision had been made.

""Within these conversations, there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

Mr Trudeau's Liberals have struggled to contain the controversy over the past three weeks.

Though she has been a key figure at the centre of the affair, Ms Wilson-Raybould had not yet not spoken publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege.

That privilege was waived by the government on Monday, paving the way for her appearance before the committee on Wednesday.

What has happened so far?

This began in early February, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on allegations of political interference in the case against SNC-Lavalin.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced repeated questions about the matter from opposition parties

The newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources, that Mr Trudeau's office pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to push the public prosecution service to consider a deferred prosecution agreement.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was attorney general and justice minister until January, when she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, a move widely seen as a demotion.

An attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function.

On 12 February, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet, though she remains a Liberal member of Parliament.

Finally on 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide Gerald Butts announced he was resigning, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff did anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the ""vital work"" being done by the team.

Mr Trudeau and his officials have denied anything improper took place but have struggled to contain the crisis.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, he said he was worried about jobs at SNC Lavalin and how pensioners would be affected.

Opinion polls indicate the matter is beginning to hurt the Liberals with months to go until the coming general election.

What is happening with SNC Lavalin?

The Quebec-based firm is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The agreement - similar to regimes in the US and the UK - essentially suspends prosecution while allowing a firm to agree instead to alternative terms or conditions.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, was detained in Vancouver last December and is under house arrest. In late January the US Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Meng is due to appear in a Vancouver court at 10 am Pacific time (1800 GMT) on March 6, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing. “Today, department of Justice Canada officials issued an authority to proceed, formally commencing an extradition process in the case of Ms. Meng Wanzhou,” the government said in a statement.

China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated badly over the affair, denounced the decision and repeated previous demands for Meng’s release. U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said Washington thanked the Canadian government for its assistance. “We greatly appreciate Canada’s steadfast commitment to the rule of law,” she said in a statement.

Legal experts had predicted the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would give the go-ahead for extradition proceedings, given the close judicial relationship between Canada and the United States.

But it could be years before Meng is sent to the United States, since Canada’s slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.

A final decision will likely come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.

Professor Wesley Wark of the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs said “the Canadians will take a beating throughout this whole process” from China.

“I suspect the Trudeau government is desperately hoping that the Americans reach a deal with the Chinese,” he said by phone.

U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene if it served national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China, prompting Ottawa to stress the extradition process should not be politicized. Last week Trump played down the idea of dropping the charges.

After Meng’s detention, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds, and a Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian man who previously had only been jailed for drug smuggling.

Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who served two postings in China, said Beijing was likely to retaliate further.

“They’re not going to take this lying down … one shudders to think what the consequences could be,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, saying Beijing might crack down on Canadian canola shipments or stop Chinese students from going to Canada.

Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.

“The Chinese side is utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the issuance of (the) authority to proceed,” the embassy in Ottawa said in a statement. Beijing had earlier questioned the state of judicial independence in Canada, noting the government faces accusations that it tried to intervene to stop a corruption trial.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied wrongdoing after he tried to shield one of the country's biggest firms from a corruption trial.

Mr Trudeau said any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

In explosive testimony, ex-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said she faced ""sustained"" pressure to abandon prosecution of the Quebec-based firm.

Opposition Conservatives are calling on the Liberal PM to resign.

They are also demanding a public inquiry following Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday before the Commons justice committee in Ottawa.

How did Trudeau defend himself?

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with his former justice minister's ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

The prime minster said he had full confidence in an inquiry by a parliamentary justice committee into the affair and in an investigation by the federal ethics commissioner, and would ""participate fully"" in that process.

Opposition parties have been ramping up pressure on the prime minister and the Conservatives have said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police must immediately open an investigation.

Mr Trudeau said that to his knowledge no member of his staff has been contacted by the RCMP.

The prime minster has insisted for weeks that all communications between himself, federal officials and Ms Wilson-Raybould were above board.

He says that any advocacy for SNC-Lavalin was done in the interest of protecting Canadian jobs that no lines were crossed.

What does the ex-justice minister allege?

Ms Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee on Wednesday she had faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for the Montreal construction firm.

The former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff endured four months - between last September and December - of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that while some discussions about the ramifications of the decision were normal, the pressure went well beyond what was appropriate given her role as attorney general.

In Canada, an attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function and decisions are not supposed to be politically motivated.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that in various meetings, Mr Trudeau and senior staff repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial.

She said she had made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial and that she believes it was why she was demoted in a Cabinet shuffle in January, which Mr Trudeau denies.

Ms Wilson-Raybould also said during her testimony she did not believe any laws were broken.

What is SNC-Lavalin accused of?

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to about C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001-11.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings have begun and the company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

A conviction on fraud and corruption charges could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on federal contracts, which would be a major financial hit for the firm.

What's the company background?

SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies and employs some 9,000 people in Canada.

The firm has deep roots in the vote-rich province of Quebec, which is expected to be a battleground in this October's general election.

This is not the first time SNC-Lavalin has found itself in trouble.

In 2016, the agency that oversees Canadian federal elections said former executives had devised a scheme to illegally donate C$118,000 to the federal Liberals and Conservatives between 2004-11. The bulk of the funds went to the prime minister's Liberal Party.

In 2013, the World Bank barred the firm and its affiliates for up to 10 years from bidding on contracts with the agency for ""misconduct"" in a bridge contract in Bangladesh, the longest debarment period ever handed down in a settlement.

How bad is this for Trudeau?

Political commentators suggest Ms Wilson-Raybould's remarks are deeply damaging for Mr Trudeau and the Liberals.

Writing in the Toronto Star, columnist Chantal Hebert says the prime minister was ""already up to his neck in the SNC-Lavalin mess"".

""On Wednesday, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould pushed his head down further. It will be harder for the Liberal government to dig itself out of the deep hole she dug before the next campaign.""

In the National Post, columnist Andrew Coyne said Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony suggested ""an attitude that appears to pervade this government: that the law is not an institution to be revered, but just another obstacle to get around, by whatever means necessary.""

Columnist Patrick Lagace, writing in Montreal newspaper La Presse, said her remarks suggest that ""for the Prime Minister and people acting on his orders, the rule of law and the independence of the Attorney General were at least negotiable"".

In Maclean's magazine, Paul Wells suggests her remarks reveal a ""sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along"".",SNC-Lavalin: Trudeau denies wrongdoing in corruption case - BBC News,Bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47362657

It’s risky to predict how this will all play out, both in the short term and for October’s federal election. That’s in part because those outcomes will likely be affected by a series of investigations, both active and proposed, into the actions of the prime minister and his aides.

Here’s a look at who’s seeking answers, what they could uncover, and who else might still take a peek:

What’s Already Underway

• Parliamentary hearings: The House of Commons’ Standing Committee on Justice is where Ms. Wilson-Raybould finally broke her silence this week. It’s also where other key players are set to appear, notably Gerald Butts, Mr. Trudeau’s friend who stepped down last month as his top political adviser amid the scandal.

But the justice committee isn’t set up to run a full-scale investigation. It has neither a team of people digging up evidence, nor the power to order up internal government documents.

And, as the opposition has repeatedly pointed out this week, the Liberals control the committee. This makes it unlikely that anything the panel does will inflict much harm on Mr. Trudeau.",Canada Letter: Who’s Investigating Justin Trudeau — and What Do They Hope to Find?,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/world/canada/justin-trudeau-snc-lavalin.html
344,Empty,2019-02-28T16:53:12Z,PM's government has been rocked by allegation that undue pressure was put on the country's former attorney general.,"Canada's Conservative opposition leader has called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign following allegations that his administration meddled in the prosecution of a major engineering firm, which is accused of committing fraud.

Andrew Scheer said late on Wednesday that Trudeau ""has lost moral authority to govern"" and ""must resign"" at once.

""Mr Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,"" he added.

For weeks, Trudeau's government has been rocked by allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper that undue pressure was put on Jody Wilson-Raybould, the country's former attorney general, for an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

Earlier on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau's inner circle of pressuring her to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, one of the world's top construction and engineering firms based in Montreal.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin,"" Wilson-Raybould told a committee in the House of Commons.

She also told the committee that she faced ""veiled threats"" and advice from Canada's top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, that ""a collision with the prime minister on these matters should be avoided"".

Wilson-Raybould, who was also minister of justice, said she believes she was shuffled to another portfolio in January over her refusal to take action in the case.

Trudeau responded that he ""completely disagrees with the former attorney general's characterisation of events"".

When asked about calls for his resignation, Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday that ""Canadians will have a very clear choice in a few months time about who they want to be prime minister of this country and what party they want to form government"". Parliamentary elections are scheduled for October.

On Thursday, Trudeau won the public support of a top political ally, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside the Liberal Party to remove him.

""I have 100 percent faith in the prime minister,"" said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of the most prominent members of Trudeau's Cabinet.

Alleged bribery

SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Muammar Gaddafi's reign.

The firm, its international arm and another subsidiary are accused of having offered $36m in bribes to officials and of defrauding the Libyan government of $98m.

The charges relate to the world's largest irrigation project - the Great Man Made River Project, which aimed to provide fresh water to the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi and Sirte.

SNC-Lavalin has argued that those responsible for alleged wrongdoing left it long ago, and that holding it accountable for their criminal actions would severely hurt its business.

The company heavily lobbied the government, including senior officials in Trudeau's office, for an out-of-court settlement that would include paying a fine and agreeing to put in place compliance measures.

Trial set to proceed

But Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

She quit Trudeau's cabinet earlier this month. Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerry Butts also resigned days later. Questions remain over their specific reasons for leaving.

151020173419586

Trudeau has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, saying again Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make"", which she confirmed in her testimony.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould testified, ""The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution for SNC, citing that if there is no DPA (deferred prosecution agreement), there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal.""

She added, ""I told him that I had done my due diligence and had made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the director (of public prosecutions).""

Wilson-Raybould went on to say that 11 government officials, including the finance minister, raised similar concerns that SNC-Lavalin might move its headquarters to London without a deal, or could face massive job losses if it was found guilty at trial - in an election year.

They ""urged me to take partisan political considerations into account, which was clearly improper,"" she said.

She added that they continued to ""hound"" her from September to December after she made her decision not to offer SNC-Lavalin a deal and had made it known.

That pressure was ""not illegal"", she opined, but ""raised serious red flags in my view"".",Canadian opposition leader calls on Trudeau to resign,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/canadian-opposition-leader-calls-trudeau-resign-190228113038516.html

Trudeau's domestic troubles have attracted attention in Chinese state media due to his previous assertion that his government cannot interfere in the case of a senior Huawei executive arrested in Canada and now fighting extradition to the United States.

Canada is likely to announce on Friday that an extradition hearing against Meng Wanzhou, the telecommunication giant's chief financial officer, can proceed, legal experts said, worsening already icy relations with Beijing.

China has repeatedly called for the release of Meng, arrested in Vancouver in December at Washington's request. In late January the U.S. Justice Department charged Huawei and Meng with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

At a regular daily news briefing in Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry took the opportunity to take Canada to task over possible double standards, by commenting on a domestic Canadian political issue that does not otherwise involve China.

Trudeau has disputed allegations by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

Asked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Trudeau to say he couldn't interfere in Meng's case while his government is accused of trying to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he ""really liked this question.""

""Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,"" Lu said.

""In fact on this case you have mentioned, people in Canada are paying it a great deal of attention,"" he added. ""In fact, not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.""

Both Meng and Huawei have denied the U.S. allegations.

Ottawa has until midnight on Friday to announce whether it will issue an authority to proceed, which would allow a court in British Columbia to start a formal extradition hearing.

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has stressed that Canada is a ""rule of law"" country and is acting without political interference in the extradition case of Meng.

""In the Meng case, our government has been scrupulous,"" she said during an interview Thursday with CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning. ""Decisions that are correctly taken at the official, ie. non-political level have been scrupulously taken at the official, non-political level, and there has been no interference, political element to the decision.""

Ottawa strongly objects to the tariffs, which Trump imposed last year citing security concerns, and has pressed many times for them to be removed.

“The Prime Minister raised the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs and expressed the need for the removal of tariffs,” a statement from Trudeau’s office said.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Thursday he was working hard to persuade Trump that the U.S. steel industry could be adequately protected by tariff rate quotas, rather than plain tariffs, on imports from Canada and Mexico.

Canadian industry officials say they are opposed to the idea of quotas.

Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said on Sunday that Canada might find it hard to ratify a new continental free trade pact unless the measures were lifted beforehand. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement was concluded last October.

Yet despite the pressure campaign, two Canadian industry sources with close ties to Washington said they had heard nothing to suggest a breakthrough was near.

“There are no talks planned on this right now,” said one of the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Canada is the single largest supplier of both aluminum and steel to the United States. Washington worries that countries could try to ship supplies through Canada and pretend the metals had been produced in Canadian facilities.

A government official said the final decision was Trump’s so it was hard to predict what might happen.

“We’re starting to see that there’s an understanding in the United States, that this is something that is a really difficult sticking point with Canada,” said the official.","Canada PM speaks to Trump about tariffs, sources see little progress",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-steel-canada-idUSKCN1QI4Z5

Jared Kushner’s clearance level raises questions; Canada’s prime minister faces an ill-timed accusation.

Trump reportedly gave his son-in-law top clearance

Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, got a top-secret security clearance despite objections from key White House officials because the president himself ordered it, according to a report Thursday from the New York Times. [NYT / Maggie Haberman, Michael S. Schmidt, Adam Goldman, and Annie Karni]

Trump has the “absolute right” to grant security clearances, according to a response from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Friday — and she’s right. However, it’s a problem if Trump denied White House recommendations and gave the clearance anyway. Conway did not reveal whether she knew if Trump had ordered the top clearance for Kushner. [The Hill / Jordan Fabian]

The House Oversight Committee started an investigation into clearances in January. Following this week’s report, committee chair Elijah Cummings announced on Friday he wants to dig deeper into the matter. The White House has not initiated any interviews with the committee concerning the matter, nor made materials that refute reports of its clearance practices available. [NPR / Philip Ewing]

Kushner had an “interim top-secret” clearance that was demoted to a “secret” level in February 2018. His initial clearance was delayed when the FBI and CIA questioned Kushner’s business contacts in foreign countries, including Israel and Russia. He apparently also did not disclose meetings with foreign actors. Kushner met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this week. [Vanity Fair / Bess Levin]

Both President Trump and Ivanka Trump have defended Kushner, who has been traveling from country to country in the effort to forge a Middle East peace plan. As he meets with top officials abroad, his potentially top-security clearance is important. The extent to which he can negotiate with America’s secrets is not known. [NYMag / Frank Rich]

Trudeau denies turning a trial into a political issue

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied accusations that he interfered in a legal case — just eight months before a national election. Trudeau’s former justice minister and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould testified on Thursday that the PM and his colleagues pushed her to not prosecute a top employer in the Quebec province. [WSJ / Paul Vieira and Kim Mackrael]

Trudeau’s political opponents also issued a letter on Thursday calling for an investigation and the PM’s resignation. This came one day after Wilson-Raybould testified that she had been pursuing corruption charges against the construction firm SNC-Lavalin when Trudeau pressured her to arrange a plea deal with the company, an employer in his hometown. [Politico / Alexander Panetta]

Wilson-Raybould provided notes from phone calls and meetings in which Trudeau and his aides tried to convince her that prosecuting the company would threaten Canadian jobs — and important votes. SNC-Lavalin reportedly faces charges for $36 million in bribes it allegedly offered Libyan officials. [BBC]

On top of it all, China is using the SNC-Lavalin case to talk about Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of the mobile giant Huawei. Trudeau claims Wanzhou was arrested in compliance with an extradition treaty with the US and his country won’t interfere in the case. On Friday, a Chinese Communist Party spokesperson was asked if it were hypocritical that Trudeau would interfere with the SNC-Lavalin case but deny getting involved in the Huawei case. The spokesperson replied that attention was on the precedent Canada would set. [Washington Post / Emily Rauhala]

Now Trudeau’s prime ministership faces a rocky future. Wilson-Raybould was demoted after the SNC-Lavalin situation, and she later quit the cabinet. Trudeau admitted that he asked the former AG to protect the company but said he didn’t pressure her. Opposition could call for an early election to be held before October 2019.

350,Empty,2019-02-25T14:46:09Z,Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wants Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to appear as a witness at the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"The Trudeau government issued a broad waiver on Monday allowing former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell the Commons justice committee details of her conversations with government officials about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an order-in-council (OIC) posted online, the government says Wilson-Raybould — ""and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin"" — can report to the committee and to the federal ethics commissioner any cabinet confidences ""in any information or communications that were directly discussed with her respecting the exercise of that authority while she held that office.""

The OIC also ""waives ... to the extent they apply, solicitor-client privilege and any other relevant duty of confidentiality to the Government of Canada"" regarding what Wilson-Raybould discussed with other government officials as justice minister ""respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin while she held that office.""

The waiver does not extend, however, to any communications between Wilson-Raybould and the director of public prosecutions on SNC-Lavalin while she was justice minister — ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" says the text of the order.

The order sets the stage for what could be an extraordinary session of the justice committee. Wilson-Raybould was expected to speak before the committee this week; a time has not yet been set for her appearance.

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya — and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet entirely on Feb. 12. She's offered no comment since on the SNC-Lavalin affair or the company's attempts to secure a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution, arguing that she's still bound by solicitor-client confidentiality from her time as federal attorney general.

The OIC clears a few things up in advance of Wilson-Raybould's appearance before the committee. The ex-minister, who said she is ""anxious"" to testify before the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, wrote to committee chair Liberal MP Anthony Housefather today saying it would be useful for the committee to have an ""authoritative statement"" on the scope of what she can say prior to her appearance.

""I am anxious to appear at the first available time,"" she wrote. ""However, I believe that in advance of my appearance the members of the committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.""

Wilson-Raybould, who has retained retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell as counsel, also requested an extended period of 30 minutes to make an opening statement to the committee.

Under pressure to waive solicitor-client privilege for his former justice minister and attorney general, Trudeau said earlier today Wilson-Raybould would be given leeway to speak.

Earlier today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to testify at the committee, insisting Canadians should be outraged by the allegations of political interference in a criminal case.

A motion tabled by the Conservatives said Trudeau should be called to answer questions given his ""alleged direct involvement in a sustained effort to influence SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution."" It called on the prime minister to appear at a two-hour televised committee under oath sometime before Mar. 15.

The motion was defeated in the Commons this evening.

During a news conference on Parliament Hill Monday, Scheer described the SNC-Lavalin affair as an unprecedented attempt to alter the course of justice through political interference.

""Politicians don't get to execute our justice system,"" he said.

""What we've seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption, with those at the very top of the Prime Minister's Office implicated in what could be the obstruction of justice.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer outlines the motion he will introduce calling on the Prime Minister to appear before the Justice Committee . 1:25

It's rare for a prime minister to appear before a committee.

On Sept. 7, 2006, then-prime minister Stephen Harper appeared before a special committee on Senate reform.

Former prime ministers have occasionally appeared before Commons committee hearings. Former prime minister Paul Martin appeared before a committee on the Kelowna Accord on Nov. 9, 2006 and Brian Mulroney spoke before a committee looking into the Airbus settlement on Dec. 13, 2007.

Last week, Canada's top civil servant Michael Wernick told the justice committee that he warned Wilson-Raybould that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Trudeau said Friday that Wernick is an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council,"" the PM said. ""His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

In September 2018, the government amended the Criminal Code to allow for remediation agreements, enabling prosecutors to use them as an alternative to a criminal trial ""at their discretion to address specified economic crimes if they consider it to be in the public interest and appropriate in the circumstances,"" according to the Department of Justice website.

If the accused organization upholds the terms and conditions of the agreement, charges can be stayed and a criminal prosecution avoided.

Shawcross doctrine

According to the government website, the purpose of remediation agreements is to denounce wrongdoing and hold the organization to account, while reducing harm to innocent employees, shareholders and other third parties. The organization would have to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing and pay a financial penalty.

In the case of SNC-Lavalin, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada opted not to pursue a remediation agreement and chose instead to proceed with prosecution. It advised the company of that decision on Sept. 4, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould, as attorney general at the time, had authority to override the decision and halt prosecution. Wernick confirmed last week several meetings were held on the topic — including a telephone call on Dec. 19 he initiated, during which he warned Wilson-Raybould of the economic consequences of prosecuting a company that employs about 9,000 people.

He insisted there was never ""inappropriate"" interference.

According to the so-called Shawcross doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Delay advising investors

Arguing in favour of calling Trudeau to speak to the committee, Conservative justice critic and deputy leader Lisa Raitt said it's in the public interest to have the prime minister testify in order to bring together the various threads of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Raitt also asked why SNC-Lavalin was told of the prosecutor's decision on Sept. 4 but didn't disclose that information to its shareholders until Oct. 10.

""Who in the Prime Minister's Office, what cabinet minister, or even did the prime minister give assurances to SNC-Lavalin that they would not have to disclose a material fact to their shareholders because they were going to sort it all out?"" she asked.

Five legal experts appeared before the committee today; some couched their comments by saying they don't have all the facts yet.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond is a senior associate counsel at Woodward and Company LLP and a professor at the Peter Allard School of Law, University of British Columbia. She told the committee the law imposes limits on anyone trying to influence an attorney general acting in the role of chief prosecutor.

'Crisis' in rule of law

""Those engaging in that must point to lawful authority that actually backs up their actions, and I would say the Shawcross doctrine is a flimsy authority,"" she said.

Turpel-Lafond said she believes it's important to hear from all of those involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair, not just Wilson-Raybould, because the situation is escalating to the level of a ""crisis in the rule of law.""

She said the RCMP integrity unit could investigate the matter — if it isn't doing so already — to determine if there was a ""subtext"" to the discussions between various officials and Wilson-Raybould regarding the criminal prosecution.

""If there's evidence that a prosecutor is fired and there was an attempt to influence or direct her attention to something that didn't have lawful authority, then it does raise the spectre of obstruction of justice, because obstruction of justice requires this sort of fear-favour element,"" she said.

Maxime St-Hilaire, associate professor at the Faculty of Law, Université de Sherbrooke, said he finds it difficult to understand how information conveyed to an attorney general would be useful after a decision had been made to not overturn a prosecution.

""If there are cabinet discussions after that decision has been made, then I find that quite difficult to understand,"" he said.

351,Empty,2019-03-01T14:42:07Z,Justin Trudeau announced the move Friday morning as part of a minor cabinet shuffle. The vacancy was created by Wilson-Raybould’s resignation last month.,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau drew his cabinet ranks tighter Friday with a mini-shuffle of existing ministers to fill the hole left by the departure of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Trudeau opted not to bring in any new faces from the ranks of his parliamentary secretaries or backbenchers, where the SNC-Lavalin scandal is fuelling nervousness about the government’s ability to navigate growing calls for an RCMP investigation or a judicial inquiry.

Instead, he installed P.E.I. cabinet minister and longtime Liberal MP Lawrence MacAulay to take over as veterans affairs minister on a full-time basis, two weeks after Wilson-Raybould — who had been shuffled into the portfolio in January — resigned from cabinet. Trudeau shifted Marie-Claude Bibeau from international development minister to the agriculture and agri-food portfolio, where she will replace MacAulay in managing the concerns of Quebec dairy farmers over international trade agreements like NAFTA. Maryam Monsef, who first stumbled as the minister for democratic reform, is moving up. The minister for women and gender equality will keep that file in addition to taking over the international development portfolio from Bibeau.

Friday’s shuffle came less than two months after the last one, which was ostensibly done to fill the vacancy left by the departure of Treasury Board president Scott Brison. That shuffle raised eyebrows with the surprise move of Wilson-Raybould out of the justice portfolio. Now the January shuffle and allegations of a high-level campaign pressuring Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal proceeding against SNC-Lavalin are at the heart of a controversy that has put the Liberal government on the defensive. Trudeau joined Governor General Julie Payette at Rideau Hall for the quick ceremony to install the ministers in their new portfolios. “Lovely day, isn’t it,” he told reporters, declining to answer questions on the scandal that continues to roil his government. All three ministers said they were happy with their new jobs, and expressed full confidence in the prime minister’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, declaring cabinet solidarity was stronger than ever.

“I think actually it’s a moment for us to work even closer together and to focus on what’s really important to us,” said Bibeau.

“I see no problem with morale. We’ve got a job to do and we’re doing it,” said MacAulay. MacAulay, 73, was first elected to the House of Commons in 1988, and has served nine terms as MP. He has indicated he fully intends to run for re-election. He was also once Canada’s solicitor general.

352,Empty,2019-02-28T23:43:55Z,Ottawa lawmakers requested an emergency debate Thursday to discuss allegations Prime Minister Justin Trudeau inappropriately sought to influence decision to charge SNC Lavalin.,"In the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s stunning testimony to the Commons’ justice committee Wednesday, MPs spent Thursday evening debating the allegations that have prompted calls for a police investigation and demands for the prime minister to resign.

OTTAWA—Jody Wilson-Raybould’s charge that top officials sought to “politically interfere” in an ongoing criminal case has plunged the government into “crisis” and shaken the confidence of Canadians in the judicial process, opposition MPs said during an emergency debate Thursday.

“The sustained interference and undermining by the key members of the prime minister’s office at the direct direction of the prime minister is a line that is crossed,” said Angus (Timmins-James Bay).

NDP MP Charlie Angus said the issue “cuts to the very heart of the question of the independence of the judicial system.

Conservative and New Democrats heaped criticism on the Liberals for “putting political considerations ahead of the rule of law” amid revelations that officials leaned on Wilson-Raybould to mediate a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin .

In testimony to the justice committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould gave a detailed account of meetings and phone calls between her and her office and Trudeau, his top aides, the top bureaucrat and officials in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office.

Over four months last fall, “there was a sustained effort, an attempt to politically interfere with my discretion as the Attorney General of Canada. It was inappropriate,” Wilson-Raybould told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould had the power to intervene in the case and direct a remediated agreement for SNC-Lavalin, ensuring the company avoided criminal prosecution, which could have resulted in a 10-year ban on federal contracts.

Candice Bergen, the Conservative house leader, denounced Trudeau’s repeated denials that anything improper was done, accusing the prime minister of being evasive and refusing to “own up” to the allegations.

“This leaves us at a crisis,” Bergen said. “If we don’t have a prime minister who can be truthful, we can’t trust him to get to the bottom of this.”

Bergen (Portage-Lisgar) said that, from the start, the Liberals have stonewalled opposition efforts to get answers, refusing at first to call witnesses to the justice committee and had to be forced “kicking and screaming” to hold hearings on the matter.

Toronto Liberal MP Arif Virani, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, tried to defend the government. He was said it was “refreshing” to hear Wilson-Raybould’s “important” testimony.

He picked out elements from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, noting the former justice minister had affirmed it was always her decision whether to intervene, that it was okay to discuss job impacts and that she considered the interventions inappropriate, but not unlawful.

“She indicated that the state of our institutions, the independence of our processes was, indeed, strong,’ said Virani (Parkdale-High Park).

But Bergen mocked his depiction of her testimony, adding, “that sure wasn’t the testimony I heard.

“Her testimony was not refreshing; it was disturbing. It was sad. It was appalling,” Bergen said.

“We have a government that is being deceptive, that is not owning up to what they have done.”

Fellow Conservative MP Michael Cooper said that attempts by Trudeau’s aides and others to persuade Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal proceeding, “smells of obstruction of justice.

“They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew they what they were doing crossed the line. You know what? They didn’t care,” said Cooper (St.Albert-Edmonton).

Bloc Québécois MP Monique Pauzé (Repentigny) put a spotlight on the potential economic consequences if SNC-Lavalin is convicted of its charges and is slapped with a 10-year ban on federal contracts, putting some 9,000 jobs at risk.

“The only way we can save these is through a remediation agreement,” Pauzé said.

She branded Wilson-Raybould’s testimony as a “settling of scores” with the prime minister and questioned why the former attorney general refused to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“She didn’t answer the most fundamental question: Why did she decide not to use a remediation agreement, thus avoiding the loss of thousands of jobs,” Pauzé said.

“She had the power to do so and she choose not to use it.”",LIVE: Parliament holds emergency debate on Jody Wilson-Raybould’s allegations on SNC Lavalin,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/02/28/members-of-parlia.html

Liberal MPs, heading into a crucial re-election campaign, …","Jody Wilson-Raybould said she wanted to tell her truth on the SNC-Lavalin story. The story she told Wednesday at the Commons justice committee is so vastly different from everything the prime minister has said until now that the two versions simply can't be reconciled.

The former attorney general spoke of veiled threats if she didn't intervene in the criminal prosecution of the giant Montreal construction firm. She spoke of constant and sustained efforts over a four-month period last fall by some of the most powerful people in government to ensure SNC-Lavalin avoided a trial.

The pressure began right at the top, she said, starting with Justin Trudeau, his top adviser and the country's most senior bureaucrat.

All of them have denied doing, saying or counselling her to do anything improper.

Wilson-Raybould, citing from memory and what she called her ""copious"" note-taking, gave a very different view.

Disagreeing is, of course, part of any political discussion. But this is no ordinary disagreement over policy. This dispute exposes a clear rift inside cabinet, and inside the Liberal caucus.

'I was taken aback'

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould said the interventions, in some ten phone calls and an equal number of meetings, played on similar themes: SNC-Lavalin would pull out of Quebec. Jobs would be lost. She was pushed, on a number of occasions, to get an outside legal opinion.

Most significantly, Wilson-Raybould said she was told by Justin Trudeau on Sept. 17 that refusing to give the company the option of entering into a remediation agreement instead of standing trial would go over badly in Quebec, home to his own riding, where a provincial election was underway.

""I was taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould told the committee in her nearly 40-minute opening statement.

""My response, and I remember this vividly, was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked 'are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.""

WATCH | Wilson-Raybould says she experienced 'sustained pressure' on SNC-Lavalin

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the gov't to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion..."" 1:08

Trudeau, she added, said that wasn't his goal. That much, at least, is consistent with the prime minister's repeated statements that he assured her the decision on whether SNC-Lavalin is prosecuted was hers to make, and hers alone.

Except the efforts to get her to change her mind didn't end there, Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday, nor were they confined to the prime minister.

Wilson-Raybould stood her ground. She would not interfere. Less than a month later, she was out as attorney general, shuffled off to Veterans Affairs.

For a prime minister who has spent much of the past three weeks talking about his government's respect for democratic institutions, for the rule of law, Wilson-Raybould's testimony is more than her finally giving her side of a ""he said, she said.""

Her testimony gave Canadians a carefully constructed timeline, based on her own memory, detailed notes and transcripts of texts. Her testimony also gave the Opposition a political cudgel, which Conservative leader Andrew Scheer immediately seized as he called for a probe by the RCMP.

Trudeau also responded quickly, speaking to reporters in time for his rebuttal to be included in all the major newscasts and morning papers.

Canadians now have two dramatically different versions of what happened. Liberal MPs, heading into a crucial re-election campaign, are already choosing sides.

Challenged by her colleagues

At committee, Wilson-Raybould found herself in the odd position of being supported by opposition MPs on the committee, and challenged by her own colleagues in a hearing that featured six rounds of questions, lasting nearly four hours.

Liberal MPs peppered her with questions. Why didn't she resign last fall if she felt she was being pressured to override the decision to prosecute for political reasons? Why didn't she go the prime minister to complain? Does she still have confidence in the prime minister?

Conservatives and New Democrats praised her courage for speaking out.

""We have witnessed not a lesson in politics but a lesson in integrity,"" said New Democrat MP Charlie Angus.

NASA has made clear their plans to return humans to the Moon in the coming decade and one of their first steps to doing so involves the creation of the Gateway space station. This week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that Canada have now become NASA’s first international partner for the endeavor.

At a press conference at the Canadian Space Agency’s headquarters in Montreal this week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that Canada will contribute US$1.5 billion to NASA’s Lunar Space Station, known as Gateway.

NASA wants to get humans back to the lunar surface in the 2020s, and a crucial part of that plan is building the new Gateway station in lunar orbit. Gateway will act as a staging post for lunar landings, with a habitable environment for astronauts to occupy for between 30 to 60 days.

And just as they did when formulating the International Space Station, NASA have been seeking international partners for their latest mini-space station, and they have welcomed Canada as their first partner.

Speaking of the move, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said “NASA is thrilled that Canada is the first international partner for the Gateway lunar outpost.” He continued, “ournew collaboration on Gateway will enable our broader international partnership to get to the Moon and eventually to Mars.”

Canada have promised the US$1.5 billion as part of a 24-year commitment, and will build a new iteration in their series of ‘Canadarm’ robotic arms. Canadarm 1 and 2 played crucial roles in the building and maintenance of the ISS and more recently carried out important repairs to the Hubble telescope. Now, Trudeau has confirmed that a Canadarm3 will be developed to help build Gateway.

Canada has always been an important, if not slightly low-key, player in space-faring missions. They were the third country to launch a satellite into orbit in 1962 and have supported the ISS since its inception. Speaking of this latest partnership, Trudeau said, “our participation in the lunar gateway ushers in a new era of Canadian excellence in space.”",Canada becomes NASA's first international partner for lunar space station,Techspot.com,https://www.techspot.com/news/79002-canada-becomes-nasa-first-international-partner-lunar-space.html

The poll by Forum Research, provided exclusively to the Star, included 1,301 randomly selected Canadian adults who responded to an interactive telephone survey on Wednesday and Thursday — the day of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s stunning justice committee testimony in Ottawa and the day after.

A majority of respondents — 55 per cent — said they could “confidently explain the situation related to the Prime Minister´s Office and SNC Lavalin,” including 27 per cent who said they can “very confidently” explain it. Meanwhile, 57 per cent said the situation has “worsened” their opinion of Trudeau, versus 36 per cent who said it has had “no effect” and 7 per cent who said their view of the prime minister has been improved by the situation. Results of the poll are considered accurate +/- 3 per cent, 19 times out of 20.

The controversy erupted Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail reported that officials in the Prime Minister’s Office pressured the former attorney general to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to strike a mediation deal with the global engineering and construction giant that is based in Montreal. Trudeau and his office have repeatedly denied there was inappropriate pressure, while Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick — Canada’s top bureaucrat who works directly with the prime minister — has acknowledged Wilson-Raybould came under pressure to make the “right” decision on whether or not to halt the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. Trudeau and his government have said the company employs thousands of Canadians and that they wanted to consider the impact of a criminal conviction — which could include a 10-year ban from lucrative government contracts — on the multinational corporation.

On Wednesday, after Trudeau agreed to partially lift cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege that prevented her from speaking publicly about the matter, Wilson-Raybould accused the prime minister and his top officials of a “consistent and sustained” campaign over four months to pressure her into suspending the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. While she said she does not believe the pressure amounted to criminal interference in a judicial decision, Wilson-Raybould said it made her feel “a very heightened level of anxiety” and that it was “entirely political and entirely inappropriate.” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has called on Trudeau and Wernick to resign, and wrote to the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police calling for a criminal investigation. Five former attorneys generals from Conservative and NDP governments added their voices to that call Thursday night. On Friday, after Trudeau shuffled existing members of his cabinet to fill the spot left by Wilson-Raybould when she resigned in the wake of the controversy, Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called on Trudeau to cancel the scheduled parliamentary break next week so that MPs can remain in Ottawa to hold the government to account on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. The NDP and Green party have called for a public inquiry, but Trudeau and the Liberals have said they are confident hearings at the Commons justice committee and an investigation by the House of Commons conflict of interest commissioner can determine what happened. Bozinoff, the Forum president, said that while the majority of respondents to his poll said the situation has soured their view of Trudeau, it is not clear how that will affect the federal election this fall. That’s because of regional differences in the results, he said. Regional breakdowns, which have much lower sample sizes, indicate that 76 per cent of respondents from Alberta said the situation has worsened their view of Trudeau, compared with 52 per cent in Ontario and 48 per cent in Quebec. Bozinoff said the controversy may be mostly turning off people who weren’t going to support the Trudeau team anyway. “So far, this thing is reinforcing — I think — people’s previously held opinions, he said. At the same time, he noted that 59 per cent said the situation will impact how they vote this fall, including 36 per cent who said it will have a “strong impact” on their vote. “This thing is ongoing and who knows what’s going to happen.

While Jody Wilson-Raybould’s split with the Prime Minister’s Office is not apparently linked to any leadership ambitions, it is abundantly clear now that the former justice minister is driving the bus in this whole saga over SNC-Lavalin .

Once again, without uttering a word about the specific grievances, Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react. Last week, she managed to get a hearing from cabinet and caucus — and this of course came after the resignation of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

On Monday, on the eve of her much-anticipated appearance at the Commons justice committee, Raybould demurred, issuing instead a long letter setting out the conditions under which she intended to speak.

So while Wilson-Raybould is not the leader or even a would-be leader of her party, she definitely has forced Liberals to follow her — if only to try to anticipate her next move.

That’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, new to cabinet and government a little over three years ago and a relative newcomer to the Liberal party.

When Lucien Bouchard left Brian Mulroney’s cabinet in 1990, that Conservative government carried on without him. Ditto for Paul Martin’s exit from Jean Chretien’s cabinet in 2003. Damage was done in both cases, certainly in the long term, but neither prime minister seemed overly concerned with keeping the departed minister in the fold.

In fact, it’s difficult to remember any other politician who retained the power to keep dictating rules of engagement to a Prime Minister’s Office after leaving cabinet.

Trudeau’s reaction to this whole saga has been curious. For several days after the story of Wilson-Raybould’s grievances about SNC-Lavalin first broke in The Globe and Mail earlier this month, the prime minister did not speak to her.

Then he spoke to her a couple of times in Vancouver and seemed to be confident she would stay in cabinet — until she quit, hours later. He apologized to her behind the closed door of the cabinet room last Wednesday, only to have her stand up in the Commons and warn that she was waiting a chance to “speak my truth.”

Late last year, Trudeau was asked in one of his year-end interviews to sum up U.S. President Donald Trump in a word. “Unpredictable,” Trudeau replied, which summed up a lot of things, especially his disciplined silence in the face of Trump’s trade-related tantrum after the G-7 meeting in Charlevoix last June.

In the end, Canada and the U.S. did end up signing a new trade deal a few months later and Trump stopped calling Trudeau and Canada names on his angry Twitter feeds.

Trump’s unpredictability isn’t Trudeau’s biggest problem now — Wilson-Raybould’s is. But when you think about it, the prime minister is handling them the same way, which is probably a mistake.

Trudeau’s strategy on Trump, distilled to its essence, was basically this: say nothing, don’t rise to the bait and fan out to seek allies and experts while the situation cools down. A similar strategy seems to be under way now, inasmuch as the Trudeau government’s response can be called a strategy.

But Wilson-Raybould’s disaffection with Trudeau and how she’s been treated is looking far more methodical than Trump’s episodic outrage of last year.

What’s more, in Trump’s case, Trudeau could count on most of Canada to be on his side. With some exceptions, Canadians were more likely to stick up for their prime minister in any battle with the unpredictable Trump.

This confident streak — maybe overconfident streak — is at the nub of the Wilson-Raybould saga now. It is striking to see the ways in which Trudeau and his team have just left the slate blank in this whole tale, banking on the conviction that Canadians will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Each day in the Commons, this is basically what Trudeau says — that Canadians know his government is balancing concern for jobs and the law. “Trust us,” he says, while the government fans out, looking for experts and allies to attest to Trudeau’s integrity and hoping that the mess will go away.

Sometimes scandals do blow themselves out; sometimes ministers — or angry presidents — just go away, and governments carry on in their absence.

Nothing in this nearly three-week-old saga over Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin gives any indication of following that pattern. Trudeau and his government aren’t leading themselves out of the controversy — they’re following and reacting — and Wilson-Raybould is doing the leading.

358,Empty,2019-03-02T22:51:06Z,Today he said he'll soon sign an executive order to block universities from attaining federal research grants unless they guarantee free speech on campus.,"Donald Trump announced plans today (March 2) to position himself as a staunch defender of freedom of speech. In a freewheeling address at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the US president said he would soon sign an executive order that would block colleges and universities from attaining federal research grants unless they guarantee free speech on campus.

“We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas. These ideas are dangerous,” Trump said. “Instead we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus.” Trump made the promise shortly after welcoming conservative activist Hayden Williams, who was punched in the face (paywall) at the University of California, Berkeley last month during a recruitment effort.

The US president’s embracement of freedom of speech marks a policy shift, in contrast to years spent disparaging such a concept. In 2015, he said he wanted to “close up” parts of the internet in a bid to combat terrorism, and said that those who protest on the grounds of freedom of speech are “foolish people.”

Meanwhile, the ACLU has a list of attacks Trump has made on the press, including praising a violent attack on a reporter and telling Canadian president Justin Trudeau, “It is frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write.” Trump has also dismissed pleading the Fifth as a refuge “for the mob,” though it now seems likely he may plead it himself. (The Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution protects a person from being “compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.”)

There’s a strong possibility that Trump’s proposal would impose its own limits on freedom of speech, warn legal scholars. “Somebody would have to decide which universities were not supporting free speech on campus,” Catherine Ross, a professor in constitutional law at George Washington University, told the Washington Post (paywall). “Some group of Washington civil servants—or maybe even worse, political appointees—would be looking at charges of speech discrimination at various colleges and universities, and labeling them as either acceptable in terms of free speech or not acceptable. And that… is a government interference in speech.”

Trump did not provide details on when he planned to sign the order, but for a president with a long history of criticizing freedom of speech, one executive decision is unlikely to turn him into a stalwart supporter of the practice.","Donald Trump, onetime freedom-of-speech skeptic, wants to protect speech on campus",Qz.com,https://qz.com/1564044/donald-trump-has-decided-he-likes-freedom-of-speech/

But her story will get immediately committed to the political memory around Ottawa, mainly for the searing details Wilson-Raybould assiduously noted over four months: an offhand dismissal of annoying “legalities,” talk of “giving us cover” and the inevitability of “some interference” to help SNC-Lavalin. And that was just in one conversation she says her chief of staff had with the prime minister’s most senior advisers, Katie Telford and Gerald Butts, toward the end of what she called a four-month “sustained” effort to change her mind. Even with Butts gone from that inner circle, one of the early casualties of this no doubt enduring saga, how does the Trudeau government put itself on a steady keel again? This is not obvious at the moment.

It’s certainly not sunny ways. The Liberal ad team might want to throw out that pitch for the next campaign. Conservatives and New Democrats accumulated enough footage from Wednesday’s committee meeting to animate a full election’s worth of ads about a Liberal leader beating up on an Indigenous woman in his government. Speaking of campaigns, Wilson-Raybould claimed the prime minister made his case in September for helping the Quebec firm, not just in the context of potential jobs lost if she didn’t agree to a plea deal for SNC-Lavalin, but against the backdrop of a looming Quebec election. So, she said, did Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick — the same supposedly non-political bureaucrat who made a vigorous and also memorable presentation to this justice committee last week.

Wilson-Raybould said in her statement on Monday that Wernick thought it important to tell her in September that the SNC-Lavalin board needed some answers before a looming meeting with shareholders and warned that the firm would relocate to London if Canada proved inhospitable to a plea deal. He then leapt into the politics of the situation — the Quebec election coming on Oct. 1. “At that point the prime minister jumped in, stressing there is an election in Quebec and that, quote, ‘I am an MP in Quebec, the member for Papineau,’ end quote. I was quite taken aback. My response — and I remember this vividly — was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked, ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’” Wernick was already facing criticism for the partisan bent of his testimony last week; Wilson-Raybould has only given credence to those arguments. A week or so ago, one of the senior officials who figured in the Wilson-Raybould story was talking off the record, and said the government couldn’t keep “fighting ghosts in The Globe and Mail.” Well, now we have a very different ghost story — actually, more like one of those scary movies with the line: “The call is coming from inside the house.” Wilson-Raybould is that caller and she brought everyone into the house with her with a hair-raising tale about how politics works in this government. There’s an old rule of opposites when it comes to Canadian prime ministers — they always exit office with an image opposite to the one they had when they took on the job. Trudeau, we’ll recall, was the just-not-ready, feminist guy who was going to make his relationship with Canada’s Indigenous people the most important one in his government. Wilson-Raybould has presented that opposite image: a prime minister who made life very difficult for an Indigenous woman in his government, who was more than ready to embrace the hard cynicism of power. That image just doesn’t line up with the one Trudeau, or even his critics, have presented of this government so far. But it’s now a signature picture in the political history books.

In a letter sent to the Commons’ justice committee Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould cautions the waiver to solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences only applies to her time as attorney general, a post she was shuffled out of in January.

The waiver — formally provided Monday — “does nothing to release me form any restrictions that apply to communications while I served as Minister of Veterans Affairs and in relation to my resignation from that post or my presentation to Cabinet after I had resigned,” Wilson-Raybould states in her letter. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Justice Minister David Lametti portrayed the waiver as an example of their government’s transparency on the controversy. But Wilson-Raybould’s response underscores that she is still barred from speaking freely.

“I mention this simply to alert the Committee to the fact that the Order in Council leaves in place whatever restraints there are on my ability to speak freely about matters that occurred after I left the post of Attorney General,” she wrote.

Trudeau said earlier in the day that he’s “pleased” Wilson-Raybould will be able to tell her version of events around allegations she was pressured over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. “It is important that people get an opportunity to testify or share their point of view with the committee. As we said, waiving privilege, waiving cabinet confidentiality is something that we had to take very seriously but I’m pleased that Ms. Wilson-Raybould is going to be able to share her perspective,” Trudeau told reporters Tuesday as he headed into a morning cabinet meeting.

It promises to be high-stakes testimony. Does Wilson-Raybould testify that her meetings with senior Trudeau aides and officials were an inappropriate intervention in the judicial process? Or does she back the government’s assertions that whatever pressure was applied on the SNC-Lavalin issue, it was appropriate and lawful?

Article Continued Below

Any charge of judicial interference by Wilson-Raybould would heap further political woes on Trudeau’s government, perhaps force yet further inquiries — beyond the Commons’ committee and ethics commissioner ongoing probes — and even trigger a police investigation, if one isn’t already underway. “Her testimony is pivotal,” NDP MP Nathan Cullen said. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony comes as a new poll reveals that the Liberals and Trudeau himself are already facing a political backlash for the controversy. Two-thirds of Canadians believe there is a deeper scandal in the Prime Minister’s Office, according to polling done by the Angus Reid Institute, a not-for-profit public opinion research organization. Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s principal secretary, resigned last week while denying allegations there was any inappropriate pressure put on Wilson-Raybould. Still, there’s a “sinking” feeling among Liberal voters “that there’s more to come, that it’s not over, that more issues are going to reveal themselves,” said Shachi Kurl, the institute’s executive director. Sixty per cent of Canadians say they have an unfavourable view of the prime minister and roughly the same number say their opinion has worsened over the last month, according to the online survey of 1,009 Canadians done between Feb. 21-24. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. While much of Trudeau’s negative polling is driven by right-of-centre voters, almost 30 per cent of Liberal supporters have a worse opinion of Trudeau. His rivals don’t fare much better — 54 per cent have an unfavourable opinion of Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and 64 per cent for New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh. In the best case scenario for the Liberals, Wilson-Raybould’s testimony on Wednesday clears the air and allows the government to focus on other issues, Kurl said. “It really comes down to what she says and the credibility factor. Do people believe it and are they then mollified and want to move on ... or does it continue to flame?” she said. Citing solicitor-client privilege, Wilson-Raybould has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.

OTTAWA—Discussions the Prime Minister’s Office had with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould about criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin are “troubling,” lack a strong legal justification and may have led to her being “fired,” a respected jurist said Monday.

The director of public prosecutions decided last fall to proceed with criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin, rejecting the company’s request for a remediation agreement that would have spared it a conviction and, with it, a 10-year ban on government contracts.

“Perhaps this is an instance where a prosecutor was actually fired for establishing a boundary that was not popular or accepted. I’m not sure of that. I think there is some suspicion and concern here about that.”

“In fact, prosecutors should not resign. Lead prosecutors, when they’ve taken a decision, should hold firm to their position and that is consistent with the rule of law,” Turpel-Lafond said.

Now those interventions are in the spotlight amid questions whether lines were crossed.

Wilson-Raybould appears to have stuck by that decision in the face of meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s senior aides and the top civil servant, despite concerns about the future of the Quebec company if the charges went ahead.

Turpel-Lafond, who currently practises law and teaches in Victoria, expressed serious doubts about the government’s claim — articulated by Wilson-Raybould’s successor, David Lametti, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Liberal MPs — that officials are permitted to hold robust discussions with an attorney general under the so-called Shawcross Doctrine.

Once a decision is made to pursue a prosecution, there is “limited authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point and going forward,” Turpel-Lafond said.

She said if the talks went beyond a “more passive and respectful approach,” and the purpose “was to persuade the attorney general as prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern.”

And she cast doubt on Lametti’s and Wernick’s assertions that the decision to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin is one that still remains open to the attorney general, even with the preliminary inquiry underway.

She said there should be a “full” airing of what was said to Wilson-Raybould, adding it would be something she’d expect the RCMP’s sensitive investigations or “integrity” section would already be looking into.

Two other legal experts agreed that the Shawcross Doctrine — a concept imported from the United Kingdom — does not justify any pressure put on an attorney general to make or change a prosecutorial decision.

That decision, they said, is the attorney general’s alone to make.

“The attorney general should not be put under pressure by colleagues and in particular should not be put under partisan political pressure,” said Mary Condon, interim dean of Osgoode Hall Law School.

Maxime St-Hilaire, an associate law professor at the University of Sherbrooke, said the clear line would be better drawn if Canada’s attorney general did not also serve as justice minister inside a federal cabinet.

Trudeau told the House of Commons he would partially lift confidentiality obligations on his former attorney general so she can testify about allegations that his office was at the centre of what the Opposition says was a “sustained effort” to influence the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Under fire in the House for weeks, Trudeau told question period Monday that Wilson-Raybould would be able to appear at the justice committee and “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

Monday night, the Trudeau cabinet issued an order-in-council waiving cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould for discussions she had on SNC-Lavalin, clearing the way for her testimony to the committee.

However, “in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,” the waiver did not extend to communications Wilson-Raybould had with Kathleen Roussel, director of public prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin.

It was not entirely clear when her long-awaited appearance will be scheduled, as her expected appearance Tuesday was postponed.

In a letter sent earlier Monday to the committee, Wilson-Raybould stated that she is “anxious to appear at the first available time.”

But she said that she remained constrained by what she can say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and the ongoing cases involving SNC-Lavalin still before the courts.

“The government can waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence. I cannot, Wilson-Raybould said in her letter to Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, chair of the committee.

She said she wants to delay her testimony until “we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.”

When she does appear, Wilson-Raybould said she wants to make an extended opening statement of about 30 minutes to provide “my best recollection of all relevant communications.”

Trudeau has denied he or anyone in his office applied any inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She has not yet spoken publicly to confirm or deny the allegation, saying she is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Late Monday, the Commons voted 155-106 against compelling Trudeau to testify before the committee, as the Conservative and NDP opposition wanted.

The prime minister again defended his actions, telling the Commons that “at every stage,” his government did what it promised Canadians, to stand up for jobs and growth while protecting the rule of law and the independence of the justice system.

“We’ve consistently and continually stood up for the 9,000 jobs at SNC-Lavalin and good jobs right across the country,” Trudeau said.

“That’s exactly what we’ll continue to do and we will continue to do it in a way that ... always respects the rules and norms that govern our institutions.”

SNC-Lavalin and two former employees were charged in 2015 under the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act with one count of bribing former members of the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi, and one count of fraud under the Criminal Code.

Trudeau says the decision to avoid a prosecution and enter into a remediation agreement with Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin was hers and hers alone.

The company was facing allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya.

It has been a long time in politics since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won the general election in 2015, surfing into office on a wave of optimism.

Key points: Canada's former justice minister alleges close Trudeau aides pressured her to settle a bribery case for a major construction firm

In testimony to the House of Commons, the ex-minister said there had been veiled threats and the intervention was ""not appropriate""

Mr Trudeau says he and his staff have done nothing wrong, but the scandal comes months out from an election

While the progressive, self-confessed feminist Prime Minister immediately became one of the internet's favourite world leaders, scandals and missteps have taken the shine off him at home.

None more so than this week when one of Mr Trudeau's former Cabinet colleagues fronted the House of Commons justice committee and delivered four hours of dramatic testimony alleging inappropriate political pressure.

Afterwards, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer said Mr Trudeau had ""lost moral authority to govern"" and ""must resign"".

So where did this all start?

The justice minister and the corruption trial

Back in 2015, the year Mr Trudeau came into office, allegations surfaced that a major Canadian construction firm had bribed Libyan officials.

The firm, SNC-Lavalin, was charged. It tried to avoid prosecution and a trial, instead wanting to settle the case with a fine.

But the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided to pursue the firm over the bribery allegations rather than negotiating a remediation agreement.

At the time that was a real concern for Mr Trudeau because if the company was found guilty it would have barred it from government contracts for 10 years — possibly endangering the firm and thousands of its employees.

As justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould had the authority to overrule the DPP and demand a settlement instead.

She chose not to intervene, instead agreeing with the DPP that the case should go to trial.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was eventually bumped to the veterans' affairs portfolio in a surprise reshuffle that was widely seen as a demotion, before she resigned around the time the interference scandal hit the papers.

She now says she felt consistent political pressure from senior political staffers, including Mr Trudeau's principal secretary, to help SNC-Lavalin evade a trial.

In testimony to the House of Commons on Wednesday (local time), she said she had 10 phone calls and 10 in-person meetings with members of the Prime Minister's Office who lobbied her to order a settlement.

She said the lobbying continued under the argument of ""finding a solution"", despite her making her decision clear about not intervening.

""This pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she said in her testimony, adding that some officials had made veiled threats against her.

The head of the federal civil service, according to Ms Wilson-Raybould, told her Mr Trudeau would ""find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind [of] mood and I wanted you to be aware of that"".

Ms Wilson-Raybould alleged that at one stage the Prime Minister stressed to her that there was an election in Quebec and that she was ""an MP in Quebec"".

What does Trudeau have to say about it?

After his former justice minister's testimony this week, Mr Trudeau gave a press conference and denied wrongdoing, saying he had been thinking about potential job losses.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" Mr Trudeau said.

""I therefore completely disagree with [Ms Wilson-Raybould's] characterisation of events.""

The Prime Minister brushed off Opposition demands for him to step down.

Mr Trudeau's principal secretary Gerald Butts also denied applying inappropriate pressure on Ms Wilson-Raybould as the scandal broke, but he later resigned.

He has said he would like to testify to the House of Commons committee, so this issue is unlikely to disappear in the crucial few months before Canada's federal election — scheduled for sometime before October 21.

'That India trip' is also a problem for Trudeau

Mr Trudeau's image as a media-savvy and charismatic leader took a major battering in early 2018 in a trip that was labelled by many as a ""PR nightmare"".

""One need only to refer to 'that India trip' and for the foreseeable future we'll all know exactly what that means,"" commentator Rob Breckinridge wrote.

In the Washington Post, India-based journalist Barkha Dutt wrote: ""Suddenly, all that charisma and cuteness seems constructed, manufactured and, above all, not serious.""

The photogenic PM was meant to be on a diplomatic trip to India but it descended into a lengthy series of cultural photo ops involving his family that seemed more at home in a family trip album.

They went everywhere — from the Trudeaus in Indian garb at the ashram where Mahatma Gandhi lived to slipping on a traditional Indian wedding dress and dancing with Bollywood stars.

Mr Trudeau did meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, eventually, but was criticised for the meeting happening so late in the tour.

The trip damaged Mr Trudeau's reputation at home, making him more irritating than adorable, journalist Micheline Maynard wrote.

The cherry on top: A new NAFTA agreement delivering a worse deal

US President Donald Trump's insistence on tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has also put Mr Trudeau in a difficult situation.

In negotiating a new free-trade deal — the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA) — Canada had to accept some restrictions and open up its protected dairy market to the US.

This has incensed farmers who held Mr Trudeau to a pledge to protect the dairy industry from cheap milk in the US.

While the new deal was agreed to by the three nations, it has yet to be ratified and still faces opposition from Canada and Mexico, which want the US to drop new tariffs on steel.

The Vancouver-area race was largely seen as a test of Singh's leadership, as he faced off against Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, a former B.C. MLA, and Conservative candidate Jay Shin, a lawyer and newcomer to politics.

In 2017, Singh made history when he became the first non-white leader of a major Canadian federal party. Since then, he's led the NDP without a federal seat.

In his victory speech on Monday night, Singh said it was a ""new day.""

""When I was growing up I could have never imagined someone like me running for prime minister, but guess what we just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can,"" he said.

""And I know that carries a lot of responsibility and I understand that responsibility and I want you to know that when I take my seat in the House of Commons I will work very hard to make you all very proud.""

Singh touts health care, housing

While Singh highlighted some of the issues critical to Burnaby South, he also touted a national platform — calling for expanded health coverage, building half a million affordable housing units across Canada, transitioning to a green economy, and working towards reconciliation with Indigenous communities.

Watch part of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

NDP leader rallies supporters after Burnaby South win, calls for change in Ottawa 1:18

Singh criticized the Liberals and Conservatives and called out the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

He also addressed growing distrust of immigration.

""New Canadians and people who are fleeing are not responsible for the problems that we're faced with,"" he said.

""We'll address that uncertainty and fear by giving people something to hope, something to dream.""

With all polls reporting, the NDP claimed 39 per cent of the vote, the Liberals 26 per cent, the Conservatives 22.5 per cent, and the People's Party 10.6 per cent.

Just under 29 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot, not including electors who registered on election day.

Rough Liberal ride

The Liberals usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But this time around, they faced challenges in the campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin — a scandal Singh alluded to in his speech.

""We have eight more months to let the people know we have a government … that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin, but stands up for everyday Canadians,"" he said.

Watch more of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says Canada can make different choices and get better results 1:59

But Lee, who replaced Wang as the Liberal candidate in January, said that as he went door-to-door constituents were concerned with local issues like housing and transportation, not the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He said the Liberals ran a strong campaign and he is considering running again in the fall.

""I look forward to more debate ... in elections, sometimes it's difficult to get the message across so I believe in the fall [it will] be much better.""

Singh addresses Quebec

The NDP also faced a test in the Montreal-area riding of Outremont on Monday, which was vacated by the party's former leader, Thomas Mulcair. Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan was the successful candidate in that riding.

Singh made a special pitch to Quebec, saying he knew Outremont would be a tough riding, but that the NDP supports legislation supported by many Quebecers, primarily surrounding green energy and the environment.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's Poll Tracker.

Comprehensively soiled. And bleeding.

It’s riveting testimony. The media are typing as if their lives depend on it. The cable guys are running the full hearing. And ordinary people are watching, because it’s not every day you see a member of a government strafe its leadership. Strafe you.

Only strafe isn’t the word. It’s more of a shiv. There is no emotion or hysteria. There is ice in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s veins and a steely determination as she coolly, calmly and credibly outlines the myriad ways your political and bureaucratic apparatus attempted to impress upon her independent mind the need to have another think on SNC, despite her repeated attempts to everyone—including you—that her thinking on the matter was all done.

You’re watching this all go down, and it is devastating. Your government is in peril. You’re in peril. You’re staring a return to your career of part-time drama teaching right in the face.

And so you decide it’s time to fight back. Because the cast of fifth-rate clowns you sent to fill the Liberal seats at the justice committee certainly didn’t do any fighting back. They not only missed the grenades, they picked them up, played with them, and then didn’t even realize when they went off in their faces.

But that’s all right. You’re Justin Trudeau. Mr. Sunny Ways. Mr. Hope and Hard Work. You got this. So you wheel yourself out to ‘push back’ against Wilson-Raybould’s allegations.

Only you don’t push back.

You don’t counter Wilson-Raybould’s facts and recollections with any of your own. You don’t dispute what was said, even about your alleged direct personal involvement, other than to say you disagree with Wilson-Raybould’s “characterization” of events.

And it stinks.

It stinks as you moan about a difficult couple of weeks because of “internal disagreements.” It stinks as you reference your success in making it easier to die, and your success in making it easier to get high. It stinks as you talk about your job being to stand up for jobs and pensions, to stand up for Canadians, and for Canadian workers, and all in an overly dramatic tone that suggests that no other prime minister has ever had that in their job description. It stinks as you speak about anything other than what Canadians need to hear from you.

And you say all of this nothing in front of a carefully crafted human backdrop meant to demonstrate your love of youth and diversity. Except the youth look like they’re in a hostage video (they are). Your human backdrop even includes your new MP, Rachel Bendayan, who is standing over your shoulder tonight playing the role of Huma Abedin while you step all over your wiener.

There isn’t a hint of contrition, or even a speck of responsibility for letting things get this far. No acknowledgment that Wilson-Raybould has laid out a set of serious charges that require serious answers. Your focus remains political.

When you’re asked about Andrew Scheer’s call for your resignation over the seriousness of these allegations, you mumble something about Stephen Harper being a bad man and this coming election being about a choice, blithely assuming you’ll still be in function to see it out. And when you’re asked about Wilson-Raybould remaining in the Liberal caucus, you say you will have to review her full testimony—testimony you have already dismissed, by the way—before deciding her fate, when it really should be the other way around.

You tell Canadians—in that sanctimonious and overly serious tone you adopt when you’re under the cosh—who have watched Wilson-Raybould rattle their confidence in Canada’s institutions to now have confidence in the ethics commissioner, an office that has already found you guilty of breaking another law, but isn’t equipped to investigate the allegations unfurled by Wilson-Raybould. And while you’re busy doing that, you have your office tell media that nobody else will be resigning based on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony.

In other words, every move you make tonight makes you look like the un-smart, un-serious man that so many of your political opponents have always insisted you are.

But you can’t let that worry you.

Your only bet now is that you being you will be enough to see you through. If there is enough talk about evil Tories, or lost jobs, or Liberal values, then Canadians might just go back to sleep and wake up thinking you’re that wonderful man who promised to change everything in 2015.

The divide is at once simple and complex, logical and emotional—a fiery chasm that threatens to split our staff apart and turn us into brother soldiers on opposite sides of a bloody civil war. So what is the fulcrum? What is the point at which this potentially disastrous schism tips?

In response to a question from Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel about a report that the embattled Quebec contractor SNC-Lavalin paid $30,000 (CND) to entertain Muammar Gaddafi’s son with prostitutes, Trudeau appeared to not only confirm the story; he also tried to exonerate the company.

Rempel was quizzing Trudeau in the House of Commons about the unfolding scandal that threatens to take down the Trudeau government. Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould says she was instructed by numerous high-ranking officials in the Prime Minister’s Office to block the prosecution against Quebec mega-contractor SNC-Lavalin on fraud charges. (RELATED: Calls For Trudeau’s Resignation Made After Explosive Testimony From Former AG)

Referring to the “$30,000 worth of Canadian prostitutes that were given to Muammar Gaddafi’s son,” Rempel noted “this is the so-called victimless crime that our quote ‘feminist’ prime minister is moving mountains to cover up. When did the prime minister learn that SNC-Lavalin paid for prostitutes for Muammar Gaddafi’s son?”

Trudeau answered, “Every step of the way, we will stand up for Canadians workers, we will stand up for Canadian jobs right across this country and we will do so in a way that is consistent with our values …” (RELATED: Trudeau Principal Secretary Gerald Butts Resigns In Wake Of Judicial Scandal)

Rempel told The Daily Caller on Friday that she was shocked at Trudeau’s response to her question.

“He needs to resign,” she said. “He’s a disgusting failure that no longer has the moral authority to govern. He needs to go.”

If SNC-Lavalin is convicted on fraud charges, it will automatically make the company ineligible to apply for lucrative federal government building contracts for at least 10 years.

On Friday, Trudeau again shuffled his cabinet in order to replace the vacancy left by Wilson-Raybould, who resigned as Veterans Affairs minister after having lost the attorney general portfolio.

While talking to journalists in Montreal, Trudeau, who is the leader of the ruling Liberal Party of Canada, made it clear that he would not resign, despite demands from the opposition. He added that he would carefully read the allegations of the former Prosecutor General that numerous officials from his administration tried to force her to intervene to help the Montreal firm avoid criminal proceedings.

According to Wilson-Raybould's testimony, cited by AP, she asked Trudeau if he was politically interfering with her role as attorney general and told him she would strongly advise against it.

The Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin is facing accusations that its former executives paid millions of dollars in bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi's rule, which collapsed in 2011.

More precisely, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang allowed a “reporter” for Chinese state media to issue the challenge, then pronounced himself delighted with the question, as transcribed by Reuters:

Asked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Trudeau to say he couldn’t interfere in Meng’s case and yet his government be accused of trying to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he “really liked this question.” “Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” Lu said. “In fact, on this case you have mentioned, people in Canada are paying it a great deal of attention,” he added. “In fact, not only Chinese and Canadian citizens but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

The SNC-Lavalin case involves testimony from former Canadian Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould that she was intensely pressured by Trudeau officials, including the prime minister himself, to avoid prosecuting engineering company SNC-Lavalin on charges of fraud and bribery.

The Chinese government has pressured Trudeau to intervene on behalf of Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested at the Vancouver airport in December and held for possible extradition to the United States to face charges of financial fraud and violating sanctions against Iran. Lu was, in essence, ribbing Trudeau for intervening in a fraud prosecution when it suited his interests but piously claiming he would never do such a thing when China asked him to.

Ottawa (AFP) Feb 28, 2019



Canada will join NASA's space mission to put an orbiter around the Moon in a few years, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Thursday.

""Canada is going to the Moon,"" Trudeau told a press conference that included a live video link from the International Space Station with Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques.

NASA plans to build a small space station, dubbed Gateway, in the Moon's orbit by 2026.

It will serve as a way-station for trips to and from the lunar surface, but will not be permanently crewed like the International Space Station (ISS), currently in Earth's orbit.

According to the Canadian Space Agency, Gateway will provide living space for astronauts, a docking station for visiting spacecraft and research laboratories.

Canada will develop and contribute an autonomous robotic system -- Canadarm3 -- that will be used to repair and maintain the station.

The original 15-meter remote-controlled mechanical Canadarm, also known as the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System, was used on the Space Shuttle for 30 years, deploying, capturing and repairing satellites, positioning astronauts, maintaining equipment and moving cargo.

Its successor is used on the ISS.

NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement that the organization is ""thrilled that Canada is the first international partner for the Gateway lunar outpost.""

""Our new collaboration on Gateway will enable our broader international partnership to get to the Moon and eventually to Mars,"" he said.

Trudeau also announced Can$2.05 billion (US$1.55 billion) over 24 years for Canada's space program, which will help support a push to develop new ""artificial intelligence-based technologies"" for space.

Due to communications lags between Earth and remote outposts, it will be increasingly necessary to automate many robotic functions on space stations and vehicles.

The last person to walk on the Moon was Eugene Cernan in December 1972, during the Apollo 17 mission.

Before humans set foot on the lunar surface again, NASA aims to land an unmanned vehicle on the Moon by 2024.

So far, only Russia, the United States and China have made the 384,000-kilometer (239,000-mile) journey and landed spacecraft on the Moon.

Last week, Israel launched a spacecraft that aims to join them.

378,Empty,2019-02-28T01:03:00Z,"Jaime Watt and Robin V. Sears, two top political fixers, give their view of the Prime Minister’s reaction so far to Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony and what should come next.","“The prime minister completely blew it,” said Robin V. Sears, a long-time NDP strategist who runs Earnscliffe Strategy Group in Ottawa, one of the leading crisis-management firms in the country. “This is a moment when his integrity, his credibility, his future is on the line. To respond as arrogantly and flippantly and disrespectfully as he did tonight is not helpful.”

For decades, Watt and Sears have advised some of the most powerful companies and people around the world on how to survive public relations disasters. The veteran advisers, who regularly contribute to the Star’s Opinion section, offered their professional views of what Trudeau should have done, should have said and what he still must do to protect his office and the Liberal party in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

“You can see the hand of Justice Cromwell crafting her remarks,” Watt said. “He writes beautifully. Because she was so direct, I think she has created a problem for the prime minister. And the government will need to answer with equal clarity.”

Watt praised Wilson-Raybould’s lawyer — retired Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell — for bringing “extremely compelling” clarity to the former justice minister’s address to the Commons committee regarding the Prime Minister’s Office’s role in mediating criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin.

“Here is a woman who is rising in public esteem daily and took a huge leap by virtue of her testimony today,” Sears said. “Trudeau reacted by appearing as if he were celebrating a byelection victory. It was just bizarre. It was tone deaf.”

What Raybould-Wilson told the House of Commons’ justice commitee about the pressure and persistent “veiled threats” she faced from Trudeau’s top officials is “profoundly critical of the character of this government,” Sears said.

Such a serious accusation demands a thoughtful response.

“Her case is pretty hard to challenge on the merits,” Sears said. “All that pressure from all those people over all that period of time — it’s hard to deny it was inappropriate. He should have said ‘I’m going to read my former attorney general’s remarks with care overnight and I’ll have a detailed reaction in the morning, but my initial reaction is I take a different view than she does about the degree to which she felt pressured.’ ”

3. Resist the urge to spin platitudes

It’s common for leaders in crisis to retreat to their “comfort zones” when they’re under public fire during a crisis, as Trudeau did during his late-night scrum with reporters in Montreal. But rattling off a series of “bumper-sticker” quotes is no way to do damage control, Watt said.

“The way they have to put their case forward is with no funny business. This is a time when spin and prevarication and the usual kind of rhetoric will be very ineffective at countering her. They actually have to employ legal-style communications, not just political-style communications if they’re going to bat down each of the points she made.”

4. Location, location, location

What Trudeau decides to say next is as important as where he says it.

“I think they would want to match the formalness of the setting (Wilson-Raybould) had,” Watt said, noting Trudeau has a few natural options. He could issue a statement in the House or the National Press Theatre or secure national television time to directly address the entire country. Watt said a formal television address is the way to go.

“She raised the stakes on this to a level of seriousness and gravity that he would have to match in his reply. These accusations go right to the heart of the integrity of the government that this requires the prime minister talking to the Canadian people.”

Sears is less specific, but agreed the Montreal scrum was a terrible move. “He should have done it in Ottawa. He should have done it outside the prime minister’s office.”

Sears said he thinks Trudeau has time to recover “tomorrow or later, but he’s got to show that he takes this seriously.” That message could resonate through an exclusive interview Trudeau could offer to a member of the media. “He needs to just talk about it; weigh the challenges a case like this presents between his obligation to be a champion of an important company on the one hand and on the other, how hard that is to navigate and how seriously he takes that. Something like that would help restore some perception that he understands that Canadians are not impressed by him claiming he did everything right when he didn’t.”

5. Another top Liberal official will need to fall

The resignation of Trudeau’s Principal Secretary, Gerald Butts, will not be enough to show the public that the federal government understands the magnitude of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Watt and Sears agreed.

Watt wouldn’t speculate on whose head would fall next, but Sears has a prediction based on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony.

“I think the clerk’s position (Michael Wernick) is pretty fragile,” he said. “Not only his testimony before the committee the other day, but the role he played that Jody outlined is pretty troubling. Political staff people misbehave, but the Clerk of the Privy Council is not expected to play that role.”

India acknowledged one of its air force planes was ""lost"" in skirmishes with Pakistan and that its pilot was ""missing in action"" on a chaotic day, which also saw mortar shells fired by Indian troops from across the frontier dividing the two sectors of Kashmir kill six civilians and wound several others.

A helicopter crash in the region also killed six Indian air force officials and a civilian on the ground.

The aircraft went down Wednesday morning in Kashmir, a mountainous region claimed by both India and Pakistan since almost immediately after their creation in 1947. One of the downed planes crashed in Pakistan's part of Kashmir while the other went down in an Indian-controlled section of the Himalayan region, Pakistan's army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said.

Pakistan's ministry of information and broadcasting released what it says is the wreckage of the Indian planes.

Pakistani troops on the ground captured an Indian pilot, he later said, after earlier saying it captured two. He did not explain what caused the confusion.

Despite Geneva Convention rules prohibiting the public display of prisoners, the military circulated a video of the Indian pilot, who was recorded saying he was being well treated. He also praised Pakistan's military.

The pilot was injured and was being treated at a military hospital, Ghafoor said. He did not elaborate beyond saying the pilots were being ""treated well"" and made no mention of them being returned to India.

""We have no intention of escalation, but are fully prepared to do so if forced into that paradigm,"" Ghafoor said.

'Wars are full of miscalculation'

Tuesday's pre-dawn strike by India was its first inside of Pakistan since the two nations' 1971 war over territory that later became Bangladesh. Pakistan had said that Indian warplanes dropped bombs near the Pakistani town of Balakot but there were no casualties.

The violence Wednesday marked the most serious escalation of the long-simmering conflict since 1999, when Pakistan's military sent a ground force into Indian-controlled Kashmir at Kargil. That year also saw an Indian fighter jet shoot down a Pakistani naval aircraft, killing all 16 on board.

Residents on both sides of the de-facto frontier, the so-called Line of Control, said there were exchanges of fire between the two sides through the night into Wednesday morning. Hundreds of villagers fled border towns in both India and Pakistan.

Within hours of the incident, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan went on television urging peace talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""History tells us that wars are full of miscalculation. My question is that given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation?"" Khan said during a brief televised broadcast to the nation. ""We should sit down and talk.""

There was no reply from Modi.

An Indian foreign ministry spokesperson said Indian planes engaged with the Pakistan aircraft and brought one of them down.

""In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts,"" Raveesh Kumar told reporters.

Clashes prompt widespread concern

The clashes prompted widespread concern from the international community.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to avoid ""further military activity"" following Tuesday's air strike.

""I expressed to both ministers that we encourage India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any

cost,"" Pompeo said in a statement on Wednesday. ""I also encouraged both ministers to prioritize direct communication and avoid further military activity.""

Both China and the European Union have also called for restraint.

Meanwhile, the hashtag #SayNoToWar emerged on social media, with citizens of both countries calling for peace.

Airspace closed

Pakistan's civil aviation authority said it shut Pakistani airspace to all commercial flights on Wednesday, without elaborating or indicating when flights might resume.

Indian news reports said airports in the Indian portion of Kashmir closed for civilian traffic shortly after the air force jet crashed. The Press Trust of India news agency said these airports were located at Srinagar, Jammu and Leh.

Indian administrator Baseer Khan confirmed that the airport in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-controlled Kashmir, was closed and said it was a ""temporary and precautionary measure.""

Indian police also said officials recovered six bodies from the wreckage of an Indian air force helicopter that crashed in Indian-controlled sector of Kashmir.

Senior police officer Munir Ahmed Khan said the chopper crashed close to an airport on Wednesday in Budgam area, in the outskirts of the region's main city of Srinagar. The Srinagar airport is also an air force station.

Police said they were still going through the wreckage and did not immediately identify the victims.

Eyewitnesses said soldiers fired warning shots into the air to keep residents away from the crash site.

Meanwhile, as the tensions and confrontation escalated between India and Pakistan, authorities asked workers to paint rooftops of hospitals and clinics in red and white with a medical emblem of a cross in Srinagar city.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministry in Islamabad said the country's air force was carrying out airstrikes Wednesday from within Pakistani airspace across the disputed Kashmir boundary but that this was not in ""retaliation to continued Indian belligerence.""

Ghafoor, the Pakistani military spokesperson, said the strikes were aimed at ""avoiding human loss and collateral damage.""

According to local Pakistani police official Mohammad Altaf, the six fatalities in the Indian shelling earlier on Wednesday included children. The shells hit the village of Kotli in Pakistan's section of Kashmir.

Kashmir is split between Pakistan and India and claimed by both in its entirety. Though Pakistani and Indian troops in Kashmir often trade fire, the latest casualties came a day after tensions escalated sharply following a pre-dawn airstrike and incursion by India that New Delhi said targeted a terrorist training camp in northwestern Pakistan.

The latest wave of tensions between Pakistan and India first erupted after Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 suicide bombing of a convoy of India's paramilitary forces in the Indian portion of Kashmir that killed 40 Indian troops.

Pakistan has said it was not involved in the attack and was ready to help New Delhi in the investigations.","'Extremely dangerous': Pakistan claims it shot down 2 Indian planes, captured pilot",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/india-pakistan-pilot-planes-saynotowar-1.5035093

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied wrongdoing after he tried to shield one of the country's biggest firms from a corruption trial.

Mr Trudeau said any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

In explosive testimony, ex-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said she faced ""sustained"" pressure to abandon prosecution of the Quebec-based firm.

Opposition Conservatives are calling on the Liberal PM to resign.

They are also demanding a public inquiry following Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday before the Commons justice committee in Ottawa.

How did Trudeau defend himself?

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with his former justice minister's ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

The prime minster said he had full confidence in an inquiry by a parliamentary justice committee into the affair and in an investigation by the federal ethics commissioner, and would ""participate fully"" in that process.

Opposition parties have been ramping up pressure on the prime minister and the Conservatives have said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police must immediately open an investigation.

Mr Trudeau said that to his knowledge no member of his staff has been contacted by the RCMP.

The prime minster has insisted for weeks that all communications between himself, federal officials and Ms Wilson-Raybould were above board.

He says that any advocacy for SNC-Lavalin was done in the interest of protecting Canadian jobs that no lines were crossed.

What does the ex-justice minister allege?

Ms Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee on Wednesday she had faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for the Montreal construction firm.

The former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff endured four months - between last September and December - of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that while some discussions about the ramifications of the decision were normal, the pressure went well beyond what was appropriate given her role as attorney general.

In Canada, an attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function and decisions are not supposed to be politically motivated.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that in various meetings, Mr Trudeau and senior staff repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial.

She said she had made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial and that she believes it was why she was demoted in a Cabinet shuffle in January, which Mr Trudeau denies.

Ms Wilson-Raybould also said during her testimony she did not believe any laws were broken.

What is SNC-Lavalin accused of?

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to about C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001-11.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings have begun and the company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

A conviction on fraud and corruption charges could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on federal contracts, which would be a major financial hit for the firm.

What's the company background?

SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies and employs some 9,000 people in Canada.

The firm has deep roots in the vote-rich province of Quebec, which is expected to be a battleground in this October's general election.

This is not the first time SNC-Lavalin has found itself in trouble.

In 2016, the agency that oversees Canadian federal elections said former executives had devised a scheme to illegally donate C$118,000 to the federal Liberals and Conservatives between 2004-11. The bulk of the funds went to the prime minister's Liberal Party.

In 2013, the World Bank barred the firm and its affiliates for up to 10 years from bidding on contracts with the agency for ""misconduct"" in a bridge contract in Bangladesh, the longest debarment period ever handed down in a settlement.

How bad is this for Trudeau?

Political commentators suggest Ms Wilson-Raybould's remarks are deeply damaging for Mr Trudeau and the Liberals.

Writing in the Toronto Star, columnist Chantal Hebert says the prime minister was ""already up to his neck in the SNC-Lavalin mess"".

""On Wednesday, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould pushed his head down further. It will be harder for the Liberal government to dig itself out of the deep hole she dug before the next campaign.""

In the National Post, columnist Andrew Coyne said Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony suggested ""an attitude that appears to pervade this government: that the law is not an institution to be revered, but just another obstacle to get around, by whatever means necessary.""

Columnist Patrick Lagace, writing in Montreal newspaper La Presse, said her remarks suggest that ""for the Prime Minister and people acting on his orders, the rule of law and the independence of the Attorney General were at least negotiable"".

In Maclean's magazine, Paul Wells suggests her remarks reveal a ""sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along"".",SNC-Lavalin: Trudeau denies wrongdoing in corruption case,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47362657

On Wednesday, ex-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed in her testimony to lawmakers, that Trudeau's office had put pressure on her in order to help the SNC-Lavalin construction company avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges, which might result in the company's ban on participating in government procurement if the firm is convicted.

The crisis around Trudeau has resulted in an uproar among lawmakers, who held emergency debates on the situation late on Thursday.

The day before, Canada's opposition leader, heading the Conservative Party, called on Trudeau to resign.

Ottawa strongly objects to the tariffs, which Trump imposed last year citing security concerns, and has pressed many times for them to be removed.

""The Prime Minister raised the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs and expressed the need for the removal of tariffs,"" a statement from Trudeau's office said.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Thursday he was working hard to persuade Trump that the U.S. steel industry could be adequately protected by tariff rate quotas, rather than plain tariffs, on imports from Canada and Mexico.

Canadian industry officials say they are opposed to the idea of quotas.

Trade deal ratification questions

Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said on Sunday that Canada might find it hard to ratify a new continental free trade pact unless the measures were lifted beforehand. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement was concluded last October.

Yet despite the pressure campaign, two Canadian industry sources with close ties to Washington said they had heard nothing to suggest a breakthrough was near.

""There are no talks planned on this right now,"" said one of the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Canada is the single largest supplier of both aluminum and steel to the United States. Washington worries that countries could try to ship supplies through Canada and pretend the metals had been produced in Canadian facilities.

A government official said the final decision was Trump's so it was hard to predict what might happen.

Ex-Attorney General Jody Wils…,"TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s former attorney general is expected to testify Wednesday about whether she was inappropriately pressured by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office to avoid prosecuting a major Canadian engineering company.

Ex-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould has said she wants to tell “her truth” and she will speak at a hearing of the Parliament justice committee.

Trudeau’s government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 that Trudeau or his staff pressured Wilson-Raybould last year to try to avoid a criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya. Critics say that would be improper political meddling in a legal case.

The scandal has been a significant blow to Trudeau, who is facing an election this year. Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s closet adviser, resigned last week but denied that he or anyone else pressured Wilson-Raybould. Michael Wernick, the top civil servant in the government, has also said that no inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould and that Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould the decision on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution was hers alone.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12 as veteran affairs minister but gave no reasons. She had been demoted from justice minister last month, and was furious, releasing a 2,000-word statement after that.

The Globe and Mail’s report this month said Trudeau’s office pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The agreement would have allowed the company to pay reparations but avoid a criminal trial on charges of corruption and bribery.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau largely waived lawyer-client privilege to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak and said Tuesday that he’s “pleased” she will get that opportunity.

Wilson-Raybould accepted the committee’s invitation to testify but complained in a letter to the justice committee that the waiver does not release her to talk about any communications she had after she was named minister of veteran affairs or her resignation from the Cabinet.

She will begin her testimony with a 30-minute opening statement.",Canada’s ex-attorney general to testify about SNC scandal,Seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/canadas-ex-attorney-general-to-testify-about-snc-scandal/

The federal Justice Department is giving the go-ahead for an extradition case to proceed against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is wanted in the United States on fraud allegations. Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press

The Canadian government has given the green light for hearings on whether to hand Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou over to U.S. law authorities.

Ms. Meng, a Chinese citizen, was arrested while changing planes at Vancouver International Airport in December, causing a diplomatic rift between Canada and China.

The federal government took pains to defend Friday’s decision to approve extradition hearings, saying in a news release that Canada is following the letter of the law governing such proceedings.

Story continues below advertisement

“Canada is a country governed by the rule of law,” a Department of Justice statement said. “The decision on whether to issue an Authority to Proceed was made by Department of Justice ... officials who are part of a non-partisan public service.”

The development drew more ire on Friday from Beijing. China has accused Canada of collaborating with the United States to harass Ms. Meng, a top executive with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., China’s biggest private company.

The Chinese embassy in Canada, which has previously called the Meng arrest a “political conspiracy,"" on Friday questioned whether the Canadian government is really bound by the “rule of law” in this case, and urged Ottawa to let Ms. Meng go.

“The Chinese side is utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the issuance of Authority to Proceed by the Department of Justice Canada on the case of Meng Wanzhou,” the embassy said.

“This is not a merely judicial case, but a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise. The subsequent developments have proved this. The so-called ‘rule of law’ and ‘judicial independence’ asserted by Canada cannot cover up the mistakes made by the Canadian side on the case of Meng Wanzhou.”

Only days after Ms. Meng’s arrest, and after Beijing threatened “serious consequences” if she was not released, two Canadians were detained in China in apparent retaliation. China’s foreign ministry says both men – former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor – are being held on suspicion of endangering national security. A Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian who had previously been jailed for drug smuggling.

U.S. prosecutors accuse Ms. Meng and Huawei of fraud to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. Her defence will hinge on allegations that the U.S. charges are politically motivated, and on proving she did nothing wrong under Canadian law, her lead counsel, Richard Peck, told The Globe and Mail last month.

The Trudeau government has said it is simply complying with the terms of Canada’s extradition treaty with the United States.

On Friday, the Department of Justice said a review of evidence submitted by the United States has satisfied the conditions required to proceed with an extradition hearing.

“The department is satisfied that the requirements set out by the Extradition Act for the issuance of an Authority to Proceed have been met and there is sufficient evidence to be put before an extradition judge for decision.”

The Canadian government noted that the proceeding will not determine whether Ms. Meng is guilty of anything. “An extradition hearing is not a trial, nor does it render a verdict of guilt or innocence. If a person is ultimately extradited from Canada to face prosecution in another country, the individual will have a trial in that country.”

The Chinese government remains unconvinced the Trudeau government has no margin to manoeuvre.

Hours before the Department of Justice announcement on Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry took Canada to task over possible double standards by commenting at a regular daily news briefing in Beijing on allegations of political interference in the prosecution of Montreal engineering and construction giant SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

Asked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Mr. Trudeau to say he could not interfere in Ms. Meng’s case while his government stands accused of trying to intervene on behalf of SNC-Lavalin, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he “really liked this question.”

“Of course, I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” the spokesman said. “Not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world is extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

Both Ms. Meng and Huawei have denied the U.S. allegations.

University of Ottawa security expert Wesley Wark said extradition could be a lengthy process if there are appeals, and he added that he would not be surprised if Ms. Meng is released as part of a U.S.-China trade deal. “The best outcome for everyone is if the United States and China come to a trade agreement.”

The British Columbia Supreme Court has scheduled an appearance for March 6 to set the date for the extradition hearing.

Ms. Meng’s defence team said in a statement that it is disappointed that Justice Minister David Lametti is proceeding with the extradition hearing, citing what it called “the political nature of the U.S. charges” and U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion in mid-December that he might use the Huawei executive as a pawn in trade talks.

James Wu, executive president of the Canada China City Friendship Association, called the Canadian government’s decision to proceed with hearings wrong and unwise.

“The whole world knows that Mr. Trump is using this case as a bargaining chip, and that it’s obviously a political issue, but the Canadian government cannot make a wise decision, which makes us very angry,” Mr. Wu said.

“The relationship between Canada and China has already been damaged, and this thing will further damage the friendly relationship between the two countries.”

However, Jimmy Yan, a B.C. lawyer who is a frequent commentator on legal issues in the Chinese-language media, said while concerns over U.S. political motivation are legitimate, Canada is merely fulfilling its obligation to an extradition partner.

“This is an opportunity and, equally, a challenge for Canada to demonstrate the independence and fairness of our court system,” Mr. Yan said. “There is adequate room for Ms. Meng to defend herself.”

Trudeau will tour the country promoting his climate-change plan…,"Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh wrote Trudeau jointly Friday to ask him to recall MPs next week so the Commons could hold the government to account for its actions in the ongoing SNC-Lavalin Affair .

OTTAWA—The Trudeau government has refused an opposition demand to recall Parliament to deal with the SNC-Lavalin affair, and is setting the stage to counter Jody Wilson-Raybould’s allegations of improper political meddling in the company’s criminal trial.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, however, will be far from Ottawa as the MPs look into the allegations.

Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the prime minister, said Friday the government has no intention of recalling the Commons, but will continue to cooperate and watch the work of the Commons justice committee as it probes the affair.

The House of Commons has risen for a two-week break, but the opposition parties say Trudeau owes the country a detailed explanation of his actions.

He is expected to attend a climate-change rally in Toronto Monday evening, the start of a number of events planned across the country next week in which his office says he will talk to Canadians about his “ climate action ” incentive plan — which the Conservatives call a “carbon tax.”

“If what is alleged is true, it is, indeed, worrisome that someone pressured her and that worries me a lot,” said Quebec provincial justice minister Sonia Lebel, who was the chief prosecutor for the Charbonneau commission into corruption in that province.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony has captivated the interest of Canadians unlike many inside-Ottawa stories. It’s shifted the conversation even in Quebec in newspaper editorial pages and beyond, where initially there had been sympathy for the company’s arguments.

The federal opposition parties intend to keep the focus on Wilson-Raybould’s stunning allegations.

In their letter to Trudeau, they slammed his failure to address the questions she raised.

“So far, your only defence is to disagree with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s justice committee testimony, but you have thus far failed to provide Canadians with your account of these events. This is absolutely unacceptable,” wrote Scheer and Singh.

“You also continue to hide behind the Ethics Commmisioner, who, as you are aware, has no mandate whatsoever to investigate political interference into criminal proceedings.

“As the leaders of Canada’s two main opposition parties, we stand united in our belief that you owe Canadians nothing less than full transparency in this matter.”

Despite the break in parliamentary sittings, the Commons justice committee will reconvene Wednesday to hear testimony by Trudeau’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned and denied wrongdoing in the SNC-Lavalin case.

Butts is expected to offer the first account by a key political actor on Trudeau’s side, of the government’s dealings with the former attorney-general.

The committee has previously heard a partial account from Michael Wernick, clerk of the privy council and a supposedly non-partisan public servant, but has yet to hear from anyone on the political staff in the Prime Minister’s Office.

Wernick and deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin will also reappear to answer questions raised by Wilson-Raybould.

Butts is almost as high as it gets.

So far, the Liberal-dominated justice committee has refused opposition requests to call Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford, among others, who were fingered by Wilson-Raybould in a list of 11 people she suggested were acting to pressure her.

In an exhaustive account Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould laid out the “sustained” efforts, including what she said were “veiled threats” by the prime minister through his representatives to persuade her to overrule the public prosecutions director and offer to mediate criminal charges against the Quebec engineering and construction company.

The Vancouver MP, who remains in Trudeau’s Liberal caucus for now, says she resisted what she called their inappropriate “political and partisan” pressure, and said she believes she was moved out of her job as justice minister and attorney general as a result — all of which the prime minister denies.

The prime minister, meanwhile, has now “familiarized himself” with all of her testimony, and has not yet made a decision on her future in the caucus, his office said.

On Friday, one of Trudeau’s ministers from Quebec, where SNC-Lavalin is headquartered, promoted the kind of deal SNC-Lavalin is seeking to settle criminal charges — that Wilson-Raybould had expressly refused.

Marie-Claude Bibeau emerged from Rideau Hall as the new — and first female — minister of agriculture and said “deferred prosecution agreements” are a “tool,” not a way to escape blame.

“A deferred prosecution agreement is not a free ride,” said Bibeau.

“It’s a way to provide for justice, but to punish people differently in terms of any individuals who are responsible and the corporation, while, at the same time, protecting innocent parties, such as employees, retirees, partners and suppliers.”

Bibeau repeated the prime minister’s claim that his government is obliged to consider “9,000 jobs” he says are in play. She upped the ante, saying that “when you include suppliers in the equation, we’re talking about as many as 100,000 people across Canada who are affected.”

“So I do think we have to look at all the options within the proper legal framework and the budget.”

The Quebec company is charged with bribery and fraud in a Libyan payment scheme to win contracts from Moammar Gadhafi’s regime. It wants to negotiate an agreement that would allow the company to avoid a potential criminal conviction and federal contracting ban in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing, a steep fine and corporate reforms and independent oversight.

It has gone to court to seek judicial review of the decision by the director of public prosecutions — Wilson-Raybould upheld this — to deny it a remediation or deferred prosecution agreement.

A Federal Court judge has reserved her decision on the company’s challenge.

In the meantime the preliminary inquiry into the criminal charges resumes April 1.

388,Empty,2019-03-02T22:12:26Z,"‘Sense of chaos’ seen around government’s response, but Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s tactics also come under scrutiny.","“No one has seen anything like it,” said Conservative strategist Jaime Watt. “The question is what does everybody do now?”

The political bombshell launched Wednesday by Jody Wilson-Raybould created new possibilities and pitfalls in the ramp-up to a federal election, say senior strategists.

“It does sound a bit shrill and predictable,” says Watt. “I think they pulled the alarm.

For the Tories, the gift of Liberal scandal delivered by the then attorney-general’s allegations of political interference against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his staff prompted a swift call by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer for Trudeau’s resignation. Wilson-Raybould told a Commons committee about “sustained” efforts to persuade her to overrule the public prosecutions director and offer to mediate criminal charges against the giant Quebec firm SNC-Lavalin .

“He’ll have to backfill with highly specific reasons and explanations for why that is the appropriate remedy … I think he’s going to have to come out with a much more lawyerly attack on the prime minister’s behaviour.”

“I don’t think public opinion is set on this. There presumably are other shoes to drop that we can’t see right now.”

There remains much unknown about what happened — and a long way to go before the October election date — for any certainty on how much Wednesday’s bombshell will reshape Ottawa’s political landscape. With only one side of the story told in detail so far, the narrative is still in flux and possibilities for new revelations very much in play, says Watt.

So Scheer’s challenge, says Watt, is keeping momentum and turning the rather arcane rule-of-law subtleties of attorney-general independence into an election issue for Canadians focused on jobs, health care and raising their children.

“We’ve seen lots of shooting stars where the parliamentary press gallery is running around saying this government is going down. They light up and disappear. Mr. Scheer has got to keep the focus on this. He has to use this to show the prime minister is not who you thought he was. That’s where this can be enterprise-threatening.”

Rather than demanding the prime minister’s head, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for a public inquiry “that would have independence to assess the truth.”

Solid strategy, assesses Robin V. Sears, a longtime NDP strategist who runs Earnscliffe Strategy Group in Ottawa.

“The problem with Mr. Scheer’s response is where does he go from here? Should Trudeau jump off a cliff? Jagmeet and his advisers were smart because they’ve now got a vehicle in which they can keep dropping evidence to argue for a public inquiry step by step.”

Trudeau’s response to Wilson-Raybould’s forensic, detailed deconstruction of meetings and conversations have amounted to sound-bite dismissals made during other announcements. That decision not to address any of the substantive allegations in similar fashion is a curiosity, says Sears.

“A little contrition would have gone a long way. I think there’s just a sense of chaos around the centre of the government … I don’t get the sense there’s a strategic plan being executed.”

And consider, he says, that it was all easily avoided.

“It was entirely predictable that when they dumped Jody, she would seek revenge. Had anyone given any thought to that? Obviously not. This is really amateurish communications management.”

So what of the Liberal fortunes?

“I don’t know how the story goes away for a long time,” says Penny Collenette, a former Liberal organizer and law professor at the University of Ottawa. “I think people really want the truth. If there’s two truths, then Canadians are smart. They’ll figure it out. They’ll decide. Everybody needs to know what happened and what went on.”

For her part, Collenette called Wilson-Raybould’s testimony “very credible, very honest. The detail is what made her very believable.”

But any notions that Wilson-Raybould’s political flame throwing could bring down the government are dramatically premature, political watchers agree.

“Prime ministers are very resilient people, believe me,” said Collenette. Wilson-Raybould “has said she wants to remain. And if the tent is large enough to keep her there, that would be terrific.”

One-off incidents like this typically don’t have enough oxygen to support sustained public outrage required to topple a government, said Watt.

“You have to have a pattern. Will it reduce the majority? Almost certainly. And if this becomes a pattern or triggers a series of leaks and brown envelopes, that’s much more problematic. That’s when you’ve got a problem.”

But one word could take this scandal from a House of Commons committee room to a courtroom: illegal.

In the mad dash following Wilson-Raybould's dazzling testimony before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer held a news conference calling for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to launch a criminal investigation into the government's actions.

""I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate and, frankly, illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau's government,"" he told reporters Wednesday night.

Scheer followed up Thursday with a letter to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, citing sections of the Criminal Code related to provoking fear in an attorney general and obstructing or defeating the course of justice.

""She confirmed veiled threats of consequences if she did not bend to the political wishes of the Liberal Party and the financial interests of the shareholders of SNC-Lavalin. It was also clear that these actions rose to the highest ranks of the government,"" he wrote.

While clearly upset by her government's handling of the file, Wilson-Raybould, who was at one point Canada's most senior lawyer, clearly disagrees something criminal occurred.

In front of the committee she was asked multiple times if the pressure exerted on her broke the law.

""In my opinion, it's not illegal,"" she told the committee.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould highlighted ten important interactions in the SNC-Lavalin affair during her bombshell testimony before the House of Commons Justice Committee. 4:53

For legal animals in Ottawa, it's been a neck-aching round of whiplash trying to figure out who is right.

""Neither opinion settles the matter,"" said Ottawa-based defence lawyer Michael Spratt. ""It's not clearly not obstruction.""

According to the Criminal Code, obstructing justice covers ""everyone who wilfully attempts in any manner … to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.""

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould said she faced intense political pressure and veiled threats related to the SNC-Lavalin affair, and was warned directly by Trudeau about the negative consequences if the company faced prosecution. SNC-Lavalin was facing corruption charges for contracts in Libya and was lobbying for a remediation agreement as an alternative to criminal prosecution.

Examine the case, Conservative MacKay says

Former Conservative justice minister Peter MacKay said there's enough from Wilson-Raybould's testimony to warrant further examination — either through a public inquiry or a criminal investigation.

""What's happened here is that somebody in the office gave her the impression there would be consequences if she was not to follow the instructions, and when that didn't happen we know that she did lose her job,"" he said.

""I come back to the definition of the Criminal Code section which speaks of perverting justice, it speaks of interference, it speaks of in some way trying to shape the outcome of a prosecution, and the elements appear to be there.""

Criminal defence lawyer Joseph Neuberger said an obstruction of justice charge wouldn't be hard to prove in court. He pointed to a meeting Gerry Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, had with Wilson-Raybould's trusted chief of staff Jessica Prince where he allegedly said, ""There is no solution here that doesn't involve some interference.""

""If that is not a smoking gun when it comes to actual interference and obstruction, I don't know what is,"" said Neuberger.

""This has stepped over the bounds of inappropriate; it has certainly crossed into the realm of criminal conduct.""

Spratt said he doesn't think the case is a ""slam dunk,"" for police and prosecutors, but ""it's starting to sound a lot like obstruction.""

Canadian Civil Liberties Association executive director Michael Bryant, who in the first few days of the scandal called for a police investigation, now says this issue isn't as clear cut.

""The evidence for obstruction of justice requires evidence of intent. So you need to have evidence of the prime minister intended to obstruct justice, and we didn't hear any of that,"" he said Thursday.

""I don't think that we should politicize a criminal investigation by the RCMP any more than we should criminalize a prosecutorial decision against SNC-Lavalin. I don't think it's for Parliament to be telling the police what to do.""

Nothing criminal, Liberal Cotler says

It's a view shared, in part, by Irwin Cotler, another former justice minister.

""I don't see anything criminal going on,"" the former Liberal cabinet minister said. ""I do think that what's been happening here is really a reflection of the ongoing dynamics between the offices of the minister of justice, the other members of cabinet and her responsibilities as attorney general.""

Cotler, who has advocated for the roles of attorney general and justice minister be separated, said it's possible officials with the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and minister of finance didn't intend to exert inappropriate direction on Wilson-Raybould, but over time it felt like concentrated and sustained pressure.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould referred to it as ""a barrage of people hounding me and my staff.""

""I know this may sound somewhat, perhaps, speaking paradoxically when I say that both sides may be telling the truth, but that was my feeling that she was really telling it as she saw it, as she experienced it,"" said Cotler.

Watch the explainer below on the key players in the SNC-Lavalin controversy:

A Power & Politics explainer. 2:26

The RCMP, as expected, won't comment on the calls for an investigation, but the force did acknowledge it's reviewing Scheer's letter.

""The RCMP does not confirm or deny the existence of a criminal investigation unless charges would be laid,"" said a spokesperson.

For his part, Trudeau said no one from his team has been questioned by RCMP officers.

""We have confidence in the processes in place. The justice committee is pursuing its study, and we will of course respect the independence and indeed the work of the committee"" he told reporters Thursday.

""We will also look very closely and participate fully in the ethics commissioner's investigation into this.""

Former AGs weigh in

Meanwhile, late Thursday, two former federal attorneys general — MacKay, who served in the role under former prime minister Stephen Harper, and Douglas Grinslade Lewis, who served under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — penned a letter to the RCMP asking for a police investigation into the matter.

The letter was also signed by three former provincial attorneys general: Jonathan Denis, Progressive Conservative, from Alberta; Cecil Clarke, Progressive Conservative, from Nova Scotia; and Colin Gableman, NDP, from British Columbia.",Legal community mixed on whether SNC-Lavalin scandal warrants criminal probe,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-investigation-obstruction-quetions-1.5037252

“It’s fair to say it’s a constitutional crisis,” Turpel-Lafond said Wednesday night, invoking a term often used to describe the breakdown of the rules underpinning a system of government. The events, as outlined by Wilson-Raybould in marathon testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, “shake the foundations of our very system,” Turpel-Lafond said. Wilson-Raybould told MPs she was repeatedly and inappropriately pressured by senior members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s staff, as well as the country’s top bureaucrat, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal trial on charges of fraud and corruption.

Wilson-Raybould refused, and found herself shuffled to a different cabinet portfolio in January. Former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant agreed the scandal amounts to a constitutional crisis, saying Trudeau seems insistent on “interfering with the prosecution.”

“That conflicts with a system that requires independence from political influence. It opens the door to prosecuting enemies of the government and giving immunity to its friends which is despotic,” Bryant, who is now the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told the Star. He said the actions of the PMO, as laid out by Wilson-Raybould, undermine public faith in the independence of the judicial process. In the fallout from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau and Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, to resign. Irwin Cotler, a former Liberal attorney general of Canada, said he doesn’t believe Trudeau should step down or that “there was an intent on the part of the government to cross the line.” “I believe that they felt they were asking her to engage in what they believed was a matter of public policy for the importance of Canada and the importance of Quebec, jobs and the like, which she acknowledged was OK,” Cotler said. But at a minimum, Turpel-Lafond said the RCMP’s integrity section must investigate, noting that 11 highly placed people in the PMO, the public service and cabinet were named by Wilson-Raybould as lobbying her or her staff on the issue. “The consequences for that is that our reputation as a nation of the rule of law will be in tatters if we do not take steps,” Turpel-Lafond said. “And the steps need to be significant, decisive.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The allegations by Jody Wils…,"The leader of Canada’s main opposition party Wednesday demanded Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quit after a former justice minister said government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major firm avoid a bribery trial.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

“He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau was to address reporters later Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Besides that critical race in B.C.'s Burnaby South for Jagmeet Singh, there are two other byelections being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe and Outremont in Quebec.

Burnaby South is one place where all three major parties have been competitive in past elections. The NDP held onto the seat by a hair more than one per cent of the votes in 2015.

The Liberals, who usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby, faced challenges in this campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he's not taking anything for granted, but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,"" he said.

Singh has been without a seat since he was chosen as leader of the NDP in October 2017. The B.C. riding has been the focus of the party's heaviest campaigning efforts since Singh announced he would run for that seat in August. Expectations are Singh will take the win in this byelection.

But the NDP is also squaring off against the Liberals in another race — to defend former leader Tom Mulcair's seat in the downtown Montreal riding of Outremont.

Outremont

The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily.

The NDP's support in Quebec has been fading, and the riding was a Liberal stronghold before Mulcair seized it in a 2007 byelection, the first-ever win in the province for the NDP and one that helped set the stage for the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011.

Countrywide, that Orange Wave is now little more than a ripple. The NDP has been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night in October, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

Singh also presents unique challenges in Quebec ridings.

Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, told The Canadian Press people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality — and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in the eyes of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about [the turban],"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Sanchez is running against Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan, Conservative Jasmine Louras, Bloc candidate Michel Duchesne, PPC candidate James Seale and Green party deputy leader Daniel Green.

York-Simcoe

York-Simcoe is almost certainly a safe Conservative seat. The Tories won it by 45 points in 2011 and still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Stephen Harper was defeated.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson told CBC News on Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue.

Hold the champagne! If Monday’s much-anticipated byelection results suggest anything, it is that none of the main federal parties is where it should want to be a little more than six months from the official start of a national election campaign.

In fact, even as polls show the unresolved crisis is taking a toll on the prime minister’s party, voters in the three ridings in play on Monday did not seem inclined to discipline the Liberals for their latest alleged ethical transgression.

At 40 per cent, their score in Outremont was their best since the 2004 sponsorship scandal. That is just the latest sign that the crisis over the government’s handling of SNC-Lavalin’s judicial file is unlikely to turn into a train wreck of similar proportions for Trudeau in Quebec in the fall election.

Only one in five voters cast a ballot in Outremont and York Simcoe. The turnout in Burnaby South was 30 per cent.

That being said, the Liberals lost close to 10 points from their 2015 scores in each of the two non-Quebec ridings in the last election. A similar drop across Ontario and B.C. this fall would see Trudeau and his party back in opposition.

His entry in the House of Commons at a particularly challenging time for the ruling Liberals will offer the NDP leader as close to a second chance to make a good first impression as a politician can hope for.

Singh will have to hit the ground running, for Monday’s returns also brought the expected confirmation that the party is headed nowhere fast in the province that gave it the most seats in the last two federal elections.

Yes, the New Democrats held on to second place in Outremont with 26 per cent of the vote, and yes, it is a score they would have been proud of in the pre-Thomas Mulcair era. But that number reflects an 18-point loss in support. It would not take a drop anywhere near that large to wipe the NDP off the face of Quebec this fall. Just last week, two more NDP MPs from Quebec announced they would not be seeking re-election.

The Conservative performance was symptomatic of all that ails Andrew Scheer’s party as it looks to the general election.

Its vote share went up in the riding where it least needed to do better — giving it a win in Ontario’s York Simcoe with 54 per cent of the vote as opposed to the 50 per cent it got in 2015. But the CPC lost ground in the other two ridings, suggesting the non-Liberal vote has yet to coalesce behind Scheer.

At seven per cent in Outremont, the Conservatives might as well have stayed home. In Burnaby South, their third-place finish with 22 per cent of ballots cast was overshadowed by Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party capturing 10.6% of the vote.

The good news for the CPC is that its right-wing rival’s score is more reflective of the personal appeal of the local candidate than that of the fledging party. At barely two per cent in Outremont and York Simcoe, Bernier’s first electoral tests in his home province and in Ontario were flops.

But perhaps the worst night on the field of expectations goes to the Bloc Québécois. This was the struggling sovereigntist party’s first byelection under new leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the first vote to showcase a sovereigntist option on the ballot since the Parti Québécois rout in last fall’s provincial election.

Outremont would not top any list of winnable BQ ridings but prior to Mulcair’s appearance on the scene in a 2 007 byelection, the sovereigntist party routinely won about a third of the vote. On Monday it only took one vote in 10.

The BQ was even beaten for third place by the Green Party. In veteran environmentalist Daniel Green, Elizabeth May recruited a rare big-name candidate for her party in Quebec and that certainly made a difference.

But the Greens’ 12 per cent finish is also a reminder that, these days, more Quebec voters are inclined to use their ballots to send a pro-environment message than a pro-sovereignty one.

Two-hundred and thirty-four days stand between today and the next federal election. That’s so many news cycles; so many chances for a gang of savvy politicians, stuck in a rut, to earn redemption; so much time. Unless, for these governing Liberals, every one of those days is anything like the last one.

Maclean’s writer Andrew MacDougall knows hellish news days, having toiled in Stephen Harper’s prime minister’s office and emerged intact. He writes that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s response to Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, hastily delivered the same evening, only confirmed the worst of his instincts:

You tell Canadians—in that sanctimonious and overly serious tone you adopt when you’re under the cosh—who have watched Wilson-Raybould rattle their confidence in Canada’s institutions to now have confidence in the ethics commissioner, an office that has already found you guilty of breaking another law, but isn’t equipped to investigate the allegations unfurled by Wilson-Raybould. And while you’re busy doing that, you have your office tell media that nobody else will be resigning based on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. In other words, every move you make tonight makes you look like the un-smart, un-serious man that so many of your political opponents have always insisted you are. [Maclean’s]

His truth: At his second encounter with reporters in just over 12 hours, the Prime Minister was again, of course, asked to answer the same questions we’re all bound to hear ad nauseum. When he was asked about Wilson-Raybould’s future as a Liberal, Trudeau invoked that well-worn tool of verbal vagueness: the passive voice. “I have taken knowledge of her testimony,” he said, “and there are still reflections to have on next steps.” So that’s a maybe? [CBC News]

Trudeau’s lieutenants dutifully distanced themselves from both Wilson-Raybould and her decision. First up was Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland: “I believe that [JWR] spoke, as she said she wanted to do, her truth. Having said that, I am clearly of the view that the Prime Minister would never apply improper pressure.” Finance Minister Bill Morneau later stood up for his chief of staff, Ben Chin, telling reporters he never crossed any lines with JWR. “My staff, appropriately, would make her staff aware of the economic consequences of decisions, about the importance of thinking about jobs.” [CBC News, National Observer]

Speaking of cabinet, the PM will this morning fill the gap at veterans affairs left vacant when Wilson-Raybould stepped down. CBC News reports the shuffle will involve only a “handful” of existing ministers. [CBC News]

He’s baaaaaack! A scant 10 days after Gerald Butts quit his post as Trudeau’s principal secretary, he’s asked for—and received—a little more time in the spotlight. In a letter to House justice committee chair Anthony Housefather, Butts offered that his “evidence will be of assistance” and that he only requires “a short period of time” to seek legal advice on that evidence—and, apparently certain “relevant documents.” [The letter, CTV News]

Elizabeth May, who recently polled as Canada’s most ethical federal leader, scored a standing-o from the opposition benches for, among other things, calling on the PM to sack Michael Wernick, the Privy Council clerk whose conduct came under intense scrutiny in the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony. [Nanos poll, Steve Paikin tweet]

Oh, and Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has asked the RCMP to investigate what he says could be criminal acts on the part of several top officials—including the PM. You read that right. Scheer, who’s alleging PMO political interference for partisan gain, is asking the RCMP to investigate his political opponent. There’s a name for that. Surely unrelated, five former attorneys general, four Tories and a New Democrat, also wrote to the RCMP. [Huffington Post, The Five AGs]

Elsewhere on the JWR file: Liberal MP Jati Sidhu certainly had a bad day. A newspaper in his riding quoted Sidhu as saying Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was based on “sour grapes,” that she “couldn’t handle the stress” of her job, and that her dad, outspoken Indigenous leader Bill Wilson, might be “pulling the strings.” Sidhu later apologized in the House. [Abbotsford News]

The Liberals would much rather have Canada talk about almost anything other than the news of the day—say, their plans to build—what else?—a robotic arm for a new moon-orbiting space station, or their “historic” attempt to fix Indigenous child welfare in Canada, or even their opening of a new, kinda-cool-sounding science-driven winery in Nova Scotia. But that’s the price of defensive talking points that utterly fail to distract a single reporter. [This is one excited astronaut, Perry Bellegarde tweet, Wine not?]

Today, Wilson-Raybould’s replacement as attorney general, David Lametti, is in Montreal, where he’ll announce funding (stay tuned for how much) meant to “help Canadians gain the skills that will allow them to fully participate in the digital economy.” One wonders how many onlookers at La Grande Bibliothèque will be preoccupied with another of the minister’s files.

It's been 16,877 days and counting since the last manned mission to the moon, but now it seems that everyone is in a hurry to go back.

After keeping her silence for weeks, former Minister of Justice and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould had a lot to say at Wednesday's Commons justice committee hearing.

Meghan Markle is at the centre of a war of words being fought on social media.

The new moon race

Fifty years is a long time, even on the moon.

The first footprints that Neil Armstrong made on the evening of July 20, 1969, were likely obliterated when Apollo 11's landing module blasted off the next day, and the American flag that the crew left behind was long ago bleached white by ultraviolet rays. Although the tools, towels, cameras and other objects they dumped to lessen the load are still up there along with the bags of astronaut poop, all now covered with a layer of fine, lunar dust.

It's been 16,877 days and counting since Apollo 17, the last manned mission to our closest celestial neighbour.

But now it seems that everyone is in a hurry to go back.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took a brief break from crisis management this morning to announce that Canada will join the U.S.-led Lunar Gateway project that could put astronauts back on the moon's surface as soon as 2028.

The international scheme calls for the construction of an orbiting moon station starting next year, followed by what NASA calls ""sustainable lunar architecture"" — aka a moon base — that will serve as both a research station and proving ground for an eventual Mars mission.

And the U.S. space agency recently announced plans for one of its private space partners to land a new robotic probe on the moon by the end of 2019, and last week unveiled a dozen scientific payloads.

The sudden resurgence of interest has everything to do with competition.

The Chinese government achieved a space first by landing a probe and rover on the far-side of the moon at the beginning of January, a likely precursor to their own crewed mission.

The Kremlin reportedly has plans to put Russian cosmonauts on the moon by 2031, and construct its own lunar base by 2035.

A lander built by a private Israeli firm, Beresheet, blasted off on a SpaceX rocket last week, and may or may not be headed for a moon landing following a software glitch.

India, which sent its first probe to the moon in 2008, has a second mission teed up and ready to go. It plans a manned mission by December 2021, the Indian Space Research Organization said in January.

And Taiwan has ramped up its space program, with the moon as the ultimate goal.

The private sector will surely play a big role in future moon missions.

A Japanese firm, ispace, is building two spacecraft that it hopes to send to the moon via SpaceX launches in 2020 and 2021. It is busy recruiting corporate partners, like NGK Spark Plug Co., to help underwrite the cost.

NASA, which hasn't had its own manned launch capability since the Shuttle program ended in 2011 — it has been contracting the job out to the Russians at as much as $82 million US a seat — is counting on Boeing and SpaceX for a made-in-America solution.

Kailasavadivoo Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, outlines upcoming moon missions at ISRO headquarters in Bangalore on Jan. 11. ISRO plans to launch a lunar probe by December 2020, a second by July 2021, and a manned mission by December 2021, he said. (Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images)

Progress has been slow, but Elon Musk's company is scheduled to send its Crew Dragon capsule on a dry run to the International Space Station this coming weekend, with plans to ferry its first astronauts in July, should all go well.

Boeing's Starliner test-flight should happen later this spring.

All of that has to do with cost.

NASA's 2019 budget is an impressive-sounding $21.5 billion US, but that's less than half a per cent of Washington's total spending, and about 50 per cent of the purchasing power the agency wielded during the Apollo glory years.

(Trudeau today earmarked $2.05 billion over the next 24 years for Canada's space program, including $150 million over five years for the Lunar Gateway.)

Despite the recent surge in interest, the new space race still lacks the 1960s urgency and investment provided by the Cold War.

Although Donald Trump, who has something of a space fixation, was reportedly willing to spend almost anything to ensure a Mars landing — as long as it occurred during his time in office.

Team of Vipers, the recent West-wing tell-all by former aide Cliff Sims, details an April 2017 Oval Office event during which the U.S. President put his then-NASA administrator on the spot, demanding a manned Mars mission before the 2020 election.

The NASA chief gently explained that the actual timeline — signed into law by Trump just a month earlier — is in the 2030s, and given the logistical challenges probably can't be advanced much, even with an unlimited budget.

Trump, writes Sims, was ""visibly disappointed.""

At Issue

It's been another wild week in Canadian politics, producer Arielle Piat-Sauvé writes.

Almost three weeks after allegations of political interference by the prime minister's office first came to light in a Globe and Mail report, we've finally heard from the person at the centre of it all — Jody Wilson-Raybould.

And after keeping her silence for weeks, the former Minister of Justice and Attorney General had a lot to say at yesterday's Commons justice committee hearing.

Jody Wilson-Raybould gives her testimony about the SNC-Lavalin affair before a justice committee hearing on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday. The Montreal-based firm was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts. (Lars Hagberg/AFP/Getty Images)

During her 40-minute-long opening statement, Wilson-Raybould presented her detailed account of events in chronological order. She then spent another three-and-a-half hours answering questions.

It's clear to anyone listening to the almost four-hour testimony that her account of what happened differs from that of the Clerk of the Privy Council and the prime minister.

Wilson-Raybould says she faced veiled threats and repeated political pressure to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin affair. The prime minister refuted Wilson-Raybould's testimony and reiterated that he believes there was no inappropriate pressure.

In his latest column, Andrew Coyne says either Wilson-Raybould is flat-out lying, or the prime minister and his people are.

Paul Wells describes the former Attorney General's account as a sickening, smug protection racket, and says the rules need to be the rules.

And last night, the leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, went as far as to call on Trudeau to resign.

Right now it looks like Canadians will have to decide whose narrative they believe, the prime minister's or Wilson-Raybould's.

As Chantal Hébert said during our special Wednesday At Issue, Wilson-Raybould has placed the prime minister right in the middle of the controversy — and they are supposed to be on the same team. Today, Hébert writes that the Liberals will likely be heading into the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin affair still hanging around the party's neck.

So why is Wilson-Raybould remaining in the Liberal caucus? And what's the government's next move?

One thing we can be certain of is that this topic will dominate Question Period today.

Needless to say, lots for the At Issue panel tonight. Rosie Barton is away this week, but Chantal, Andrew and Paul will join host Ian Hanomansing. We'll tackle the latest on the SNC-Lavalin controversy and take some viewer questions.

Hope you can tune in!

#Megxit or #Megulator

Meghan Markle is at the centre of a war of words being fought on social media, writes London bureau reporter Kayla Hounsell.

I had been combing through the online vitriol about Meghan Markle for a while when my producer, Lily Martin, came across the work of social data journalist Gemma Joyce.

She had noticed so much nastiness online about the Duchess of Sussex, she decided to dig deep to find out who was saying what.

While it was already clear there were many distasteful and racist comments, I thought Joyce could give us some actual data. We made the trip to Brighton, England, to meet with her.

Joyce showed us a wall of screens in her office, displaying bar graphs, pie charts and maps. They indicated the most popular hashtag about Meghan Markle is #Megxit. You guessed it, a play on Brexit. People want Meghan to ""leave"" the way Britain is leaving the European Union.

#Moonbump is also growing in popularity, referring to the Duchess's baby bump.

""There is this theory going around that she is faking her pregnancy, which to me sounds a little bit mad,"" Joyce says.

Careful Meghan your moonbump crease is showing again <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/moonbump?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#moonbump</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/fakepregnancy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#fakepregnancy</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Megxit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Megxit</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Megxit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Megxit</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/CharlatanDuchess?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#CharlatanDuchess</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/notmyduchess?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#notmyduchess</a> <a href=""https://t.co/LF0dHQJLD3"">pic.twitter.com/LF0dHQJLD3</a> —@jasmine3071

Perhaps not surprisingly, 80 per cent of this discussion is being generated by women, but what's really interesting is that the majority of them are not in the United Kingdom. The United States, where Meghan was an actress before marrying into the Royal Family, is fuelling the conversation, followed by the U.K., with Canada coming in third.

Joyce points out that while there is a lot of online abuse, there are also Meghan supporters, and they have a hashtag too. They're the Megulators.

""It's not that, you know, the trolls are really winning,"" she says. ""But at the same time, just looking at the kind of hatred around it is quite depressing really.""

397,Empty,2019-03-01T14:21:25Z,"And now, corruption news from north of the border The post Justin Trudeau’s days as PM may be numbered appeared first on Hot Air.","Remember when Justin Trudeau was the new, liberal golden boy of international politics? He’s been somewhat pushed off the stage by Emmanuel Macron in recent years, but following his Liberal Party’s stunning election victory in 2015, he was on top of the world. He’s also made a habit of verbally crossing swords with President Trump from time to time, just to keep his liberal bona fides in proper order. His approval ratings in the Great White North have traditionally been well above water.

That may be coming to an end, however. Canada’s next federal elections are coming up in October of this year and almost all the news for Trudeau has been bad lately. While it hasn’t surfaced on American cable news networks very often, the Prime Minister is in hot water over an emerging corruption scandal that has opponents calling for his resignation. It’s alleged that Trudeau pressured his former Attorney General to drop corruption charges against a major construction company and quietly pursue a settlement agreement instead.

All bets are now off about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s political survival. An ethics scandal has plunged Canada’s government into disarray, with the prime minister himself facing unprecedented political peril. A flood of new details allege Trudeau and several senior government officials repeatedly pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large construction company and reach a settlement agreement. Trudeau’s political opponents sent police a letter Thursday requesting an investigation and called for Trudeau’s resignation. “He can no longer, and in good standing with a clear conscience, lead this nation,” said Conservative Andrew Scheer, who hopes to replace Trudeau.

This may sound like small potatoes compared to the regular cornucopia of scandals we get in the United States, but the details are fairly stunning. When the allegation of interfering with the Attorney General’s office first emerged, Trudeau’s team flatly denied there had been any such involvement. But this week, the former Attorney General in question, Jody Wilson-Raybould, provided testimony and notes from meetings and phone calls detailing the conversations she’d had with the Prime Minister’s staff and even Trudeau himself.

Compounding matters is the fact that the company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major employer in Quebec where Trudeau is a member of Parliament. The AG testified that Trudeau himself had reminded her that there was an election coming up in Quebec and this would look very bad. Wilson-Raybould was then demoted by the PM and replaced by a new official from Trudeau’s home province.

All of this adds up to a story that’s taking much of the bloom off of Trudeau’s rose. The polling was already showing him in a tight race before the AG’s testimony and now it’s shaping up to be even worse. We should also keep in mind that the Canadians haven’t traditionally been shy about swapping out the party in power. Prior to the Liberal Party’s sweeping victory in 2015, the Conservative Party held a solid majority of their own following the 2011 elections under Stephen Harper. And the way things are going, the Conservatives may be on the rise once again.",Justin Trudeau’s days as PM may be numbered,Hotair.com,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/03/01/justin-trudeaus-days-pm-may-numbered/

All bets are now off about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's political survival.

An ethics scandal has plunged Canada's government into disarray, with the prime minister himself facing unprecedented political peril.

A flood of new details allege Trudeau and several senior government officials repeatedly pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large construction company and reach a settlement agreement. Trudeau's political opponents sent police a letter Thursday requesting an investigation and called for Trudeau's resignation.

""He can no longer, and in good standing with a clear conscience, lead this nation,"" said Conservative Andrew Scheer, who hopes to replace Trudeau.

The prime minister brushed off that request and said Canadians will have a chance to judge him for themselves in an election this fall.

Until recently, his reelection appeared to be nearly a lock. The latest polls now show him slipping into a tight race — and those surveys don't even capture the latest influx of damaging detail.

""It’s like someone threw the chessboard into the air,"" said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. ""The pieces haven’t landed yet ... This was already a close race. [Trudeau's Liberals] couldn’t afford to stumble. And, yesterday was much more than a stumble.""

The turning point was testimony Wednesday at a spectacular justice committee hearing in the Canadian House of Commons: On the same day Michael Cohen torched President Donald Trump at a committee hearing, a spurned ally of Trudeau's was scorching him too.

Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was dropped by Trudeau but continues to sit in his party’s caucus, broke her silence after weeks of speculation about what she might say.

In painstaking detail she demolished the talking point from the government that Trudeau played no role in pressuring her to cut a plea deal with a Montreal-based company. Wilson-Raybould described and shared notes from about 10 meetings and 10 phone calls with 11 senior members of the government, including Trudeau. She said after she repeatedly fought pressure last fall from officials in Trudeau's office and other departments to deliver a non-prosecution agreement, the prime minister brought it up with her.

She said Trudeau noted in a meeting last September that the company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major, longstanding employer in his home town.

Wilson-Raybould also said the prime minister and others raised the suggestion that cutting a deal could help the provincial wing of their Liberal party in an election last October, which it ultimately lost.

""At that point the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am [a member of Parliament] in Quebec.' ... I was quite taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould said. ""My response — and I vividly remember this as well — was to ask the prime minister a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked, 'Are you politically interfering with my role?'""

She said Trudeau said he wasn't interfering.

But she was soon demoted to a lesser role in the Cabinet, replaced with a new attorney general from Trudeau's home town, and she recently quit her Cabinet post.

Wilson-Raybould, who remains a member of parliament, told the committee hearing that she was, ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,"" the Watergate purging of the Justice Department.

The sole bright spot on the darkest day of Trudeau's term came when the former minister was asked whether Trudeau or others had committed a crime.

""I don't believe that,"" she replied.

The opposition seized the moment anyway: The Conservative leader hoping to replace Trudeau in an election later this year sent police a letter requesting an investigation.

Andrew Scheer asked the Mounties to investigate whether the acts described violated two criminal code items: one on obstruction of justice, the other against pressuring the attorney general. The RCMP has not commented.

He also called on Trudeau to resign.

“I was sickened and appalled by [the] story of inappropriate, and frankly bordering on illegal, pressure,” Scheer said. ""Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet must now find a way forward, without him … They have a duty to govern this nation, not help a disgraced prime minister hang onto power.”

Trudeau disputed the characterization of events, but did not deny asking her to spare the company. He insisted he never directed the minister to drop charges.

“There are disagreements in perspective on this,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""But I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

He also sidestepped questions about calling a broader public inquiry, beyond ongoing parliamentary and ethics investigations.

One option available in theory is an early election.

If the opposition wants Trudeau gone, and if Trudeau said his fate is ultimately up to voters, they could call for an early election. The current election is officially set for October 23, but the Canadian constitution allows a vote at any time.

Several members of the Trudeau government dismissed the idea. A spokesperson for the prime minister, Eleanore Catenaro, said Trudeau squashed the idea of an early election call in a December interview.

""His comments still stand,"" Catenaro said.

And asked about early election talk, Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said Thursday: “[There's been] none that I’ve heard.""

Minister of Innovation Navdeep Bains was with Trudeau at a press conference announcing a 24-year Canadian commitment to NASA's deep-space exploration project.

He sounded a similar note.

“We’re just focused on our mandate,"" Bains said in an interview. ""We’re focused on executing our work for Canadians.”

Justin Trudeau's right-hand-man says the prime minister did nothing improper as a deepening political crisis threatens the government's re-election chances. Here's what you need to know.

In a nutshell

Mr Trudeau has been accused of pressuring his former attorney general to cut a deal with a company facing corruption charges - and retaliating when she refused to play ball.

The revelations could cost Trudeau the October general election, some pundits say.

The former AG, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and his staff spent months trying to convince her that taking the company to trial would cost Canadians jobs, and their party votes.

She also says she was subject to ""veiled threats"", which she believes were made good when she was shuffled out of her department.

Now another minister, Jane Philpott, has quit saying it was ""untenable"" for her to continue due to ""serious concerns"" raised by the case.

But Gerald Butts, Mr Trudeau's former principal secretary, says there was no political pressure - only concerns for how the prosecution could affect local economies.

Who are the players?

The spurned ex-minister: Jody Wilson-Raybould was Canada's attorney general and justice minister. Unlike in the UK, the two roles are held by the same person.

She was also Canada's first indigenous justice minister and worked on a number of pieces of landmark legislation, including legalising cannabis and assisted dying.

In January, she was shuffled from the justice department to the department of veterans' affairs - a move many saw as a demotion.

The corporation: SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company faces fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was in power.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The PM: Justin Trudeau is Canada's prime minister. He won a majority government in 2015 on a platform of transparency, gender equality and a commitment to reconciliation with Canada's indigenous peoples.

He faces a federal election in October 2019.

The Trudeau ally who quit: Jane Philpott is described as one of his most trusted ministers.

But her resignation statement explaining why she was quitting as Treasury Board president could not have been more pointed.

Citing the SNC-Lavallin affair, she said: ""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Trudeau's right-hand man: Gerald Butts has been described as the ""most important Liberal in Canada today"" whose last name is not ""Trudeau"". But all that changed in February, when Mr Butts resigned amid rumours he had pressured the justice minister to cut a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

Mr Butts is one of Mr Trudeau's closest allies, and the two have been friends since their university days in Montreal.

He is credited with helping Mr Trudeau win the Liberal party leadership in 2013 and was a key architect in the Liberal party's sweeping 2015 electoral victory.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jody Wilson-Raybould, seen here with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has so far declined to comment

Why would Trudeau care about SNC-Lavalin?

SNC-Lavalin is based in Quebec, a swing province that has long been viewed as essential ground for the Liberal Party to win during an election - which is coming up in October.

When the Liberals win Quebec, they often win a majority of seats in parliament. When they lose, they lose badly.

At the time that Wilson-Raybould says she was being pressured to cut a deal, Quebec was also in the middle of a heated provincial election that eventually led to the ousting of Quebec Liberal premier Philippe Couillard.

Wilson-Raybould says the federal Liberal Party kept raising the Quebec election as one of the reasons why she should consider cutting a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

What does Trudeau say?

Trudeau has denied wrongdoing and says any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with her ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

What could the fallout be?

Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerald Butts has already resigned.

Many speculate that other top officials that Wilson-Raybould named may follow.

Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating Wilson-Raybould's accusations to see if any conflict-of-interest rules were broken. For her part, Wilson-Raybould says she believes no laws were broken, but that the prime minister's office acted improperly.

But the real question is what this could mean for Trudeau and his election in the fall.

Conservative leader of the opposition Andrew Scheer has already called for Trudeau's resignation, saying he no longer has the ""moral authority"" to lead.

That seems unlikely, but what is likely - at least according to columnist Chantal Hebert and other political pundits - is that ""the Liberals will likely go in the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin albatross still hanging around their party's neck"".",Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould: The scandal that could unseat Canada's PM,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47408239

Scheer calls for Trudeau's resignation

Posted on by tcrlaf

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

Wilson-Raybould is se…","Jody Wilson-Raybould says she faced intense political pressure and veiled threats related to the SNC-Lavalin affair, and was warned directly by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the negative consequences if the company faced prosecution.

It was a day of high political drama, as the former justice minister and attorney general accused top Liberal government officials of inappropriate, excessive political interference in an independent criminal prosecution, and the opposition parties called for Trudeau's resignation and a public inquiry into the scandal.

Testifying at the Commons justice committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said she was contacted by 11 officials in the Prime Minister's Office, the Privy Council Office and Finance Minister Bill Morneau's office while she was justice minister and attorney general about the Quebec-based engineering and construction company. SNC-Lavalin was facing corruption charges for contracts in Libya and was lobbying for a remediation agreement as an alternative to criminal prosecution.

""For a period of four months from September to December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin.""

Wilson-Raybould said she was ""hounded"" by various officials through phone calls, meetings and text messages.

'Veiled threats'

""Within these conversations there were express statements regarding the necessity of interfering in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC-Lavalin,"" she said.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the gov't to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion..."" 1:08

The corporation faced a 10-year ban on bidding on government contracts if convicted of the criminal charges of bribery.

Wilson-Raybould chronicled a series of meetings, including one with Trudeau and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick on Sept. 17, 2018. She told him that she had made a decision not to overturn the decision from the director of the Public Prosecution Service Kathleen Roussel to proceed with criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin.

The prime minister cited potential job losses and the possible move by the company, and asked her to ""help out."" The clerk then made the case for a DPA and reminded her that there was an election coming in Quebec.

""At that point, the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec, and that 'I am an MP in Quebec, the MP for Papineau,'"" she recounted. 'I was quite taken aback.""

PM needed a 'solution'

At that point, Wilson-Raybould said, she posed a direct question to Trudeau while looking him straight in the eye, asking if he was politically interfering with her role and her decision as the attorney general.

""I would strongly advise against it,"" she told the committee she warned Trudeau, who responded, ""No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh speech to reporters after Jody Wilson Raybould's testimony 0:48

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the RCMP must open an investigation, and he called on Trudeau to resign as prime minister for his role in undermining the administration of justice and trying to overturn an independent decision by the attorney general. He said the prime minister has lost his moral authority to govern.

""I was sickened and appalled by [Wilson-Raybould's] story of inappropriate and, frankly, borderline illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest levels of Justin Trudeau's government,"" he said.

Trudeau refuted Wilson-Raybould's account and dismissed the call for him to step down.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" he said during an event in Montreal late Wednesday. ""And therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events.""

Still in caucus — for now

Trudeau said it's premature to determine Wilson-Raybould's status in the Liberal caucus.

""I haven't yet had the opportunity to review her entire testimony. I will do that before making any further decision,"" he said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Trudeau may well have to resign, but right now he's pressing to get to the bottom of the scandal.

""At this point, Canadians demand some answers that they have, and the only way to get to the bottom of this is a public inquiry that would have the independence to assess the truth,"" he said.

Singh called Wednesday's testimony ""explosive"" and ""incredibly damaging.""

Wilson-Raybould, who is still in the Liberal caucus, testified for nearly four hours as the key witness for the Commons justice committee in a packed room on Parliament Hill. In an unusual reversal of roles, opposition Conservative and NDP MPs praised the Liberal MP for speaking truthfully and having the courage to speak out while she was asked pointed and at times uncomfortable questions from her fellow Liberal MPs.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to reporters in Montreal after Wilson-Raybould's testimony 0:57

Wilson-Raybould recounted an Oct. 26, 2018, conversation between her chief of staff Jessica Prince and PMO adviser Mathieu Bouchard, who was still pressing the option of an alternative to prosecution for SNC-Lavalin and suggesting an external legal opinion.

She told the committee that Prince told Bouchard this would be perceived as interference and the attorney general questioning Roussel's decision.

""Mathieu said that if — six months from the election — SNC announces they are moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said, 'We can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected,'"" Wilson-Raybould testified.

On Dec. 5, 2018, she met with Gerry Butts, the prime minister's then-principal secretary, to discuss issues including SNC-Lavalin and the ""barrage"" of people hounding her and her staff.

'We need a solution'

""Towards the end of the meeting I raised how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate. Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff — he said I needed to find a solution,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said the pressure escalated later that month with contacts from PMO officials. Butts and Trudeau's chief of staff Katie Telford ""summoned"" Prince to a Dec. 18 meeting, saying the situation was getting worse and that they felt she wasn't doing anything about it.

According to Wilson-Raybould's testimony, Telford suggested they could line up people to write op-eds to say what she was doing was ""proper.""

The next day, Wilson-Raybould met with Wernick. She said the clerk conveyed that the prime minister was ""quite determined, quite firm,"" and wanted to know why the DPA route wasn't being pursued.

""He said, 'I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that,'"" Wilson-Raybould testified.

Wernick testified last week that he warned Wilson-Raybould about the economic ""consequences"" of prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including heavy job losses, but insisted there was never any ""inappropriate pressure"" put on her to override the prosecution service's decision. The clerk also told her that the prime minister and others in the government were ""anxious"" about the impact of prosecution.

Confidence in PM?

Repeatedly asked by Liberal MPs why she would have remained in cabinet when she felt inappropriate pressure, Wilson-Raybould explained that she took the prime minister at his word, retained confidence in him, and decided to stay at the cabinet table as veterans affairs minister after the shuffle Jan. 14.

She said she had ""serious concerns"" that the government would enter into a DPA if she were no longer attorney general, and said she would have quit if that happened.

Wilson-Raybould offered few details on why she ultimately left.

""I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the cabinet table, that's why I resigned,"" she said.

She declined to explain why she quit cabinet or disclose details of her conversations with the prime minister prior to her resignation. But she described experiencing ""heightened anxiety"" as she waited for the ""other shoe to drop.""

A week before the cabinet shuffle, she said she received a call from Trudeau advising her she was being moved from the justice portfolio.

""I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case.""

Asked if she still has confidence in the prime minister, Wilson-Raybould said the question was not relevant to the hearings.

""Are you politically interfering with my role as the attorney general,"" Wilson-Raybould says she asked Trudeau. ""I would strongly advise against it."" 1:15

NDP MP Nathan Cullen asked if it is illegal to exert pressure on an attorney general to offer a ""special plea"" to a company for political reasons.

""In my opinion, it's not illegal. It is very inappropriate depending on the context of the comments made, the nature of the pressure, the specific issues that are raised,"" she said. ""It is incredibly inappropriate and is an attempt to compromise, or to impose upon an independent attorney general.""

“What is not appropriate is pressing the attorney general on matters that she or he cannot take into account such as partisan political considerations …” 1:10

Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted that Wilson-Raybould could ""speak fully"" about the SNC-Lavalin affair, contrary to the claim by Wilson-Raybould that she was constrained despite a confidentiality waiver from the Liberal government.

Wilson-Raybould wrote to the committee chair, Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, late Tuesday to say the parameters outlined in Monday's waiver would not allow her to speak freely on issues related to her resignation from cabinet or her time as veterans affairs minister.",Trudeau insists Wilson-Raybould can 'speak fully' on SNC-Lavalin affair,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-testifies-justice-committee-1.5035219

(File)

Canada's opposition leader formally asked federal police on Thursday to investigate a claim of political meddling by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The House of Commons scheduled an emergency debate Thursday on the deepening controversy, the most serious faced by Trudeau since assuming office in 2015.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer accused the Liberal prime minister's inner circle of possibly attempting to obstruct justice, in a letter to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Brenda Lucki -- which the RCMP confirmed to AFP it has received.

""The matter at hand appears, on its face, to be a gross violation of the law,"" Scheer wrote.

He pointed to ""explosive testimony"" by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who told the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday that Trudeau's staff and other senior officials applied undue pressure on her to settle a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Muammar Al Gaddafi's reign.

Wilson-Raybould, after resigning from cabinet, testified that she experienced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" to politically interfere in the prosecution of one of the world's top engineering firms.

She added that she faced ""veiled threats,"" and described the intense pressure on her to comply as ""inappropriate,"" but stopped short of suggesting it was illegal.

In the end, Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

Trudeau has rejected her characterizations of events, saying Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make.""

Thursday morning, dodging calls to resign, he said: ""My team and I have always acted in a professional manner.""

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that's exactly what we've done every step of the way ... in a way that has respected our laws and respects the independence of the judiciary,"" he added.

For weeks, Trudeau's Liberal government has been rocked by the allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper, only eight months before elections.

Canada's ethics commissioner has launched an investigation into the matter.

405,Empty,2019-02-25T17:25:42Z,Scheer says it is clear now that Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the criminal code to be changed to avoid a criminal prosecution.,"OTTAWA—Canadians should be outraged that Liberal politicians made any attempt to influence the outcome of a criminal case, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says. Scheer introduced a House of Commons motion Monday afternoon that would demand Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appear at the Commons justice committee to explain his role in allegations former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured not to proceed with a criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

“Quite simply what we’ve seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the Prime Minister’s Office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice,” Scheer said in a news conference before introducing the motion. Scheer said Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick’s testimony to the justice committee last week made it clear that SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the Criminal Code to be changed to allow for remediation agreements. Those allow companies to avoid a criminal prosecution in exchange for accepting responsibility for wrongdoing, paying fines and reparation to any victims, relinquishing any financial benefit from the actions and showing changes to prevent misdeeds from being repeated. Striking such an agreement would mean SNC-Lavalin could avoid a criminal prosecution in Canada for allegations it bribed officials in Libya to win contracts there.

Scheer said the Liberals launched “an unsolicited, co-ordinated and sustained effort by the PM himself to get the former attorney general to change her decision. “Canadians need to be outraged at the suggestion that politicians were putting pressure on independent agents of the Crown, independent legal officers, to try to get a better deal for well connected friends of the Liberal party,” Scheer said. “That is unacceptable and we need to be outraged about this because of the implications it has on the entire justice system across the country.”

The Liberals don’t appear ready to support the Conservative motion to call Trudeau to testify. The motion would not be binding in any event, and a Commons committee can’t summon a sitting MP to appear before it. Arif Virani, the Liberal parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, said in the House of Commons there isn’t a need for the Commons to inject itself into the proceedings of the justice committee. If the committee wants to call certain witnesses the committee members can decide who they want to hear from, he said. “Committees of this house do exemplary work,” said Virani. “We’re confident that the committee hearings will continue to be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the answers and information that they seek.” Thus far the committee has heard from Wernick, deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin and current Justice Minister David Lametti. Lametti replaced Wilson-Raybould in the job in January, when she was shuffled to veterans affairs. She resigned from cabinet altogether a few days after the allegations of improper pressure were first raised, but continues to sit as a Liberal MP. She is expected to testify at the committee this week but no date or time has been confirmed. Trudeau denies any improper conduct occurred and that any conversations on the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin were done with Wilson-Raybould knowing the final decision was hers alone.

Here in Canada the so-called “United We Roll” (UWR) movement, ostensibly a ragtag group of truckers emanating from western Canada and advocating for oil pipelines, rolled onto Parliament Hill last week. While undoubtedly many were focused on the pipeline issue, it’s hard to neglect the fact that the convoy was born out of the racist “Yellow Vest Canada” (YVC) movement.

Indeed, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network tried to ensure that media, government officials and others were aware of the unavoidable links between YVC and UWR. Before the convoy arrived on Feb. 19, we publicly explained that UWR was in fact originally to have been called the “Yellow Vest Convoy.” When it became clear that YWV embraced overt racism, had engaged in online death threats including calls for the arrest and death of the Prime Minister, supported anti-Muslim hate groups including Canadian Combat Coalition, Soldiers of Odin, and Worldwide Coalition Against Islam, it was clear that a name change was necessary. Thus the Yellow Vest Convoy became “United We Roll.” Sadly, however, too many were still associated with the racism emanating from YVC.

The hatred and images of violence from YVC were not hidden. Much of it was directed at Canadian Muslims. That included conspiracy theories blaming local Fort McMurray Muslims for starting the wildfire in order to build a super mosque. David Selvers, from Sault Ste. Marie, is but one example of bigots attracted to YVC/UWR. He is a Holocaust minimizer, anti-Semite and Islamophobe. So vile were his social media postings that the city of Sault Ste. Marie and others disassociated itself from Selvers Crane business. In fact, even UWR had to distance itself from Selvers given the ugly publicity he was generating. Sadly, the Yellow Vests movement has now been entirely co-opted by the far right. In Canada, neo-Nazis like Paul Fromm and Brian Ruhe attend their rallies. Faith Goldy, a self-proclaimed propagandist for the alt right movement, spoke at their first Toronto rally and was a featured speaker at the UWR rally last week on Parliament Hill. Lately in France the Yellow Vest movement has engaged in antisemitic and anti-immigration rallies. Yet, despite the rebrand, despite the close alliances with the racism violence and bigotry of YVC, convoy organizer Glen Carritt still claimed his group identified with the yellow vests and welcomed them to the convoy. Carritt was not the only one to welcome YVC and other convoy members to Parliament Hill. Andrew Scheer, federal leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, along with Maxime Bernier, leader of the new ultra-right “People’s Party,” hopped on the same bandwagon used by Faith Goldy to support and bring greetings to the small group of convoy protesters.

No question they had every right to do so. What is deeply troubling, however, was that neither Scheer nor Bernier uttered one word of concern about the racists now firmly associated with the convoy. Their silence was deafening. Even worse, given opportunities to correct the record, Scheer has remained tight-lipped. It’s this form of willful blindness that gives fresh air to the aspirations and hopes of neo-Nazis, antisemites, xenophobes and Islamophobes.

When political leaders choose expediency and vote counting over denouncing the evil in front of their eyes, the spiral towards hate and bigotry becomes ever larger. It was only two years ago that Alexandre Bissonnette, a young man inspired by the same hatred seen espoused by some members of the UWR convoy, walked into a Quebec City mosque and murdered six Canadian Muslims at prayer, wounding many others. It was only a few months ago that David Bowers, also motivated by anti-immigrant rhetoric and convinced that the Jews were to blame for the decline of America, murdered 11 innocent Jews at prayer in Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. Our nightmares have now turned to reality. Groups like YVC and their supporters within the UWR convoy only give strength to those like the Bissonnettes and Bowers of this world. Worse yet, political leaders who ignore such hatred are not just willfully ignorant but clearly stand with the victimizers against the victims. Bernie M.

407,Empty,2019-03-01T20:44:55Z,Let Me Illustrate: Gary Clement's take on the SNC-Lavalin scandal that's embroiled the Liberal Party,"Jody Wilson-Raybould spoke about the SNC-Lavalin controversy at a hearing of the House of Commons justice committee on Feb. 27.

In her first substantial public statement on the matter, the former justice minister and attorney general testified that she was inappropriately pressured to prevent the Montreal-based company from being prosecuted in a bribery case.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee’s MPs that over a four-month period in late 2018 she was pressured by finance minister Bill Morneau and his staff, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office including former principal secretary Gerald Butts and chief of staff Katie Telford, and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself.

She said partisan concerns were repeatedly raised in connection with the SNC-Lavalin case, including by Trudeau, who she claims pointed out to her in a September conversation that he was himself a Quebec MP and raised the political consequences of prosecuting a large Montreal-based company during the then-ongoing Quebec election.

Following her opening statement, Wilson-Raybould took six rounds of questions from Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs.

Asked whether Wilson-Raybould should remain in caucus, Trudeau said Wednesday he had not reviewed her testimony in full yet, and would make decisions on that once he had.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, meanwhile, said Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern and called on him to resign.

408,Empty,2019-03-01T09:47:47Z,It centres around claims that a former attorney general was inappropriately pressured to prevent a prosecution.,"CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER Justin Trudeau is facing the biggest political scandal of his administration.

The scandal centres around claims that Trudeau’s former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was inappropriately pressured by the Prime Minister to prevent the prosecution of a major Canadian engineering firm accused of fraud and bribery.

The affair has been politically costly to date. Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s closest adviser and a longtime friend, resigned two weeks ago, according to The Guardian. Wilson-Raybould has also resigned.

So, with that, here’s how we got to this point.

What are the accusations?

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin is accused of bribing Libyan officials to win construction contracts, according to The Global and Mail newspaper.

The company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi’s reign.

SNC-Lavalin has heavily lobbied the Canadian government, including senior officials in Trudeau’s office, for an out-of-court settlement that would include paying a fine and agreeing to put in place compliance measures.

Here’s where the scandal comes in.

Wilson-Raybould testified this week at the House of Commons Justice Committee that Trudeau, one of his ministers and close advisors applied “inappropriate” pressure on her, including “veiled threats” to intervene in a criminal prosecution.

She said that from September to December 2018 officials “hounded” her to ask prosecutors to settle the case out of court.

Wilson-Raybould has refused the requests, and the trial is set to proceed.

The allegations were first reported by The Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources, and were confirmed Wednesday by Wilson-Raybould herself while testifying at the justice committee.

Why help the company out?

The construction and engineering company is one of the world’s largest.

During its lobbying, the company has argued that those responsible for alleged wrongdoing left the company long ago, and that holding it accountable for their criminal actions would severely hurt its business.

A guilty verdict would notably result in a 10-year ban on bidding on Canadian government contracts.

There were suggestions in the press that it might also move its headquarters to London if that happened.

What is the government’s position?

Trudeau has said he “completely disagrees” with his former attorney general’s characterisation of events.

He has insisted he and his team were rightly looking to safeguard up to 9,000 Canadian jobs, including in his own Quebec electoral district. Wilson-Raybould has referred to this as improper “partisan political considerations”.

Trudeau has insisted that he made clear to his former attorney general that the “decision around SNC-Lavalin was Wilson-Raybould’s and hers alone to make”.

In Canada, the attorney general and justice minister are conjoined positions, something critics say blurs their separate responsibilities – the former is the country’s top prosecutor and independent from the political, partisan role of a cabinet minister.

Wilson-Raybould has suggested they should be split.

What are the political consequences for Trudeau?

The major political controversy unravelled when The Globe and Mail first reported on 7 February that Trudeau’s office attempted to pressure Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the case – months from the next election.

Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s first indigenous attorney general, was shuffled to veterans affairs in January, and, as noted above, a month later resigned from cabinet.

Days later, Gerry Butts, Trudeau’s closest adviser and a longtime friend, also quit.

“I think if the Liberals had not replaced Ms Wilson-Raybould in January as attorney general, we might never have heard about any of this,” said Daniel Beland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal.

The accusations weigh heavily on Trudeau because he has repeatedly affirmed the independence of Canada’s judiciary.

His stance was notable in the case of Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei who was arrested in Vancouver on a US warrant and faces possible extradition.

Opposition Conservatives have took opportunity of the controversy to call on Trudeau to resign and for a federal police investigation into the matter.

My statement: https://t.co/FkMT8l8ave pic.twitter.com/lqy6nq1TkU — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) February 28, 2019 Source: Andrew Scheer /Twitter

The leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer has said Trudeau “simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done”.

“This is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign.”

What happens now?

The Guardian has reported that a number of politicians have requested to testify before the justice committee. These include Butts and Michael Wernick, the country’s top public servant.

It also reported that Trudeau said he would consider the future of Wilson-Raybould in the Liberal Party.

A poll taken since the scandal erupted put the opposition Conservatives in the lead ahead of the ruling Liberals, for the first time since Trudeau came to power in 2015.

So, while the final outcome of the scandal remains unclear, it’s apparent that it’s having serious political consequences.

It’s clear Wilson-Raybould was removed from her position as justice minister for “doing her job,” said Mary-Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former Saskatchewan provincial court judge who currently teaches and practises law.

“It’s fair to say it’s a constitutional crisis,” Turpel-Lafond said Wednesday night, invoking a term often used to describe the breakdown of the rules underpinning a system of government. The events, as outlined by Wilson-Raybould in marathon testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, “shake the foundations of our very system,” Turpel-Lafond said. Wilson-Raybould told MPs she was repeatedly and inappropriately pressured by senior members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s staff, as well as the country’s top bureaucrat, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal trial on charges of fraud and corruption.

Wilson-Raybould refused, and found herself shuffled to a different cabinet portfolio in January. Former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant agreed the scandal amounts to a constitutional crisis, saying Trudeau seems insistent on “interfering with the prosecution.”

“That conflicts with a system that requires independence from political influence. It opens the door to prosecuting enemies of the government and giving immunity to its friends which is despotic,” Bryant, who is now the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told the Star. He said the actions of the PMO, as laid out by Wilson-Raybould, undermine public faith in the independence of the judicial process. In the fallout from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau and Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, to resign. Irwin Cotler, a former Liberal attorney general of Canada, said he doesn’t believe Trudeau should step down or that “there was an intent on the part of the government to cross the line.” “I believe that they felt they were asking her to engage in what they believed was a matter of public policy for the importance of Canada and the importance of Quebec, jobs and the like, which she acknowledged was OK,” Cotler said. But at a minimum, Turpel-Lafond said the RCMP’s integrity section must investigate, noting that 11 highly placed people in the PMO, the public service and cabinet were named by Wilson-Raybould as lobbying her or her staff on the issue. “The consequences for that is that our reputation as a nation of the rule of law will be in tatters if we do not take steps,” Turpel-Lafond said. “And the steps need to be significant, decisive.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

411,Empty,2019-02-28T21:17:35Z,"Trudeau’s Liberals confuse not being Conservatives, not being led by Stephen Harper, with virtue. It's a massive, lethal blind spot","The choice for Canadians now seems as stark as the first question put to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at his Wednesday night press conference in Montreal: Should Canadians believe Jody Wilson-Raybould’s account of “a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin,” or should they believe Trudeau’s insistence that he and his staff “always acted appropriately and professionally”?

If only because we have a hugely detailed account from Wilson-Raybould, and a perfunctory denial from Trudeau, not to mention the sudden resignation of his principal secretary Gerald Butts, it seems likely the former justice minister and attorney general — the first Indigenous woman to hold the positions, as we were so often told — will win that showdown. The question then becomes: Does it matter?

Many partisan Liberals publicly took note of Wilson-Raybould’s opinion that the pressure exerted upon her had not been illegal — just inappropriate. That’s nothing for Trudeau to hang his hat on. But if “appropriate and professional” was ever the minimum threshold for reelection in this country, “not guilty” long ago replaced it. Clearly there is some despair among partisan Liberals who actually bought Trudeau’s doing-politics-differently schtick. But veteran partisans had already downshifted their re-election pitch from “utopia awaits” to “it’s him or Andrew Scheer, who’s just Stephen Harper in disguise.”

Many partisan Liberals publicly took note of Wilson-Raybould’s opinion that the pressure exerted upon her had not been illegal — just inappropriate

One of Wilson-Raybould’s most telling recollections concerned Butts’ alleged efforts to get her on board with the DPA, in a meeting at the Château Laurier. She said she refused. It would be especially inappropriate, she said she argued, considering Lavalin had already applied for a judicial review of the independent Director of Public Prosecution’s (DPP) decision not to offer such an agreement.

At this point, she said, Butts changed course. “Gerry talked to me about how the statute was … passed by Harper and that he does not like the law,” said Wilson-Raybould, referring to the 2006 Director of Public Prosecutions Act. “I said something like ‘that is the law that we have.’”

It’s quite a picture: The PM’s principal secretary, increasingly exasperated by the attorney general’s quaint insistence upon prosecutorial independence, reminds her that the rules they’re playing under were designed by the dark lord himself — as if the mere invocation of Harper’s accursed name might change her mind.

Wilson-Raybould’s answer — the law is the law — was a pretty good one. She’s a lawyer, after all. Had she been inclined toward a more thorough analysis, she might have reminded Butts of how the DPP came into being. Harper first seems to have mooted the idea on the campaign trail in 2005, amidst the Liberals’ final meltdown. Jean Chrétien had asked the Federal Court to quash the Gomery Inquiry’s findings with respect to his role in the sponsorship scandal; Paul Martin was left gibbering, supporting Chrétien’s right to appeal while standing foursquare and contritely behind Gomery’s findings.

Famously, the Liberals did not win that election. “The days of kickback schemes and envelopes stuffed with cash are over,” Treasury Board president John Baird crowed the next year as he introduced the Federal Accountability Act, which created the DPP.

Thirteen years later, Trudeau’s right-hand man allegedly thought it was a good idea to go a-meddling in the DPP’s business to protect a company accused of cartoonish corruption in Libya, and that admitted to over $100,000 in illegal donations to the Liberal party, riding associations and leadership candidates between 2004 and 2011. Why? By Wilson-Raybould’s account: because there was an election coming up in Quebec, because Lavalin might decamp from Montreal to London, because the PM’s seat is in Quebec, and because “we can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected,” as Wilson-Raybould said the PMO told her chief of staff.

Oh yes and jobs. Mostly jobs!

It speaks of a massive, lethal blind spot that never seems to go away: So often, Trudeau’s Liberals confuse not being Conservatives, not being led by Stephen Harper, with virtue. At his Wednesday press conference, Trudeau set out to enumerate some of the “great things that we’ve accomplished together as a team on the justice file.” He pointed first to medical assistance in dying — fair dues, though as with so many advances the Liberals claim as their own, it came at the Supreme Court’s behest. He pointed second to legalizing marijuana — a surprising and positive development, certainly, though it came with outrageously intrusive impaired driving legislation that is sure to be abused by police until the courts find it unconstitutional. And finally pointed to “progressive reforms around criminal justice and sentencing.”

Oof. Ask any justice reform advocate if he thinks the Liberals have lived up to their promises. You’ll get an earful.

Self-congratulation out of the way, Trudeau reminded Canadians twice that the choice they face next year is between him and his Liberals and what is “still very much the party of Stephen Harper.” You would think they had won by 20 points, that Harper was in miserable exile. They won by seven-and-a-half points. The spectre of Harper does not terrify most normal Canadians; nor that of Prime Minister Andrew Scheer. In the long term, it’s likely good news for Trudeau that at least some of his MPs still seem intent on aiming higher than the inherent righteousness of being Liberals in government. In the short term, however, one of them is being a total pain in the neck.

On Wednesday, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, an MP who was once the country's top prosecutor before resigning from Trudeau's cabinet, testified to a Parliamentary committee about the ""political pressure"" and ""veiled threats"" she endured as Trudeau and members of his office pushed her to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Her testimony directly implicated Trudeau, who, according to Wilson-Raybould, insinuated during a meeting last year that he needed her to go easy on SNC-Lavalin to improve his prospects for reelection (he reminded her that he's an MP representing an area of Quebec that could be hurt by job losses if SNC-Lavalin decided to move).

Justin Trudeau

And although Trudeau's support within the Liberal Party remains relatively steady - he told reporters on Wednesday that he has no plans to resign - opposition figures are doing their best to stoke public anger with Trudeau. Late Wednesday, after Wilson-Raybould had finished her testimony, Canada's Conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer demanded Trudeau resign, saying the prime minister had ""lost his moral authority"" to govern.

Here's more from Al Jazeera:

Andrew Scheer said late on Wednesday that Trudeau ""has lost moral authority to govern"" and ""must resign"" at once. ""Mr Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,"" he added.

Trudeau has steadfastly disputed Wilson-Raybould's characterization of what happened, and insisted that he didn't do anything improper.

Wilson-Raybould left his government earlier this month after being abruptly transferred to lead the country's Veterans Affairs ministry, which was widely seen as a demotion. In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould implicated at least 11 employees in Trudeau's office and members of the privy council for participating in the pressure campaign.

Opposition leader Scheer issued a statement calling for Trudeau’s resignation shortly after Wilson-Raybould delivered her testimony to the House of Commons.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done,” Scheer wrote.

“That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign,” he continued. “Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation – if it has not already done so – into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former Attorney General detailed in her testimony.”

The Toronto Sun agreed on Wednesday that the SNC-Lavalin case is now a matter for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

“After the first minute of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, it was already clear that this was a colossal bombshell,” the Sun editorialized, presenting the former justice minister’s opening statement as a concise summary of the case:

She began her opening remarks: “For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. “These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of.” That in itself was damning enough. Then Wilson-Raybould went on in detail to explain how she had repeatedly told these senior figures to not pressure her, that she had made up her mind, and that she thought the pressure was inappropriate. But they kept on doing it.

Wilson-Raybould testified that there was a “barrage of people hounding me and my staff” to avoid a criminal trial for SNC-Lavalin, including Prime Minister Trudeau and his senior aides. She said these people not only warned her about the dire consequences of a prosecution, including jobs lost for SNC-Lavalin employees and political fallout for the Liberal Party, but issued “veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC.”

Wilson-Raybould said she was ultimately pushed out of her position to make room for a more pliable justice minister. She said SNC-Lavalin was made the first order of business for her successor, David Lametti, in one of his first meetings with Trudeau.

SNC-Lavalin, one of the largest engineering firms in the world, was investigated for fraud and corruption due to its business practices in Libya, which was one of the company’s largest clients under dictator Muammar Qaddafi. The company was accused of paying millions of dollars in bribes to secure business deals during the ten years before Qaddafi was overthrown in 2011. The company argues the wrongdoing was entirely the work of a single rogue executive named Riadh Ben Aissa.

If SNC-Lavalin as a whole is convicted on corruption charges, the company would be banned from bidding on Canadian federal contracts for ten years. Trudeau has publicly worried such a penalty could severely damage the company and eliminate a large number of jobs. He denies improperly pressuring Wilson-Raybould to avoid prosecution.

Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, resigned over the scandal two weeks ago, claiming he was innocent of wrongdoing but did not wish to bring further negative attention to the prime minister’s office.

Former Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant, director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told the Globe and Mail on Thursday the testimony from Wilson-Raybould “disclosed a constitutional crisis far worse than what I envisioned.”

“She says it was a bald attempt by the Prime Minister to exercise his cabinet-making power over her quasi-judicial authority. I am personally very familiar with the tactic, but have never seen evidence of it used on an attorney-general in this brazen, reckless fashion,” he said.

Another former attorney general, Geoff Plant, found it deeply “problematic” that pressure against Wilson-Raybould continued after she clearly stated she did not support a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.

“This observation crosses the line between inquiries that relate to the public interest, which are legitimate, and partisan political considerations, which are not. She was right to say that this was inappropriate. The fact that this consideration was raised again and again is very disturbing,” he said, citing the importance of maintaining political independence for prosecutors.

Trudeau’s defenders essentially argue his concerns about crippling the huge engineering company with a corruption prosecution were valid, and while he and his aides may have vigorously communicated that argument to the justice minister, their actions came up short of improper political interference.

Scheer completely rejected that reasoning in his statement on Wednesday, saying Trudeau has “lost the moral authority to govern.”

Regarding Trudeau, he said:

A Prime Minister who allows his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A Prime Minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the Government of Canada begins. And a Prime Minister who has allowed a systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office and those of his most senior cabinet and public service colleagues.

“As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends. Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,” he contended.

Writing at Maclean’s on Wednesday, Paul Wells called Trudeau a “moral catastrophe” and said he was running a “sickeningly smug protection racket” for the Liberal Party’s allies.

“If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification?” he asked, referring to the elections looming when the SNC-Lavalin scandal began.

Trudeau said on Wednesday that he has no intention of resigning and suggested voters should have the final judgment on his actions in the October election.

“There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that … has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,” he said, as quoted by the Calgary Herald. He continued, “And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper, that continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.”

“Before Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Canadians knew Justin Trudeau had engineered an unwanted, sustained, and co-ordinated attempt to get Ms. Wilson-Raybould to change her mind and stop the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin. Today, thanks to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, we now know just how intense those efforts were: ten meetings and ten phone calls involving eleven senior government officials relentlessly targeting Ms. Wilson-Raybould over a four month period – with the sole objective of bullying her into bending the law to benefit a well-connected corporation.

“The details are as shocking as they are corrupt: multiple veiled threats to her job if she didn’t bow to their demands. Urgings to consider the consequences on election results and shareholder value above judicial due process. And reminders from Justin Trudeau to his Attorney General about his own electoral prospects should she allow SNC-Lavalin’s trial to proceed.

“As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends.

“Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.

“Canada should be a country where we are all equal under the law. Where nobody – regardless of wealth, status, or political connections – is above the law. I believe we can be that country again.”",Andrew Scheer’s full statement calling for Justin Trudeau’s resignation over SNC-Lavalin scandal,Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/andrew-scheers-full-statement-calling-for-justin-trudeaus-resignation-over-snc-lavalin-scandal
415,Empty,2019-02-27T20:10:01Z,Tom Parkin: Andrew Scheer is pinned down with a Max Bernier problem. And Jagmeet Singh is finally freed to take on the struggling Liberals. The post The election battle lines being drawn appeared first on Macleans.ca.,"Two new confrontations were laid bare by Monday’s byelections. And how, in the months upcoming, political parties play out these pre-election challenges will frame the final showdown, which ends when Canadians head to the polls in October.

In Burnaby South, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh improved the NDP vote considerably and won his seat comfortably—revealing that the endless winability doubts were more partisan concern trolling than political science. In York-Simcoe, his NDP result was status quo. In Outremount, his NDP exceeded expectations scoring 26 per cent support, but lost the seat. Quebec challenges lie ahead.

Trudeau’s Liberals should certainly take comfort in re-taking Outremont—but dropping eight points in Burnaby South and nine points in York-Simcoe should concern them. The average result across the three byelections would yield a minority—Liberals 32 per cent, Conservatives 29 per cent, NDP 27 per cent. And those results echo the Liberals’ poll support, which droops as Canadians muddle through the detail and arrive at the central fact that Trudeau and his staff repeatedly intervened with the attorney general in an effort to stop the corruption prosecution of a major Liberal donor.

READ MORE: The real bad news in Burnaby South might be for Andrew Scheer

The real loser on Monday night was Andrew Scheer. He has Bernier problems. Conservative support in Burnaby South dropped deeper into third place, bleeding to Bernier’s hard-right People’s Party. In Outremont, the Conservatives ran fifth. While they held York-Simcoe, a four-point boost is not the tide required to sweep Scheer to government. And unlike in Burnaby South, in York-Simcoe the Conservatives faced no threat from the People’s Party candidate, who simply failed to launch, earning just two per cent support.

Laid bare by the Burnaby South results, Scheer’s strategic problem is that the People’s Party has him pinned. He needs to fight the far-right People’s Party by appealing to its far-right supporters. That’s tough to do without alienating mainstream conservatives.

Scheer’s role at the recent “convoy” rally in Ottawa is a snap-shot of the problem. Though watching Scheer compete with Maxime Bernier and Faith Goldy—a politician on the white nationalist fringe—for the support of a rally infiltrated with yellow-vests must be stomach-turning for mainstream conservatives, there he was. And Scheer couldn’t not be there, fearing Bernier would claim unrivaled leadership of the rally.

Thanks to Bernier, Scheer is unable to turn against the far-right, unable to turn to them, with no clear way forward. This is one of the two critical pre-election fights.

The stage for the other key fight was set on Monday as Singh’s win finally unpinned the NDP from its Burnaby South focus. Trudeau’s months of byelection delay kept Singh on the west coast, unable to continue his introduction in Quebec, a crucial battleground where he is not well known. But with his byelection test now won, Singh can make his critical pivot to Quebec to confront the Liberals.

Singh walks into the Quebec confrontation armed with a 15-member Quebec caucus and a durable, if eroded, political base—certainly he leads a Quebec political force many-fold better than what former NDP Leader Jack Layton had in the 2011 election run-up.

And the terrain of this coming confrontation has many features—most obviously, the Prime Minister’s repeated, lobbyist-fueled interventions with the attorney general in an apparent attempt to stop the corruption prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The Trudeau Liberals are betting on the position that Quebecers, and Montrealers in particular, will excuse the PM’s effort to block a criminal prosecution because Trudeau says he was doing it to benefit Quebec. Singh and the NDP will try to pierce Trudeau’s veil of Quebec identity politics. Certainly, Liberals doing political favours for political friends remains an open sore in Montreal. So this skirmish will be fascinating to watch.

Another legal action, the trial of former vice-admiral Mark Norman, could add insight into the Liberal friends and favours political approach. Norman is charged with breach of trust by leaking confidential information while the Trudeau cabinet was considering switching a $670 million ship-building contract from Quebec City’s Davie Shipyard to the Halifax shipyard of the billionaire Irving family. Norman’s defense team will explore the relationship between former minister Scott Brison and the Irving family. Brison quit cabinet shortly after court documents listed him as a trial witness.

And in Quebec there are hilltops to be gained by attacking Trudeau’s failure to meet carbon targets and buying a bitumen pipeline. There is concern about failing to protect culture from massive corporations like Netflix. There is anger at tax haven inaction. Trudeau may be the government, he may be ahead – it doesn’t mean Quebecers wouldn’t choose a better option, if it came along.

A critical strategic objective of the NDP has always been to create a bond between progressive voters in Quebec and across Canada. Antipathy to Liberals whose idea of federalism is doing favours for insider friends in both official languages—at the expense of the people of Canada, including Quebecers—may be just the bond the NDP needs. With Singh now unpinned, and Scheer trapped in a side-battle with Bernier, the NDP has a few pre-election months to strengthen that bond.

416,Empty,2019-02-28T23:51:04Z,"There is a genuine belief in Liberal ranks that Wilson-Raybould told the truth, but not the whole truth. They are going to have a tough time convincing Canadians","Contrary to what you might have read in all newspapers, the country is not going to the dogs — it’s going to the moon.

We are assured that Justin Trudeau did not arrange for Canada to join the U.S.-led lunar mission just to deflect attention from Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony at the justice committee. But the prime minister must have been mightily relieved to look at his itinerary for Thursday and see that it included the announcement at the Canada Space Agency headquarters in Saint-Hubert, Que., rather than answering questions about prosecutorial interference in the House of Commons.

In Saint-Hubert, he was asked about the SNC-Lavalin scandal and reiterated that his team acted professionally and appropriately. He said he disagreed with the former attorney general’s “characterization” of events.

Among Liberals Thursday there was a palpable sense of relief, such as might be felt by someone who’s just had hip replacement surgery — it’s still painful but there is a feeling the worst is over.

They’re probably right. Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, has over-reached by calling for Trudeau’s resignation — that’s not going to happen, as long as he maintains he and his staff acted appropriately, and Liberal polling numbers remain in the 30-40 per cent support range.

The only way he is forced out is if there is a split in Liberal ranks and that is not happening.

On the contrary, most Liberal MPs sound angry at Wilson-Raybould for putting their jobs at risk. Politics is a team sport, they argue, and she should have done what she was told by the leader at whose pleasure she served, or she should have resigned.

That will not be a popular view in the country, or one that MPs will express publicly, but it is held widely.

There is a sense in caucus that the prime minister is reaping the whirlwind after appointing as justice minister someone who was not a partisan Liberal.

But far from sending out her colleagues to besmirch Wilson-Raybould’s reputation, the Prime Minister’s Office is trying to rein in caucus anger and stop a repeat of the public haranguing directed at the former attorney general by B.C. Liberal MP Jati Sidhu. He told the Abbotsford News that Wilson-Raybould is not a team player and suggested her father may be “pulling the strings.” He later apologized for his comments but he is far from alone in thinking them.

In the absence of a caucus revolt, Trudeau should be able to ride out the storm. There is even anticipation in Liberal ranks at the prospect of being able to comment freely, now that Wilson-Raybould’s allegations are out in the open.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who is alleged by Wilson-Raybould to have told her former chief of staff that any solution “involves some interference,” wrote to the justice committee chair, Anthony Housefather, requesting an opportunity to give his side of the story.

The committee will also hear again from Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, and Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of Justice.

There is a genuine belief in Liberal ranks that, while Wilson-Raybould has told the truth, it is not the whole truth, and does not reflect the intent of the range of actors who were motivated by a desire to protect jobs at SNC.

They are going to have their work cut out for them convincing Canadians who appear to sympathize with the former attorney general’s viewpoint that the persistent and relentless nature of the attempts to make her change her mind over whether to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement was inappropriate.

They are going to have to be persuasive if they are planning to argue that the attorney general was not removed from her cabinet post because of a position she took and refused to change.

And they are going to have to make a compelling case if they are going to refute Wilson-Raybould’s allegation that, after she was shuffled, her former deputy minister at Justice was told by the clerk of the Privy Council that her replacement could expect to have an early conversation with the prime minister about SNC.

Yet, if they can place doubt in the minds of the jury, the Liberals will probably have done enough.

The SNC-Lavalin affair reduces the chances of the Liberals repeating their majority government feat of 2015. But are we going to see voters entering the polling booth in October vowing to defeat Trudeau because he may have applied undue pressure on one of his own ministers and breached the Shawcross doctrine? Unfortunately for the voters who would like to give Trudeau a one-way ticket to the moon, those people probably don’t exist in sufficient numbers to bring down a government.

417,Empty,2019-02-26T00:49:07Z,Why did Trudeau apply ‘relentless pressure’ to get Wilson-Raybould to change her mind? The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could,"There is no calm for the Liberals as the storm of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s upcoming appearance at the justice committee rumbles towards them.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday he has waived solicitor-client privilege, freeing the former justice minister to talk about “relevant matters” as long as she does not touch on two court cases involving SNC-Lavalin.

Meanwhile, Wilson-Raybould said in a letter to the committee chair that she is willing to testify at the “first opportunity,” but wants to make sure there is clarity on possible constraints on what she can say — which suggests it may not be in the next couple of days.

While we don’t know when Wilson-Raybould will appear at committee, we do know she wants 30 minutes for an opening statement. You don’t need half an hour to say that the whole SNC-Lavalin saga, and recent allegations of political interference in the justice system, are just a big misunderstanding.

On Monday afternoon the committee heard from a former Saskatchewan judge who has gone on record as saying the affair should be investigated by the RCMP if there is evidence Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to another portfolio over her refusal to reconsider her position on asking the director of public prosecutions to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond has said a police investigation would be necessary to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, calling the prospect of the attempted influence over a prosecution “not only immoral, (but) illegal.”

Last week I suggested that Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at cabinet and Liberal caucus might auger a closing of ranks and an attempt by all sides to tamp down more controversy. After the clerk of the Privy Council’s unconventional committee appearance last week and Wilson-Raybould’s letter of intent, I’m less sure.

The appearance at committee of Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, suggested he thinks there is nothing to see here — that Canadians should have faith in the system because laws are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held,” he said last Thursday.

As to his own conversation with Wilson-Raybould on December 19th last year, he made clear he believes it was neither immoral nor illegal. He said he told the then-attorney general her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of SNC and discussed whether a deferred prosecution agreement for the company was still an option. “I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate,” he said. “I was informing the minister of context.”

The adjudicator of whether Wernick, and perhaps even the prime minister himself, crossed any lines will be the ethics commissioner. If prosecutors agree with Turpel-Lafond, the affair may even end up before the courts and be settled by a judge.

But what perplexes me is why Wernick, the prime minister, and senior advisers Gerald Butts and Katie Telford even discussed a remediation agreement for SNC after Wilson-Raybould made clear she was not disposed to negotiate one, when a perfectly sound plan B was already being worked on.

As my colleague Gabriel Friedman revealed in the Post on Saturday, the department of Public Services and Procurement is finalizing changes to the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy under the Integrity regime. This word salad governs whether corporations convicted of crimes can bid on federal projects.

SNC’s fear is that a conviction on corruption charges for bribing Libyan officials could lead to a 10-year ban on access to government infrastructure projects — the source of around 15 per cent of its $9 billion in revenue in 2017.

But the changes being contemplated by the government could reduce the ineligibility period from the automatically mandated 10 years to a debarment at the government’s discretion.

This policy change has been in the works for years — the public was invited to comment back in fall 2017 and the government says the update is being “studied and finalized.” A statement in the revised policy consultation said it is expected to take effect in “early 2019.”

One lawyer Friedman quoted said the debarment could conceivably be reduced to six months, a year or even no ineligibility at all. The proposed changes would widen the scope of offences that could lead to debarment, including human trafficking and environmental violations. The idea is that a one-size-fits-all punishment must be made more flexible if the range of offences is broadened.

SNC chief executive Neil Bruce has said the failure to secure a DPA would likely lead to three to four more years of court battles because the company considers itself not guilty.

But unless I’m missing something, a DPA would require an admission of culpability.

Under the new integrity regime, the company would also have to admit to wrongdoing before throwing itself on the mercy of the Registrar of Ineligibility and Suspension at Public Services. But, in that event, the company could claim mitigating circumstances, because the executives who perpetrated the alleged corruption have left and steps have been taken to ensure there is no repeat of the errant conduct.

So if the government already had an alternative to a deferred prosecution agreement that is expected to become policy in the next month or so, why did the prime minister and his most senior advisors risk flirting with immorality, if not illegality?

As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked Monday, if the decision to grant or refuse a deferred prosecution agreement was Wilson-Raybould’s alone — as the prime minister maintains — why did he apply “relentless pressure” to get her to change her mind?

The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could.

The scandal has suddenly made Trudeau vulnerable, consuming his Liberals in the run-up to an election in which he’d have otherwise have been the frontrunner. He’s lost his polling lead for the first time since June, and the controversy has undermined his personal brand as a progressive leader who singlehandedly returned his moribund party to power in 2015 on a pledge of change. “It’s very damaging and it’s very serious,” said Penny Collenette, a University of Ottawa professor who served as director of appointments under a former Liberal prime minister. Every politician wants to protect jobs, she said. “But I think the question that needs to be asked here is: at what cost?” Trudeau’s fate depends on several factors — including whether cabinet stands by him and the Liberals stay united. Only a handful of lawmakers have voiced any measure of support for Jody Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet last month but remains a Liberal member of parliament. The prime minister hasn’t decided yet whether to force her out of the party’s caucus.

Divided They Fall Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the centre of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis.

For Justin Trudeau, the days of ‘sunny ways’ are over “If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,” Nanos said in a telephone interview. “I can’t remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can’t even agree, how is it that they can govern?”

The latest polls already show the Liberals have lost their lead in voting intentions. An aggregate of public opinion surveys maintained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. shows Trudeau’s team with 33.9 per cent of the vote, below the Conservatives with 35.8 per cent. What’s hurting the prime minister is the extraordinary spectacle of a former high-ranking member of his government now emerging as its most powerful critic — and his rivals smell blood. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation and wrote the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking an investigation. The police force hasn’t said whether or not it will look into the matter. New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh is demanding a public inquiry. Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company. “My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,” Morneau told reporters in Toronto. “I will continue do that. I think that’s critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government.” Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events. The former attorney general — whose absence from cabinet was filled Friday by shuffling portfolios among existing ministers — may also end up testifying again. United So Far But no current minister has broken ranks. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn’t imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signalled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. “At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,” Freeland said. Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the “box of what’s legal” with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions. “We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses.” Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff. “I remain very confident in the work of this government,” Blair said. Parliament adjourns on Friday for a two-week break, due to return in time for Morneau’s March 19 budget. The path of the scandal could also depend on what Liberal lawmakers hear while away from Ottawa, in their home districts scattered across Canada. “They’re going to get earfuls,” Collenette said. “If the truth is really two perceptions, then voters will make up their minds. But they need facts.”

DRIVING THE DAY

NEW: BOB BARNETT, the Williams and Connolly attorney, is shopping around a book by Gary Cohn to publishers in New York. Cohn was a central character in “Fear,” the Bob Woodward book.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT … THIS WEEK, with the president in Hanoi, it looks like he is going to have a pretty horrible week in Washington. First, as our colleagues report below, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP will likely be handed a defeat when Congress rejects his emergency declaration. The House is going to vote it down, and it increasingly looks like the Senate will too.

-- AND SECOND, Michael Cohen, the president’s former attorney, will be on the Hill testifying for the next three days. Just one session is open: tomorrow’s House Oversight Committee hearing, chaired by MARYLAND REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS. Cummings gaggled Monday night in the Capitol for a bit with reporters, and said a moment like this is “very significant."" Cummings added that he thinks people will be talking about Trump and the investigations 200 years from now.

-- NYT’S MAGGIE HABERMAN: “Cohen ... is planning on portraying his onetime client in starkly negative terms when he testifies Wednesday before a House committee, and on describing what he says was Mr. Trump’s use of racist language, lies about his wealth and possible criminal conduct.” NYT

BURGESS EVERETT and MARIANNE LEVINE: “Trump on brink of defeat on border emergency”: “President Donald Trump is on the verge of a bipartisan rejection of his emergency declaration at the border, in what would be an embarrassing rebuke by a Congress opposed to his immigration agenda.

“Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) on Monday night said he would join Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) along with 47 Senate Democrats to block Trump’s attempts to secure billions for his border wall after lawmakers effectively stiffed him. Now just one more GOP senator’s support for a resolution to block Trump's bid would send the measure to Trump’s desk and force a veto. …

“Interviews on Monday with more than a dozen GOP senators who have been publicly critical of Trump’s unilateral maneuver or warned him not to deploy it were cagey about their intentions for what would be a crucial vote on the Senate floor in coming weeks. Many said they were undecided and still studying Trump’s move to circumvent Congress and score billions more for the border barrier.” POLITICO … Tillis’ WaPo op-ed

-- SENATE REPUBLICANS have held back on publicly rebuking the president on a number of issues, but the emergency declaration appears to be a step too far for many who have long privately criticized Trump and his policies.

-- THE PRESIDENT is en route to Hanoi from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, per pooler Eli Stokols of the L.A. Times. Trump also stopped at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom.

-- THE SCHEDULE, per Stokols: Wednesday: TRUMP will meet with the Vietnamese president and prime minister, and will have dinner with Kim Jong Un, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Kim Yong Chol and another North Korean associate.

-- ELIANA JOHNSON in Hanoi and RUAIRÍ ARRIETA-KENNA: “Trump’s blind spot on North Korea could sink a deal: The president has sold Kim Jong Un on peace and prosperity. But North Korea’s record on human rights stands in the way.”

-- DRAMA WITH AMERICAN MEDIA ALREADY … WAPO’S DAVID NAKAMURA and JOHN HUDSON in Hanoi: “Kim was staying at the Melia hotel tower in the heart of the city, but the hotel also happened to have been booked by the White House as the filing center for the traveling press corps to cover the summit.

“Not long before Kim arrived, a notice was distributed to the press corps that the filing center would be moved to a separate filing center for the international press corps at the Cultural Friendship Palace. …

“Television network producers had spent weeks setting up cameras, lights, monitors and other equipment shipped halfway across the world.

FOR YOUR RADAR -- “Iran’s Foreign Minister, Architect of Nuclear Deal, Says He Is Resigning,” by NYT’s Ben Hubbard in Istanbul and David Sanger: “Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran announced Monday that he was resigning, in what seemed a sudden end to the tenure of one of the Islamic Republic’s best-known figures abroad. Mr. Zarif, an American-educated diplomat who was an architect of the Iranian nuclear deal, announced that he was stepping down in a post on his Instagram account. It was not immediately clear why he was quitting or whether his resignation would be accepted.

“In the post, Mr. Zarif said he apologized ‘for my inability to continue serving and for all the shortcomings during my service.’ His resignation announcement also was reported by Iran’s Fars News Agency. Mr. Zarif’s public resignation in a country where governance is usually conducted behind closed doors seemed to indicate escalating tensions between the country’s hard-liners and President Hassan Rouhani.” NYT

[Caroline Fish is an attorney admitted to practice in New York State and Licensed Master of Social Work, who has worked on issues of gender-based violence since 2009 and written on legal issues related to human trafficking.]

The story of Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she was groomed and recruited by ISIS fighters, captures popular attention today, but States have been struggling to develop a strategy for handling the return of ISIS-affiliated women and children for several years. A year ago, these cases were first highlighted in the United Kingdom (“UK”) when authorities arrested a young mother with her small son for attempting to return from living in ISIS-controlled territory in Syria.

Before that, in 2017, German authorities fought to stop Iraqi authorities from executing a 16-year-old ISIS recruit who was “groomed online,” joined the terrorist organization, and then imprisoned in Iraq (the effort to prevent the death penalty worked, and in February 2019, she was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment in Iraq). In December 2017, the United Nations Security Council (“UNSC”) adopted Security Resolution 2396 on national security concerns and appropriate responses to ISIS returnees, including the need for a “special focus” on procedures for returning women and children and “assisting women and children associated with foreign terrorist fighters who may be victims of terrorism.” Today, many ISIS-affiliated women and children are still being held in refugee camps, army camps, and prisons.

Yet, the State policies and practices that predominate in response to ISIS returnees have failed to appropriately screen for human trafficking and, without such screening, may be excessively punitive. Without recognition of the link between human trafficking and terrorism and appropriate assessment of returnees, States’ risk being in violation of their obligations under international law. Thus, an imminent question is how States should assess whether an ISIS returnee is a victim of human trafficking in compliance with their international legal obligations.

State Responses to ISIS Returnees

When it comes to Muslim women and girls recruited by ISIS, national responses are predominantly punitive, and there is little official discussion of how to appropriately screen and assess returnees for human trafficking. Indeed, policies dealing with women and children returning from ISIS-controlled territory are generally, and notoriously, irregular (one report called them “incoherent”). Responsive measures include security restrictions (i.e., tags, curfews), surveillance, passport revocations, limitations of social benefits, citizenship revocation, and criminal prosecution. Arrest is fairly routine. Rehabilitative solutions can be contentious.

Naturally, and as might be expected in the face of a dangerous group like ISIS, State officials are worried about those returnees who “remain committed” to ISIS and its goals. While sympathetic, grief and regret can be manipulative tactics to gain entrance to a State where the former ISIS member can then continue to sow the violent ideology or even launch attacks. Yet, in prioritizing only that fear, the predominant discourse entirely avoids screening for trafficking victimization and identifying rehabilitation needs.

The Soufan Center, a non-profit that examines global security issues, advocated for blanket, punitive policies in a 2017 report, stating, “[W]omen who have joined IS must be assumed to have known what they were doing, and be treated accordingly . . . Though some women may have been tricked or coerced . . . into traveling to Syria, most will have gone there willingly.” Similarly, a report for the European Commission, which made a number of recommendations for European member states, suggested that any characterization of female ISIS returnees as “victims” should be proactively avoided, as it “deprives women of their agency.” The United States (U.S.) Institute for Peace also spoke out against recognition of the victimization of women at the hands of ISIS by stating, “International efforts to counter violent extremism will miss the mark if the work is based on assumptions that women are . . . duped or victimized.”

Even where States do seek to assess and reintegrate returnees, such proposals face backlash. For example, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first proposed a plan to assess and reintegrate ISIS returnees, his Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale voiced his doubts that any ISIS returnees should be directed toward services, advising governments instead to focus on “‘prosecuting wherever and whenever you can.’” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer condemned Trudeau for his unwarranted focus “on the rights of ISIS terrorists” and demanded that he take the “security of Canadians seriously.” A conservative parliamentarian, Blake Richards, wrote an opinion piece, in which he argued that the government’s proposal to reintegrate ISIS returnees was abhorrent, and the government should focus, instead, on helping “victims of ISIS.” A columnist recently wrote critically that Trudeau was weaving a “welcome mat” for ISIS returnees.

In the UK, a public official stated that women who joined ISIS should be left in refugee camps in the Middle East because they “need to be responsible for what they did.” The then-international development minister, Rory Stewart, told the British Broadcasting Corporation that “the only way of dealing with [returnees] will be, in almost every case, to kill them.’” More recently, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, stated that returnees “should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted.” In France, the defense minister, Florence Parly, told French radio that young children of ISIS recruits would be helped, but not their mothers. In the Netherlands, after a Dutch woman, who was abused and brought to Syria with her violent husband, escaped and was arrested in the Netherlands, the Public Prosecutor asserted, “I do not know any stories of people who could show with good justification that they were victims.” In the United States, officials merely sent letters to attempted returnees announcing their automatic “denaturalization.” In all of these policy discussions, the assumption is that policies that screen for victimization or attempt to assist ISIS returnees are unnecessary or, at least, ineffective.

Far from providing a “special focus” on identifying victims, States tend to justify not assisting returnees, under the presumption that when women or girls join ISIS, there are no victims; there are only terrorists.

State Obligations to Victims of Human Trafficking

Treating returnees, in a blanket manner, as potential terrorists without screening for human trafficking risks placing States in prima facie violation of their obligations under international law, particularly the international anti-trafficking regime and human rights law.

States should work to identify victims and assist them, as ISIS’s recruitment and exploitation of women and girls constitutes human trafficking and fits the international legal definition of the crime in at least some instances. The international legal definition of human trafficking, adopted in many domestic jurisdictions, indicates that trafficking is to be understood to encompass situations that involve agency on the part of the victim. It frames the crime of trafficking in terms of “vulnerabilities,” rather than consent, and recognizes that trafficking can still occur “where an individual consents to be smuggled across a border or is willingly recruited to join a particular group.” Under this definition, a person’s own “agency” cannot be used as a justification for failing to adopt policies that screen for and address trafficking victimization. Further, the definition of trafficking states that any person under 18 is a presumptive victim in a situation where she was recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, or received for the purposes of exploitation.

At the very least, under the previously discussed exhortations of the UNSC, States have been called upon to “develop appropriate legal safeguards to ensure that prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration strategies developed are in full compliance with their international law obligations” in the context of ISIS returnees.

Under the current international anti-human trafficking regime and human rights obligations, States are obliged to appropriately identify and protect victims. Under Article 9 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, State parties must establish policies and programs to “protect victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, from revictimization.” Notably, this obligation includes the principle of the “non-criminalization of trafficking victims,” which entails recognition of the fact that some victims are “‘imperfect’ victims.” Even where victims may have unsavory affiliations or have potentially committed crimes in conjunction with their trafficking, this legal standard directs States to identify victims in all cases and not abdicate the responsibility to thoroughly assess whether victims should be directed only toward rehabilitative avenues, rather than punitive ones. Relatedly, Article 8 of the same protocol states that in cases where residents were trafficked abroad, States must “facilitate and accept, with due regard for the safety of that person, the return of that person without undue or unreasonable delay.” Stripping a victim of citizenship would be in direct violation of this obligation for all 173 State parties that have signed onto this protocol.

Additionally, under case law of the European Court of Human Rights, States’ obligations toward human trafficking victims include investigating situations of potential trafficking, identifying victims, and facilitating such victims’ access to services and rehabilitation.

Considerations for Returnee Victims

Women and girls trafficked by ISIS are far from ideal victims. They have responded to the appeals of one of the world’s most hated and violent terrorist entities and made their way into ISIS-controlled territory on the romantic or idealistic impression that they could participate in the construction of a pure Muslim state. Hate and fear toward such actors is politically sanctioned, as evidenced by vocal animus by world leaders. Although they may have experienced exploitation, their experience, which includes agency, seems to render them unworthy of the recognition of any possible victimhood at the hands of State actors.

State actors are often not willing to confer victim status on a person who is presumptively terrorist, enemy, and foreign. If anything, they are likely to see her as blameworthy, as someone who chooses to associate with a violent, pathological group and ideology. Faced with stereotypes and presumptions of guilt, ISIS’s trafficking victims are also less likely to cooperate with interrogation tactics that question and pick apart her experiences; she may be unlikely to frame her experiences as one of victimization and may avoid discussion of her experiences altogether, contributing to the ongoing denial by state actors of any victimization she may have suffered.

To engage and appropriately screen for trafficking victimization, States should adopt trauma-informed tactics and tools and avoid the starting ground of punishment. Under international guidance and best practices, these practices include trauma-informed interviewing tactics. In the context of preparing trafficking victims to testify, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime released a guidebook that discusses, among other tips, that trauma may make a victim forgetful, inconsistent, aggressive, unpredictable, angry, withdraw, or reticent; as such, in conducting interviews or other assessments, interviewers should do so in a comfortable location (i.e. not in a jail cell), take breaks, build trust, and ask appropriate questions.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’ Toolkit to Combat Trafficking includes a checklist to facilitate victim identification that provides examples of appropriate questions to identify victims, such as, “Does the victim allege deception or violence on recruitment?”; “Does the victim allege exploitation or violence at the place of reception?”; “Was the victim involved in illegal activities at the place of reception?” and “Were other victims involved in the same recruitment, transport and exploitation?” Further, questions should be tailored to seek to differentiate the experiences of women and girls who decided to join ISIS and instead found themselves trapped in situations of exploitation from those who were recruited but who embrace ISIS’s regime and ideology.

In adopting effective and routine screening measures for trafficking in the case of ISIS returnees, States can begin to move beyond narrow conceptualizations of ISIS’s victims and include those who were induced to join the group and subsequently exploited. In doing so, States can ensure that they are in compliance with their international legal obligations under existing anti-trafficking and international human rights law.",“ISIS Brides” and State Failure to Screen for Human Trafficking in Violation of International Law and Transnational Anti-Trafficking Regimes,Opiniojuris.org,http://opiniojuris.org/2019/03/01/isis-brides-and-state-failure-to-screen-for-human-trafficking-in-violation-of-international-law-and-transnational-anti-trafficking-regimes/

She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister’s office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defence of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party byelection victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

Inner circle

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation — and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

London calling

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”

She met Butts in December in Ottawa, and was already frustrated by what she called “the barrage of people hounding me and my staff.” She pushed back. “I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC, as I had made up my mind and that the engagements were inappropriate.”

She read a text-message conversation with her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, who was relaying a conversation with Butts and Telford. Wilson-Raybould said Prince was told by Butts “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” She said Prince told her Telford said: “We don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

Opposition reaction

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who is Trudeau’s top rival, demanded the prime minister step down over the revelations. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the third-place New Democratic Party, called for a full public inquiry.

Wilson-Raybould was ultimately moved in a cabinet shuffle last month, before the scandal broke. Trudeau at first sought to downplay it by saying Wilson-Raybould’s presence in cabinet should speak for itself. She resigned the next day.

To be sure, she said she didn’t believe Trudeau or his aides broke the law, but that their interventions were inappropriate. Wilson-Raybould also said no one ever flatly directed her to intervene. Trudeau has echoed that. The former attorney general said she didn’t think it was inappropriate to discuss the potential of job losses early on, but became inappropriate to continually do it, and to raise the political ramifications of the situation.

SNC-Lavalin has said it’s no longer focused on getting a remediation agreement, but instead on fighting the case. It’s also facing legal proceedings that allege it delayed disclosing that it would not get an offer of a deferred prosecution agreement, from Sept. 4 to Oct. 10. SNC-Lavalin said Wednesday the prosecutor’s “final decision” was only made Oct. 9.",Trudeau stares into abyss after former AG’s explosive testimony,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/02/28/trudeau-stares-into-abyss-after-former-ags-explosive-testimony.html
422,Empty,2019-02-27T21:46:22Z,Her remarks to the House of Commons justice committee deepen what is already the biggest crisis of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s tenure,"OTTAWA — In a stunning appearance before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould accused the entire senior ranks of the federal government of making ‘veiled threats’ against her while attempting to interfere politically in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Sitting alone at a table in a packed basement room in Parliament’s West Block, Wilson-Raybould told the committee’s MPs that over a four-month period in late 2018 she was pressured by finance minister Bill Morneau and his staff, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office including former principal secretary Gerald Butts and chief of staff Katie Telford, and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself — all of whom were eager for her to direct federal prosecutors to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on corruption and fraud charges and negotiate a remediation agreement instead.

“For a period of approximately four months between September and December of 2018 I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people in the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” Wilson-Raybould said.

Wilson-Raybould said partisan concerns were repeatedly raised in connection with the SNC-Lavalin case, including by Trudeau, who she claims pointed out to her in a September conversation that he was himself a Quebec MP and raised the political consequences of prosecuting a large Montreal-based company during the then-ongoing Quebec election.

A corruption conviction for SNC-Lavalin, a massive Montreal-based engineering company, would mean the company is barred from bidding on federal procurement contracts for ten years. Remediation agreements see a company admit wrongdoing, pay a fine, and obey other compliance conditions, but avoid a guilty conviction in court.

She said the conversations were “clearly inappropriate” and included the suggestion that “a collision with the prime minister on these matters should be avoided.” She said one conversation with Wernick on Dec. 19, 2018, had her thinking of the Saturday Night Massacre, a reference to U.S. President Richard Nixon’s firing of the independent prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. Indeed, in a cabinet shuffle the following month, Trudeau moved Wilson-Raybould from her role as attorney general and justice minister to Veterans Affairs, a move she thought may have resulted from her refusal to comply with the prime minister’s wishes on the SNC-Lavalin case. However, she said, the PMO denied that this was the reason she was moved to a different cabinet portfolio.

Wilson-Raybould said it was not wrong for senior officials to raise concerns about job losses in the “early stages” of the decision, but once the decision was made, the “long sustained discussions about the job losses” crossed the line — and then became worse.

“Leaving aside job losses … where they became very clearly inappropriate was when political issues came up like the election in Quebec, like losing the election if SNC were to move their headquarters, conversations like that,” Wilson-Raybould said.

“Conversations like the one I had with the clerk of the privy council who invoked the prime minister’s name throughout the entirety of the conversation, spoke to me about the prime minister being dug-in, spoke to me about his concerns as to what would happen. In my mind those were veiled threats and I took them as such. That is entirely inappropriate.”

Speaking from Montreal after the committee testimony, Trudeau said he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of events, and said the decision on the SNC-Lavalin case was always “hers alone.” Yet he declined to respond to any of the specific allegations Wilson-Raybould made about comments from him and his senior staff.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff alway acted appropriately and professionally,” he said. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We of course had discussions about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possible impact on pensions.”

Asked whether Wilson-Raybould should remain in caucus, Trudeau said he had not reviewed her testimony in full yet, and would make decisions on that once he had.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, meanwhile, said Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern and called on him to resign.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” Scheer said. “That is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign. Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation, if it has not already done so, into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former attorney general detailed in her testimony.”

He also called for Wernick’s resignation.

Asked if the RCMP was investigating allegations of political interference in the matter — or planned to investigate — the force’s deputy commissioner Gilles Michaud said “it would be inappropriate to confirm or deny the existence of a criminal investigation.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said Wednesday evening that while Trudeau may eventually need to step down, for now his party is calling for a public inquiry to bring out the facts.

“What we need to do is get to the truth, and that’s what a public inquiry will do,” he said. “He may need to resign because of this, but … a public inquiry will get to the bottom, get to the heart of this.”

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony included detailed accounts of conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages with 11 senior government officials. “For most of these conversations, I made contemporaneous and detailed notes,” she said. “Notes, in addition to my clear memory, which I am relying on today among other documentation.”

The officials named in her testimony included Trudeau, Telford and Butts, who resigned last week amid controversy over his role in the SNC-Lavalin scandal; senior PMO advisors Elder Marques and Mathieu Bouchard; Morneau and his chief of staff, Ben Chin; and Wernick, the ostensibly nonpartisan head of the federal public service whose testimony before the committee last week some observers criticized for being partisan in tone and content.

After federal prosecutors decided on Sept. 4 against a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, it took only two days for Morneau’s chief of staff to contact Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince.

“He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this,” Wilson-Raybould said. “He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.”

She said the first time PMO staff contacted her office was Sept. 16, when Marques and Bouchard had a phone call with Prince.

“They said that they understand that the individual Crown prosecutor wants to negotiate an agreement, but the Director (of Public Prosecutions) does not,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said they started to discuss what a “reasonable solution” might look like, such as getting outside advice to the prosecutors, while acknowledging that “that there are limits on what can be done, and that they can’t direct.” She said they also brought up the “Quebec election context.”

It's the Quebec election right now, so we can't have that happen

On Sept. 17, she had a meeting with Trudeau that she had previously requested on another subject. Wernick was unexpectedly also in attendance. She said Trudeau raised the SNC-Lavalin case “immediately.”

“The prime minister asks me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC, citing that if there was no (deferred prosecution) there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal,” she said. She said she told him she had made up her mind, and was not going to interfere with the decision of federal prosecutors.

She said the discussion continued, with Wernick making the argument that the company could leave Canada if the prosecution continued.

“At that point (Trudeau) jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an MP in Quebec — the member for Papineau,” Wilson-Raybould said. “I was quite taken aback. My response, and I remember this vividly, was to ask (Trudeau) a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said ‘No, No, No — we just need to find a solution.’”

Two days later, on Sept. 19, she said Morneau spoke with her in the House of Commons.

“He again stressed the need to save jobs, and I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop, that they were inappropriate,” she said. But the next day, she said, her chief of staff had two phone calls from aides in Morneau’s office, including Chin.

After that, things went quiet for a while, Wilson-Raybould said. Then on Oct. 18, the PMO’s Bouchard called her chief of staff to suggest looking at the option of getting an external legal opinion on the issue.

The next day, SNC-Lavalin filed a Federal Court case challenging the prosecution service’s decision not to negotiate a remediation agreement. “In my view, this necessarily put to rest any notion that I might speak to or intervene with the (director of public prosecutions), or that an external review could take place,” she said.

Yet she went on to detail many more meetings and phone calls from PMO staff.

She met with Butts on Dec. 5, and she said she told him “how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate.”

“Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff, he said I needed to find a solution,” she said. She alleges he told her that the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, which separated the prosecution service from the justice department, “was set up by (former Prime Minister Stephen) Harper,” and that he “does not like the law.”

The two final meetings came on Dec. 18 and Dec. 19. The first one had Butts and Telford meeting with Prince, and pushing her to find a solution. Wilson-Raybould read out text messages that Prince sent her after the meeting, including the allegation that Butts had said: “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.”

Prince also texted that Butts and Telford were keen on having Wilson-Raybould retain a former Supreme Court justice to get advice on the matter, saying it would “give us cover in the business and legal community” and “allow the PM to say we were doing something.”

“(Telford) was like ‘if Jody is nervous, we would of course line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper,’” Wilson-Raybould said Prince texted her.

The next day, she had a phone call with Wernick. “The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm, he wants to know why the (deferred prosecution) route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used,” Wilson-Raybould said. “He said ‘I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.’”

Wilson-Raybould said she told Wernick they were “treading on dangerous ground,” that the attorney general cannot act in partisan way and that “all of this screams of that.”

She said Wernick insisted that “it is not good for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at ‘loggerheads.’” She told him she was starting to have thoughts of the “Saturday Night Massacre.”

On Jan. 7, Trudeau called Wilson-Raybould to inform her she would be removed as justice minister and attorney general. “I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter,” she said. “They denied this to be the case.”

Following her opening statement, Wilson-Raybould took six rounds of questions from Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs.

“I have to say that I am very shaken by what I’ve heard here today,” the NDP’s Murray Rankin said. “I’ve been a lawyer for over 40 years, I’ve taught a generation of law students about the rule of law, and what I’ve heard today should make all Canadians extremely upset.”

Liberal MPs focused many of their questions on why she didn’t immediately resign, and why she stayed in cabinet after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs in January (she subsequently resigned after the SNC-Lavalin story hit the media).

“I decided that I would take the prime minister at this word, I trusted him, I had confidence in him, and so I decided to continue on around the cabinet table with the concerns that I had around SNC because I took the prime minister at his word,” she said.

“Do you have confidence in the prime minister today?” asked Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault.

Wilson-Raybould paused for a long time before answering. “I’ll say this … I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the table, the cabinet table,” she said. “That’s why I resigned.”

Later, she was asked again by Liberal MP Jennifer O’Connell if she had confidence in Trudeau.

Said Wilson-Raybould, “I’m not sure how that question is relevant.”

Ms Wilson-Raybould gave testimony before the Canadian House of Commons justice committee for several hours on Wednesday, speaking out against members of staff and Prime Minister Trudeau attempting to interfere with an investigation into the SNC-Lavalin corporation, The Globe and Mail reports.

Accusations that the prime minister and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) interfered with the SNC-Lavalin investigation first emerged on February 7th.

The engineering company, which is based in Quebec, was accused of engaging in bribery in Libya in efforts to secure lucrative contracts in the country.

Since the accusations were made public, further allegations have revealed that the corporation may also have gone as far as paying for prostitutes for Saadi Gadhafi, son of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, during a visit to Canada in 2008.

Receipts claim that the company spent as much as $30,000 on prostitutes for Gadhafi while he was allegedly in Montreal and Toronto at the invitation of the company to learn English.

Initially, after the first Globe and Mail report on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the accusations were dismissed by Trudeau and the PMO.

Justin Trudeau’s Top Adviser Resigns amid Corruption Scandal https://t.co/vAZMBhuUXF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 19, 2019

Only weeks later, Trudeau’s chief adviser, and one of his closest confidants, Gerald Butts resigned abruptly from his position as principal secretary in the PMO.

Butts denied that his resignation had anything to do with the SNC-Lavalin affair saying accusations that he or others put pressure on former Attorney General Wilson-Raybould were “simply not true.”

Until Wednesday, Ms Wilson-Raybould had been unable to comment on the matter but was free to do so in front of the justice committee.

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould made bombshell allegations towards Trudeau and the PMO saying, “For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin.”

“These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance,” she added.

One of the most damning pieces of testimony involved an alleged discussion between Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau:

The Prime Minister asks me to help out – to find a solution here for SNC – citing that if there was no DPA there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal. In response, I explained to him the law… I told him that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP.

… At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

The former Attorney General named several prominent politicians and staff who were engaged in pressuring her, some with “veiled threats.”

Among the names included former PMO head Gerald Butts, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau, and head of the Privy Council Office Michael Wernick.

The scandal has rocked the Canadian political scene and has led to calls from Conservative opposition lead Andrew Scheer for the prime minister to resign from office.

Justin Trudeau has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign. Speaking LIVE to the media right now: https://t.co/BFhSYFiCVE — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) February 28, 2019

“As Ms Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends,” Scheer said and added, “Mr Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.”

Prime Minister Trudeau, meanwhile, rejected calls for his resignation saying that voters would get to decide their next prime minister at the upcoming national elections in October.","Alleged Threats, Bribes, Prostitutes: Growing Scandal Threatens to Bring Down Canada’s Trudeau",Breitbart News,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/02/28/ex-canadian-attorney-general-testimony-bring-down-trudeau/

Jagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada's New Democrats Party (NDP), has won his first seat in parliament after a by-election bid in British Columbia.

The party premier secured 38% of votes in a closely-watched race in Burnaby, east of Vancouver.

Mr Singh, 40, is the first ethnic minority to lead a major federal party in the country.

His win comes ahead of general elections in October and is seen as a boost for his leadership.

""Friends, we made history today,"" he told supporters after learning the results. ""Guess what? We just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can.""

His new seat, Burnaby-South, opened up after fellow NDP member Kennedy Stewart resigned to become mayor of Vancouver.

The town's election race made headlines in January after Liberal candidate Karen Wang stepped down after making remarks about Mr Singh that some said amounted to racism.

Ms Wang wrote a post on the website WeChat in which she said that as the only Chinese candidate in the race she stood a good chance of winning, and pointed out Mr Singh's Indian descent.

Announcing her resignation, she said her ""choice of words wasn't well-considered and didn't reflect my intent"", but she denied that they were racist.

Mr Singh is a practising Sikh and former provincial Ontario legislator, and became leader of the centre-left party in 2017 despite no experience of federal politics. During the NDP's leadership campaign, a video of his reaction to an angry heckler at a campaign rally went viral.

Despite success in Burnaby, the NDP failed to secure seats in Canada's two other by-elections. Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan ousted the party from Montreal's Outremont constituency, which the NDP had held for over a decade.

The Conservatives also held onto seat in the Ontario constituency of York-Simcoe.

By-elections are held in Canada when a seat is vacated by a member of Parliament (MP) between general elections.

What does this mean for the coming election?

Monday's victory was a necessary breakthrough for Mr Singh's leadership, which had been undermined by poor polling, fundraising difficulties, and internal party divisions.

The NDP has never held power and is currently the third place party in Canada's Parliament, holding 40 of 338 seats in the House of Commons. A quarter of its MPs who won seats in the 2015 election have either resigned or announced they are not running again in October.

In an interview with CTV last month, former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said ""it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Singh to stick around"" if his parliamentary bid failed.

But losing the seat in Outremont to the Liberals on Monday is still a blow for the party.

That seat, which was won by Mr Mulcair in 2007, was a foothold in the vote-rich province of Quebec and helped launch the so-called ""Orange Wave"" of support for the NDP in 2011.

With more than half the polls reporting results in Burnaby South, Singh had just over 38 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22 per cent.

But while victory tightens Singh’s shaky grip on the reins of the NDP, the challenge ahead was underscored by the simultaneous loss of the Montreal riding that launched the NDP’s orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

In Outremont, Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding’s polls reporting results, with the NDP’s Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when former NDP leader Tom Mulcair scored an upset byelection victory for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the New Democrats that helped them launch their 2011 sweep of Quebec and vault them into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

The Conservatives, meanwhile, easily hung onto the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe.

Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results, with Liberal Shaun Tanaka taking 31 per cent.

The Vancouver-area race was largely seen as a test of Singh's leadership, as he faced off against Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, a former B.C. MLA, and Conservative candidate Jay Shin, a lawyer and newcomer to politics.

In 2017, Singh made history when he became the first non-white leader of a major Canadian federal party. Since then, he's led the NDP without a federal seat.

In his victory speech on Monday night, Singh said it was a ""new day.""

""When I was growing up I could have never imagined someone like me running for prime minister, but guess what we just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can,"" he said.

""And I know that carries a lot of responsibility and I understand that responsibility and I want you to know that when I take my seat in the House of Commons I will work very hard to make you all very proud.""

Singh touts health care, housing

While Singh highlighted some of the issues critical to Burnaby South, he also touted a national platform — calling for expanded health coverage, building half a million affordable housing units across Canada, transitioning to a green economy, and working towards reconciliation with Indigenous communities.

Watch part of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

Singh criticized the Liberals and Conservatives and called out the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

He also addressed growing distrust of immigration.

""New Canadians and people who are fleeing are not responsible for the problems that we're faced with,"" he said.

""We'll address that uncertainty and fear by giving people something to hope, something to dream.""

With all polls reporting, the NDP claimed 39 per cent of the vote, the Liberals 26 per cent, the Conservatives 22.5 per cent, and the People's Party 10.6 per cent.

Just under 29 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot, not including electors who registered on election day.

Rough Liberal ride

The Liberals usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But this time around, they faced challenges in the campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin — a scandal Singh alluded to in his speech.

""We have eight more months to let the people know we have a government … that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin, but stands up for everyday Canadians,"" he said.

But Lee, who replaced Wang as the Liberal candidate in January, said that as he went door-to-door constituents were concerned with local issues like housing and transportation, not the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He said the Liberals ran a strong campaign and he is considering running again in the fall.

""I look forward to more debate ... in elections, sometimes it's difficult to get the message across so I believe in the fall [it will] be much better.""

Singh addresses Quebec

The NDP also faced a test in the Montreal-area riding of Outremont on Monday, which was vacated by the party's former leader, Thomas Mulcair. Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan was the successful candidate in that riding.

Singh made a special pitch to Quebec, saying he knew Outremont would be a tough riding, but that the NDP supports legislation supported by many Quebecers, primarily surrounding green energy and the environment.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's Poll Tracker.

Today’s the day, for real this time.

Not so fast. In another letter to Housefather sent Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould said the freedom the Liberal government gave her to speak through an Order in Council “falls far short of what is required” if Canadians are to learn all the facts. That’s because the order only covered her time as attorney-general, but still limits her from speaking about events that happened after she was shuffled to veterans affairs or what she told cabinet after she resigned.

Even so, she is scheduled to appear starting at 3:15 p.m. ET.

And someone else claims to be looking forward to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, too. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: “I’m pleased that Ms. Wilson-Raybould is going to be able to share her perspective.”

Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won the Burnaby South byelection on Monday night with 39 per cent of the vote – but he is getting a great deal of attention for his rap game on Tuesday.

A huge crowd of supporters turned up to support Singh for this critical moment in his political career. Following the win, elated supporters turned the event room into a dance party.

“I will be your champion,” Singh said. “I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa. I will fight for you in the House of Commons.”

Of course, many people were dancing, but one of the night’s highlights was Singh rapping Post Malone’s “Congratulations.” Not only was he rapping some of the lyrics, but he also passionately pumped up the crowd. In fact, Singh got so into the beat that he started motioning to the crowd to jump when the chorus dropped, and he proceeded to jump on the platform.

Nine months after the body came into being, SJOBA organised its first Scooter Motorcycle SJOBA Rally on March 8, 1981. While the first edition of the rally saw more than 40 riders competing, the second edition also saw the introduction of cars and jeeps in. The rally, which started as a one-day long affair, will see its 32nd edition being held over three days starting March 1 later this year

“The first meeting of SJOBA was held with 19 members on July 19, 1981 and the founding members were keen on organising a sporting event. Unlike other sports, motorsports gives an opportunity to a young rider to compete against an older rider and vice versa; this was the main reason we decided to hold the first SJOBA Rally in March, 1982.,” recalls Sarin, adding how he would accompany his brother Ranjit Lal Sarin to chalk out the route. “We also came out with a souvenir publication, which we used to raise funds for advertisements to conduct the rally,” adds Sarin.

The first rally, which was flagged off from the St John’s High School, Sector 26, was meant only for the scooter/motorbikes. The four-wheelers were introduced in the second edition. The first route of the rally saw riders traversing from Chandigarh to Kasauli-Dagshai-Chail and back to Chandigarh on the same day.

This year, the rally will be conducted for the first time in the plains with the new route covering places like Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Garshankar in Punjab apart from seeing a night stage.

“We started with the stage format and a couple of women riders too competed in the second edition of the rally. As the number of participants grew in the coming years, we made it a two-day affair in 1996. After getting the affiliation with Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) in 2000, we also introduced the time-speed-distance (TSD) format in 2007 apart from converting the rally to a three-day long drive in 2006, which meant that the city residents could also see the rallyists in action. Nowadays, more and more riders are competing in the TSD format too and that is good for rallying. This year we have also introduced the night stage apart from conducting the rally in plains in Punjab,” said SPS Ghai, one of the founding members of SJOBA.

2012 : 25th edition of the rally held

Champions Speak

With rallyists like five-time SJOBA champion Suresh Rana to celebrities like Gul Panag, the rally has seen some of India’s top ranked rallyists in its 31 editions. Rana, who is a multiple winner of Raid-De-Himalaya, will be making his return to SJOBA this year after missing the rally for some years. “The best thing about SJOBA Rally is that it helps you prepare for the more tougher rallies with the same kind of terrain and competitiveness. It is a short rally in terms of number of days as well as route but that makes it more competitive too. I am making a return to the rally after some years and I will be driving a Gypsy this time instead of Grand Vitara. The fact that the rally is being held in plains will make the rally more open and it will be a exciting thing to compete in the night stage too,” shares Rana, who is based in Manali.

Kalka biker Mohit Verma, a three-time winner in the rally in the motorbikes format with his first title coming in 2011, sees the rally as a big stepping stone in his racing career. 28-year-old Verma, who became the only Indian rider to win the Raid-De-Himalaya, Desert Storm, Dakshin Dare and SJOBA Rally in 2014, is currently away from the circuit due to an injury.

“If you are a beginner, the SJOBA Rally puts you in competition against experienced riders and a rider can take him time to master the format and return back strong in the next edition. When I won the title in 2011, it was one of my first titles and gave me a lot of confidence. In 2014, when I won the titles in all the rallies, it meant a lot for me. I suffered an injury in 2015 but those wins are always special for me,” shared Verma. Two-time winner in TSD format, Jagmeet Gill also believes the same. “Winning the rally twice in the TSD format as a former student means a lot for me. I had competed for the first time in 2009 in the rally. As a rallyist, one enjoys the tough competition in this rally,” shared 34-year-old Gill.

Woman Power

Over the years, SJOBA Rally has seen more than 50 women participants competing as riders as well as navigators. Last year, the rally saw riders like Sarah Kashyap, Anita Krishan and Suzanne Bull competing in the Extreme Moto category apart from some woman riders in the TSD format. Kashyap, who had moved to Dubai last year, is the only Indian female rider to complete Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm.

The 33-year-old competed for the first time in the rally in 2015 while riding a Bullet. Last year, Kashyap finished first in the ladies category and 11th overall in Moto Extreme category. “I first heard about SJOBA rally when I was kid. I never thought I will compete in the rally one day. When I competed in the rally in 2015, it was my first rally ever and I had never raced before that. I kept falling off the motorbike and I even got a heat stroke after which the organsiers asked me if I wanted to continue. I got an appreciation award that year and it motivated me. I have competed in the rally three times so far and it has laid the foundation for many cross-country rallies for me. It was easily the stepping stone for Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm and taught me the required skills. The rally has new routes every year and it poses fresh challenges every year,” shares Kashyap.

Former Miss India and Bollywood actress Gul Panag too competed in the TSD format in the rally in 2010 with her two cousins and an aunt. Panag acted as the navigator for her cousin Simrat and they won the event in the women’s category in TSD format. “It was an experience to remember for all of us. My team consisted of my two cousins and aunt and all four of us competed in the TSD format. Being the navigator, I was responsible for guiding my cousin about the route and also keep a track of others things. It was a different challenge in every stage and we enjoyed a lot competing in such a rally. It is good to see more and more women riders competing in such events,” shares Panag.

Logistics Control

There is a lot of logistics involved in the rally that sees close to 80 riders competing in the 4WD Extreme, Moto Extreme and TSD categories apart from spectators stage SSS.

Vishal Sharma, the present president of SJOBA, says their task begins with charting out the route. “The chalking of route begins 40-50 days prior to the rally and we do the recce of the whole route more than five times. Then there is the task of making rule books and log books for the route. Once I was officiating as a marshal and sitting on a hill top. A group of monkeys came and took my equipment,” he laughs.

Another SJOBA member Vivek Bansal handles the communication part of the rally which means setting up the communication channels and radio for the drivers. “I am Ham Radio operator and the toughest part in SJOBA rally is to provide coverage in the valleys. Most of the times, we sit on hilltops to get full coverage. Once while officiating at Barog, we had a slide shave when lightning struck my radio and other equipment,” shares Bansal.

Kshitij Sharma, secretary, SJOBA, too has seen the action from close. “This year, more than 140 SJOBA members will act as volunteers and we have got close to 80 entries. The event has been successful because of the efforts of all the members as well as riders,” says Sharma.

The Way Ahead

With new sponsors supporting the rally, it will see the night stage happening this year. As Manmohan Lal Sarin proudly shows the first souvenir, he is quick to add, “The rallying gods have been kind to us in all these years. Apart from one incident in the starting years when a car skidded down and the death of a rider in an accident some years later, the rally has been conducted smoothly. When a rallyist died in an accident, we were deeply saddened and thought about discontinuing the rally.

But then Brother Meredith told us to remain calm and see it as a mishap, which can take place in any sport. When the car of a competitor fell into a khud, Jimmy Sehgal, one of the competitors and leader at that point, stopped and helped the rider. Such heartwarming incidents have given strength to the organisers and rallyists.”

‘My first win at SJOBA will always be special’

SPS Garcha, 65, still remembers the first time he competed in the SJOBA rally. It was the first edition of the rally in 1981 and the 1971 batch alumnus of St John’s was also actively involved in organising the rally. Garcha, who started competing in motorsports in 1977, became the first winner of the Scooter/Motorbike Open SJOBA Rally in 1981 and went on to become the national champion for five successive years from 1982 to 1987.

Garcha won the rally on a Jawa motorcyle and was told not to compete in the following editions of the rally to give others a chance.

“I was actively involved in planning the route and doing the recce for the rally. I used to have a 1966 JAWA motorbike at that time. After the first stage in the morning, we had lunch at Solan with me in the lead but on the eay back , my bike’s rear brakes got heated. As the route was uphill, I removed the brakes and continued. Riding uphill does not require much of rear brakes and when I reached Barog, the brakes had cooled down and I completed the last stage. I have very find memories of my first win,” says Garcha.

The motorsports champion also used to run a garage in those days. The following years saw him working closely with the Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) and officiating in many rallies besides working as the federation’s regional director. A senior steward and technical delegate with FMSCI, the former rallyist is still involved in charting the route and officiating at the SJOBA Rally. “In the 1980s, we would read books and magzines to learn about various rules and the various formats of a rally. Since the rally was held only in Stage Rally format, it would mean spending hours chalking out the route and understanding the map. There was less traffic and most of the roads were tracks. Despite tech advancements, the core of the racing has remained intact. That’s why a lot of new riders compete every year,” adds Garcha.

Looking back at his long and adventurous innings, Garcha remembers an incident during the Raid De Himalaya. “I was officiating as one of the stewards of the course when one of the cars did not cross the next point. Knowing that something was wrong, we reversed and sure enough, I saw skid marks. It was close to midnight but we launched a search for the car.

Jagmeet Singh could lead the NDP to victory in the federal election this fall, but only if the party re-engages with its socialist roots, according to a former NDP MPP.

""We're looking at polls that say that socialism, as a word, is now more popular than capitalism for millennials,"" said Cheri DiNovo, who served for 11 years as an Ontario NDP MPP.

She told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti that to capture those votes, the NDP doesn't need ""slippery language,"" but needs to stand ""on firm socialist ground."" The party needs to espouse positions like ""being very adamant about our opposition to pipelines, being very pro about doing something for the environment,"" she added.

""We need to take stands that are in dramatic contrast to liberalism, and neo-liberalism and centrism … no one needs another Liberal party.

""And ... if we do that, yes, I think we'll win.""

Singh won a byelection in Burnaby South, B.C., Monday, with 39 per cent of the vote. He will take a seat in the House of Commons for the first time. His win was balanced against an NDP loss to the Liberals in another byelection in Outremont, Que, the centre of the so-called Orange Wave that boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status in 2011, for the first time in its history.

NDP leader rallies supporters after Burnaby South win, calls for change in Ottawa 1:18

The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's poll tracker.

""The bad news is we've halved our polling in Quebec. The bad news is we're losing MPs who are not running again. That's the bad news,"" said DiNovo.

""The good news is that this … could be a reboot and that Jagmeet's completely capable of being a leader in such a reboot, if and only if, the party starts focusing on policies and starts focusing on principles.""

To discuss the byelection results and what lies ahead for the NDP, Tremonti was joined by:

Ed Broadbent, former leader of the federal NDP, and chair of the Broadbent Institute

Farouk Karim, who served as press secretary for the federal NDP caucus until 2016, and now works for the Canadian Union of Postal Workers

Cheri DiNovo, who served for 11 years as an Ontario NDP MPP, and is now the minister at Trinity-St. Paul's Centre for Faith, Justice and the Arts in Toronto

""I will have been doing it for nearly seven years by the time the next election comes along and I think it's time to pass the torch,"" Rankin said in an interview with CBC News.

""I wasn't prepared to spend the next four years doing this. I thought at this stage, I wanted to do other things with my life aside from politics.""

""Not to say this hasn't been the most exciting and rewarding career that I've ever had, but it's time for a change.""

Rankin is the 12th NDP MP out of the 44 elected in 2015 to resign or announce in recent months that they won't run again in October. Others, like B.C. MP Nathan Cullen, have said they are also weighing their futures in politics.

With eight months to the next election, the New Democrats are in third place with an estimated 14.2 per cent of support, compared with 35.8 per cent for the Conservatives and 33.9 per cent for the Liberals.

'People are saying we've got a strong leader'

Rankin said his decision has nothing to do with the party's popularity or the leadership of Singh, who was elected to the House of Commons on Monday in a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

""I think people are saying we've got a strong leader as well and as soon as Canadians get to know him better I think there's going to be an enormous uptick in support, and I think we're in a good position for the next election.""

Rankin said those who are leaving have a variety of reasons.

""Transition happens all the time in a party. I don't think the narrative that people are abandoning the NDP team is really warranted. It's certainly not relevant in my case. That's not the reason I have decided to move on.""

Rankin's announcement comes as he is in the spotlight as a key member of the justice committee examining allegations key government officials pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)

While the NDP has held the riding of Victoria since 2006, Rankin's departure could create an opportunity for Elizabeth May's Green Party.

Rankin was first elected in a byelection in November 2012, narrowly beating a Green Party candidate by less than three percentage points. While he increased his margin of victory in 2015 to more than nine percentage points, Green Party candidate Jo-Ann Roberts was a close second, with the Liberals and the Conservatives lagging far behind.

Rankin's riding also borders May's riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands and is represented provincially by B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver.

While Rankin acknowledges the Green Party posted one of its strongest results across the country in his riding in the last election, he said voters would be better off voting for whoever succeeds him as the NDP candidate — particularly if that candidate is a strong advocate for the environment.

""If you're caring deeply about these issues, where do you think you're going to have the most clout in Ottawa? Being part of a team that may have the balance of power in the next Parliament, the NDP? Or a team that has, so far, one member?""

Unpopular Liberal decisions

Rankin said the riding also has a base of Liberal support but he said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has made decisions that are unpopular in the riding.

""There's a lot of disenchantment with the fact the electoral reform didn't go through. The pipeline issue — I would be lying to you if I didn't say that was an enormous obstacle for the Liberals on Vancouver Island. People are just not prepared to take chances with our coastline.""

Rankin's announcement comes as circumstances have thrust him into the spotlight as a key point person for the NDP in what he describes as a ""constitutional crisis"" — former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's assertion that key government officials pressured her to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with Quebec construction giant SNC-Lavalin which is facing charges of fraud and corruption.

He is also the NDP's deputy house leader and a member of the highly secret National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

While he plans to serve out his mandate, Rankin has already been appointed by the B.C. government to help guide and design a new reconciliation process with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who have been opposing a natural gas pipeline in Northern B.C. and implement the Supreme Court's Delgamuukw, decision which helped define indigenous title.

""The new government in Victoria, I'm very proud of the fact that they're committed to trying to do things differently. They have, in their speech from the throne, committed to the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous people. They talk about implementing the historic Delgamuukw case and to be given an opportunity to do that is something I couldn't say no to.""

A lawyer by profession, he is also thinking of once again teaching law at the University of Victoria and has been approached by law firms to practice environmental and Indigenous law.

But for now he is focused on completing his mandate and getting to the bottom of the SNC-Lavalin case.

""There's a lot of work to do here. We're living through a constitutional crisis right now in the House of Commons. … We're dealing with issues that are absolutely historic and important so that will take a lot of my time.""

Finally. More than 16 months after he cruised to victory in the NDP leadership race, the 40-year-old politician from Ontario clinched his first federal seat in a British Columbia byelection Monday.

Not only will Singh now be able to lead his party from the floor of the House of Commons, he may also have saved his political career, for defeat in Burnaby South on Monday — as many NDP insiders have put it — was simply not an option for the third-place party. Singh’s victory came in one of three byelections held Monday, as voters in key battleground areas cast ballots against the backdrop of the lingering SNC-Lavalin scandal. In York-Simcoe, the Conservatives hold onto a Greater Toronto Area riding that has been a lock for the party since 2004. And here in Outremont, a diverse and multilingual district at the heart of the Island of Montreal, voters returned to their long-established tradition of electing Liberals, 12 years after Thomas Mulcair’s breakthrough here became the symbolic forerunner to the unprecedented success of the “orange wave” election in 2011.

The NDP leader campaigned against a Liberal government he accuses of cosying up to corporate friends, falling short on affordable housing and failing to take climate change seriously. The riding was previously held by Kennedy Stewart, an NDP MP who won by about 500 votes in 2015 and resigned the seat last year to run for Vancouver mayor. David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said a Singh victory is the first bit of good news the NDP has had in a long time. Under Singh’s leadership — which began when he cruised to victory in the October 2017 leadership race — the NDP has stalled in the polls, seen a parade of sitting MPs quit or announce they won’t run again in the general election, and experienced a sharp drop in fundraising from more than $18 million in 2015 to roughly $5 million last year.

Singh’s entry to the House of Commons gives the party a chance to change the narrative, Coletto said. “It gives them a huge opportunity to pivot and to start rebuilding his own reputation,” he said. “Low expectations can be a really powerful tool, because it’s easier to meet them.” Singh’s chances may have been boosted by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which the NDP has used to portray the Liberals as a band of faux-progressive allies of big business. Combined with a Liberal stumble — candidate Karen Wang was replaced by former MLA Richard Lee partway through the race — and the possibility that People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson snags votes from the Conservatives’ Jay Shin, the riding looked primed for a Singh win, said political scientist David Moscrop. “Burnaby South is sort of cooked for him to win,” he said Monday morning. Meanwhile, the results in York-Simcoe pointed to victory for Conservative candidate Scot Davidson. For 14 years, the riding north of Toronto was home to Peter Van Loan, a Harper-era cabinet minister who resigned from the House of Commons last year. That continued Monday with Davidson on pace to beat Liberal challenger — and second-time candidate — Shaun Tanaka. With such a record of Conservative voting, Coletto said he is looking to see how Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party — and local candidate Robert Geurts — performs in the riding. “The most important signal we get from tonight is how well does Max Bernier’s party do,” he said, adding the party could make an impact in all three byelections. “That will give us an indication of the potential effectiveness of his party,” he said. Meanwhile, Outremont was a Liberal stronghold for decades, until Mulcair won it for the NDP in a 2007 byelection. It is therefore hallowed turf for New Democrats, who see Mulcair’s success as the symbolic toehold for the “orange wave” in 2011, when the party was lifted to its best-ever federal election result by overwhelming success in Quebec. But now that Mulcair has left politics, local lawyer Rachel Bendayan wrested Outremont back for the Liberals Monday night. By late Monday, she had a sizable lead over Julia Sanchez, an economist who worked for decades in international development, who campaigned on an environment-focused platform for the NDP. One factor in the race may have been voter reaction to the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has a strong local component given the company is headquartered nearby in downtown Montreal and is a significant employer in the province. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute not-for-profit polling firm, said while early polling has suggested the Liberals have taken a hit during the controversy, SNC-Lavalin is seen in a different light — as a big employer worth saving — by many in the province. But regardless of its impact Monday, it is too early to conclude whether the controversy surrounding the company and Justin Trudeau’s office will linger into the fall general election, Moscrop said. “I think this is a reminder to the Liberals that, boy, you don’t want this in the news in October,” he said. “The sooner you deal with this completely, the better.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Big day today on Parliament Hill.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould is set to speak her truth about the SNC-Lavalin controversy this week—specifically, tomorrow,* when she appears before a justice committee that’s looking into whether the PMO tried to pressure her into going easy on SNC-Lavalin.

Will she light it up? If the former AG adds credible colour to the story being told by anonymous sources this past week, it will be a devastating day for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, writes Andrew MacDougall: “If you’re Trudeau, it’s hard to envision an appearance in which Wilson-Raybould doesn’t burn everything—Trudeau included—to the ground. There has been some serious red-on-red action on the nation’s front pages in the past few days, and only one side can survive.” (Maclean’s)

No, no, no: The men who wanted SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution engaged in “Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting” of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by repeatedly refusing to accept her authority on the file and then insisting she was under no pressure, writes Anne Kingston:

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from [Privy Council Clerk] Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it. Through it all a question emerges: How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say “No” before she was heard? (Maclean’s)

Singh needs this win: Monday is also byelection day. Votes will be counted in three ridings, including Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Outremont in Montreal. But the one everyone will be watching is Burnaby South, where NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to finally secure a seat in the House. With his leadership in question, and the NDP low on polling and fundraising support, Singh needs victory—and the SNC-Lavalin mess embroiling Liberals can only help “(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” saysRichard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.” (Canadian Press, CBC News)

Politics show round-up

Didn’t catch the weekend politics shows? Here’s what you missed:

In his testimony to the justice committee Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick attacked the original Globe and Mail story that kicked off the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Bob Fife, one of the journalists who broke the story, made the rounds, and on CTV’s Question Period defended the scoop: “In politics the best defence is often a strong offence, and particularly shooting the messenger, but in his testimony [Wernick] actually confirmed what we reported—we reported Miss Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to cut a deal so SNC-Lavalin would not be prosecuted, would pay a fine. We did not say the Prime Minister directed her to do so. Nobody said that. In fact nobody did do that.” (CTV video tweet)

Speaking on Question Period Conservative Justice Critic Lisa Raitt said Wernick’s committee testimony shows lines were crossed with Wilson-Raybould: “Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end. And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.” (CTV News)

Following Friday’s recommendation by the National Energy Board that the Trans Mountain pipeline be approved, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa is on track to wrap up consultations with 117 Indigenous committees that would be impacted by the pipeline within the next few months: “The work that we have done so far and the work we will continue to do in the coming months, I can tell you that I feel that we are in a very strong position to conclude these consultations within the next 90 days. But we must get it right.” (Global News)

On Trans Mountain, Canada’s fisheries minister Jonathan Wilkinson told CBC’s The House that increased tanker traffic from the pipeline expansion won’t have much additional impact on endangered southern resident killer whales because they’re already being blasted with underwater noise. “It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline, he said. “There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year, there are thousands of ferries…. All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there’s a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.” (CBC News)

The New Democrats secured a seat for their leader, Jagmeet Singh. The Liberals stole a riding away from the NDP in Quebec and the Conservatives increased their support in a GTA stronghold. The Greens and the People's Party each hit double digits in one of the three contests as well.

That's the good news. But there was bad news, too.

Both the Liberals and Conservatives saw their support slip in two out of three byelections. The NDP lost Outremont, the scene of the party's first breakthrough into Quebec in 2007 that foreshadowed the Orange Wave of 2011. And where the Greens and Maxime Bernier's party didn't hit double digits, they weren't a factor whatsoever.

In his victory speech, Singh thanked supporters and promised to fight against poverty and continue his party's campaign for a universal pharmacare plan.

""And when I take my seat in the House of Commons, I will work hard to make you all very proud,"" Singh said.

Singh's win came in one of three federal byelections held Monday in B.C., Ontario and Quebec.

In Ontario's York—Simcoe riding, Conservative candidate Scot Davidson claimed victory, stepping into a seat long held by retired Conservative MP Peter Van Loan.

In the Montreal riding of Outremont, Liberal Rachel Bendayan won her campaign, taking control of a seat last held by former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair.

Results from Burnaby South in B.C., show Singh claimed victory with 39 per cent of the vote. The Liberals followed with 26 per cent, followed by the Conservatives with 22.5 per cent. Former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada trailed with 10.6 per cent.

Singh also pledged to help the NDP ""reconnect"" with Quebec voters who have drifted away, in an effort to realize the political ambitions of the party's late leader, Jack Layton.

""We are the champions for Quebecers. New Democrats are the champions for Canadians, we will continue to do that work.""

Low turnout

The Conservatives secured their seat in the Ontario riding of York—Simcoe with 53.2 per cent of the vote to the Liberals' 29.9 per cent and the NDP's 7.4 per cent with 115 of 136 polls reporting.

Early numbers showed that turnout in all three byelections was low: just over 19 per cent in York—Simcoe and just over 18 per cent in Outremont. Burnaby South drew slightly larger numbers at 29 per cent, but all three fell below the average of the last 20 years which sits at just under 35 per cent for byelections.

In Outremont — where the NDP was looking to hold on to the seat of the party's former leader — Bendayan claimed victory with 40 per cent of the vote. The NDP trailed with 26.1 per cent, followed by the Greens and then the Bloc Québécois.

""On behalf of Liberals across Canada, I want to congratulate Rachel Bendayan and her team on their hard-earned victory, and I know that she will be a dedicated voice for Outremont in Parliament,"" Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada, said in a statement.

Vancouver NDP MP Jenny Kwan acknowledged the loss of Outremont was ""a disappointment.""

""What we're going to do, of course, is learn from this experience and then we're going to redouble our efforts to ensure that the people of Quebec know we are there for them,"" she said at Singh's victory party.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's poll tracker.

Julia Sanchez, a former international development executive, was the NDP's candidate in Outremont. Bendayan, a lawyer and former party staffer, ran against Mulcair in the last election, finishing second with 33.5 per cent of the vote to Mulcair's 44 per cent.

Conservatives win York—Simcoe

While the Conservatives usually have a tough time winning when the NDP is in a weakened position, the party kept its seat in York—Simcoe, Ont., formerly held by Peter Van Loan.

The former leader of Stephen Harper's government in the Commons, Van Loan stepped down from his seat in September and announced he was retiring from politics.

Van Loan won York—Simcoe in the 2015 federal election with more than 50 per cent of the vote to the Liberals' almost 38 per cent.

Davidson, a businessman, beat out Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka, a geography professor at Queen's University and the University of Toronto, who also ran for the Liberals in the 2015 electio​n.

In his victory speech, Davidson thanked supporters and told them he is going to Ottawa to be a MP for everyone. He said he is the type of guy who is eager to meet with new constituents face-to-face to hear their concerns.

The breakaway People's Party of Canada, created last summer by Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the byelections. Results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests come the fall.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York—Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won more than 10 per cent of the vote after running on a ""Canadians first"" campaign that was denounced as anti-immigration and racist by some supporters of rival candidates.","Voters cast ballots in Ont., B.C. and Que. byelections tonight",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/byelections-burnaby-south-york-simcoe-outremont-1.5033259

Rankin has been representing Victoria, B.C. since he was first elected in a 2012 byelection. He plans to keep his seat until the end of this Parliament, at which point he says he’s keen to do other things.

""It has been the most rewarding, exciting thing I've ever done, serving as an MP… people writing an 'X' beside your name is something that will live with you forever, "" Rankin told CTVNews.ca ""But I never expected I would do it for the remainder of my career.""

As for what he plans to do next, he was recently appointed by the government of British Columbia to work as the province's representative in treaty renegotiations with the Wet'suwe''en First Nation as the two sides seek to affirm the rights and title of the Wet'suwet'en people.

Rankin worked for the federal government as a treaty negotiator for years, as well as a lawyer for various Indigenous communities and he thinks he is in a good position to understand both sides through this reconciliation process.

""I want to try to make a contribution in my own way,"" Rankin said. This is in addition to his plans to keep up on other legal matters, including the ongoing fight against the Trans Mountain pipeline, which is strongly opposed in his riding.

Rankin shot down any question that his departure has to do with the current state of the NDP, amid low polling numbers and fundraising troubles.

""It's simply not the case,"" Rankin said. ""I think it's time for a fresh look.""

His departure makes it at least a dozen NDP MPs who have announced they will not be running again, some of which have already vacated their seats. He said this wave of departures allows for party ""renewal.""

He said he is optimistic that the party is ""turning around"" now that leader Jagmeet Singh has clinched a seat in the House. Rankin predicted that once Canadians can see him in the Commons the party’s fortunes will ""dramatically improve.""

During his time on Parliament Hill, Rankin has sat on the House Finance Committee, House Health Committee, the special committee tasked with physician-assisted dying, and is a part of the House Justice Committee that is currently probing the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He's also been the NDP House leader, and is the sole and first NDP MP on the top-secret National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

Over the last few months he's been pushing the government to pursue expungements for people with past pot possession charges, and not simply pardons, as Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is poised to table imminently. He has presented a private member's bill to this effect and condemned the Liberals' plan as a ""half-measure."" He said he'll see what the bill that Goodale ends up introducing contains, but he’s planning on being disappointed.

Rankin voiced appreciation for the support of his wife, Linda Hannah, and two adult children during his many years of splitting his time between the West Coast and Ottawa.

He is planning on helping his successor campaign in the fall to try to ensure that his riding stays orange.

439,Empty,2019-02-28T22:46:13Z,"The NDP justice critic has been busy probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, but plans to step down in October","VICTORIA — Victoria MP Murray Rankin took a break Thursday from one of his busiest weeks ever in Ottawa to announce he will not run in this year’s federal election.

The NDP justice critic, who has played a key role in probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, said there’s never a right time to make such a decision.

“Obviously, I wasn’t taking into account in my calculation the serious constitutional crisis that we have right on us,” he said in a telephone interview. “But I will continue to do that (work) until I’m no longer an MP in October.”

Rankin, who was first elected in 2012, said he decided to announce his intentions now to allow for a successor to get nominated and build a profile in the community.

He noted, too, that he’s leaving behind a strong electoral-district association with money in the bank and a team of volunteers.

“So I think I can honestly look myself in the mirror and say that I’m leaving this ship in good shape,” he said.

Finally, he added that the NDP has a bit of “spring in our step” now with new leader Jagmeet Singh winning his seat and a scandal threatening the Liberal government.

“It seemed like it was a good time for me to get on with the rest of my life,” he said.

Rankin, who last year was nominated by his peers for the title of hardest-working parliamentarian, stressed, however, that he has no plans to take things easy.

“I want to let people in Victoria know that I take very seriously representing them,” he said. “I have in the past and that’s not going to change as I step away from the election.

“In an ironic way, I hope I can work harder on some of the issues now because I won’t be involved in knocking on thousands of doors and doing all-candidates meetings.”

Among other things, Rankin said he’ll keep pushing the federal government for money to expand the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. “The province stepped up, the private sector stepped up, and I’m trying desperately hard to get the federal government to contribute.”

In the years ahead, Rankin plans to devote his time to reconciliation efforts with First Nations. “Aside from climate change, I think reconciliation is one of the key challenges of our time.”

A lawyer, who specialized in environmental and aboriginal rights law before becoming an MP, Rankin was recently appointed by the B.C. government as its representative in a reconciliation process with the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs.

“I think it’s an important assignment,” he said. “I’ll be working on behalf of the provincial government. I’m not getting paid for this. I’m simply going to do this because I’m committed to doing it.”

Among the highlights of his career, Rankin cited his role advising government on the legalization of medical assistance in dying and sitting on Parliament’s new intelligence and national security oversight committee. He also pointed to his role opposing the Enbridge pipeline.

At an age when many people retire and hit the golf course, Rankin, 69, said he has no plans to slow down.

“From binners to billionaires, I have met people all across our community, in all walks of life,” he said.

“This job makes you, requires you, to get to know your community like no other position. It’s just a remarkable community. So you know what? I want to keep growing from that, not simply going and retiring to the golf course. That’s not me.”

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October’s election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec’s Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.’s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver’s mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Université de Montreal.

Sign-up at the bottom of the page to get it delivered straight to your inbox.

Please allow us a Mea culpa about yesterday’s edition. We got ahead of ourselves and said former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould would begin testifying Monday before the justice committee reviewing the SNC-Lavalin case. Her first appearance is (or was—see below) expected for today, instead. Very sorry about that.

Singh gets his win: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pulled ahead early in the evening in the Burnaby South byelection and held that lead to the end, clinching 38.5 per cent of the vote. The Liberals came second with 25.8 per cent to the Conservatives’ 22.8 per cent, while the People’s Party took 11.1 per cent. (Results as of midnight ET with 89 per cent of polls reporting.) The win will allow Singh to put some of the questions about his performance as leader behind him as he takes a seat in the House. Meanwhile the Conservatives have got to be hoping the People’s Party just had a fluke of a good night that won’t be replicated across the country come October. (Canadian Press)

Win one, lose one: The NDP lost the byelection in Outremont, Que., the riding previously head by former leader Tom Mulcair, to the Liberals. Meanwhile the Conservatives reclaimed York-Simcoe as expected.

Waiting for Wilson-Raybould: It’s apparent now that Wilson-Raybould won’t be speaking today either. On Monday she sent a letter to the committee stating that, while “anxious” to testify, her testimony might need to be delayed until she and the committee have “as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify. … I would prefer not to schedule my appearance before the Committee until we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.” (CBC News)

Those issues are solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidentiality, and “sub judice,” a parliamentary convention that covers speaking about cases before the courts.

Earlier in the day Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did tell Parliament his government would confirm that Wilson-Raybould “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

And sure enough on Monday night the Liberals issued an order in council authorizing Wilson-Raybould “and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority” to speak to the committee and the federal ethics commissioner. The order waved any solicitor-client privilege that existed and freed her from cabinet confidentiality. However, to safeguard the court case against SNC-Lavalin, Wilson-Raybould is not allowed to testify about anything discussed between her and the Director of Public Prosecutions about the file. (CTV News, Orders in Council)

So the question now is, does that sufficiently meet Wilson-Raybould’s request for an “authoritative statement” before she testifies? When she does speak, it promises to be gripping. In her letter to the committee Wilson-Raybould requested a full 30 minutes to make her opening statement.

The Conservatives tried, and failed, to pass a motion that would have compelled Trudeau to also testify at the justice committee. (CBC News)

With more than half the polls reporting results in Burnaby South, Singh had just over 38 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee's 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin's 22 per cent.

But while victory tightens Singh's shaky grip on the reins of the NDP, the challenge ahead was underscored by the simultaneous loss of the Montreal riding that launched the NDP's orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

In Outremont, Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding's polls reporting results, with the NDP's Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when former NDP leader Tom Mulcair scored an upset byelection victory for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the New Democrats that helped them launch their 2011 sweep of Quebec and vault them into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

The Conservatives, meanwhile, easily hung onto the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe.

Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results, with Liberal Shaun Tanaka taking 31 per cent.

The question now for the NDP is what it will stand for. Until Monday, it was not clear that Singh would remain at the head of his party. Under his leadership, fundraising stagnated and the NDP’s popularity sagged.

To most Canadians, Singh remained invisible. When he did emerge into the spotlight, he too often appeared defensive and ill-prepared. At times he seemed at odds with the party’s federal caucus. He also managed to engage in a feud with virtually the entire Saskatchewan wing of the NDP over an issue — the social awkwardness shown by Regina MP Erin Weir toward women — that was essentially trivial. If Singh had not won the Burnaby South byelection, he would have found it near-impossible to stay on as leader.

At a time when socialism is no longer a dirty word, it also gives the NDP a chance to define itself as a serious left-wing alternative to the Liberals and Conservatives. The NDP’s roots lie in the prairie populism and Fabian socialism of the old Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. But the party has never been entirely comfortable with its socialist antecedents. Nor has it always been at ease with its ties to organized labour.

Article Continued Below

That has made language important. The party tends to avoid terms like “working class” as too Red. It prefers instead to speak of “working families” or “ordinary Canadians” or “everyday families.” For years, the party warred internally over whether to keep the word “socialism” in its constitution. In the end, it settled on a compromise that talked of the party’s “social democratic and democratic socialist traditions.” Under the leadership of Jack Layton and later Thomas Mulcair, the NDP focused on replacing the Liberals as Canada’s centre-left party — and almost succeeded. But the 2015 election, which saw the Liberals under Justin Trudeau successfully feint to the left, demonstrated the key limitation of this strategy: It’s hard to out-Liberal the Liberals. Oddly enough, as the NDP continues to try and avoid sounding too left-wing, socialism has become fashionable again in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., seven contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination — including avowed socialist Bernie Sanders — have signed onto something called the Green New Deal. Among other things, it calls for the federal government to provide a good-paying job to whoever wants one. In Britain, much to the dismay of the right-wing press, young people are attracted to unions, government intervention and old-style democratic socialists like Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. When the LEAP Manifesto, a Canadian precursor of the Green New Deal, came out in 2015, its call for moving immediately to a zero carbon-emission economy was dismissed as utopian. It now seems prescient. Where is Singh in all of this? In his successful 2017 bid for the party leadership, he produced policy papers on standard issues, such as the old age pension. But when speaking, he preferred to focus on broad rhetorical themes like love and courage. During the Burnaby South byelection campaign, he talked of the need for affordable housing, an important issue in Greater Vancouver. Speaking on CBC the day after his victory, he spoke of a policy trifecta: affordable housing, fighting climate change and universal pharmacare. Perhaps this is where the NDP is going in the upcoming election campaign. If so, it will have to square some circles. In particular, it will need to show how it would reinvent Alberta’s entire carbon-based economy in a zero-emission world. It will also, however, have to be bold. The NDP can only get so far by calling Trudeau’s Liberals untrustworthy. It will have to sketch out a compelling but plausible vision of its own. That is the reaffirmed leader’s main task.

Singh may well be looking to turn the page on the past year and a half. Since he was elected in October 2017, his leadership has been marked by poor polling, lacklustre fundraising and a steady trickle of caucus members making their way toward the exit.

But with Monday’s victory, analysts say, Singh has a fresh chance to make a new impression on Canadians, albeit a little later in the game than he’d probably like. “The chatter is over,” B.C. MP Nathan Cullen told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Mr. Singh’s ability to lead this caucus into the next election is 100 per cent secured.”

Still, his problems aren’t all behind him: a few of his heavyweight MPs, including Cullen, have yet to say if they’ll run again in the next election, and he faces a major obstacle in Quebec, where the NDP lost Outremont, the riding held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007, to the Liberals in another byelection on Monday.

But the timing for a fresh start isn’t bad, said former NDP strategist Farouk Karim. Singh will take his place in the House of Commons while the Liberals are mired in the SNC-Lavalin controversy, and as they table their last budget before this year’s election.

“It’s not often in life that you would have a second chance to make that impression,” Karim said. “And he has that opportunity.”

In his victory speech, Singh worked hard to paint Liberals and Conservatives as interested only in helping their “well-connected corporate friends,” while leaving ordinary Canadians in the lurch. “People should be angry at that, angry at governments in Ottawa that continue to develop a system that puts more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands,” he said, pointing to three issues — affordable housing, pharmacare and climate change — that will likely be pillars of the NDP’s election campaign.

Robin MacLachlan, a former NDP strategist, said there’s an opening for Singh while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is “reeling” from the SNC-Lavalin controversy, which he said has damaged Trudeau’s image “as being on the side of ordinary Canadians.”

“He has an opportunity to position himself as the leader who kind of gets what you’re facing,” he said.

With a seat in the House of Commons, Singh will finally have the chance to face off against Trudeau directly, though with little time remaining before the next election. “I would lower expectations. He’s not going to be 100 per cent from the get-go,” said Karim. “But I think if people see an improvement throughout, that will go a long way.”

Cullen said Singh took a risk in deciding to run for a seat in the Burnaby byelection, and it paid off. “I think Canadians are going to look at us in a new way, and I think Mr. Singh’s confidence is going to be boosted,” he said. “I’m looking forward to how he does.”

Arguably the biggest hurdle Singh now faces is Quebec, where the NDP has recently been polling as low as a dismal eight per cent, and nearly all of the party’s seats seem to be under threat. In a separate byelection on Monday, Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan won the Montreal riding of Outremont, which had been a Liberal stronghold until it was taken by Mulcair in 2007 and became a symbol of the party’s gains in that province.

After Bendayan’s victory, Liberals were quick to declare the death of the Orange Wave that swept through Quebec in 2011 and helped propel the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time. “It’s finished,” Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Just look at the results.”

But Singh played down the loss on Monday, saying the party “always knew that Outremont was going to be a tough riding.”

Karim said he was actually “pleasantly surprised” by the Outremont results, which saw NDP candidate Julia Sánchez finish second with 26 per cent of the vote — disappointing, but not catastrophic, according to Karim.

“I think it’s a little hope that the party can build on,” he said. “Twenty-six per cent is far from over, that’s what I would say to the Liberals.”

Singh, clearly recognizing the importance of building his profile in Quebec, said on Monday that he plans to travel to the province next week. Currently, more than a third of the NDP caucus is from Quebec, but several Quebec MPs have said they won’t run again, including Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach, who both made their announcements last week.

MacLachlan said the NDP could attract Quebec voters concerned about climate change, and upset about the Trudeau government’s decision to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline. Karim said the strong third-place showing of the Green Party in Outremont, which finished with 12.5 per cent of the vote, proves that Quebecers “want answers” on the environment.

Outside Quebec, two other high-profile NDP MPs — B.C.’s Cullen and Murray Rankin — have yet to announce whether they’ll run again in this year’s election. So far, 11 of the 44 NDP MPs elected in 2015 have either resigned their seats or have said they won’t seek re-election.

But MacLachlan said Singh’s win should help “consolidate support” for the leader within and outside his caucus. Now, he said, Singh needs to focus on building his profile from inside the House of Commons.

“He needs to reintroduce himself to Canadians,” MacLachlan said. “He’s been absent from the national conversation about policy, and now they’re going to hear from him.”

Just as they were celebrating Jagmeet Singh’s impending entry into the House of Commons after a long 16 months of wandering the land, seatless, Statistics Canada dropped this little gem: It put out new figures showing the Canada Child Benefit introduced by the Trudeau Liberals in mid-2016 is lowering poverty in a significant way. Fully 278,000 fewer children were living below the poverty line in 2017 compared to just two years earlier. That’s big.

What’s the connection? Just this. Once Singh takes his seat in the Commons as NDP leader, following his convincing byelection victory on Monday night, he’ll have to persuade voters on the broad left of the political spectrum to turn away from the Liberals and go with his party. Early signs are that he’ll take the standard NDP approach, arguing the Liberals are in bed with big business and the rich while only the New Democrats are “on your side.” But good luck with that when the facts show the Liberals’ signature social policy is working to lift tens of thousands out of poverty. The national poverty rate dropped more than a full percentage point in a single year, according to StatsCan. New Democrats would be proud to boast such a record, and rightly so.

Article Continued Below

It comes down to how Singh intends to position his party for this fall’s election, now that he’s secured a seat in Parliament. He has to put the stumbles and misstatements that have undermined his leadership behind him and develop a coherent critique of the Liberals. So far the NDP line is that Trudeau & Co. are tools of their corporate cronies, as demonstrated by the 50 meetings secured by SNC-Lavalin and its lobbyists with government officials to avoid a damaging trial on corruption charges. This, says Singh, amounts to “spending time trying to find a way to help his friends avoid the consequences of breaking the law.” If anything, this line of argument suggests the NDP has written off its chances in Quebec, where the survival of SNC-Lavalin and the thousands of jobs associated with it is seen, to put it mildly, as involving a lot more than propping up the undeserving rich. It’s something to see the self-styled party of working people so cavalierly dismiss the importance of protecting the livelihood of thousands of Quebec families. There are other promising issues for New Democrats. Take affordable housing, a pressing concern in Singh’s riding of Burnaby South and other places where property prices have soared out of reach. There, too, the Liberals will compete fiercely. They took steps to cool the hottest housing markets two years ago, and in his pre-election budget Finance Minister Bill Morneau is expected to address the difficulties first-time buyers have in getting into the market.

Voters will be looking for forward-looking solutions. But on Wednesday Singh had this to say to CBC News: “Let’s build houses the way we did in the 1970s or the late ’40s.” It’s clear what he meant: government should invest more in social housing of various kinds. But could there be a more backward-sounding statement, harking back to the approach of four or even seven decades ago? The bottom line is that winning a seat in the Commons is just prologue for Singh and his party. The lights will be all the brighter once he takes his place in Parliament and is expected to put forward a smart, persuasive critique of the government every day. Most important, the NDP has to figure out where its own heart lies and express that in a way that will give voters a distinct choice in October. With the Liberals occupying the centre-left, it’s not obvious how to do that. And the election countdown clock is already ticking loudly.

If you haven’t heard of it yet, the Green New Deal is a political idea to tackle climate change with WWII-scale economic and social mobilization. Named for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal agenda that pulled the United States out of the Great Depression, the Green New Deal has been rapidly picking up steam south of the border. Championed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and now supported by dozens of congressional representatives and senators (along with every major Democratic presidential hopeful), the Green New Deal has become a clarion call for action at the scale and pace of the climate crisis.

But the Green New Deal isn’t just a good idea. With the campaign and organizing savvy of the Sunrise Movement behind it, polling numbers show wide geographic and cross-partisan support (especially among youth). It’s become a winning platform for Democrats and, if they imported it in the right way, it could do the same for Jagmeet Singh and the NDP.

It’s no secret that, in 2015, Justin Trudeau’s success was due, in large measure, to his ability to outflank the NDP on critical progressive issues — including climate change. It’s also true that his majority victory was driven by a dramatic uptick in youth voter turnout — 57.1 percent of eligible 18-24 year olds voted in 2015 compared to 38.8 per cent in 2011 — that largely showed up for the Liberals.

It’s also clear that Canadians, especially young people, want to see more from our federal government when it comes to climate change.

A Mainstreet Research poll released last November found that 76.1 per cent of Canadians accept that climate change is real and caused by human activity, and that nearly 60 per cent of Canadians agree that the government has to solve the issue of climate change even if doing so impacts economic growth.

The good thing about a Green New Deal is that it would create jobs and support working families through a federal jobs guarantee program. Although we don’t have direct polling on such a proposal in Canada, a 2016 Iron & Earth poll found that nearly 70 per cent of energy workers support a time-bound transition to 100 per cent renewable energy in Canada. That same poll found that 80-95 per cent would support government programs to support workers through the transition. Among the general public, these numbers are even higher.

It’s also clear that Canadians are looking for more climate ambition from our government. A recent poll from Abacus Data found just over 50 per cent national support for the carbon tax, despite the fact that almost 60 per cent didn’t think it would lead to significant emissions reductions.

That same poll found that nearly 25 per cent of Canadians think that no federal party leader has the best plan to deal with climate change, and that only five per cent think that Jagmeet Singh’s plan measures up.

Compare this to polling around the Leap Manifesto, arguably the best Canadian blueprint for a Green New Deal. According to a 2016 Ekos poll, nearly 50 per cent of Canadians backed the Leap vision of tackling climate, social and economic justice. And those numbers are even higher among NDP and Liberal party faithful.

All of this adds up to a clear challenge to the NDP to put out a climate plan that acknowledges, as Vox writer David Roberts put it last week, “this is a fucking emergency.” A plan that actually prescribes the kind of massive economic and social mobilization necessary to rise to the challenge.

The good news is that some people within the party already seem to be getting the message. Citing last fall’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report — the one that warns us all that we have just over a decade to get our act together when it comes to climate change — Svend Robinson returned to politics to run against notable Trudeau pipeline apologist Terry Beech in the riding of Burnaby-North Seymour. The second tweet from his campaign account was about a Green New Deal for Canada.

Grassroots activists within the NDP are trying to make sure that Robinson is not alone. Across the country, nomination races are being challenged by young women with bold, ambitious, Green New Deal-esque platforms. In Alberta, Paige Gorsak came within a handful of votes of winning the nomination for Linda Duncan’s former seat. In Ottawa-Center, Graciela Hernandez-Cruz did the same. They may have lost their races, but not by much, and they’ve helped to inspire other candidates like Leah Gazan in Winnipeg-Center and Emma Norton in Dartmouth-Cole Harbour — to put their names forward to bring a bolder, climate and social justice vision to the NDP.

With only eight months until the next federal election, it’s going to take a small miracle for the NDP to right their ship. But, if they want a shot at clawing their way back to federal relevance, they need to call a big shot, and a Green New Deal for Canada is their best chance to do that.",The NDP's only hope is a Green New Deal for Canada,Nationalobserver.com,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/26/opinion/ndps-only-hope-green-new-deal-canada
448,Empty,2019-02-26T04:55:16Z,"With most polls reporting, Singh took Burnaby South with more than 38% of the vote. Had he lost, he would almost certainly have faced demands to resign as leader","OTTAWA — Jagmeet Singh tightened his shaky grip on the reins of the NDP Monday by winning a do-or-die federal byelection in British Columbia.

But the challenge he now faces in reviving the party’s flagging fortunes in time for this fall’s national election was underscored by the NDP’s simultaneous loss to the Liberals in Outremont, the Montreal riding that served as a launching pad for the orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

With most polls reporting, Singh captured Burnaby South with more than 38 per cent of the vote, ahead of the Liberal contender with 26 per cent and the Conservative with 22 per cent.

Had he lost, Singh would almost certainly have faced demands to resign as leader. Going into Monday’s byelection, many New Democrats — including Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair — had questioned how Singh could lead the party in the October federal election if he couldn’t win a seat for himself.

However, the loss of Outremont cast a pall over Singh’s victory celebration.

Lawyer Rachel Bendayan reclaimed the riding for the Liberals with 42 per cent of the vote, even as the governing party struggles with the fallout from allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt criminal proceedings against Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The NDP’s Julia Sanchez captured 27 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when Mulcair scored a byelection upset for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the party in Quebec, from which it eventually went on to sweep the province in 2011 and vault into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

Since those heady days, the party has fallen back to its traditional third-party status. It won just 44 seats in the 2015 election, 16 of them in Quebec. Monday’s loss of Outremont gives credence to polls that suggest the party risks being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

Vancouver NDP MP Jenny Kwan acknowledged the loss of Outremont was “a disappointment.”

“What we’re going to do, of course, is learn from this experience and then we’re going to redouble our efforts to ensure that the people of Quebec know we are there for them,” she said at Singh’s victory party.

In a third byelection Monday, the Conservatives handily hung on to the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, which had been held since 2004 by former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan. Scot Davidson took 53 per cent of the vote for the Tories, well ahead of Liberal Shaun Tanaka with 30 per cent.

There were, however, a couple of potentially bad omens for the Conservatives in Monday’s results.

The breakaway People’s Party of Canada, created last summer by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the byelections and results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests come the fall.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York-Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won more than 11 per cent of the vote after running on a “Canadians first” campaign that was denounced as anti-immigration and racist by some supporters of rival candidates.

And in Outremont, the Conservative candidate ran a distant fifth with just over six per cent of the vote, behind the Liberals, NDP, Greens, and Bloc Quebecois.

The Greens, who’ve watched their vote share increase in a number of other recent byelection contests, came third in Outremont with some 13 per cent of the vote — up 10 points from the 2015 election. However, the party’s vote share was down slightly in York-Simcoe, at less than three per cent. The Greens did not run a candidate in Burnaby South, as a courtesy to Singh.

Singh’s win was all the sweeter for the fact that Burnaby South was not a natural home or a safe seat for a former Ontario provincial politician. New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, now mayor of Vancouver, won the riding by just over 500 votes ahead of the Liberals in 2015.

His victory will give Singh some much-needed visibility in the House of Commons in the run-up to the general election and will help put to rest grumbling within NDP ranks about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

What we’re going to do, of course, is learn from this experience

But his problems go well beyond his low profile on the main stage of federal politics.

Singh has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus discipline.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising results have been dismal. As well, at least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While the Liberals could celebrate victory in Outremont, the party’s vote share dropped by about seven percentage points in each of the other two byelections — at least in part likely due to the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In Burnaby South, the ruling party was likely also hurt by the fact that it dumped its original candidate after she identified Singh as being of “Indian descent” and contrasted herself as the “only” Chinese candidate in a riding with a large Chinese-Canadian population.

Mélanie Joly, the Liberal minister of tourism, official languages and La Francophonie, told reporters in Montreal on Monday night that the NDP byelection loss in Outremont marked the end of the huge surge of NDP support in Quebec that lifted the party to its best-ever election result in 2011. Finance Minister Bill Morneau picked up the theme Tuesday on Parliament Hill, when he told reporters: “It looks fairly like there’s no wave to me. It seems like a fairly flat sea.” The NDP’s Alexandre Boulerice bristled at that analysis.

“It’s over. Jagmeet Singh is our leader. He is our leader in the next federal election, and he will be great in Parliament,” said Boulerice. “It’s a huge victory for the NDP. He’s the first federal leader who is racialized who will sit in the House of Commons. We’re very proud of that.”

Article Continued Below

The potential for disappointment in Quebec has cast a shadow on Singh since the 2017 leadership campaign, when questions were raised about how voters would react to a political leader who openly wears the symbols of his faith in a province where a debate over state secularism continues. Singh spoke briefly in French during his 19-minute victory speech in Burnaby on Monday night, pledging to travel to Quebec next week to deliver a “plan” that will unite left-leaning voters across French and English Canada—a goal he described as “the dream of Jack Layton.” Boulerice said Tuesday that Singh will unveil at least part of the party’s platform for voters in Quebec. But the Outremont defeat on Monday is being scrutinized closely because the province’s importance to the NDP began in that riding in 2007, when Thomas Mulcair won the longtime Liberal fortress for the first time. That win is seen as the precursor to Layton’s “orange wave” in 2011, which saw the party surge to 59 seats in the province. Fifteen of the party’s 40 current MPs now hail from Quebec. Farouk Karim, a former NDP press secretary who is from Montreal, contended Tuesday that the “bittersweet” mixture of Singh’s victory in Burnaby South and NDP candidate Julia Sanchez’s loss in Outremont is “not that bitter.” Sanchez took 26 per cent of the vote, Karim noted, arguing that shows solid support in the face of polls that have put voting intentions for the NDP in single digits across the province. That, combined with his view that the Green candidate’s third-place finish shows a strong desire for environmental action, gives the NDP something a solid foundation in Quebec, Karim said. “It’s not orange-wave level, but it’s not catastrophic either. It’s something to build on,” he said. Christian Bourque, executive vice-president of polling firm Léger, isn’t ready to count the New Democrats out in Quebec either. “The NDP is not dead,” Bourque said. “That was something people were watching out for because their national numbers are quite dismal. But, then again, the issue is the popularity of their leader across the country. As of this morning, he still remains the leader of the NDP.” Indeed, speaking to the Star in B.C., Singh was casting ahead to his arrival on Parliament Hill just before the Liberal government tables an election-year budget on March 19. He said the budget will be an opportunity for him to contrast the NDP’s call for Ottawa to directly build hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units, create universal pharmacare and invest heavily in clean technology with the Liberals’ housing plan and ongoing support—including the $4.4-billion purchase of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline—for fossil-fuel industries. “I want to see some commitments in this budget to make people’s lives better, to make the lives of people in Burnaby South better,” Singh said. “So that’s what we’re going to focus on when I get back into the House, to push this government to deliver something meaningful that will help people out right now.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Rankin said in an interview on Thursday his decision was very difficult, and serving as an MP has been the “most rewarding experience” of his life.

“I’ve got to know so many people in our community,” he said. “I’ve got to know so many great colleagues here in Ottawa in the caucus. One of the great benefits of being an MP is in order to do your job and represent people, you have to know people from all walks of life and I’ve really enjoyed that.”

The 69-year-old also said his choice is about moving to a new chapter in his life and has nothing to do with the NDP’s prospects or Jagmeet Singh’s leadership.

The party has been lagging in popular support and fundraising.

He suggested the New Democrats’ fortunes are “definitely going up,” adding that Singh won his Burnaby South byelection by “significant margins” over both the Liberal and Conservative candidates.

“It looks to me to be a turning point,” he said. “We will have a leader in the House … I think people will be able to see a distinct contrast between us and the Conservatives and Liberals.”

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October’s election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec’s Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.’s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver’s mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal.

Rankin said Thursday he takes pride in work he’s done on issues including fighting for tax fairness and medical assistance in dying and working to ensure Canadians serving jury duty can access psychological supports.

“I hope I’ve made a difference,” Rankin said.

He said his work with the House of Commons justice committee has also been important, suggesting the “constitutional crisis” involving former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will be an issue discussed for many months.

Rankin stressed he will not be working any less until the end of his mandate as MP.

452,Empty,2019-03-02T15:56:09Z,Welcome to your weekly roundup from National Observer.,"Welcome to your weekly roundup from National Observer.



Whatever the outcome of the SNC-Lavalin situation, Canadians got to see some very unusual displays this week.



It is incredibly rare for the media to shine its spotlight so brightly on such an impressive Indigenous woman. Jody Wilson-Raybould radiated dignity, strength and thoughtfulness.



Another reason the country has been transfixed is that it's so unusual to get such a ""graphic demonstration of corporate power in politics.""

As Sandy Garossino put it, ""As with (the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion), the lesson to corporate Canada is that threatening the [government] works.""

There are eerie similarities to the pipeline decision. You may remember National Observer revealed that one day after Texas-based Kinder Morgan lobbied a top public servant, officials altered the review process.



Mike De Souza also reported allegations that the federal decision was rigged after public servants said they had been instructed to ""give cabinet a legally-sound basis for saying 'yes.''""



We have full coverage of all the latest developments in the SNC-Lavalin saga:



SNC-Lavalin overshadowed the other big news in federal politics this week — Jagmeet Singh won a seat in Parliament. Singh ran on a platform of pocketbook issues like affordable housing, coupled with broader issues of climate change and energy. Climate activists were quick to argue that the NDP's best hope is a Green New Deal for Canada.

Some clean energy, lots of oil

Clean energy projects have become shockingly cheap.



Alberta is making progress towards its 2030 target for renewable energy, and the latest project — a solar contract to supply more than half of the Alberta government's needs — came it at an average price of just 4.8 cents per kilowatt hour. Last year, other projects came in at 3.7 cents. Read more in Alberta creeps closer to 2030 renewable energy target.

The federal government wants to copy the U.K.'s successful independent climate watchdog. Carl Meyer reports that the feds are planning to award millions of dollars to create one in Canada.

""McKenna’s office said that such an institute could help fill the void created by the government of former prime minister Stephen Harper when it cancelled funding for the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, or NRTEE, forcing the independent organization to close its doors in 2013.""

The head of that U.K. climate watchdog was in Ottawa this week. He says we need a ""grown up discussion about getting off fossil fuels"" (article for subscribers only).

“Put bluntly, if we are to meet the emissions targets that are implied by the Paris agreement, then we know already that we have too many fossil fuel reserves out there that are recoverable.”

But not everyone in government is focused on climate solutions.



The premiers of Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador called on the Senate to force the Trudeau government to take into account the economic benefits of fossil fuel projects.

The Notley government says it cannot ship the ever-greater amounts of crudeits industry is making available for export, an amount that has more than doubled since 2010.

Meanwhile, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador hopes to usher in a new offshore oil rush. It is looking to permit as many as 140 wells in the North Atlantic and hopes to pump 650,000 barrels of oil per day. One of them, Bay du Nord, would represent the first deepwater drilling site for the provincial industry, plunging over a kilometre down into the ocean.

This comes after the province experienced the largest spill in the history of its offshore industry last fall, when 250,000 litres of oil spilled into the ocean in November.

#ONpoli

In case you missed it, last Friday Fatima Syed reported that the provincial government is shutting a service that helps Ontario citizens fight wealthy developers.

And this week, the Ford government moved to scrap 'restrictions' on development in northern Ontario

Meanwhile, Lisa MacLeod wanted the mother of an autistic child to say the Ford government was 'on the right track'

""... if they've manipulated my quote and then gone and read it making it seem like I wrote that in support of her plan, how many other stories has (MacLeod) read in Queen's Park that are an outright lie or that have been used or manipulated in the wrong way?""



South of the border, our Climate Desk colleagues reported that Pro-Trump billionaires continue to bankroll climate denial.

But let's end on a more promising note. Scientists discovered a giant tortoise in the Galapagos Islands that has not been seen since 1906. The Fernandina giant tortoise was thought to be extinct.

A Chelonoidis phantasticus tortoise is shown at the Galapagos National Park on Santa Cruz Island, in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, on Feb. 20. Photo Credit: Galapagos National Park

""The female tortoise, believed to be more than 100 years old, was found in a patch of vegetation on a remote part of the island of Fernandina. Tracks indicate there may be even more of these tortoises elsewhere.""

“There may be hope,” says Stuart Pimm, a professor of conservation ecology at Duke University.

That's all for this week's roundup but there's lots more over on the main site. Thank you for supporting National Observer and have a great weekend.

Sign-up at the bottom of the page to get it delivered straight to your inbox.

Right from the start of Jody Wilson-Raybould‘s testimony she provided a damning account of what “consistent and sustained” political interference looks like: 10 phone calls and 10 meetings involving 11 people in the PMO, the Privy Council Office and the finance minister’s office.

Unless Liberals offer persuasive evidence that Wilson-Raybould was making the whole thing up, writes Paul Wells, it’s pretty clear “the hucksters and worse” were running the show:

What the former attorney general described tonight is a sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along. If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification? If a Clerk of the Privy Council can claim with a straight face that ten calls and meetings with the attorney general, during which massive job loss, an angry PM and a lost election are threatened, don’t constitute interference, then what on earth would interference look like? Tonight I talked with two former public servants whose records rival Michael Wernick’s. Both were flat astonished that he seems not to have pushed back against this deeply disturbing, and plainly widespread, behaviour. (Maclean’s)

After hearing Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign, saying the Prime Minister has “lost the moral authority to govern.” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh didn’t go that far, but said an independent inquiry is needed. (Canadian Press, Scheer’s statement)

Trudeau fires back: The Prime Minister stated again that nothing anyone said to Wilson-Raybould constituted pressure and that she always had the final say on the SNC-Lavalin file. And he said no one from his office will be resigning: “I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally. I therefore completely disagree with the former attorney general’s characterization of events.” (CTV News, video)

On four occasions Trudeau, his aides and even Canada’s top civil servant played the “election” card to try to get Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the case against SNC-Lavalin. (Maclean’s)

Here’s just a snippet from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony:

The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise – the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA – he said “there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders” … “they will likely be moving to London if this happens”… “and there is an election in Quebec soon”… At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau”. I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.”

454,Empty,2019-02-28T21:30:20Z,His decision brings to 12 the number of NDP MPs elected in 2015 who aren’t running again,"OTTAWA — The federal NDP is losing another member of its team just days after Leader Jagmeet Singh finally won a seat in the House of Commons in a make-or-break byelection.

B.C. MP Murray Rankin, the party’s justice critic and one of its senior caucus members, announced Thursday that he won’t seek re-election this year. His decision brings to 12 the number of NDP MPs elected in 2015 who aren’t running again — more than a quarter of the caucus.

“After about seven years, I think it’s time for a fresh voice,” he told the National Post in an interview. “It’s been the most exciting and rewarding thing I’ve ever done, working as an MP … But in terms of my life, I think it’s time to let someone else take the reins and I think this is a good time to do it.”

Rankin said he “absolutely” supports Singh’s leadership, and said he hopes the party is on an “upward incline” since Singh won the Burnaby South byelection on Monday with 39 per cent of the vote.

“We had, I think, a very significant turnaround in the NDP fortunes when the leader won so convincingly in Burnaby South,” he said. “I think a lot of Canadians are now going to say we have a leader … who connects well with voters. We just have to get him into the House and get him better known by Canadians.”

After about seven years, I think it’s time for a fresh voice

Rankin, a lawyer who previously worked as a treaty negotiator for the province of B.C., was elected as the MP for Victoria in a 2012 byelection. He is the party’s justice critic and co-chair of the House of Commons justice committee, which is currently investigating allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a deal with engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Rankin suggested the SNC-Lavalin controversy presents an opportunity for the NDP. “We have a situation unfolding in Ottawa that is going to give a lot of Canadians pause about the nature of the Liberal government, the government they thought was going to be a very different government,” he said.

In 2017, Rankin was also named to the national security committee of parliamentarians, tasked with overseeing Canada’s security and intelligence agencies.

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have decided not to seek another term. Of the 44 MPs elected in 2015, 12 have now announced they won’t run again, including Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Alberta’s lone NDP MP, Linda Duncan. A few more caucus members have yet to make their decisions public, including senior B.C. MP Nathan Cullen.

Singh has faced major hurdles since he won the party leadership in October 2017, including poor fundraising numbers and disappointing byelection results. Initially claiming he was comfortable without a seat in the House of Commons, he eventually changed his mind and decided to run in Burnaby. But his victory there was tempered by the loss of the Montreal riding of Outremont in a separate byelection on the same day, a seat held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007.

Rankin said it can be a “hard slog” for opposition MPs trying to make an impact in Ottawa. “The lot of an opposition politician isn’t always a happy one,” he said. “We do make differences … but sometimes being in an opposition role is not always gratifying.”

Rankin was recently appointed by the B.C. government as its representative to help guide talks in a new reconciliation process with the hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en nation, whose opposition to a proposed natural gas pipeline through their traditional territory led to a showdown with the RCMP in January. He has accepted the position without pay.

“I simply want to do other things after this amount of time,” he said. “I think a lot of people would realize that going back and forth to Ottawa regularly, nine hours door-to-door, isn’t the most joyful experience, and maybe I can do other things at this stage of my career.”

455,Empty,2019-02-27T01:50:00Z,"With the election looming and the party’s poll numbers and fundraising in the tank, the NDP leader's first challenge is to prove that he can lead.","Jagmeet Singh won his seat in the House of Commons the old-fashioned way with shoe leather and a populist message that might have made Tommy Douglas proud.

The federal NDP leader knocked on thousands of doors with a message that spoke to the economic anxieties and fears of many in the Burnaby South riding worried about housing affordability and the dearth of well-paid jobs.

His win was decisive, with nearly 3,000 votes more than the second-place Liberal and nearly 3,700 more than the Conservatives who might have done better had the People’s Party of Canada not hived off 2,420 votes.

The celebration was exuberant, with Singh leading his supporters in the dancing and singing. It was a historic win.

On March 18, Singh will take his seat in the House of Commons as the first, non-white leader of a national party.

“Growing up, I could never have imagined that someone like me would be running to be prime minister,” he said after his win. “We’ve just told a lot of kids out there that ‘yes, you can.’ ”

As Singh acknowledged Monday night, the celebration was only a brief respite before much bigger challenges ahead in the eight months until the Oct. 25 federal election.

With race and ethnicity constant topics even in Burnaby South — one of the most diverse ridings in the country — he’s likely to face much more of it in places like vote-rich Quebec, where the NDP lost a seat in one of the other two byelections Monday.

In Quebec, for example, the turban-wearing leader is likely to butt up against concerns about both displays of religious symbols and about immigration weakening its unique culture and language.

With the election looming and the party’s poll numbers and fundraising in the tank, Singh’s first challenge is to prove that he can lead.

Having stumbled several times when he’s forced off his tightly scripted message, Singh needs to prove both in the House and in daily scrums that he has a firm command of the issues.

His first test will be March 19, his second day in the house. That’s the day the Liberals’ deliver their pre-election budget and Singh will have to respond both in the chamber and outside.

The second challenge is Singh’s environmental policy. He’s called for tougher carbon emissions’ targets, a swift transition to a green economy and he’s opposed expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline that terminates in Burnaby. Yet, Singh supports the northern B.C. LNG project, which some opponents describe as a “carbon bomb” that blows up the province’s climate-change commitments.

Even if it is contradictory, it seems to have resonated with Burnaby voters, who didn’t have the choice of a Green candidate in the byelection.

But Singh has alienated New Democrats and others in Alberta and Saskatchewan, as well as union leaders and their members whose jobs are tightly tied to a carbon and have the most to lose — or at least, the most to fear — since no one can guarantee of a smooth transition to a “green economy.”

Singh has downplayed criticism of his leadership, calling it “disrespectful to the opportunity that I have to make a difference in people’s lives to worry about my own situation.”

As a brown person growing up in a white culture and facing obstacles because of that, Singh told me, “You either become very cynical or you become very optimistic. I’ve become very optimistic.

“I always believe there are ways to get through, to push forward. I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic, but I’m more so a hopeless optimist.”

It’s a sharp contrast to the negative messaging of some other politicians. So too is his commitment to social justice. He learned it from his mother, and then committed to it after being initiated into the Sikh faith as a teenager.

“There’s a meditation that Sikhs do that calls for the betterment of all, and it’s not all Sikhs, it’s all as in everything — all people, animals and the environment. The betterment of all,” he said.

“There’s a nobility to the idea of wanting to pursue justice for all … I thought it was worth taking up the challenge to fight for a better world,”

It’s that mix of optimism and candour that’s appealing to millennials and idealists.

It’s why Winnipeg city councillor Jason Schreyer and his wife, Sarah, spent the last week campaigning in Burnaby South.

The son of former Manitoba premier and governor general Ed Scheyer, Jason was one of several New Democrats who talked to me Monday night about how Singh’s message has reinvigorated them.

But Singh has a hard road ahead. In an Angus Reid poll released Tuesday, Singh had the lowest rating of the three leaders, with 66 per cent saying they had an unfavourable view of him.

Still, Singh isn’t the only leader with challenges.

Because of the SNC-Lavalin affair, Justin Trudeau’s popularity has fallen, with 60 per cent of Canadians saying they have an unfavourable impression of him. And while the Liberals now trail the Conservatives by seven percentage points, 54 per cent of Canadians hold unfavourable view of the their leader Andrew Scheer.

Whether Singh can translate the enthusiasm from the hothouse of a byelection campaign into a national one remains to be seen. But the byelection win has at least given him a chance to try.

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

Daniel Otis , CTVNews.ca Staff





Prominent NDP MP Nathan Cullen will not be seeking re-election, becoming the 13th member of his party to make such an announcement.

“Before every election -- I’ve been in five of them -- before we go in my family and I always sit down and talk about whether we want to do this,” Cullen told CTV News Channel Friday evening from his home in Smithers, B.C. “I felt that representing this place and also trying to do my work in Parliament as well as having a young family, it was kind of unsustainable, actually. And it felt like this was the right time to go.”

Cullen, who represents the federal riding of Skeena-Bulkley Valley in northwestern B.C., made the surprise announcement Friday afternoon along the snowy banks of the Bulkley River in Smithers.

“From the advancement of Indigenous rights and title to the protection of our rivers and coasts, from fighting for better jobs to demanding more accountability in our government, these past 15 years have been a great adventure and challenge,” Cullen said in a statement. “I have experienced this work as a powerful vocation and calling, and I have given it my full heart and mind.”

Cullen was first elected to the House of Commons in 2004 and currently serves as the NDP’s critic for democratic reform. In 2012, he placed third in his party’s race to replace its late leader, Jack Layton.

“It’s real mixed feelings today,” Cullen added in his CTV interview. “I love this work, I love being able to represent this place, and yet I also know for me and where I’m at right now that this is the right decision.”

Cullen joins a growing list of NDP MPs not seeking re-election this year, including fellow B.C. MPs Murray Rankin, Kennedy Stewart, Sheila Malcolmson and Fin Donnelly, Alberta’s Linda Duncan, Ontario’s Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, and Quebec’s Tom Mulcair, Helene Laverdiere, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet, Anne Minh-Thu Quach and Romeo Saganash.

Despite not seeking re-election, Cullen has vowed to help the NDP and leader Jagmeet Singh in their upcoming campaign.

“We need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” Health Minister Christine Elliott said.

Elliott pointed to the thousands of people waiting for long-term care every day or the 1,200 people who receive care in hospital hallways.

“What we are doing is centring care around the patient, that is the most important consideration,” Elliott told reporters after question period at Queen’s Park.

“We have to do better and we will do better.”

The plan will apparently scrap the Local Health Integration Networks that increased bureaucracy across the system but did not deliver the health-care coordination promised.

In place of the LHINs will be a centralized “Super Agency” to coordinate care.

Meanwhile, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath was blasting the government’s plans before they were announced.

The Liberals made a mess of our health-care system. They created a …health-care system that people couldn’t rely on, where we had hallway medicine across the province” Horwath said.

But the NDP said the that Ford government is taking the province in a worse direction.

“We are waiting to see the legislation, but I’ll tell you this,” Horwath added. “It better have closed the loopholes that allows the province to belly up to our health-care dollars and it better close the loophole to this super agency.”

Deputy minister Nancy Naylor sent boards a memo Thursday noting that the government implemented a hiring freeze in June and that school boards may wish to institute similar measures.

When that public service hiring freeze was instituted, the government said it didn’t apply to front-line staff such as police and fire services, and Premier Doug Ford said it also didn’t apply to nurses or teachers.

Naylor advised the boards this week to defer filling vacancies for retirements and other leaves for teachers and other staff until the minister gives them an update by March 15.

“I am writing to you today to recommend that school boards exercise prudence in making hiring decisions in light of the upcoming Ontario budget and the recent consultation on class size and hiring practices,” she wrote in the memo.

The consultations launched in January contemplate the possibility of removing class size caps for kindergarten and primary grades.

NDP education critic Marit Stiles suggested the promise of an “update” by March 15 is ominous.

“The Conservatives, I believe, have just put families on notice that deep cuts are coming to their children’s education,” she said.

The push is coming from public-health advocates and from at least one Liberal MP, Toronto's Nathaniel Erksine-Smith.

article continues below

""One of my constituents lost her nephew to the opioid crisis because of fentanyl and the lack of a safe supply,"" he said. ""If we want to save lives, we know that thousands of Canadians are dying because of an unsafe supply. If we want to save lives, we need to make that supply safe.""

Public-health experts are also advocating for removing of criminal sanctions for possession of small quantities of opioids to help to reduce stigma in seeking treatment, Erksine-Smith added.

British Columbia's provincial health officer has called for Ottawa to look at ways of supplying safer opioid drugs, saying B.C. and other parts of the country are grappling with a poisonous street-drug supply that is killing people because they can't tell what's in the drugs they use.

Richard Elliott, the executive director of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, said it is necessary to address the toxicity of the drug supply to ultimately reduce the number of deaths.

His organization was part of a Canadian coalition that called on the government last fall to address the issue of supply, pointing to toxicology results from across Canada that reveal opioids purchased in the illegal market are often contaminated with fentanyl and its analogues. Those can be much more potent than the opioids users believe they are consuming, and the difference between an ordinary dose and a lethal one is tiny.

""When you are in an emergency and the stuff you can get illegally is largely contaminated and may kill you even if you are seeking to be safe, as most people are, then we need to figure out, 'OK, how do we substitute something safer for you to use instead of what you're currently purchasing on the street and that is killing too many people,' "" Elliott said in an interview this week.

The opioid crisis is affecting every community in every province and territory, said NDP health critic Don Davies, adding that Canadians understand that people are losing their lives as a result of ""poison street supply.""

""Nobody is advocating drug use,"" he said. ""But as a public-policy response, they recognize that at least if we can control the supply, we can keep people alive and that's a better public-policy approach than letting them die in the streets or alone in their homes.""

Davies said he shares the concern of advocates who recently expressed concern that the federal Liberals won't want to address the issue in an election year.

Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said she asked her department to explore options to address the toxic supply in the fall, adding she looks forward to seeing advice from Canada's top public-health doctor Theresa Tam on how to move forward.

""When we've consulted with many stakeholders, professionals and also individuals that use drugs, they've indicated the issue of safe supply is something we should really be looking at,"" Petitpas Taylor said. ""That's exactly what we are doing.""

In a December interview, Tam told The Canadian Press that said clamping down on the market-driven supply of illicit drugs is not easy.

""I think my plea is an escalated, compassionate response,"" she said. ""To implement a lot of these measures, you need society to be on side.""

Tam's comments came after the Public Health Agency show that 94 per cent of opioid-related deaths in 2019 were classified as ""accidental poisonings.""

Nearly 72 per cent were unintentional deaths involving highly toxic fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.

Elizabeth May says the NDP government’s “Keep Canada Working” campaign centered around the controversial pipeline project is misleading.

“Canadians deserve to know the facts about the cost of the Kinder Morgan pipeline,” May said.

“The Notley government’s ‘Keep Canada Working’ ads exaggerate the economic benefits and hide the many risks. This pipeline is a liability any way you look at it.”

May said the Trans Mountain pipeline will create 90 permanent jobs, not thousands of jobs as indicated by the Alberta government.

“The delay to the Kinder Morgan pipeline costs the country of Canada about $40 million a day and there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said last April.

Alberta’s NDP government said the expansion will help sustain good paying jobs for thousands of Canadians.

“The Conference Board of Canada has estimated that the project would result in 37,000 jobs across Canada,” a government statement to Global News read.

“Fifteen-thousand new jobs will be created during project construction. Thirteen-hundred annual full-time marine sector jobs will be created during operation.”

Trans Mountain said there were 2,000 people working on the pipeline before the Federal Court of Appeal struck down the project’s original approval last summer, citing issues over the impact on marine life and Indigenous consultation.

The company said it expected the project would employ 5,000 workers by the middle of the year had it not been postponed.

The Green Party leader also suggested the safest way to transport bitumen is as a solid by rail rather than by pipeline.

“The only way to transport bitumen, which is a solid, through a pipeline is mixing it with a toxic diluent,” the party’s statement read. “When that mixture spills it’s impossible to clean up.”

“I am often asked: ‘Doesn’t Canada have truth in advertising laws?’ We do, but the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards doesn’t apply to government paid advertising for political issues,” May said. “The Alberta ad campaign demonstrates that it should.”

On Feb. 19, Notley announced the province was spending $3.7 billion to move landlocked oil to market by rail.

The province said transporting oil by rail cars is more expensive, less efficient and less environmentally-friendly than by pipeline.

“We could be getting so much more out of our products then we do, but instead, we are forced to curtail production and lease rail cars to move our product,” a government statement read.

READ MORE: Notley cautiously calls NEB Trans Mountain decision a step in the right direction

Last week, the National Energy Board conditionally approved the Trans Mountain expansion and made 16 new recommendations to the Governor in Council.

The NEB said the project could cause environmental harm but that the benefits of the pipeline outweigh the effects.

“We’re pleased that we got a recommendation to the federal cabinet and that we can hopefully see them move forward in a timely way,” Notley said.

Notley said she is not expecting the federal cabinet to approve the pipeline before the next provincial election, which by law has to happen before the end of May.

The Trans Mountain expansion would triple the amount of oil flowing from Alberta to the B.C. coast for export to overseas markets.

READ MORE: ‘This is B.C. vs. Canada’: Alberta has spent $23M on Keep Canada Working campaign

According to documents obtained by Global News, Keep Canada Working is a national advertising campaign with multiple messaging arms for different parts of the country.

In January, the province told Global News $23.4 million had been spent on the Keep Canada Working campaign out the total budget of $31 campaign committed to the campaign.

The money is going towards television, radio, print, online and billboard ads that tout the Trans Mountain Pipeline as a project that would boost Canada’s economy and create jobs.

The Alberta government said the campaign is having an impact.

“Before the campaign started roughly four in 10 Canadians agreed that we need new pipelines. Now that number is almost seven in 10,” the province’s statement read.

“We continue to see more news confirming increased awareness of the topic and that the vast majority of Canadians agree our lack of pipelines is a crisis and we need to get pipelines built.

Cullen has served in a number of roles since his election, including Opposition House leader and critic for finance, natural resources and youth. He ran for the NDP leadership in 2012, finishing in third place.

He has been a harsh critic of the Liberal government's failed promise to bring in electoral reform.

NDP MP Nathan Cullen joined Power & Politics Friday to discuss his decision not to run for re-election in the fall. 4:49

Cullen said before he was elected, he promised himself that when he left politics it would be with his family, health and integrity intact.

""Thank you to the people of the northwest for keeping me ground in this promise,"" he said.

Cullen wished his colleagues and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh the ""very best"" in the next election.

And that makes them vulnerable to being reversed by a future government, he says.

On Friday, Goodale said the Liberals are planning to offer people with records for simple possession of marijuana a version of the pardon process available to any offender, with two differences.

READ MORE: How far should Canada go to erase cannabis convictions?

First, the process would be free, instead of costing $631. Also, it could be applied for immediately. An offender can normally only ask to be pardoned at least five years after any sentence has ended (or 10 years for serious crimes).

The bill was scheduled to be introduced in the Commons on Friday.

The only people who will be eligible are those with a record only for simple possession, and nothing else.

WATCH: Petition calling for pot pardons



A pardon, or “record suspension” sets the offence aside, but doesn’t erase it. The pardon can be reversed if the person is convicted of new crimes or is “found to no longer be of good conduct.”

“I think it’s a step in the right direction, but unfortunately does not go far enough.,” says University of Toronto professor Akwasi Owusu-Bempah.

READ MORE: If RCMP can’t say how many Canadians have minor pot convictions, how will amnesty erase records?

“The practical consequence is that they still could be accessed by some levels of government or law enforcement agencies. They may appear in court. And most importantly, they could be reversed. The most practical thing is that it’s still there.”

Last October, NDP MP Murray Rankin introduced a private member’s bill that would “expunge,” or completely erase, old possession convictions.

That process would be similar to the one the government followed with historic same-sex offences, where people can apply to have a record permanently erased if the acts were consensual. Owusu-Bempah favours this approach.

“Expungement is the government acknowledging that a behaviour never should have been criminalized in the first place. Whereas a pardon or record suspension is forgiving someone for having done something wrong.”

READ MORE: Why a Canadian marijuana possession amnesty is harder to implement than it sounds

Most importantly, Owusu-Bempah says, expungement protects people against a future government that might want to reverse the amnesty.

“If another government were to come in and decide that the record suspension never should have been implemented in the first place, and that cannabis legalization should not have come about, that could also be reversed.”

Destroying the records makes that impossible, much as the destruction of the long gun registry in 2012 made it difficult for a new government to reconstruct it.

In a comment sent Friday evening, a spokes​person in Goodale’s office called the concern “alarmist and uninformed.”

“Attempts to revoke (the record suspensions) would be met by vigorous court challenges that would almost certainly succeed,” Scott Bardsley wrote in an e-mail.

READ MORE: 6,000 Canadians would be covered by gay pardon decision

Goodale explained last October that the government saw same-sex convictions as a “fundamental injustice” in a way that marijuana possession convictions weren’t.

“The laws with respect to cannabis that have existed historically we believe are out of step with current mores and views in Canada but are not of the same nature as the historic social injustice that was imposed in relation to the LGBTQ2 community,” he said.

“The difference here is the nature of the offence.”

Conservative public safety critic Pierre Paul-Hus’s office said they would comment after the text of the bill had been published.

It’s not clear how many Canadians have a record for possession of marijuana, since some were convicted under a generic drug charge that doesn’t specify the drug involved. However, advocates claim about half a million people are affected.

However, if officials have to individually investigate each case to see if it involved marijuana or some other drug, it would greatly complicate the process. San Francisco recently deleted over 8,000 marijuana convictions going back to 1975.

Shawn Jeffords and Allison Jones, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Ontario is consolidating its local and provincial health networks to create a central agency as part of a system overhaul, the health minister announced Tuesday, though she wouldn't say if the move will save money or lead to job losses.

Legislation introduced Tuesday would create a new agency, called Ontario Health, to consolidate the 14 local health integration networks, Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and several other agencies. The system transformation, including establishing local health teams to co-ordinate care, will take years, Health Minister Christine Elliott said.

""Too much time and attention is spent on maintaining a siloed and fragmented system, and far too many people believe it is the patient's or the family's job to navigate this complicated system during what is already one of the most traumatic and stress-filled periods in their lives,"" Elliott said. ""That is just wrong.""

Background materials from the government say that each of the agencies being rolled into Ontario Health has a full senior management team and administrative support, ""and over time some of this work has become duplicative.""

The ""duplicative"" work refers to some of the administrative functions, Elliott stressed, but she said those services will be required in the new local health teams, too.

""I think we have to look at this as a rearrangement, but rearranged around the patient,"" she said. ""This is not a financial exercise.""

When asked how many staff would lose their jobs as a result of the reorganization, the minister said that is something she can't answer right now.

""We promised that we would put more people on the front line in health-care services, and that's what we intend to do so that there are people who are working in the LHINs, for example, right now who provide wonderful home care,"" Elliott said. ""We will still need them. Nothing's going to change that way. People will still need home care. We want to make sure that we can amplify those home care numbers. So, in the end, it will work out.""

Elliott didn't say if the government expects to save money through the agency consolidation, but noted Ontario spends 42 cents of every dollar on health care, and studies show the province isn't getting good value for it.

The other agencies being rolled into Ontario Health are Health Quality Ontario, Trillium Gift of Life Network, Health Shared Services Ontario, and HealthForce Ontario Marketing and Recruitment Agency.

As well, Ontario Health Teams will be established to provide what Elliott called seamless access to health services, including primary care, hospitals, home and community care, palliative care, residential long-term care, and mental health and addictions services.

The teams would be responsible for delivering all of the care for their patients and connecting them to services. Elliott said the goal is to have 30 to 50 health teams set up, each responsible for up to 300,000 people. It won't change how patients go to the doctor, Elliott said.

A group of providers will come together -- for example a hospital, a local nurse practitioner clinic and a mental health team -- and will be responsible fiscally and for the delivery of care to everyone within the geographic area, Elliott said. The health teams will be given a lot of flexibility in how they operate to allow for local variation, officials said.

People will still be able to choose who provides their care, and more choices will be available through technology, Elliot said, such as giving patients an option to securely access their electronic health records and virtual care options.

""Imagine, we can book appointments online,"" Elliott said. ""We have access to our own health-care record.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she fears the changes will open the door to greater privatization of services.

""This morning's press conference did not allay our concerns about opening up our public health care system to private, for profit, motivated corporations,"" she said.

The Ontario Health Coalition said it would fight any attempt to privatize the public non-profit health services, while the Canadian Union of Public Employees said it will begin escalating actions across the province to push the government to reconsider the changes.

""This dangerous Ford government reboot of our public health system must be stopped before patient care and safety fall victim to the gaps, holes and pitfalls this massive overhaul will create,"" said CUPE Ontario President Fred Hahn.

But the changes had some supporters in the health care sector, including the associations representing the province's doctors, registered nurses and hospitals.

Dr. Nadia Alam, president of the Ontario Medical Association, welcomed the proposed changes, saying patients are currently struggling to get the care that they need.

""If we can do anything to make that easier it's a good day,"" she said.

Anthony Dale, the CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association, said a broader view of the health-care system will help address overcrowding and help break down barriers that exist between care providers in the health-care system.

""One in six hospital beds are occupied by someone who needs to be in long-term care or at home or assisted living,"" he said. ""It's a system wildly out of balance.""

The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario said they're optimistic that the government plan will divert money from middle management in the health bureaucracy to front line care.

""I think some of those organizations, quite frankly, have ballooned in terms of staffing,"" said CEO Doris Grinspun. ""I think what they need is a very clear mandate.""","Province unveils new 'Ontario Health' super agency, co-ordinated health teams - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/province-unveils-new-ontario-health-super-agency-co-ordinated-health-teams-1.4312887

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Shortly after becoming Premier, Doug Ford demanded changes to his Ontario Provincial Police security detail because he didn’t trust the rotating cast of officers, according to newly disclosed court records.

Internal police e-mails filed in Ontario Divisional Court also show that the Premier’s office was interested in retrofitting a van for his travels, relaying a $50,000 cost estimate to the OPP.

Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair submitted the internal e-mails to bolster his claim that Mr. Ford and his office have interfered in police operations. The senior officer is asking the courts to order the province’s Ombudsman to review the hiring of Mr. Ford’s friend, Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, as the next OPP Commissioner.

Story continues below advertisement

Deputy Commissioner Blair, who was also a front-runner for the position, went public with his concerns in December, alleging that “inappropriate political interference or cronyism” could impact OPP operations. In his filings and correspondence, he alleged the Premier’s office directed a sole-sourced “off-the-books” request for the OPP to refit an executive van for the Premier’s use. He further alleged the Premier relayed to police that he wanted a meeting with then-OPP Commissioner Vince Hawkes to ask him to replace a rotating security detail for Mr. Ford with permanent bodyguards, and if not, ""perhaps a new Commissioner would.”

Deputy Commissioner’s Blair’s most recent court filings, made on Feb. 15, include internal e-mails about Mr. Ford’s concerns and an estimate for the van overhaul. The Premier’s office says, however, he should not be accessing those records and making them public.

“It is extremely troubling that Mr. Blair is apparently using his office to obtain confidential information and documentation and then filing such documents in a public court record to further his own personal agenda in the court process he himself initiated,” said Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for the Premier.

In an e-mail to The Globe, the spokesman added that the allegations about off-the-books purchase requests by the Premier’s office “are a complete fabrication by Mr. Blair and are categorically false.”

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak released a statement saying the van proposal is “wildly inappropriate"" when the government is implementing budget cuts elsewhere. ""It’s the gravy train for Ford, and cuts for everyone else.”

The OPP e-mails filed in court show that in mid-July, just a few weeks after the Progressive Conservative government had taken power, Mr. Ford expressed concern about his shifting cast of police-assigned bodyguards. In an e-mail to his supervisor, an officer assigned to Mr. Ford relayed the Premier’s displeasure as he prepared to travel to a first ministers meeting.

“[W]hat ... is going on? I’m going to Moncton with 3 officers I don’t know. This is too much. ... I keep getting new people in the truck. I just want my own protection team,” Sergeant Terrance Murphy wrote what Mr. Ford told him after he picked him up to go to the airport. He reported the Premier saying he had no faith in newly assigned bodyguards.

“I have not formed the trust with them. I have asked for my own detail of officers who I trust already. It feels like I’m not being heard, like I’m getting f***ed around by the OPP, and I’m getting more pissed off,” the e-mail reads.

“I’m going to call the Commissioner and sort this out,” the Premier then said, according to the e-mail.

In the July e-mail exchange, the police officer quotes Mr. Ford as saying he wanted to meet the then-OPP Commissioner “so he can see how serious I am about this. If he can’t sort this out, then maybe a new Commissioner can make it happen.”

The Premier’s office defended Mr. Ford’s request and again took issue with the release of internal e-mails related to security.

“These types of requests are made by politicians of all stripes, at both the federal and provincial levels of government,” said Mr. Jefferies. “Internal police reports are by definition, in our opinion, highly confidential documents.”

The Globe and Mail reported this week a senior government official warned Deputy Commissioner Blair in December about publicly disclosing any more sensitive OPP materials as part of his court bid.

Story continues below advertisement

The OPP e-mail exchanges filed in court further reveal that on Nov. 21, when the hunt for a new commissioner was concluding, the OPP received an e-mailed cost estimate of $50,696 for the interior redesign of an executive van for the Premier’s potential use.

A Mississauga company called A1 Mobility had provided this estimate – which involved installing WiFi, leather seats, a mini-fridge, a couch and a TV – to an executive assistant in the Premier’s office, who in turn relayed it to the police force.

Deputy Commissioner Blair has alleged in court documents that this cost estimate was relayed in a potential contravention of police procurement policies. The Premier’s office says these assertions are “categorically false.”

“As has been repeatedly stated by the Premier, he requested the OPP look into the possibility of obtaining a cost-effective used van for purposes of working and travelling the province,” said Mr. Jefferies. “The e-mails sent to the OPP from a member of the Premier’s Office staff are not an official procurement of a van, instead they are a cost estimate and reveal an effort to minimize expense.”

Mr. Jefferies said the retrofit has not happened. OPP Staff Sergeant Carolle Dionne said the police force would not comment about matters that are being litigated, including what happened to van-retrofit request that was received by the OPP.","Doug Ford demanded changes to his OPP security detail, according to court filings - The Globe and Mail",The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-doug-ford-demanded-changes-to-his-opp-security-detail-according-to/

Ford banned the media after the Star revealed lobbyists had been enlisted to sell tickets to Wednesday’s event, which attracted 3,200 people who paid $1,250 each to attend the posh dinner.

Government House Leader Todd Smith dismissed opposition criticism of a decision by the Progressive Conservatives to ban media from a fundraising dinner Wednesday night. “It was open to everyone who wanted to buy a ticket, and then it was open to everyone via livestream,” he said.

Journalists are typically allowed to cover premiers’ major fundraisers, but leave immediately after the speech and before the meal is served. Stung by the fallout after it emerged government lobbyists had been conscripted to hawk tickets, Ford closed the Toronto Congress Centre event to reporters, who were only able to cover his remarks using a Tory-supplied livestream. Opposition parties say the premier was clearly trying to conceal who was there.

“When you’re banning the media, it’s obvious that you have something to hide,” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Thursday. Interim Liberal Leader John Fraser told reporters that Ford “didn’t want you to see who was there last night.” “That was what this was about. I can remember our big fundraising dinners, (the media were) always invited for the speech,” said Fraser. “It’s an event with 3,200 people — it’s a big speech ... so why would you not be there? He probably didn’t want you to talk to who was there,” he said. Green Leader Mike Schreiner said by preventing the media from covering the event in person, Ford, whose campaign slogan is “for the people,” was doing the public a disservice.

“I just want to know what the premier is trying to hide. Did he not want the media to know which corporate lobbyist sold the most tickets? Which deep-pocketed insiders have the most access to the premier?” said Schreiner. While Ford was not in the legislature on Thursday, he sent a thank-you email to supporters.

“Last night was incredible. Nobody has ever raised as much money as we did last night. Nobody has ever hit the number of donors we did,” the premier wrote. “There can be no doubt we’re going to get this job done. From the bottom of my heart ... thank you,” he concluded, signing his missive “Doug.” Under fire from the New Democrats in the legislature, government house leader Todd Smith defended Ford’s move to close the dinner to the media. “It was an excellent night last night. It was open to everyone who wanted to buy a ticket, and then it was open to everyone via livestream last night,” said Smith, suggesting NDP MPP Taras Natyshak was jealous of the Tories. “When it comes to fundraising, our party is doing exceptionally well. I can understand why he’s turning red in the face or green with envy. It’s because they’re not raising anything. You know why? People aren’t buying what they’re selling. They’re buying what we’re selling,” he said. Natyshak (Essex) said Ontarians should be alarmed by the “disturbing edicts” from Ford. “Media reports in the Toronto Star today indicate that some unusual edicts have been coming out of the premier’s office. Desperate to sell tickets, the premier’s office allegedly ordered lobbyists to sell tickets to clients under threat of losing access to this government,” he said. “Late yesterday, the order banning journalists from the evening’s festivities also came out of the premier’s office.” Robert Benzie is the Star's Queen's Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale tweeted Wednesday that he intends to give notice to introduce ""a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis,"" following up on promise made in October.

According to parliamentary procedure, a member must give 48 hours written notice before introducing legislation in the House of Commons.

A spokesperson for the minister said that means that bill could be tabled as early as Friday.

Later today, I will give notice to introduce a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis. —@RalphGoodale

The Liberal government first signalled its plans to waive the fee and waiting period for Canadians seeking a pardon for a past conviction for simple pot possession the day recreational marijuana was legalized last year.

As it stands, the fee for normal record suspensions is $631. The waiting period to apply is usually five years for a summary offence and 10 years for an indictable offence.

According to a 2014 study, more than 500,000 Canadians have a criminal record for having pot on their person.

Goodale has previously said the bill would ""shed the burden and stigma"" and break down barriers to jobs, education, housing or volunteer work.

However, the bill has already received criticism from the NDP.

A record suspension does not erase the fact that a person was convicted of a crime, but keeps the record separate from other criminal records.

“I prefer to drive around and talk to the people about things that matter — about creating jobs, lowering taxes, making sure we’re lowering the heating costs, lowering gas prices,” he added, claiming “we don’t have enough people for all the jobs we’ve created.” The two King Airs are used to fly premiers, the lieutenant governor and cabinet ministers is an eight-seat, twin-engine turboprop with barely five feet of room for passengers to stand. They are operated by the natural resources ministry, which also uses them to shuttle forestry workers. Natyshak accused Ford of “a lack of respect for taxpayers” in seeking $50,000 in customization on a passenger van, as revealed in court documents this week from a court case fighting the controversial appointment of Ford friend Ron Taverner as commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. It is on hold pending an ethics investigation into any political influence in the hiring.

“I requested a used van that is about one-third the cost of the regular Suburban,” Ford replied, referring to the model of Chevrolet SUV typically used by the police force to transport premiers. Government House Leader Todd Smith later told reporters Ford was “simply inquiring” about getting a customized van and noted “there is no van.”

“He obviously didn’t like what it was going to cost or he decided not to do it now.” Natyshak also pressed Ford on his complaints about his rotating OPP security detail, in which the premier reportedly stated just weeks after being elected: “I’ve asked for my own detail of officers that I trust already” and expressing concerns that “I’m getting f-ed around by the OPP and I’m getting more p--ed off.” The premier brushed aside the New Democrat’s accusations he “demanded special treatment” from the police force whose officers drive Ford to and from home and events and provide security for him. “I’m speaking for my detail. They’re disgusted right now…if they could run in here right now, each and every one of them would be standing shoulder to shoulder with me. I think they’re incredible.” Ford’s office has said the premier simply asked for bodyguards with whom he was comfortable and that such a request is “hardly unusual.” The details about the van request and the security detail complaints were in court filings from Deputy OPP Commissioner Brad Blair, who was passed over for the top job given to Taverner, 72, a veteran Toronto police superintendent. Blair lawyer Julian Falconer has launched a civil case to force Ontario’s ombudsman to probe the Taverner appointment, which is already the subject of an investigation by provincial integrity commissioner J. David Wake. He has recently interviewed Ford’s chief of staff Dean French for more than two hours about his role in the hiring, Progressive Conservative sources have told the Star.

Journalists are usually permitted to cover a premier’s speech, then leave before dinner is served. But the Conservatives have been scrambling to do damage control since it emerged last Thursday that they appealed to lobbyists for help, due to restrictions around fundraising introduced in 2016 by the Liberals. A ban on corporate and union donations — sparked by a Star probe of Liberal fundraising excesses — has made it more challenging to sell tickets. In the past, companies and unions could purchase entire tables for dinners and then distribute the tickets to employees, associates, clients or members. Under the current law, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, who is registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted last month by the party — not Ford’s office. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said “it’s becoming more and more clear how things work under this Ford government.” “If you’re a lobbyist who can help fill the empty seats at the premier’s fundraising dinner, you get access, and you get results. If you’re a family struggling to pay for treatment with autism — not so much,” said Natyshak. But government house leader Todd Smith said “no lobbyist is going to influence our premier.” “He’s been having $25 spaghetti dinners in communities right across Ontario, meeting with grassroots people in our communities. Listen, I’m not going to talk about the success that this party has had with fundraisers, because we’ve had a lot of success,” said Smith. “The NDP should think about having a fundraiser, because they’re not doing so well.” Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

Cullen joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October’s federal election.

The list includes Victoria MP Murray Rankin, Port Moody-Coquitlam MP Fin Donnelly, Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, and Quebec’s Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart (Burnaby South) and Sheila Malcolmson (Nanaimo-Ladysmith) also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver’s mayor and Malcolmson is MLA for Nanaimo.

Malcolmson’s Nanaimo-Ladysmith seat remains empty.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Université de Montreal.

Court of Appeal whether the province has jurisdiction to regulate the shipment of heavy oil through B.C. by pipeline or rail.","VICTORIA — The B.C. New Democrats have lost an embarrassing legal round in the fight with their Alberta counterparts over petroleum and pipelines.

B.C. filed a constitutional challenge to an Alberta law allowing that province to restrict fuel supplies to this province in retaliation for opposition to twinning the Trans Mountain pipeline.

But the challenge was tossed out in a Calgary courtroom because the legislation, though passed by the Alberta legislature, had never been proclaimed into force by their provincial cabinet.

“I am of the view that a claim seeking a declaration as to the constitutionality of an act that has not yet been proclaimed is premature,” wrote Justice R. J. Hall in a decision released Friday. “The claim of the Attorney-General of B.C. is premature, because the act is not in force in Alberta. The statement of claim is hereby struck.”

His five-page written judgment cited ample precedents for the courts not involving themselves in hypotheticals, like ruling on the constitutionality of legislation not in force.

One might have expected B.C. Attorney-General David Eby to have familiarized himself with those precedents before mounting an expensive court challenge. A simple check of Alberta cabinet orders would have established whether the offending legislation was actually in force.

But when pressed during Question Period in the legislature Monday an unapologetic Eby insisted that the reversal was no big deal.

“The entire claim was not struck out,” he insisted, taking refuge in the court having said that it was merely premature.

“We thought we had a principled argument to make when Alberta brought forward legislation that they were going to turn off oil-and-gas supplies to British Columbia,” he told Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

In an affidavit filed in court, the New Democrats conceded B.C. is dependent on Alberta refineries for 55 per cent of its gasoline and 71 per cent of its diesel, most of it shipped via the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“The affidavit goes on to say that British Columbia cannot replace that supply from viable sources,” as Hall noted in passing. “It says that reductions in supply from Alberta will cause shortages in British Columbia and that the result could be increased prices, lack of supply and civil unrest in British Columbia.

“The affidavit makes interesting reading as to B.C.’s supply of gasoline and diesel fuel, and its dependence upon Alberta,” continued the judge, confirming B.C. fears were anything but groundless.

Back to Eby: “We thought we had good reason to go to the court as early as we could to raise this issue and say that that would have devastating consequences, certainly, for British Columbia and we believed the action was illegal.”

Outside the house, Eby was more pithy. “Why do we have to wait to get punched in the face, before we complain about being punched in the face?”

Otherwise Eby said the government is studying the Alberta court decision and will decide whether to file an appeal.

The judge suggested a more sensible course of action: “Should the Alberta government proclaim the act in force, the Attorney-General of B.C. may recommence a claim.”

But such advice misses the point of the legal grandstanding by governments opposed to the pipeline expansion. Burnaby spent untold thousands of dollars on court challenges, never mind that there was no precedent for a municipality to overturn a federal government approved project.

The B.C. New Democrats famously vowed to use “every tool in the tool box” in their fight against the pipeline expansion.

Eby initially suggested that B.C. would only be going to court over the threatened fuel restrictions if the Alberta government actually made use of the legislation.

“Clearly the legislation is a bluff,” Eby told the legislature in April 2018 when the Rachel Notley government tabled the bill. “We think they are very unlikely to use this and we think they know it, and it is a bill for political purposes only.”

In the unlikely event that the Notley government did try to use it, Eby continued, “we would be in court immediately seeking an injunction to stop them from using it. But we would probably have to get in line behind oil companies that would be concerned about contracts that they have with companies in B.C. to deliver product.”

But after the Alberta government passed its legislation in May, Eby decided that bluff or no bluff, B.C. was going to court.

“We believe it would be reckless in the extreme and therefore highly unlikely that Alberta will actually attempt to use the powers they granted themselves,” he told reporters, repeating his earlier take on the bill.

Nevertheless he proceeded to hire legal heavyweight Joe Arvay to file the constitutional challenge that has now been rebuffed.

However Eby decides to proceed in that case, the government will be back in court next month on a different aspect of the pipeline fight.

In a reference case starting March 18, the NDP government is asking the B.C. Court of Appeal whether the province has jurisdiction to regulate the shipment of heavy oil through B.C. by pipeline or rail.

Though interprovincial pipelines and railways are federal jurisdiction, B.C. believes it has a legal opening because of provincial responsibility over the environment.

But even if that line of argument fails, the case will have served the NDP’s larger purpose of sparing no legal expense in fighting the pipeline.

If they win, they could then phase out the subsidy as did the Stephen Harper Conservatives when they were in power at the national level.","VICTORIA — Premier John Horgan was at the two-month mark of his term when he broke a major pre-election promise on political party financing.

As NDP leader before the election, Horgan said repeatedly that in getting rid of big money in politics, he did not intend to replace it with direct subsidies from taxpayers.

Indeed, he mocked the whole notion as fake news from the leading recipient of big money herself, Premier Christy Clark.

“It’s always alternative facts with the premier,” said Horgan. “She said my preference was taxpayers pay for political parties. That’s just not the case.”

Plus there was his answer to this question in a pre-election radio interview: “When you table your legislation, just to be clear, there is going to be nothing in there about, sort of, taxpayers having to fund political parties?”

Horgan: “Yeah, that is correct. That’s what we said in the past and that’s what we’re going to do after the May election, when we form government.”

Far from directly sticking taxpayers with a bill, the NDP election platform said party financing would be left to an independent commission, headed by the chief electoral officer.

But all that was relegated to the trash heap when the New Democrats introduced their bill to get big money out of politics in September 2017.

Gone was the independent commission. Gone the outside review of the options for party financing. In its place a direct serving of taxpayer funding, totalling $30 million over five years.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

When reporters pressed Horgan on breaking his promise, he replied: “It is not what you are making it out to be. This is a transition fund and will be gone at the end of this mandate.”

Not so. A third of the $30 million was permanent and the rest could be extended by a future vote among the elected MLAs who stood to benefit most from the subsidy.

Not surprisingly, the Opposition exploded in outrage. “A travesty” and “a complete betrayal” and “disgusting,” said Andrew Wilkinson, soon to become the new leader of the B.C. Liberals.

But only one candidate for the Liberal leadership vowed to reject the promised taxpayer funding. That was Todd Stone, and he finished fourth.

Wilkinson, on winning the leadership in early 2018, swallowed his disgust and took the money — starting at about $2 million a year, under the per vote formula in the NDP legislation.

Nor have subsequent developments made it any easier for the Liberals to turn up their nose at the tax dollars flowing their way.

The most recent filing from Elections B.C. shows the Opposition having a harder time than the governing party adapting to the new fundraising regime.

The NDP raised just over $2 million between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2018. Over the same six-month span, the Liberals raised $1.69 million.

There was a similar gap over the full year, with the Liberals taking in $4.4 million to the NDP’s $5.5 million. Deducting the roughly $2 million subsidy that the two big parties each received, the gap appears even greater.

The Liberals raised just $2.4 million on their own, or about two-thirds of the $3.5 million tally for the NDP.

Trying to make the best of it was Emile Scheffel, executive director of a Liberal party still working to pay off its loans from the 2017 campaign.

“We actually beat the NDP on the category of contributions greater than $250, but they smoked us again on donations smaller than $250,” Scheffel told Rob Shaw of The Vancouver Sun.

“What that says is we have work to do overall. Where we’re going to focus that work is on smaller donations.”

Smaller donations from many individuals have long been a mainstay of NDP fundraising. Whereas the Liberals specialized in maximizing big-ticket donations from rich donors and corporations. Not surprising they are finding it harder to adapt.

The uphill struggle continues, judging from Scheffel’s recent followup to party supporters on the Nanaimo byelection.

With second-place finisher Tony Harris, the Liberals managed to better their performance from the 2017 general election in both total votes and share of the popular vote.

But they had to do so “with a fraction of past local campaign budgets,” while competing against the NDP political machine.

“A formidable beast,” writes Scheffel, “staffed by highly capable organizers, and it extends well beyond their core party organization. A plethora of NDP-friendly unions held well-timed conferences and meetings in Nanaimo, sending their members out to knock on doors.”

He also claims the NDP was assisted by “dark-money groups” of environmental and political activists: “These organizations are not required to disclose the majority of their funding, much of which comes from U.S. foundations whose economic interests are directly counter to B.C.’s and Canada’s.”

Consequently, says Scheffel, “we’re at risk of being outgunned in the key ridings that will decide the next election.”

As for the taxpayer funding, the Liberals will surely continue to need it until the election. If they win, they could then phase out the subsidy as did the Stephen Harper Conservatives when they were in power at the national level.

But for now the era of big public money replacing big private money continues.

And for irony watchers, there remains the spectacle of the party that squawked the most about John Horgan’s broken promise on taxpayer subsidies needing the money more than does the NDP.

Ron Taverner.,"Premier Doug Ford’s chief of staff has been interviewed by the ethics watchdog probing allegations of political interference in the appointment of Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner as OPP commissioner. Progressive Conservative sources told the Star that integrity commissioner J. David Wake recently questioned Dean French for more than two hours about his role in the Ontario Provincial Police hiring.

French has been interviewed by the province’s integrity commissioner over the appointment of Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner as OPP commissioner. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

The meeting is significant because documents filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice suggest French was actively involved in the search for a new commissioner. The government has insisted that Taverner, a 72-year-old Ford friend, was selected by an “independent” hiring committee that had nothing to do with the premier. Asked about the questioning of French, the premier’s office said Tuesday they are co-operating with Wake’s investigation.

While Ford has not yet met with the integrity commissioner, Community Safety Minister Sylvia Jones has. Documents filed by a lawyer for OPP Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair, who was passed over for the force’s top job, show French and then secretary of cabinet Steve Orsini, the head of the public service, and deputy minister Mario Di Tommaso, Taverner’s former boss at Toronto police, did the job interviews.

Article Continued Below

A Nov. 15 email to Blair from Odgers Berndtson, the executive search firm, confirmed that Ford’s chief of staff was on the interview panel. “This time around you’ll be meeting with Steve Orsini, Dean French and Mario Di Tommaso,” Odgers Berndtson project manager Sue Mahon wrote to the OPP deputy commissioner. That missive is part of a trove of documents filed by lawyer Julian Falconer in his push to have Ontario ombudsman Paul Dubé probe the Taverner appointment. Dubé has said it is beyond his jurisdiction. Wake’s separate inquiry was triggered by a complaint from the opposition New Democrats that the Members’ Integrity Act had been violated. Blair’s lawsuit has also brought to light that Ford’s office sought an OPP van for the premier with more than $50,000 in customized features, including a 32-inch TV, a Blu-ray DVD player, a mini-fridge, mobile Wi-Fi, leather captain’s swivel chairs and a “power reclining sofa bench.” New Democrat MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) blasted the premier for demanding an “over-$100,000, off-the-books, taxpayer-funded super-van.” “The vehicle the premier asked for sounds like the Taj Mahal on wheels,” Natyshak said of the Ford Transit passenger van, which has a base price of about $42,000. Customization and taxes would have pushed the price to more than $100,000. The community safety minister said Ford merely requested “a used van” to be retrofitted so “he could continue to do his work while he is travelling from community to community.” Jones said it is “a perfectly reasonable use of resources.” Government house leader Todd Smith said Ford “is not a premier who likes to travel by plane across the province.” “His office asked for the option of a used van so he can travel the province in comfort. At the end of the day, nothing has happened on this file yet,” Smith said. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath accused Ford of “jumping on his own gravy train while parents of autistic children beg for financial help with high treatment costs. “The premier has access to a number of OPP vehicles, SUVs, that are quite comfortable,” she said. “These are public dollars and no premier needs to have that kind of a pimped-out ride. Why he thinks the public should be paying for it, that’s something he’s going to have to answer to.” Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

479,Empty,2019-02-27T02:21:07Z,"The CBAs require workers on designated projects to join one of 19 NDP-favoured unions within 30 days. They also include pay, benefits and other conditions that can add as much as seven per cent to the cost of construction, by the government’s own admission.","VICTORIA — The New Democrats are continuing to drive up the cost of taxpayer-financed construction in the province, with more than $4 billion worth of projects already covered by union-friendly community benefit agreements.

The CBAs require workers on designated projects to join one of 19 NDP-favoured unions within 30 days. They also include pay, benefits and other conditions that can add as much as seven per cent to the cost of construction, by the government’s own admission.

Three recent announcements from the ministry of transportation and infrastructure should give a sense of the size and scope of the NDP’s intentions on the file.

Feb. 11: The transportation ministry issues a tender call for four-laning a two-kilometre stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway 1 east of Revelstoke.

It is budgeted at $63 million, with the province on the hook for three-quarters and Ottawa picking up the balance.

“This is the first of several upgrade projects on the Trans-Canada Highway between Kamloops and Alberta to be built using a community benefits agreement,” says the news release.

“Community benefits will include job and training opportunities for people in the local area and will increase the participation of apprentices and workers traditionally under-represented in the construction trades, such as Indigenous peoples, women and people with disabilities,” it continues, not mentioning either the union-favouring provisions or the added cost.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

The project is part of a $464-million commitment by the NDP to four-laning the Trans-Canada through that part of the province over the next three years.

The next specific installment is probably a five-lane replacement for the almost 60-year-old R.W. Bruhn bridge at Sicamous.

The project was in the three-year capital plan in the provincial budget last week, priced at $225 million, with the province scheduled to pay 60 per cent and Ottawa the rest.

The ministry confirms it, too, will entail a community benefit agreement.

Feb. 14: The province announces the three pre-qualified bidding teams for the competition to design and construct a toll-free replacement for the 80-year-old Pattullo Bridge.

The project’s budget of $1.377 billion will be funded entirely by the provincial government, after the New Democrats agreed to take over the Pattullo from TransLink, the regional transportation authority.

“Construction of the new Pattullo bridge will be facilitated by the province’s community benefits agreement,” says the news release, echoing an announcement last July.

One head-turner among the three bidding teams is SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec-based firm embroiled in controversy over efforts to obtain a deferred prosecution on allegations of corruption. If convicted, the company would face a 10-year ban on bidding on contracts in Canada.

SNC-Lavalin will be competing against Kiewit Canada, which built the new Port Mann bridge, and a consortium led by Flatiron Constructors Canada, which is also a partner in building the generating station and spillways at Site C.

Feb. 15: The province issues a request for qualified contractors to design, build and finance the Broadway Subway project, a 5.7-km-long extension of SkyTrain from VCC-Clark to Arbutus St.

The call is on a tight timeframe, closing in April. “The ministry will then select up to three respondent teams to participate in the subsequent phase of the competitive selection process.”

Given that SNC-Lavalin built the earlier phases of SkyTrain, it would hardly be surprising to see it make that list as well, controversy notwithstanding.

The twin-tunneled subway and six stations are together budgeted at $2.83 billion, with B.C. putting up $1.83 billion, Ottawa $900 million, and Vancouver $100 million.

And once again, “the project will be delivered under a community benefits agreement announced by the provincial government.”

So that’s $464 million for widening the Trans-Canada, $1.377 billion for the Pattullo, and $2.830 billion for the SkyTrain expansion — $4.640 billion in total for projects with community benefit agreements.

In announcing the deal to build the Pattullo last summer, the New Democrats acknowledged that the benefit agreements could add as much as seven per cent to the cost of a given project.

On that estimation, news stories had the NDP’s union preference counting for almost $100 million in the budget for replacing the Pattullo.

But the New Democrats have since tried to fudge the numbers, saying the “up to seven per cent” calculation applies only to the cost of construction and not other matters in the budget for a given project.

“Estimated CBA costs are factored only into construction costs and can vary depending on the type of project,” according to a statement this week from the transportation ministry.

“With some projects a significant proportion of the total costs are non-construction costs, related to property acquisition, project management (including engineering, legal, environmental), and interest during construction.”

For instance, although the Broadway subway will be underground, there are major land acquisition costs for the entry points for the six stations.

Nor are the New Democrats prepared to specify what part of a given project budget is represented by construction costs.

“We can’t say right now” was the reply from a government representative this week. “That’s part of what the procurement process is all about.”

Forget about ever getting a precise dollar figure for how much the NDP’s union preference is adding to the cost of taxpayer-financed construction in the province.

But on the strength of what the New Democrats have admitted so far, the tab must run to the tens of millions of dollars.

483,Empty,2019-02-28T20:20:57Z,Attempts to contact 17 Liberal B.C. MPs unsuccessful thus far in the wake of the former justice minister's testimony to a House committee.,"Most B.C. Liberal MPs avoided public comment one day after Vancouver Granville Liberal MP and former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified before a House of Commons justice committee that she received “veiled threats” from senior members of the federal government in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Postmedia sought comment from 17 Liberal members of Parliament in B.C. and the Vancouver Granville Liberal riding association since Wilson-Raybould testified, and received three responses.

On Wednesday in Ottawa, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she was pressured — by Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his staff, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office including former principal secretary Gerald Butts and chief of staff Katie Telford, and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself — to direct federal prosecutors to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on corruption and fraud charges and instead negotiate a remediation agreement.

“For a period of approximately four months between September and December of 2018 I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people in the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” Wilson-Raybould said in her opening statement.

Although he did respond to Postmedia’s inquiries, Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon Liberal MP Jati Sidhu told The Abbotsford News on Thursday in an interview that he thought Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was “sour grapes” and he thought she lacked experience.

“The way she’s acting, I think she couldn’t handle the stress,” he told The News. “I think there’s somebody else behind – maybe her father (Chief Bill Wilson) – pulling the strings.”

Fleetwood-Port Kells MP Ken Hardie called Sidhu’s comments “total rubbish.”

“I would imagine my colleague would like that one back, because that’s certainly not been my observations of her. I don’t think that’s been anyone’s experience of her,” Hardie said.

He called her previous handling of big issues as “calm, deliberate and very orderly,” and described her as principled and someone with integrity.

I apologize without reservation to the Member of Vancouver Granville for my inappropriate comments. Both inside and outside of the House, it is important to treat everyone with respect. — Jati Sidhu (@MPJatiSidhu) February 28, 2019

Sidhu later issued an apology to Wilson-Raybould in the House of Commons and on Twitter, calling his comments “inappropriate.”

“Both inside and outside of the House, it is important to treat everyone with respect,” he said.

Personally, Hardie said, he disagrees with Wilson-Raybould’s decision to pursue criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

“I just happen to disagree with her position on this particular situation, but those disagreements are important; they need a good, thorough airing,” Hardie said. “If we can’t disagree and come out of it, then I think that’s a weakness — and I don’t think we’re a weak party.”

When asked about her testimony on the pressure to which she was subjected, Hardie said, “Was there pressure? Absolutely. Was it inappropriate? I think she is the one that should define that because she is the one who experienced it, so I won’t comment on that. But, was some kind of discussion — or if you want to call it, pressure — justified? Yes, absolutely, because of the implications of her course of action.”

Hardie said Wilson-Raybould is an asset and he hopes she remains with the party.

In an email, Surrey Centre MP Randeep Sarai said he did not believe that Trudeau placed “consistent and sustained” pressure on Wilson-Raybould, but merely discussed the matter with her.

“Pressure, discussions and consultation are what government officials do, not make decisions in a vacuum without taking into account all the consequences,” Sarai said.

The press secretary for Fisheries and Oceans Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, in an email on Wednesday evening, directed queries to the Prime Minister’s Office.

Conservative, NDP and Green MPs in B.C. described Wilson-Raybould’s testimony as “explosive,” “courageous” and “entirely credible.”

“I think she’s a hero,” New Westminster-Burnaby NDP MP Peter Julian said.

At Granville Street and Broadway in the heart of Wilson-Raybould’s Vancouver riding, a Postmedia News team asked 50 people what they thought of her testimony and whether she should stick with the Liberal party.

The dozen or so who responded said they were impressed by her, and took her word over Trudeau’s.

Beth Carruthers, 64, from Metchosin, said Wilson-Raybould “is a woman of great principle.”

“I would love to be able to say that Canada is ready to have a First Nations prime minister, who is also a woman, but I’m not sure we’re there yet,” she said.

“One of the things I like about someone like Elizabeth May is she also that kind of integrity, so if I were in some imaginary reality, (as) Jody Wilson-Raybould, I might be tempted to run with the Green party.”

Jackie Lehman, 35, from Vancouver, said she didn’t want to suggest what Wilson-Raybould do next, but believes the former attorney general has many options.

“She should just do what she wants,” Lehman said.

“She’s fantastic, so I think that she should stay … she does such an amazing job, whatever she does, so it would be good to see her in some type of leadership role.”

“The plans for layoffs are rolling out,” said another. “I know several small (service providers) that have already had open discussions that layoffs will begin the first week of April.” Meanwhile, school boards are appealing to the province for some direction — and resources — saying children no longer accessing therapy at autism centres will expect those services to be provided in schools. Both Children, Community and Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod and Education Minister Lisa Thompson have received letters from school boards, with Halton District School Board trustees saying they are “gravely concerned about the changes” — and that they need to know what the government’s implementation plan is. Without one, and additional funding, student safety is compromised, they say.

Thompson told reporters at Queen’s Park on Wednesday that her ministry is “working with our school boards and this is a very sensitive situation and we are going to make sure we get it right for the students.”

She noted the province already spends $3 billion in total on special education. But NDP Education Critic Marit Stiles called it “disturbing” that school boards haven’t received any word from the ministry. “Boards are telling us there has been absolutely no communication around the situation,” said Stiles, a former school trustee. “Things were tough enough,” she told the Star. “School boards already spend more than they are given for special education, and it comes through other funds. They are just moving shells around.”

Cathy Abraham, head of the Ontario Public School Boards Association, said “we don’t know how many students will be coming — we don’t know the degree of their need, we don’t know the services required. We need to know what will happen so we can plan, because we want to be able to serve these children.” MacLeod has said the government is “committed to eliminating the 23,000-long wait list for families of children with autism” and will do so in the next year and a half.

A ban on corporate and union donations has made selling the tickets a challenge.","The Progressive Conservatives’ decision to enlist lobbyists to peddle $1,250 tickets to Doug Ford’s upcoming fundraiser suggests the governing party is selling access to the premier, charges Democracy Watch. Duff Conacher, co-founder of the non-partisan organization that advocates for democratic reform and government accountability, expressed concern after the Star first revealed the Tories urged lobbyists to sell tickets to Wednesday’s fundraiser.

Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford: “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the event, which should make the Tories $2 million. ( Aaron Vincent Elkaim / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )

“The PC Party asking lobbyists to sell high-priced tickets to the premier’s fundraising event shows that the Ford government is willing to sell access to the premier for cash, and to trade favours with lobbyists, in violation of the interests of the people of Ontario,” he said. Conacher, an adjunct professor of law and politics at the University of Ottawa, said the governing party will “feel compelled to return the favour by protecting the interests of the lobbyists’ clients. “That means the public interest will be violated.”

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford. No one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said during a trade mission to Washington. “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should make the Tories $2 million.

“We have to run campaigns.” As disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories appealed to lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government. The ban on corporate and union donations has made selling tickets a challenge. Until the changes three years ago, which were triggered by a Star probe of Liberal political fundraising excesses, companies could purchase entire tables for dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. But now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wants to continue to do business with the Tories, said there has been “tremendous pressure” on his company to sell tickets. “You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” the consultant said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said Friday that “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner said that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.” Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, has said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.” In November, the Tories repealed a section in the campaign finance reform bill that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees. That new loophole means a company or union could, theoretically, make a political contribution in someone else’s name. The government has emphasized it only made the amendment because the disclosure form was a nuisance to contributors.

Speaking to 3,200 well-heeled supporters at an event from which the media were banned after the Star revealed the Tories enlisted lobbyists to sell tickets, Ford touted his government’s accomplishments.

“We promised we would make Ontario open for business and open for jobs. Promise made, promise kept,” he said, pointing to the 41,000 full-time jobs created in the province last month, extending an era of near-record low unemployment that dates back to former premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals in 2017. But the premier emphasized Wednesday night at the Toronto Congress Centre that difficult decisions loom as the Tories tackle a $13.5-billion budget deficit. “We continue to fight hard for Ontario workers and Ontario jobs, for the hard working people in private-sector unions. Everything the government of Ontario does is put at risk when you do what the Liberals did and let deficits spiral out of control,” he said in a speech that was live-streamed on the Progressive Conservative Party’s website.

Ford noted the event was sold out, suggesting the party could have taken in as much as $4 million before expenses. “This is the largest fundraiser in Canadian history,” the premier boasted. Because of the large crowd, the snowstorm and some protesters outside, attendees were slow entering the sprawling Etobicoke venue, which delayed Ford’s speech by about an hour. At Queen’s Park earlier in the day, he defended the closed-door dinner and emphasized he also does events that ordinary Ontarians can afford to attend. “I’m going up to Muskoka on Friday for a $25 spaghetti dinner to talk to the real people. I encourage everyone to come out Friday to listen to the great things that this government has done for the common folk,” Ford said in the legislature.

But Green Leader Mike Schreiner said those folksy fundraisers aren’t the problem. “We haven’t heard any reports that the premier is pressing corporate lobbyists to sell $25 tickets to his spaghetti dinners,” said Schreiner.

Article Continued Below

Last Thursday, the Star disclosed that the Tories asked lobbyists to help sell tickets because campaign finance reforms that banned corporate and union contributions have made it a challenge to fill tables. “It’s potentially doing an end run around the ban on corporate donations,” Schreiner said. While premiers’ major fundraisers have traditionally been open to the media, the party announced Tuesday that the event would be closed. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said that is becoming a theme for Ford’s administration. “It says that the government is elected for only special interests,” said Horwath. “We know that this government, particularly, does a lot of their business behind closed doors in secret where nobody knows what they’re doing and what they’re cooking up.” Government house leader Todd Smith said prohibiting reporters was “a decision made by the party.” But Tory sources, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal PC matters, insisted the edict came from Ford’s office.

After weeks of embarrassing leaks — including revelations in the Star about a new health “super agency” and the opposition NDP’s unauthorized release of a draft government bill — Elliott will table legislation on Tuesday.

“There’s no real surprise in the sense that I’ve said from the beginning that we need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” the minister told reporters Monday at Queen’s Park. “We have some significant problems that we’re dealing with when we have over 30,000 people who are waiting for long-term care beds,” said Elliott. “We have 1,200 people every day in hospitals across Ontario who are receiving health care in hallways and storage rooms; and the wait-list for mental health and addictions is way too long,” she said.

Confirming what the Star first reported on Jan. 17, Elliott said as part of the restructuring there would be a new “super agency” overseeing how health services are delivered. “What we really need to do is focus our health-care system on the patient. That’s what the centre of all of this is about — to make sure that patients’ needs are considered and thought of first and foremost.”

Article Continued Below

The minister emphasized that the head of the new super agency would not be a patronage appointment. “We are thinking about the people that we are going to be appointing to the agency. We are wanting to make sure that we are connecting with people that are knowledgeable about our health-care system so that’s what we are concentrating on,” she said. “We are finalizing our appointments ... it is going to be a professional person.” In recent months, the Tories have been criticized for appointing friends of Premier Doug Ford, including Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner, 72, the proposed new commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, whose party’s obtaining of draft legislation led to a mid-level government bureaucrat being fired on Feb. 4, said she’s worried about what the revamped system will look like. “They better close this idea of a super agency that’s going to take away the local specifics around what people need in their communities,” said Horwath. “We’re very, very concerned about that,” she said, warning of increased “privatization” in health care. The draft bill, which Elliott downplayed as a “very early” version, would give the new super agency unprecedented powers to contract out health services. One of the leaked documents, titled “agency review weekly status report,” indicates the government has used focus groups to gauge acceptance of the health-overhaul plan. Some 20 existing health agencies are expected to be folded into the new body. Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

“We know that our educators, our teachers and our educational assistants do their very best to support students every single day, but they are stretched to the limit,” NDP Education Critic Marit Stiles said in the legislature Tuesday. “The truth is that this government has cut supports to students with special needs. I want to know ... if the minister of education will tell parents and families if they are going to be hiring more teachers, educational assistants and support workers to ensure these children get the support they need in school? Will the minister at least consult with the school boards?” said Stiles, a former Toronto public school board trustee. Criticism of the autism overhaul continued for another day at Queen’s Park, with MacLeod again defending accusations her ministry froze the wait-list for children’s autism services after taking office, as well claims the Ford government’s is spending more on autism than the Liberals when the previous government had budgeted the same amount — $321 million.

“If I used that quote yesterday incorrectly, I unequivocally apologize,” MacLeod said. Windsor West MPP Lisa Gretzky called it a “hollow apology” saying Sherri Taylor — a mom of four children with developmental disabilities — felt “manipulated” because “the minister’s office asked her for a statement before they announced changes to the autism program” and “was not told what the statement was to be used for; nor that the minister would be reading it aloud” in the legislature on Monday.

Article Continued Below

Under the changes, the government has promised to clear the 23,000-long wait list for therapy, and will introduce a childhood budget allowing families to choose the services they want — essentially spreading autism funding to more families, meaning some will receive much less than they currently do. Families will be eligible for up to $20,000 a year for children under 6 — up to a lifetime maximum of $140,000. Children older than that can access up to $5,000 a year up to age 18, to a lifetime maximum of $55,000. MacLeod has previously landed in hot water for issuing a warning to behavioural therapists during a meeting in January that they’d be in for a “long four years” if they didn’t publicly support the autism changes. She later said sorry for her tone during what she described as a tense meeting. Meanwhile, Education Minister Lisa Thompson said the government has extended funding for a pilot project “with regard to improving school-based supports for students” who have been diagnosed with autism. Overall, she noted, boards will receive $3 billion in funding for all special education programs this school year — though many boards say they spend more than that. “We are working with our school boards and we will be sharing our steps forward with our boards in the weeks to come,” Thompson later told reporters. “... We are working with boards in identifying and addressing their concerns.” Boards say they have no idea how many children are currently being served outside of schools under the Ontario Autism Program, nor what impact the changes could have come April 1. “This so-called 23,000 wait list is just going to be pushed into the schools,” said Liberal MPP Michael Coteau, who is also a former Toronto public school board trustee. “So if you are a young child who needs 25 hours of ABA (behavioural therapy) services and you are only getting seven hours because of the allocated amount, that gets downloaded to the actual school board,” he said. “And the school boards are just not prepared.” Under the Ford government changes, only families earning less than $55,000 in net income will qualify for the full funding amounts. On Tuesday, the social services ministry quietly released the sliding income scale which determines how much families are entitled to for autism services.

Health Minister Christine Elliott held a news conference early Tuesday morning, more than six hours before the legislation to transform the system was introduced. That left her answering questions by saying she couldn’t comment.

“I can’t really speak about it yet. I have to wait until this afternoon to introduce it properly in the legislature,” Elliott said in response to one question on the looming changes.

“That is something that we can’t answer right now,” she said in response to another question.

Late Tuesday afternoon, after the legislation had been introduced, officials held a background briefing for journalists that was again devoid of details.

No documents were available to explain the legislation, the legislation itself was not available until after reporters had been asking questions for about 20 minutes. Then, mid-briefing, members of the media were handed a collection of documents more than 85-pages long.

Officials also were unable to answer basic questions at times.

This was the Ford government’s chance to sell their legislation, their chance to explain how and why they were changing a system that is fully broken and that no one can defend anymore.

They failed, it was amateur hour at Queen’s Park.

So what can be said about the government’s plans at this point?

The goal of these changes, Elliott said time and again, was not to save money but to change the focus from the bureaucracy to the patient.

“Too much time and attention is spent on maintaining a siloed and fragmented system, and far too many people believe it is the patient’s or the family’s job to navigate this complicated system,” she said.

“We promised that we would put more people on the front line in health-care services, and that’s what we intend to do.”

There will obviously be job cuts, especially in the over-bloated bureaucracy, but neither Elliott at her news conference nor the officials at the briefing could give details — or even estimates.

Elliott wouldn’t even admit that by getting rid of the useless and ineffective Local Health Integration Networks that any jobs would be cut.

If they aren’t cut, then we will still have a broken system and not enough money for front-line care.

The system under the Liberals became one more interested in those that pushed paper than medical personnel who provide front-line care.

I believe the Ford government wants to shift the system back in the right direction; I just wish they could tell us how in some greater detail and sell the system without being scared of their own shadow.

There won’t be private hospitals and no, you won’t need to pull out your Visa to pay for a doctor’s visit. Despite NDP fear mongering, the system will not be privatized.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath is continuing to push the privatization line and decrying that there might be private delivery of care.

There is in Ontario, including family doctors, the local blood lab or X-ray clinic, the private delivery of care.

Horwath told me she’d like to get rid of that. If the opposition at Queen’s Park wasn’t so inept, the Ford government would be big trouble.

The Canadian Press





LETHBRIDGE, Alta. -- A spokeswoman for Alberta Premier Rachel Notley appeared to acknowledge the poor optics of a weekend appearance Notley made at a hospital, which the Opposition says broke rules prohibiting political activity at health facilities.

Cheryl Oates posted on Twitter on Sunday that while Saturday's event was in a public area of the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge, the premier's office will ensure future campaign events are not done at Alberta Health Services facilities.

A picture Notley posted on Twitter of the event showed her standing at a podium with the message ""Rachel Notley, fighting for you"" on it, with health-care workers standing behind her.

United Conservative House Leader Jason Nixon said in a news release that Notley's NDP government and AHS should be investigated by the province's ethics commissioner for what he called a ""partisan campaign event.""

AHS policy states that elected officials may access their facilities for the purpose of carrying out their duties, provided they don't engage in political activity.

The health agency tweeted Sunday that the Notley event was not organized by AHS, and that participants were not representing the agency.

""The AHS Political Activity Policy, which came into effect in March 2012, is designed to maintain AHS's non-partisan role in health-care delivery, and to protect our staff and patients,"" the health agency said in a separate tweet Sunday.

An Alberta election must happen before the end of May, and Notley could call a vote at any time.

""The NDP's use of a public hospital to launch a partisan attack is an unethical abuse of public resources. Alberta's hospitals belong to Albertans, not to the NDP,"" Nixon said in his statement..

Nixon also suggested Notley and her staff broke government rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital.

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney called the event ""an unethical abuse of public resources.

""Stop campaigning at public expense. Call the election,"" Kenney challenged Notley on Twitter.

Oates said on Twitter that ""not a single tax dollar"" went to the announcement.

""The nurses who came to speak out about the dangers of (Kenney's) plan to privatize health care, came on their own time because they are worried about what he will do to front-line services,"" she stated.

Kenney responded by posting that his party will maintain a ""universally accessible, publicly funded health-care system.""",Opposition accuses Alberta premier of breaking rules with event at hospital - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/opposition-accuses-alberta-premier-of-breaking-rules-with-event-at-hospital-1.4310811

Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson, who was widely criticized Thursday for saying that struggling to pay rent is challenging but also “fun” and “a rite of passage,” has taken to Twitter to rephrase his comments.

Wilkinson made the controversial statement in the legislature Wednesday, during a discussion on upcoming changes to the B.C. Residential Tenancy Act. He said, “I rented for over 15 years, I lived in a dozen different rentals. It was challenging at times, but it was fun. It was part of growing up and getting better. We’ve all done it. It’s kind of a wacky time of life, but it can be really enjoyable.”

The Liberal leader added that, by imposing rent caps and stricter rules on tenant protections, the current NDP government is making it harder for landlords, which ultimately reduces rental supply.

NDP housing minister Selina Robinson was quick to criticize the comments, saying that Wilkinson’s comments “demonstrate how the B.C. Liberals are out of touch.” The Twitterverse also jumped on Wilkinson’s statements with an array of responses, largely slamming the Liberal leader’s position.

When young families can’t afford to buy a home because an out-of-control housing market was ignored for years by the @bcliberals just how out of touch do you need to be to say that the solution is to stop protecting renters, because after all it’s just a ‘wacky’ phase of life — Selina Robinson (@selinarobinson) February 28, 2019

Wilkinson responded on Twitter with a long message in four parts in an attempt to reposition his commentary.

The government’s job is to make achieving your dream possible. If you dream of a better job, a better home, a higher income – those are all opportunities that are crushed when this NDP government closes the door to investment and smothers job creation with taxes. 2/4 #bcpoli — Andrew Wilkinson (@Wilkinson4BC) February 28, 2019

The debate comes in the week that the City of Vancouver implemented new rental guidelines that have been criticized over the rent prices that the City describes as “affordable.”

Also this week, an online campaign in support of renters called Stand Up For Renters was launched, calling in B.C.

494,Empty,2019-03-01T20:35:11Z,"""It's a lot more cost-effective to have me continue to provide that below-market, family rental housing... than it is for them to go and build it.""","B.C.’s property assessment and tax system, which landlords large and small say increasingly threatens Vancouver’s stock of older, affordable rental homes, is apparently causing agreement in some unlikely corners.

Patti Bacchus, the left-leaning former Vancouver school board chairwoman, is largely supportive of the B.C. NDP. But as a landlord expecting a big property-tax hike this year after her 50-year-old, 10 unit building saw a 38-per-cent assessment increase, Bacchus believes the government needs to figure out how to keep landlords like her providing homes at below-market rents to long-term tenants.

And on this point, Jordan Bateman, the more right-leaning former B.C. director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation who’s a regular critic of the B.C. NDP, agrees.

“Taxes should not put anyone out of business,” Bateman said. “I’m not afraid to say, on the record: I’m shocked that I agree with Patti Bacchus.”

Many Vancouver landlords understand why the public — or governments — might not give them too much sympathy. They are, after all, not the most vulnerable group in Vancouver’s housing crisis. But the system appears to threaten older affordable apartment buildings — which is, of course, bad news for tenants.

As reported this week in The Vancouver Sun, the financial viability of Vancouver’s older, affordable rental apartment buildings is under increasing pressure, landlords say, by the provincial government’s practice of assessing property values based on their development potential (instead of actual use), and on market rents (instead of actual rents, which could be half the market rate).

Both are the practices of the B.C. Assessment Authority, said regional assessor Tina Ireland, adding: “and I would suggest in a thriving real estate market, both are going to probably create pressures.”

“It’s a reflection of the marketplace,” Ireland said.

B.C. Assessment is doing the job they’re legislated to do. A change in their approach would require legislative change, which is up to the B.C. government. B.C. Housing Minister Selina Robinson said the system has worked this way for decades, and her government is “monitoring it.”

Asked if she’s heard about challenges to the financial viability of older rental buildings, Robinson said she understands some landlords are facing rising property taxes, but added: “We have a record number of rental units that are currently under construction, and when we have improved vacancy rates, it will help limit the rent increases, it will lower those market rents and it will prevent the skyrocketing assessments that we saw under the previous government.”

Asked if the government might consider changes to the Assessment Act, Robinson said: “We’re absolutely monitoring it, it’s important that we do that, but our focus is really about driving the opportunity to create more vacancy.”

LISTEN: President and CEO of the Urban Development Institute Anne McMullin and Adjunct Professor at the Center for Sustainable Development Michael Geller join host Stuart McNish to discuss measures taken in the B.C. NDP budget to impact the housing market. Can government’s plan to target the demand side of the housing equation lead to lasting results?

David Hutniak, CEO of Landlord B.C., which represents the rental-housing industry, said: “This needs to go beyond monitoring.”

Hutniak said Robinson and the B.C. government should be applauded for taking “meaningful” action on housing, including funding for community sector and modular housing, and making legislative changes, with Landlord B.C.’s support, to improve renter protections.

Hutniak also supports the province’s efforts to get more rental housing built, he said, but this older housing stock is more affordable than new rentals built by the private sector, and the government “needs to focus on this specific issue right now.”

“This really has a huge negative impact on all that existing rental (housing),” Hutniak said. “It is a situation where economic and financial useful life of the existing building is being made to be far shorter than the physical useful life of the building.”

The issue is coming to a head, Hutniak said, as he hears “typical” property tax increases for Vancouver purpose-built rental buildings expected to be more than 20 per cent this year, on top of increases, around 10 per cent each, for sewer, water and insurance. This comes after the B.C. government reduced maximum allowable rent increases to 2 1/2 per cent for 2019, a move that was welcomed by tenants and their advocates, but landlords say poses challenges in combination with their rising costs. While property owners will be glad to see their asset’s value increase, higher taxes and tightening margins mean more owners of older rental buildings may give up and sell.

Current pressures are pushing some older rental buildings “towards evicting people and demolishing,” said Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, adding his priority is to add more rental homes while minimizing displacement.

The current approach of assessing old properties based on market rents instead of actual rents “would push the property value up,” Stewart said, adding, “if you can get this much rent for (a building), of course it’s going to raise the value.”

Changes to the assessment system for older purpose-built rentals would be up to the B.C. government, Stewart said, adding that he hasn’t been lobbied directly on that subject.

Bacchus, whose family has been in the rental-housing business for generations, owns a 10-unit Kitsilano building she rents to long-term tenants paying below-market rents. She wants to continue doing so, she said, but questions if it’s viable in the current climate. Her accountant is asking her to reconsider.

“Because of the increase of the value in the dirt my building sits on, it’s becoming harder to justify keeping it as 10 modest family units,” Bacchus said. “I’m a lefty when it comes to policy, but from a pragmatic point of view, this current tax structure isn’t helping small landlords who are providing a lot of this city’s affordable housing stock.”

Bacchus also applauds the B.C. NDP’s effort to build more rental and supportive housing, adding: “I do support this provincial government in many, many respects, but one of the levers they have is tax policy, and it’s a lot more cost-effective to have me continue to provide that below-market, family rental housing on the west side of Vancouver than it is for them to go and build it.”

Interim Liberal Leader John Fraser expressed concern about the way Ford's staff got an estimate for the van.

""The most important thing is they tried to conceal it,"" said Fraser. ""That's what people should be concerned about.""

The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario states online it ""recommends"" leaders of public institutions ""strictly control"" their staff and forbid the use of personal email accounts for doing government business, unless they can be set up to make sure those records are saved.

View f…","OTTAWA — Fewer Canadians are living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday

The agency laid the credit for the drop on a combination of a buoyant economy and the Liberals signature child benefit.

The national statistics office says that in 2017, the most recent year available, 3.4 million Canadians, or 9.5 per cent of the population, lived below the poverty line the government officially adopted late last year — including 622,000 children — which is the lowest the agency reported going back to 2006.

The drops since the Liberals took office in 2015 were also noted in the agency’s release: 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017 — the first full year of the benefit — compared to 2015 when the Liberals took office.

Statistics Canada said an increase in the value of child benefits, coupled with gains in market income, put more money into the pockets of families in 2017 — which Liberals touted Tuesday as a political and policy victory.

“It certainly shows a program that is simple for the government to manage, simple for families to receive, and fair for everyone … is a good thing when it comes to making more Canadians able to make ends meet,” Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said in an interview.

The Liberals introduced the income-tested Canada Child Benefit midway through 2016, replacing a previous system of tax credits and the Conservatives’ universal child care benefit. The agency calculates that between 2016 and 2017, a couple with children saw their median benefit rise by $1,200, while lone parents received an extra $1,300.

Duclos suggested numbers will drop further, particularly once the Canada Workers Benefit launches next month and expands a wage subsidy introduced under former prime minister Stephen Harper to boost the incomes of the country’s working poor.

Duclos was less clear about whether the Liberals would boost the base value of the child benefit or ensure immigration status doesn’t affect eligibility as some anti-poverty activists have requested.

The Liberals promised in the 2015 election that the child benefit would lift 300,000 children out of poverty compared to 2013 figures, but based on a different measure of poverty than was previously used.

Parsing out the numbers, the Liberals met their projections: a drop of 315,000 in children in poverty in 2017 compared to 2013.

Last year, the Liberals pegged the value of the benefit to inflation — two years before they planned to do so — and promised by 2020 to cut poverty rates by 20 per cent of 2015 figures.

What Statistics Canada reported Tuesday is that there were 826,000 fewer people living in poverty in 2017 compared to 2015 — or just shy of the 20 per cent target.

An expert panel the Liberals turned to for help crafting the poverty plan originally recommended a 25 per cent target for 2020. The Liberals chose 20 per cent, leading some experts to suggest the goal was likely a given based on the measures the government had introduced.

The next part of the plan proposes a drop to 50 per cent of 2015 levels by 2030, which will require thought about how to “make more of a dent in those who are living in and with extreme poverty,” Lindsay Tedds, scientific director of fiscal and economic policy at the University of Calgary’s school of public policy, said on Twitter.

A bill to set the poverty plan into law has yet to pass the House of Commons, but it doesn’t propose any additional spending than what is already promised.

“We picked the indicator, we picked where we want the indicator to be, but there’s no plan if we miss that target and there should be,” said David Macdonald, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

“That’s the point of a poverty reduction plan as opposed to having just a tracking plan, which is presently what it is.”

That estimate, in a new analysis, is 22 per cent higher than figures presented by the Department of National Defence and will likely mean renewed criticism of the Liberal government's plan.

Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux looked at the cost of buying 18 old F-18s, modifying them to Canadian standards, operating them until at least 2032 and disposing of them.

The warplanes, which are of the same vintage as the air force's existing CF-18s, are expected to arrive in batches between now and 2022. The first two aircraft arrived recently.

DND planners estimated the cost would be up to $895.5 million.

The budget office figures it will be higher, running between $1.09 billion and $1.15 billion.

Giroux says the biggest difference between the two estimates relates to upgrading the fighters to Canadian standards.

Even still, he is puzzled by the disagreement. In preparing its estimate, the budget office used figures from the Department of National Defence and publicly available information.

""Why have they underestimated the cost? I wonder myself."" Giroux told reporters after the report was presented.

""Given that they provided us with the basic information we used, I don't see why they would have missed the mark by 22 per cent.""

'The magical trigger of $1 billion'

The answer, he suggested, may involve optics, because programs that slide in just under the $1 billion mark tend to generate less public controversy.

""The estimate we provided crosses the magical trigger of $1 billion life-cycle cost. They may have had an incentive to lower the cost estimate,"" Giroux said.

In a statement, National Defence said its cost was ""extremely close to that of the PBO on the majority of line items,"" but they differed on figures for the upgrade, as well as the notion of whether extra funds — known as a contingency — should be set aside.

The department insisted the cost of improving the Australian jets is still up in the air. ""We are still producing options for these upgrades,"" said the statement.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons defence committee that his department has provided the necessary information to the budget office and the public.

He said his department does ""thorough costing.""

Auditor general also challenged figures

Even still, the budget office is not the only one estimating that the program crack the billion-dollar mark.

Last fall, the auditor general also challenged DND's figures.

Michael Ferguson's last report estimated the purchase and operations cost would be roughly $1.02 billion.

Giroux, in his report Thursday, said the cost could go higher.

""The sensitivity analysis conducted within this report shows that prices could further change according to both project timelines and future flying-hour behaviour within the fleet,"" the report said.

The Liberals have long insisted the air force needs extra fighters because it cannot at the moment meet both its NATO and full-alert North American Aerospace Defence Command commitments at the same time.

The used F-18s are considered a stopgap until the federal government purchases 88 new fighters through a competition that has yet to get going.

The Conservative opposition have repeatedly said used fighter jets are a waste of time and money.

""We shouldn't be surprised here, the Liberals have a tradition of buying old used equipment for the Canadian Armed Forces, all for political gain,"" said Conservative critic James Bezan, referring to the 1990s-era purchase of used submarines from the British.

The latest report is not the first time the budget office has challenged National Defence over its fighter jet arithmetic.

Almost eight years ago, the budget office questioned whether the estimated cost of acquiring the F-35 fighter, under the former Conservative government, was low-balled by defence planners.

The report led to the eventual unravelling of the federal government's plan to buy the stealth warplane.",Used Australian fighter jets could cost taxpayers $1.1B: PBO,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pbo-fighter-jets-1.5036942

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau turned to a political veteran to take on the portfolio Friday, hoping the appointment of Lawrence MacAulay will assuage advocates frustrated by the turnover in ministers.

Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence Lawrence MacAulay speaks to reporters following a federal cabinet shuffle at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on March 1, 2019. ( Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

MacAulay, who was secretary of state for veterans under prime minister Jean Chrétien, was effusive Friday, telling reporters he was delighted to return to an issue he was first involved with two decades ago. “It’s an honour to be a minister at the table in any portfolio but the chance to be at veterans affairs really for the second time is indeed a great honour,” MacAulay said outside Rideau Hall following the swearing-in ceremony. The veterans affairs department is close to home in another way too — MacAulay is MP for the riding of Cardigan in Prince Edward Island, and the headquarters for veterans affairs is in Charlottetown.

Article Continued Below

He pledged to do “everything I can” to make sure the personnel who “preserve democracy for us worldwide” are well looked after. That enthusiasm might help ease the discomfort of veterans groups worried that their priorities are getting lost in the political upheaval. MacAulay fills the vacancy caused by the sudden departure of Jody Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from the position in February just a month into the job. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan had taken on responsibilities for the file in the interim. Friday’s shuffle means there have been 10 ministers to hold the veterans affairs position since 2009 and five since the Liberals took office in 2015. Scott Maxwell, executive director of Wounded Warriors Canada, said the changes in ministers with just months to go before the fall election make it difficult to make progress on issues such as the transition to civilian life and improving benefits and payments for wounded veterans.

“It just doesn’t seem realistic for anybody to step into this role at this time and hope to accomplish very much,” Maxwell said. Brad White, national executive director of the Royal Canadian Legion, said that during MacAulay’s first ministerial stint with the department in the 1990s, he enacted some “transformational” change to address pension issues.

“I’m hoping he takes that attitude to this new portfolio,” White said in an interview. He said there are numerous issues that need attention, notably smoothing the transition for personnel between the Canadian Armed Forces and the veterans affairs department. “We have some very complex issues out there right now. We have injuries we have never seen before, both physical and psychological that we have to deal with … and they are younger people than they were before,” he said. “I’m just concerned that we don’t lose the focus… we need to look after our veterans,” he said. Conservative MP Phil McColeman, the critic for veterans issues, said he’s happy to see veterans affairs restored to a full-time minister. He said urgent action is needed to address issues highlighted by the parliamentary budget officer in its recent examination of the various benefits programs provided by the department since 2006. In a February report, the budget officer concluded that most, but not all, veterans receiving disability benefits will be financially better off under the new regime that takes effect April 1. But its analysis found that about 3 per cent of new claimants would be “greatly disadvantaged” under the new program, by about $300,000. “That’s is a glaring thing that I think he should address,” McColeman (Brant) told the Star Friday. McColeman also wants the new minister to address the health concerns of veterans who took the anti-malaria drug mefloquine, which carries the risk of psychological side effects. The federal government may face a lawsuit from veterans who say their health has suffered as a result of the drug. McColeman is hoping the Liberal government can resolve the issue without a courtroom showdown. “I would ask the new minister to look at every possible avenue to make sure that we don’t end up in the courtroom again with our veterans,” he said.

Trudeau must be very calm right now, because Liberals are nervous in the wake of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s remarkable revelations about her dealings with Trudeau and top members of his government. “It’s probably cost us the election,” one usually upbeat MP said offhandedly when asked what damage had been done by the testimony. Another MP, doing his own soundings of colleagues since Wednesday, said about one-third of the caucus is “grumbling” about Wilson-Raybould, another one-third is keeping an open mind about both sides and the last third is hoping that this episode is a corrective slap in the face for business as it has been practised in this government for the past three years. “Heads should roll,” said an MP who would put himself in that last category. Which heads? “Maybe all of them.”

The immediate Liberal communications strategy seems to revolve around having heavy-hitter cabinet ministers, such as Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, talk to the media about how they continue to stand behind the PM. But there does not seem to be a plan to assure MPs or Liberals at large about their election prospects, apart from having Trudeau in business-as-usual mode. Trudeau himself has indeed radiated icy, almost surreal calm in media encounters after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony — even when technical glitches erupted in the midst of attempts to connect the PM with Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques, currently orbiting above the Earth in the International Space Station.

Article Continued Below

Yes, that really was on the prime minister’s agenda on a significant, day-after-disaster itinerary — a golden opportunity for would-be political comedians, who got to tell all kinds of jokes about who else should be hurtled into the stratosphere right now as Trudeau’s PMO is still reeling here on Earth with Wilson-Raybould’s detailed condemnations. (Insert your favourite Trudeau adviser here.) Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould may have a lot in common in times of stress. The former attorney-general sat stone-faced and calm in her front-row seat on the government benches in the Commons on Thursday as the opposition howled outrage on her behalf. It was an odd spectacle in a week filled with things we haven’t seen much around Parliament Hill.

Wilson-Raybould now has superhero powers in the eyes of the Conservatives and New Democrats, even as she continues to be a leading Liberal. She can leap tall government buildings and make herself invisible when she chooses, as she did on Thursday. Her most staunch defenders in the chamber were not the people surrounding her, but the Conservatives and New Democrats across the floor, voicing fury on her behalf at reports of how one of her own Liberal colleagues called her grievances “sour grapes.” The colleague in question is Jati Sidhu, from the B.C. riding of Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon. In an interview with the Abbotsford News, Sidhu also said: “The way she’s acting, I think she couldn’t handle the stress…. I think there’s somebody else behind — maybe her father — pulling the strings.” Sidhu has since apologized, but it’s safe to say that the exasperation under his remarks is not isolated to just one MP or loyal Liberal soldier. Caucus management has never been a strong suit within Trudeau’s government; some backbenchers complain that members of the media have more regular access to the top folks in the PMO than they do.

Wilson-Raybould’s extraordinary intervention has emboldened some Liberals to declare their own dissatisfaction with PMO-MP relations — and make no mistake, Conservatives and New Democrats have picked up on those threads of dissent too, which means they’ll keep using disclosures this week to drive wedges in Liberal unity. But any clamping down on that dissent by the current PMO could backfire. What Canadians witnessed on Wednesday at a Commons committee could be seen as the direct result of keeping resentment and frustration simmering too long on the back burner.

501,Empty,2019-03-01T22:06:13Z,"With two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — detained in China on bogus, tit-for-tat charges related to the Meng case, the Liberals really need to walk their talk.","Most public discussion since Jody Wilson-Raybould’s explosive testimony Wednesday to the House of Commons justice committee has focused on whether the prime minister and his officials pressured the former attorney-general inappropriately to interfere in an SNC-Lavalin criminal case, and whether the Liberal government’s future is at risk.

Another important issue has been largely overlooked.

How could Justin Trudeau and his underlings so brazenly try to interfere for indisputably partisan reasons in what by law must be an independent prosecution while criticizing China for doing the same thing in the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou?

It’s a question a Chinese government spokesman jumped on Friday, although one that Canadians should ask and the Trudeau government should answer.

“Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, according to a Reuters report. “In fact, not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.”

Lu is raising an important point about Trudeau government hypocrisy. This isn’t to suggest that anyone extend their agreement to the view of China’s totalitarians that political interference in criminal prosecutions is acceptable. It isn’t, and that’s what makes the behaviour of the PM and his team so serious.

In extensive, detailed and believable testimony, Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his operatives of a “sustained effort” over four months “to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” as well as “veiled threats” if the prime minister didn’t get what he wanted — a remediation agreement to end the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on fraud and corruption charges. Such a deal had been ruled out by prosecutors.

What makes the Liberals’ conduct even more hypocritical is that while officials were hammering Wilson-Raybould to politically interfere in the case, Canada’s Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland, was expressing concerns after learning that U.S. President Donald Trump had mused that he would intervene in the Meng prosecution if it would help the U.S. strike a trade deal with China.

Freeland cautioned, “our extradition partners should not seek to politicize the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice and following the rule-of-law.”

Reacting to the same comments by Trump, Trudeau said, “Regardless of what goes on in other countries, Canada is and will always remain a country of the rule-of-law.”

On Friday, in announcing Canada would proceed with the extradition of Meng, who has been on house arrest in Vancouver since December on U.S. fraud charges, the Justice Department declared in the first line of its media release that “Canada is a country governed by the rule-of-law.”

While it’s clear that the Trudeau government is good at stating the importance of that rule, if it wants to be taken seriously, especially on the world stage, it needs to back up those words with action. Given what we now know about the SNC-Lavalin case, it’s fair for Canadians to have doubts and be angry about Trudeau and his people for trying to inject politics into a prosecution — as they do in places like China.

With two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — detained there on bogus, tit-for-tat charges related to the Meng case, the Liberals really need to walk their talk.

502,Empty,2019-03-01T19:17:33Z,Economists see cash infusions for Canadian households coming,"Canada’s recent economic rough patch has prompted chatter about the fiscal plans of the federal government, not just the monetary policy of the country’s central bank.

Statistics Canada reported Friday that the economy grew just 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018. Growth was 1.8 per cent for the year, a decrease from the 3 per cent seen in 2017.

The news had some economists saying that the Bank of Canada may have been handed a reason to lay off on discussion of further interest-rate increases, if it so chooses.

“On the basis of this latest set of woeful GDP figures, the Bank of Canada must surely be considering following the Fed and abandoning any talk of further interest rate hikes at next week’s policy meeting,” said a note from Capital Economics.

However, the weak economic growth also caused some economists to eye the federal government’s fiscal plans ahead of the March 19 budget, which will arrive just months away from the next Canada-wide election in October.

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the emphasis upon quick shots that get stimulus immediately out the door, like more cash infusions for households Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank

“Barring pre-election handouts from Ottawa, expect a further moderation of consumption this year more so considering the still-low savings rate and an expected moderation in employment creation,” wrote National Bank of Canada senior economist Krishen Rangasamy.

Recent figures from the Department of Finance Canada have suggested that Ottawa could have some room to manoeuvre with its budget. There was an approximately $2.5-billion surplus for December and a $324-million surplus from April to December, the figures showed.

The latest GDP figures could “provide cover” to the federal government to add some stimulus to its coming fiscal plan, according to Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to see the emphasis upon quick shots that get stimulus immediately out the door, like more cash infusions for households as one option,” wrote Holt.

“It might also raise pressure on Finance and the provinces to ease restrictions on housing demand which Finance Minister (Bill) Morneau has already hinted will be a focus in the upcoming budget.”

But there are employment figures for February still to come next week. And jobs numbers will be “the judge and jury for policymakers,” wrote Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

“For the Finance Minister Morneau, there were already temptations to use the fiscal room created by a lower than expected deficit for 2018 to announce more generous child tax credits or other spending initiatives in what is an election year,” Shenfeld said Friday.

“Only if the jobs data weaken could he add the need for further stimulus to that list.”

There has already been some buzz around what sort of measures, if any, the federal Liberal government could have up its sleeve on March 19.

“While we’re not in the game of predicting budget measures, the recent chatter has centred on areas such as expanded universal pharmacare, skills training and measures to help housing affordability,” wrote Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, on Feb. 22.

“On the latter, there has been some hints that Ottawa could bring back 30-year amortizations for first-time buyers, but the details at this point are minimal.”

The Liberal government has been on the defensive since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail said senior officials pressured Wilson-Raybould last year to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials and to pay a fine instead.

Wilson-Raybould - who was demoted in January and resigned from her new post this month - has not said a word so far about the affair. She will testify to the House of Commons justice committee at 3:15 p.m. ET (2015 GMT), her office said.

It is still not clear how much she will actually be able to say. Trudeau announced on Tuesday that she would be allowed to address most aspects of the case, but not all of them.

Opinion polls suggest the matter is starting to hurt the Liberals months before an October election. Trudeau and other officials insist there was no wrongdoing.

A former Canadian justice minister says she faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.

Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed repeatedly to ""find a solution"" for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

PM Justin Trudeau said he disagreed with the minister's testimony and he and his staff acted appropriately.

Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has called on him to resign.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" the Conservative leader told reporters, adding that he was calling for a full police investigation.

What did the former minister say?

Speaking to the House of Commons justice committee, the former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff faced four months of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the Quebec-based engineering and construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

It was an option rejected in September by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada - an independent authority whose main objective is to prosecute federal offences - and one she supported.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said she and her aides were pulled into multiple conversations and meetings - ""a barrage of people hounding me and my staff"" - with Mr Trudeau, senior aides from his office and the finance department, and a top bureaucrat.

In those various meetings, they repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial long after that decision had been made.

""Within these conversations, there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

Mr Trudeau's Liberals have struggled to contain the controversy over the past three weeks.

Though she has been a key figure at the centre of the affair, Ms Wilson-Raybould had not yet not spoken publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege.

That privilege was waived by the government on Monday, paving the way for her appearance before the committee on Wednesday.

What has happened so far?

This began in early February, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on allegations of political interference in the case against SNC-Lavalin.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced repeated questions about the matter from opposition parties

The newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources, that Mr Trudeau's office pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to push the public prosecution service to consider a deferred prosecution agreement.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was attorney general and justice minister until January, when she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, a move widely seen as a demotion.

An attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function.

On 12 February, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet, though she remains a Liberal member of Parliament.

Finally on 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide Gerald Butts announced he was resigning, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff did anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the ""vital work"" being done by the team.

Mr Trudeau and his officials have denied anything improper took place but have struggled to contain the crisis.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, he said he was worried about jobs at SNC Lavalin and how pensioners would be affected.

Opinion polls indicate the matter is beginning to hurt the Liberals with months to go until the coming general election.

What is happening with SNC Lavalin?

The Quebec-based firm is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The agreement - similar to regimes in the US and the UK - essentially suspends prosecution while allowing a firm to agree instead to alternative terms or conditions.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

A conviction could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on Canadian federal contracts, which would be a major financial hit for the firm.",Jody Wilson-Raybould: Trudeau's ex-minister makes 'threats' claim,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47362652
505,Empty,2019-03-02T03:39:26Z,"Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty Often, sometimes multiple times a day, users in an anti-vaccination Facebook group post a link to a 2017 article about vaccine laws in Sweden. “Nice!” one group member captioned the article last week. “Amazing,” “in…","Often, sometimes multiple times a day, users in an anti-vaccination Facebook group post a link to a 2017 article about vaccine laws in Sweden.

“Nice!” one group member captioned the article last week.

“Amazing,” “interesting,” wrote two people who shared the article in the 150,000-member group on the same late January day.

The article wasn’t from a medical news source, though, or even another anti-vaccine group. It came from a white supremacist website, Red Ice.

The anti-vaxxer movement, comprised of people who falsely believe vaccines are dangerous, is ascendant. In 2019, the World Health Organization named “vaccine hesitancy” one of the top 10 threats to global health, the first time it made the list. The movement is credited with contributing to ongoing measles outbreaks worldwide, including an outbreak of approximately 70 people in Washington state. But that’s not all it’s spreading. Like other conspiracy movements, the anti-vaxxer movement has rubbed shoulders with the far right.

New studies reveal vaccine skepticism to be a strong predictor for populist politics in Europe, where many populist candidates run on a hard-right line. And fringe media outlets are seizing on the sympathy from the anti-vax movement, pushing even more extreme conspiracy theories under the guise of vaccine skepticism.

White supremacist website Red Ice has churned out at least 100 articles and radio clips bashing vaccines in recent years. Links to those articles appear regularly in closed anti-vaxxer Facebook groups, a number of which boast more than 150,000 members. Unlike Facebook pages, which any user can read, these closed groups can be hotbeds of political activity and harassment, in which members coordinate attacks on pro-vaccine doctors and activists, as the Guardian reported.

Racist Rabbit Hole

Far-right news sites can find a serious audience in these highly active conspiracy communities. One 2017 Red Ice article has repeatedly made the rounds in large anti-vax groups, sometimes racking up more than 1,000 likes. Although the article skews right wing (it lauds a clip from the Tucker Carlson’s show) and alarmist (vaccines “can seriously injure your child”), it isn’t overtly white supremacist. But should anti-vaxxers chose to explore the rest of the site, they would find a white supremacist swamp, full of anti-immigrant and Islamophobic fear-mongering.

Most anti-vaxxers are not white supremacists, far from it. But the overlap can send some well-meaning parents down the rabbit hole. Far-right groups frequently engage in “entryism,” a tactic that involves seeding a sympathetic mainstream group with extremist ideology, then slowly radicalizing its members. The tactic works well in groups like the anti-vax community.

At their surface level, anti-vax claims tap into populist grievances with bipartisan support; in the U.S., where health care can be prohibitively expensive, vaccines are sometimes seen as an extension of well-moneyed pharmaceutical companies. But the world of conservative-leaning conspiracy sites take the claims further. Red Ice, Infowars, and their ilk build on the mistrust of pharmaceutical companies to claim vaccines are part of a world-domination scheme by a shadowy global elite. As these claims typically go, the conspiracy theory gets anti-Semitic, with white supremacists interpreting “elite” to mean Jewish people.

As anti-vax spreads into the internet’s fringes, it mingles with other far-right conspiracy theories.

Natural News, a right-wing conspiracy site with 2.9 million likes on Facebook, is one of the primary sources of anti-vaxxer content, according to The Atlantic. A recent anti-abortion article on Natural News accuses “the political Left in America” of advocating for child murder, and warns that government “vaccine enforcer” teams are about to start vaccinating children at gunpoint. In a 10,000-member Facebook group for those who believe certain people (usually blonde or red-headed) are a superior race unrelated to the rest of humanity, members offered a series of arguments against vaccination, including the claim that vaccinations constitute race-mixing.

Anti-Elite, Anti-Vaccine

But entryist techniques aren’t entirely to blame for the anti-vax movement’s right-wing streak. A pair of recent studies suggests anti-vaxxers tend to hold worldviews compatible with right-wing populism.

A March study by Australian researchers used a theory that tests for five character traits, including a person’s respect for “purity,” and their deference to authority. Anti-vax parents tested high for belief in purity (defined by researchers as “an abhorrence for impurity of body”) and low on respect for authority.

Conservatives typically score high on respect for purity and authority, while liberals score lower. But populist movements, including Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, borrow some of the left’s anti-authority language, casting themselves as anti-elite. On Facebook, anti-vaxxers might rage against the authority of pharmaceutical companies or school vaccination policies, but Trump is a less common target. (Trump has promoted anti-vax conspiracies, too, falsely claiming in 2014 that vaccines cause autism.)

“ The idea that we force someone to give up their liberty for the sake of the collective is not based on American values but rather, Communist. ” — Kelly Townsend, Republican anti-vaxxer in Arizona

Other conservatives have painted their anti-vax stances as anti-authoritarian by claiming vaccinations are communist. “The idea that we force someone to give up their liberty for the sake of the collective is not based on American values but rather, Communist,” Kelly Townsend, a Republican anti-vaxxer in Arizona’s state House, wrote in a Thursday Facebook post.

The trend is even clearer in Europe, where a study published in February in the European Journal of Public Health suggests “a connection between the rise of political populism and vaccine hesitancy.”

The study found an overlap between measles outbreaks in France, Greece, and Italy, and the rise of populist parties in those regions. In all three, more than 15 percent of respondents said they did not believe vaccines are effective. (Vaccination programs are most effective when at least 95 percent of the population is vaccinated.)

“It seems likely that scientific populism is driven by similar feelings to political populism – ie profound distrust of elites and experts by disenfranchised and marginalised parts of the population,” the study’s author wrote, according to the Guardian. A December 2018 investigation by the Guardian found similar overlap between populist votes and anti-vaxxers in the U.S. and Poland.

In Ireland, the merger of anti-vaxxer conspiracy and right-wing populism marches in the streets. Participants in Dublin “Yellow Vest” protests in January shouted anti-immigrant slogans while simultaneously protesting vaccines, Ireland’s Journal reported. The Yellow Vests, initially a French protest movement with support from the populist left and right, has taken on a more conspiratorial right-wing tone abroad, with Canadian and British Yellow Vests using the movement to push anti-immigrant rhetoric and the QAnon conspiracy theory. Members of right-wing extremist groups have marched in the Canadian and British demonstrations.

Some Facebook groups for Ireland’s Yellow Vest movement were “dominated by fringe conspiracy theory views and share debunked articles from untrustworthy news sources,” including false health claims about fluoride, the Journal reported.

Some of those health claims linked back to Awareness Act, a conspiracy site currently pushing the bogus claim about blondes and redheads belonging to a master race unrelated to the rest of humanity.

Eventually, all of it—the conspiracy theories, the skepticism of some unseen authority, the right-wing populism—coalesces. On Natural News, the American anti-vaxxer site with nearly 3 million likes, an article claims the government will start forcefully vaccinating children against their parents’ will.

The article, which argues against gun laws, has spent the past two days at the top of the Natural News site with a provocative title:

“House Democrats explode in recriminations as liberals lash out at moderates” [WaPo]. “But Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the unquestioned media superstar of the freshman class, upped the ante, admonishing the moderates and indicating she would help liberal activists unseat them in the 2020 election… ‘She said that when activists ask her why she had to vote for a gun safety bill that also further empowers an agency that forcibly injects kids with psychotropic drugs, they’re going to want a list of names and she’s going to give it to them,’ [AOC staffer Corbyn] Trent said, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Triggering the blowup were Wednesday’s votes on a bill to expand federal background checks for gun purchases. Twenty-six moderate Democrats joined Republicans in amending the legislation, adding a provision requiring that ICE be notified if an illegal immigrant seeks to purchase a gun.” • Pelosi is ticked off at them too, seemingly, which is hilarious since this sort of Blue Dog is exactly the sort of candidate the DCCC sought to put in office, at Pelosi’s behest. I don’t know whether that’s incompetence or playing both ends against the middle, but that’s our Democrats. Too bad the explosion of recriminations is about gunz and not #MedicareForAll or the Green New Deal, though. “Six Republicans named to House climate panel” [The Hill]. “The climate committee was formed as Pelosi’s response to calls from progressives to form a panel designed to focus specifically on mitigating the effects of climate change. Originally, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) had championed a committee on the Green New Deal, which would draft a plan to get the country running on 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. Pelosi instead drafted the climate crisis committee, which will have no subpoena or legislative authority.” • I’ll take that as a no. “Senate Democrats introduce ‘Green New Deal’ alternative” [The Hill]. “‘Climate change is real, human activity during the last century is the dominant cause of the climate crisis; and the United States and Congress should take immediate action to address the challenge of climate change,’ the resolution reads in its entirety…. The resolution is meant as an alternative to the Green New Deal resolution introduced in early February by Sen. Ed Markey. Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fast-tracked the vote on the resolution two weeks ago in an effort to highlight a Democratic divide over the plan…. While the new resolution doesn’t offer any specific plans to decrease emissions and combat climate change, Democratic leaders championed it as a push in the right direction as Republicans failed to back or introduce any climate bills of their own.” • [head, desk]. • And I’ll take that as a no. AOC (1): If you want to scale the left, this is a good approach: My staff + I come to decisions through robust discussion + debate – we operate as a team. They are also intro’d at community events, bc I want constituents to grow familiar w/ the people picking up the phone when they call. As an educational organizer, I view it as development. https://t.co/iF5Zwp9t10 — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 1, 2019 Though I hate to see the gradual corruption of AOC’s language; “robust,” forsooth.

And who would pay the immense transfer sums involved?” • The scaly old lizard backbrained reprobate isn’t wrong (though, to be fair, it’s not clear to me that these were questions the German State asked after the Holocaust). The thing is, however, that these are basic questions for which there should be ready answers. MMT is obvious framework for the “transfer sums” (what a loaded word); reparations advocate Darity — a scholar, as opposed to a pundit like Coates — is MMT-adjacent. But the qualifications process seems tricky and fraught with unintended consequences (as Warren’s adventure with DNA shows). Both Harris and Warren aren’t really proposing straight-up reparations, either; both are simply repurposing existing programs or concepts, like “investment in black communities.” I hate to go all “national conversation” on this, but it may be that Conyers’ HR40 — the closest to a reparations bill that there has been; Jayapal and Khanna were cp-sponsors — is the best way forward. It’s not a “study,” it’s a lot like a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. If this could be undertaken in good faith, and didn’t become either a whipping boy for reactionaries or the playing of identititarian policy entrepreneurs, progress could be made. (Then again, debts that can’t be paid, won’t be.)

Stats Watch

Personal Income and Outlays, January 2019: Edged lower [Econoday]. “Today’s report combines all of December’s data with only January’s income data, the rest of the month’s data delayed because of the government shutdown…. Consumers apparently put the money they didn’t spend into the bank as December’s savings rate spiked 1.5 percentage points to 7.6 percent…. The December piece of this report is old news and was wrapped inside yesterday’s fourth-quarter GDP data, but January’s income, specifically the 0.3 percent rise for wages & salaries, offers a respectable opening for the first-quarter outlook.” And but: “U.S. personal income falls; spending weakest since 2009” [Reuters]. “The Commerce Department did not publish the January consumer spending portion of the report as the collection and processing of retail sales data was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the government that ended on Jan. 25.” And: “The increase in personal income for December was above expectations, however the change in personal income for January was well below consensus” [Calculated Risk].

Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index, February 2019: “slowing conditions through the month of February” [Econoday]. “Manufacturing had a strong year last year but there have been emerging signs the past six weeks or so that the sector slowed at year-end and early into this year. Still, rates of growth are sound underscored by strength in this report’s employment reading.” And but: “Overall, surveys do not have a high correlation to the movement of industrial production (manufacturing) since the Great Recession” [Econintersect].

Institute For Supply Management Manufacturing Index, February 2019: “Not all the anecdotal reports are reporting slowing but both manufacturing PMI and now ISM manufacturing are” [Econoday]. “Though slowing, rates of growth are still in the mid-50s which is not only respectable but arguably desirable… Though there are plenty of small sample reports like the ISM showing continued strength, the bulk have been signaling moderation which is probably the call right now for manufacturing. This report gets close attention from the Fed and today’s results fit right in with their general warnings on slowing and the need for patience in monetary policy.” And: “This was below expectations of 55.0%, and suggests manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in February than in January” [Calculated Risk].

Consumer Sentiment, February 2019 (Final): “Consumer sentiment did bounce back at least some following the government shutdown” [Econoday]. “Today’s report fits in with the general slowing theme of recent data and specifically offers a hint that consumer spending may be on the soft side this quarter.” And: “Final February 2019 Michigan Consumer Sentiment Improved From Preliminary” [Econintersect]. “Surveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin, makes the following comments: ‘…. Consumers continued to react to the Fed’s pause in raising interest rates, balancing the favorable impact on borrowing costs against the negative message that the economy at present could not withstand another rate hike.” • Does anybody know if consumers actually act that way? I certainly don’t.

Retail: “UPS Offers Fulfillment Service for Multichannel Sellers” [Ecommerce Bytes]. “UPS announced a fulfillment service for small and medium sellers who sell on multiple marketplaces and platforms, from eBay, Amazon, and Etsy, to BigCommerce, Shopify, and Volusion, and Sears, Rakuten, and Walmart. It also supports Amazon Seller Fulfilled Prime. UPS eFulfillment handles storage, order processing, packaging and shipping. Each month, sellers are billed for fulfillment and shipping of orders and inventory storage or $1,000, whichever is higher. As a general rule, approximately 4-5 orders per day will place a merchant’s bill above the minimum. The company is currently offering a 60-day trial for new merchants in which it waives the minimum fee.” • So, Amazon buys trucks and jets, UPS boosts marketplaces that compete with Amazon. (If the other marketplaces could get a union bug on products that ship via UPS, that would be excellent.)

The Bezzle: “Here’s Everything That Just Went Down at Tesla” [Bloomberg]. Picking one tidbit: “In order to achieve these dramatic price cuts, Tesla is eliminating in-store sales. All sales will now be completed online.” • Certainly a bold solution for Tesla’s QA problem!

The Bezzle: “How Instagram Users are Building Businesses Based on Others’ Intellectual Property” [The Fashion Law]. “There is a growing pool of people using the Facebook-owned photo-sharing app to create and maintain accounts that aim to meet users’ pop culture fancies, whether they be meticulously-updated celebrity fan accounts, nostalgic fashion ones or something else altogether. More than merely using the 8-year old social media platform to display such imagery, though, the operators behind many of these accounts, having built up a dedicated following, are looking for ways to monetize their followers…. The practice is also potentially problematic when we consider the fact that in the vast majority of these cases, the curated imagery consists of individual photos for which the Instagram account operators do not have rights, specifically, copyright rights.” • The next Facebook scandal?

The Bezzle: Or maybe this is the next Facebook scandal:

The funds currently reside on the company’s NYSE Arca exchange, an electronic venue powered by algo-driven traders known as lead market makers. While these firms commit to offering the best prices for a large part of the day, the lack of human involvement can leave less traded products struggling if a large order hits just as trading begins or ends, or there aren’t enough liquidity providers making a market at any given time .” • Oh. I hope that doesn’t apply in other trading verticals…

“There is a word for the trauma caused by distance from nature” [Quartz]. “Disconnection from nature can be bad for our mental health. But there was no name for this particular malaise until Australian sustainability professor Glenn Albrecht coined the term psychoterratic, creating the beginning of a vocabulary to discuss the relationship between mental health and environment…. Wood wandering as therapy began in Japan in 1982, when the government introduced the concept of shinrin yoku, or “forest bathing.”… Japan now has 62 designated therapeutic woods, attracting about 5 million visitors annually.” • And here at NC we have antidotes and plants! So we are doing our best.

“About a dozen trees cut, dumped into Potomac River at Trump golf club in Virginia” [WaPo]. • No shinrin yoku for golfers!

“Wiped out: America’s love of luxury toilet paper is destroying Canadian forests” [Guardian]. “But America’s heavy use of toilet paper – particularly the pillowy soft kind – is worsening climate change and taking ‘a dramatic and irreversible toll’ on forests, especially the Canadian boreal forest, according to a new report by two major environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Stand.earth…. The report found that major brands’ refusal to switch to sustainable materials in toilet paper is having a devastating impact on forests and climate.” • I hope this isn’t too much information, but I hate “pillowy soft” toilet paper and never buy it. It never seems to, er, do the job [musical interlude].

“Labor Unions Are Skeptical of the Green New Deal, and They Want Activists to Hear Them Out” [The Intercept]. “With respect to labor issues, [Evan Weber, political director at Sunrise Movement] said, the Green New Deal is ‘leaps and bounds ahead of previous climate proposals.’ From his group’s perspective, if energy workers cannot find new jobs that pay them equal to what they’re currently earning, then ‘the government should step in and make up that difference,” he said. ‘I think the job guarantee is a really critical element of the Green New Deal,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t say if you’re a coal miner, you’re now going to go work on installing solar panels; it asks what are the jobs that make sense for your community and have this transition be something that’s locally determined.'” • Weber gets it. That said, doesn’t that approach disempower/disintermediate union leadership? Also interesting on carbon capture, struck from H.R. 109, but about which unions are enthusiastic.

“California Is Stuck Fighting Climate Change With a Bankrupt, Distrusted Company” [Bloomberg]. “The Camp Fire, as it was named, proved the deadliest and most damaging blaze in California history—85 people were killed, most of them in Paradise, and 18,800 buildings were destroyed. Cal Fire won’t conclude its investigation into the cause for months, possibly years, but the realization that PG&E’s equipment might be the culprit led in short order to a collapse in the utility’s stock price, the resignation of its chief executive officer, and, on Jan. 29, a declaration of Chapter 11 bankruptcy…. The bankruptcy is an early test of the state’s new governor, Gavin Newsom. But this isn’t just a California story. It’s also a multibillion-dollar case study for a set of once-abstract questions about corporate responsibility, societal risk, and climate change. California’s political leaders have long seen the power grid as a vital tool for reducing carbon emissions to curb global warming. What’s become clear is that the grid is also dangerously vulnerable to the already palpable effects of climate change.”

“Toledo Wants Local Control to Save Lake Erie” [The American Conservative]. “”The Lake Erie Bill of Rights” was a charter amendment that would be put on the ballot and could bestow upon this body of water the legal designation of “personhood.” That’s right, Toledo wanted to radically change the legality of the natural environment, basically making this 10,000 square-mile lake it sits upon its child, with the citizens of the Glass City the lake’s legal guardian. In essence, the parents then could sue on behalf of its child if the lake was bullied with polluters…. [T]he city ordinance passed this week easily, by a 61 percent majority vote.” • Interesting enough. The TAC spin: “Are American urban areas becoming more independent city-states than second-fiddle step children under the national umbrella?…. They are also dealing with mass transit funding, water conservation, and renewable energy more locally…. In some ways, what is evolving is that liberal entitlement programs and libertarian free-market independence can not only coexist, but can promote each other in big cities.” • Well, I’d expect liberals and conservatives policies to mesh, because as neoliberals both put markets first. So I don’t know what TAC’s reaction would be if left “universal concrete material benefits” were swapped in for liberal “entitlement programs” (emphasis on “entitlement” though complex eligibility requirements).

“The city of Angkor died a slow death” [Ars Technica]. “In the early Middle Ages, nearly one out of every thousand people in the world lived in Angkor, the sprawling capital of the Khmer Empire in present-day Cambodia. But by the 1500s, Angkor had been mostly abandoned—its temples, citadels, and complex irrigation network left to overgrowth and ruin. Recent studies have blamed a period of unstable climate in which heavy floods followed lengthy droughts, which broke down the infrastructure that moved water around the massive city. But it turns out Angkor’s waterworks may have been vulnerable to these changes because there was no one left to maintain and repair them. A new study suggests that Khmer rulers, religious officials, and city administrators had been steadily flowing out of Angkor to other cities for at least a century before the end.” • We should start moving Federal agencies out of DC….

“Hundreds pack Oregon hearing to oppose bill to end vaccine exemptions” [The Oregonian]. “Oregon and Washington are in the midst of a measles outbreak that has touched five people in Multnomah County and 65 in Clark County. But even for people who haven’t caught the highly contagious virus, the large number of cases has spurred hundreds more people to vaccinate this year than usual years. And it has restarted a long-running debate over whether parents and guardians should be allowed to send their children to school with the risk of exposing other children to measles…. Lawmakers who support the bill say that parents can still choose not to vaccinate — however, they will have to homeschool or find ways for children to go to school online…. the most passionate pleas came from those who compared their plight to Brown v. Board of Education and Nazi concentration camps, saying that those who choose not to vaccinate their children would be segregated unfairly . Some said they moved out of California after it passed a similar bill in 2015, and others said they would leave Oregon.” • Good. What’s the issue?

“An “Exciting But Dangerous Moment” for Medicare for All” [Common Dreams]. ” I am also completely convinced that imposing costs on patients at the time of healthcare use has no useful purpose. That seems like a radical idea, and even people on the liberal-left side of the spectrum sometimes say, well, having a reasonable copay is not such a bad idea to ensure that healthcare is not used sort of frivolously…. At the end of the day, maybe people paying for healthcare only really affects working class and poor people because well-off people are always going to be willing to pay a forty-dollar copay, right? It really is just a way of punishing the sick and the poor.” • Yep. I don’t know if there are any numbers on “frivolous” use of health care. I mean, who thinks going to the doctor is fun?

I drink my coffee and proceed to read the entirety of the Financial Times, excluding the particularly dense bits of the Companies & Markets section.” • Yes!!!! More: ” often find myself explaining my preference for the pink paper of liberal capitalism over the Gray Lady of cultural liberalism. The answer is simple: by literally any measure, the Financial Times is just a better paper. It covers the world as it is—a global battle not of ideas or values, but of economic and political interests…. FT’s reportage serves a readership that gambles on world events. The New York Times compulsively analyzes and scrutinizes everything Trump ad nauseam because it pays the bills by cultivating an audience, flattering them, and keeping them stimulated.” • It’s awfully fun to see a Chapo Trap House podcaster in the CJR, and on the FT, Frost is 100% correct. The weekend FT in print (my guilty pleasure) is far superior to the sadly provincial Sunday New York Times.

Suicide rates tend to be lower in counties with large Hispanic populations and higher in counties with large Native American populations….

507,Empty,2019-03-01T03:52:57Z,"Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed that Trudeau, one of his ministers and close advisors put a lot of pressure on her, including threats to intervene in a criminal prosecution.","MONTREAL: Canada’s former attorney general has provoked the worst political crisis for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government by accusing senior officials of attempting to head off the fraud prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

Here’s what you need to know.

What are the accusations?

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified at the House of Commons Justice Committee that Trudeau, one of his ministers and close advisors applied “inappropriate” pressure on her, including “veiled threats” to intervene in a criminal prosecution.

She said that from Sep to Dec 2018 officials “hounded” her to ask prosecutors to settle the case out of court.

The company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi’s reign.

Wilson-Raybould refused, and the trial is set to proceed.

The allegations were first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing unnamed sources, and were confirmed Wednesday by Wilson-Raybould herself while testifying at the justice committee.

Why help out SNC-Lavalin?

The Montreal-based construction and engineering company is one of the world’s largest.

It heavily lobbied the government, including senior officials in Trudeau’s office, for an out-of-court settlement that would include paying a fine and agreeing to put in place compliance measures.

It has argued that those responsible for alleged wrongdoing left the company long ago, and that holding it accountable for their criminal actions would severely hurt its business. A guilty verdict would notably result in a 10-year ban on bidding on Canadian government contracts.

There were suggestions in the press that it might also move its headquarters to London if that happened.

What’s the government’s position?

Trudeau said he “completely disagrees” with his former attorney general’s characterization of events, insisting that he and his team were rightly looking to safeguard up to 9,000 Canadian jobs, including in his own Quebec electoral district – which Wilson-Raybould referred to as improper “partisan political considerations.”

He has insisted that he made clear to his former attorney general that the “decision around SNC-Lavalin was Wilson-Raybould’s and hers alone to make.”

The attorney general and justice minister are conjoined positions in Canada, which critics say blurs their separate responsibilities – the former is the country’s top prosecutor and independent from the political, partisan role of a cabinet minister.

Wilson-Raybould suggested they should be split.

What are the political consequences for Trudeau?

The Globe and Mail newspaper unleashed a major political controversy when it reported on Feb 7 that Trudeau’s office attempted to pressure Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the case – months from the next election.

Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s first indigenous attorney general, was shuffled to veterans affairs in January, and a month later resigned from cabinet.

Days later, Trudeau’s longtime friend and top advisor Gerry Butts also quit.

“I think if the Liberals had not replaced Ms Wilson-Raybould in January as attorney general, we might never have heard about any of this,” said Daniel Beland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal.

The accusations weigh all the more heavily on Trudeau because he has repeatedly affirmed the independence of Canada’s judiciary, notably in the case of Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei who was arrested in Vancouver on a US warrant and faces possible extradition.

The opposition Conservatives have seized on the controversy to call for Trudeau’s resignation and a federal police investigation into the matter.

“Trudeau’s image,” said Beland, “has been tarnished. This is a prime minister who boasted about being a feminist and a strong advocate of reconciliation with indigenous peoples, so this has created dissonance damaging to him.”

A poll taken since the scandal erupted put the opposition Conservatives in the lead ahead of the ruling Liberals, for the first time since Trudeau came to power in 2015.

Andy Blatchford, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Canada said Friday it will allow the U.S. extradition case against Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou to proceed.

Canadian Department of Justice officials issued a statement saying they diligently reviewed the evidence and the case can go ahead.

Meng is due in court on March 6, at which time a date for her extradition hearing will be set. The decision to proceed is a formality and allows a judge to hear arguments on whether to grant the U.S. request.

Canada arrested the daughter of Huawei's founder at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver's airport. Meng is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran.

""There is sufficient evidence to be put before an extradition judge for decision,"" the statement said.

The statement took pains to stress Canada is following its extradition laws. Ultimately, Canada's justice minister must decide if Meng is extradited.

The case set off a diplomatic furor among the three countries, complicated high-stakes U.S.-China trade talks and severely damaged Beijing's relations with Ottawa.

China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng. A Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer since being arrested.

Meng is out on bail in Canada and living in one of her two Vancouver mansions awaiting extradition proceedings.

David Martin, Meng's lawyer, said in a statement: ""We are disappointed that the Minister of Justice has decided to issue an Authority to Proceed in the face of the political nature of the U.S. charges and where the President of the United States has repeatedly stated that he would interfere in Ms. Meng's case if he thought it would assist the U.S negotiations with China over a trade deal.""

Martin also said the charges against Meng are not crimes in Canada and that his client maintains her innocence.

China's embassy said it was ""utterly dissatisfied.""

""This is not a merely judicial case, but a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise,"" the embassy said in a statement.

Huawei, the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies, is a focus of U.S. security concerns. Washington has pressured other countries to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.

The U.S. and China have tried to keep Meng's case separate from their wider trade dispute, but President Donald Trump has undercut that intent, saying he would consider intervening in the case against Meng if it would be in the interest of U.S. national security or help forge a trade deal with Beijing.

Certainly, we’ve seen worse. Less-than-total failure is by Canadian standards actually a decent outcome. So, congratulations, Liberals, on achieving only baseline levels of dysfunction.

The PBO was looking into Canada’s decision to purchase 18 used F-18 jets from Australia. The increasingly elderly CF-18 jets operated by Canada are of the same vintage as those currently being retired by the Australians. Our own fleet has been eroded by attrition since the planes originally entered service in 1983 — you read that right, 36 years ago — and the Liberals decided Canada did not have enough jets available to meet our three primary simultaneous obligations: domestic patrol, continental defence in partnership with the United States, and supporting our allies abroad, if necessary. The 18 used Aussie birds, the government decided, are just what Canada needs to keep our squadrons filled out until 2032, when new jets are expected to arrive in service. The Air Force had estimated the entire project would cost $900 million; the PBO found that it would actually cost as much as $1.15 billion — more than 20 per cent more.

That’s not good, but a Canadian military procurement that only runs a fifth over budget would probably set some kind of efficiency record. Still, parsing the specifics of this procurement misses the main point: if Canada doesn’t have enough fighter jets, instead of buying a few extra old ones, why not just skip to buying lots of new ones?

The obvious answer is cost: A whole new fleet of modern jets would cost a lot more money than 18 old ones. True enough. But we’re going to need to buy the new fleet eventually, and the sooner the better. The billion we’re giving to Australia for old jets is a billion defence dollars that can’t be used to offset the cost of the new ones. And in Canada (especially) defence dollars are precious for their scarcity.

The Liberals are still locked in by preposterous conflicting campaign promises

The problem is that the Liberals are still locked in by preposterous conflicting campaign promises during the 2015 election: that they would select Canada’s next fighter jet in a fair and open competition, but that they also would refuse to consider the F-35 jet favoured by the Harper Conservatives. You cannot have a fair and open competition while excluding a leading candidate. The Liberal answer to this self-imposed problem seems to be just punting the final decision off as long as they can. Hence, the purchase of four-decade-old Australian castoffs (jets Australia no longer needs because it’s replacing its aging fleet with modern equipment).

511,Empty,2019-03-01T20:23:57Z,An item in the Canadian Bar Association's magazine applauds our chief justice's idea to take the Supreme Court on the road,"But will they have a merch table? A Feb. 25 item in the Canadian Bar Association’s magazine The National applauds our chief justice’s idea, pitched last year in the Globe, to take the Supreme Court out on the road like a rock band. “The idea,” Justice Richard Wagner said at the time, “is to be close to the people.” Close enough to mosh? “It’s all in line with our policy to be present in each province, to make sure that every citizen feels that the Supreme Court is there for them. And to give the chance to those people who cannot be in Ottawa to look at how it’s done.”

Any sign of a commitment to transparency on the part of the Canadian judicial system must be regarded as welcome, but the idea of the Supreme Court transforming itself into a travellin’ medicine show seemed to be a strange leap past more obvious measures. Any newspaperman would be tempted to suggest cracking down on judges’ lazy overuse of publication bans, for example, or perhaps moving the country’s courts one inch toward reforming what is still a wilderness of costly pre-digital methods of accessing public legal records.

Still, the CBA has given its official imprimatur to Chief Justice Wagner’s homely idea. Its president, Raymond Adlington, observed in a letter to Wagner that webcasting has brought SCC hearings “within reach of many Canadians … However, additional dimensions of understanding and appreciation of the SCC’s work are available for those able to attend in person.” These are not described. Perhaps they are beyond describing.

The idea of the Supreme Court transforming itself into a travellin' medicine show seemed to be a strange leap

There is something downright odd about Wagner’s dream. It may be desirable in some sense for the Supreme Court to be “close to the people,” but the Court may already be the most popular element in Canadian government, give or take the Queen. One wonders if Wagner really wants to enhance its public esteem, or merely wishes to demonstrate it.

But a supreme appellate court is not really designed to be the popular element in a modern constitution. We don’t elect it. Its membership is restricted to one profession. It’s an undemocratic — when necessary, anti-democratic — body drawn from a forensically trained elite.

And, uh, the last time I checked we had an institution called the “Commons.” This creature is rooted so firmly to the soil of Ottawa that when its physical home there begins to crumble, we unthinkingly find other quarters in Ottawa, rather than making it spend a decade in Medicine Hat or Trois-Rivierès. Something is backwards here. Why is no one suggesting that the Senate go on tour? (I know, I know. Don’t all suggest Mars at once.)

Perhaps it should not be held against the chief justice, but his proposal calls attention to the constant tension between populist and elitist forces in our semi-democracy — a theme that lies behind much of what is in the day-to-day newspaper headlines. The latest example is, of course, the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Here, perhaps before your actual eyes, you have a federal attorney general insisting that the work of her director of public prosecutions should remain independent and unsullied by base electoral motivations. Her colleagues complain that democratic responsibility is a good thing, and argue that an A-G is answerable to the prime minister Canadians chose with their votes, and suggest by implication that this sort of decision can legitimately be made with electoral popularity in view.

The position is not altogether without hypothetical merit: it is the specific circumstances that have created a stench. Reconciling the rule of law with the democratic spirit is one unceasing, stressful balancing act, to be performed with close attention to our history and culture. What I would add is that the current Liberal government is not very competent at this balancing act.

The current Liberal government is not very competent at this balancing act

Even before the SNC affair exploded one could not help feeling this. They introduced far-reaching changes to the organization of the Senate, trying to make it more “democratic” by … taking Senate appointments out of the hands of the prime minister, giving them to multiple layers of independent panels, and formally severing the Senate Liberals from their democratically elected colleagues in the Other Place. They did something similar with the Supreme Court itself, creating a board to oversee appointments that are constitutionally executed on the prime minister’s advice. They trusted their electoral reform mission to a multiparty committee, then sent what they had ordered back to the chef in a rage.

All these boards and panels are intended to provide the political cover and prestige associated with independence from partisan politics, but Liberals know that they are bound to end up with answers the prime minister likes, and can be evaded when they don’t. Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony on Wednesday gave the Canadian game away in a myriad of respects, and one was her account of the PMO’s suggestion that some legal notable could be found to do an “external review” of the decision to prosecute SNC.

Wilson-Raybould was not doing what was expected of her by the PMO — to make her own politicized review of the DPP’s finding — and if the external reviewer of her review made the same error, no doubt there could be an external review of the external review of the review. If the pretzel logic of this is making you queasy, completely irrespective of the corruption, join the club.

The push is coming from public-health advocates and from at least one Liberal MP, Toronto’s Nathaniel Erksine-Smith.

Federal Liberal backbencher Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and public-health advocates are pushing the Trudeau government to immediately provide a safer supply of drugs to address a growing number of opioid-related deaths across the country. ( Colin Perkel / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

“One of my constituents lost her nephew to the opioid crisis because of fentanyl and the lack of a safe supply,” he said. “If we want to save lives, we know that thousands of Canadians are dying because of an unsafe supply. If we want to save lives, we need to make that supply safe.” Public-health experts are also advocating for removing of criminal sanctions for possession of small quantities of opioids to help to reduce stigma in seeking treatment, Erksine-Smith added. British Columbia’s provincial health officer has called for Ottawa to look at ways of supplying safer opioid drugs, saying B.C. and other parts of the country are grappling with a poisonous street-drug supply that is killing people because they can’t tell what’s in the drugs they use.

Article Continued Below

His organization was part of a Canadian coalition that called on the government last fall to address the issue of supply, pointing to toxicology results from across Canada that reveal opioids purchased in the illegal market are often contaminated with fentanyl and its analogues. Those can be much more potent than the opioids users believe they are consuming, and the difference between an ordinary dose and a lethal one is tiny. “When you are in an emergency and the stuff you can get illegally is largely contaminated and may kill you even if you are seeking to be safe, as most people are, then we need to figure out, ‘OK, how do we substitute something safer for you to use instead of what you’re currently purchasing on the street and that is killing too many people,’ “ Elliott said in an interview this week.

The opioid crisis is affecting every community in every province and territory, said NDP health critic Don Davies, adding that Canadians understand that people are losing their lives as a result of “poison street supply.” “Nobody is advocating drug use,” he said. “But as a public-policy response, they recognize that at least if we can control the supply, we can keep people alive and that’s a better public-policy approach than letting them die in the streets or alone in their homes.” Davies said he shares the concern of advocates who recently expressed concern that the federal Liberals won’t want to address the issue in an election year. Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said she asked her department to explore options to address the toxic supply in the fall, adding she looks forward to seeing advice from Canada’s top public-health doctor Theresa Tam on how to move forward. “When we’ve consulted with many stakeholders, professionals and also individuals that use drugs, they’ve indicated the issue of safe supply is something we should really be looking at,” Petitpas Taylor said. “That’s exactly what we are doing.” In a December interview, Tam told The Canadian Press that said clamping down on the market-driven supply of illicit drugs is not easy. “I think my plea is an escalated, compassionate response,” she said. “To implement a lot of these measures, you need society to be on side.” Tam’s comments came after the Public Health Agency show that 94 per cent of opioid-related deaths in 2019 were classified as “accidental poisonings.” Nearly 72 per cent were unintentional deaths involving highly toxic fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.",Liberals face pressure to act on safer drug supply amid opioid-related deaths,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/27/liberals-face-pressure-to-act-on-safer-drug-supply-amid-opioid-related-deaths.html
513,Empty,2019-02-25T10:00:00Z,"Don’t expect to see the much-discussed national pharmacare plan in the March budget, writes David Olive.","Universal pharmacare has long been in place widely in Europe. The Liberal-dominated Commons health committee called last year for universal pharmacare, because about 20 per cent of Canadians are uninsured or under-insured for drugs. And roughly one in 10 Canadians goes without prescription drugs because they cannot afford them.

In the spring budget, just over three weeks from now, the Trudeau government will once again pass on the chance to finally give Canadians the universal pharmacare that doctors and a multitude of studies have shown is needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the country’s prescription-drug bill.

That’s not what the doctor ordered, but it is what the insurance lobby wants. And the Trudeau government will oblige the private insurers, who fear having to compete with universal pharmacare.

Morneau will speak glowingly of how the Trudeau government is “filling the gaps” in our patchwork system of drug spending by government, private drug plans, and the $3.6 billion that Canadians spend out of pocket on prescriptions. Actually, Morneau will add complexity to the patchwork system rather than streamline it.

But in his next budget, which was set last week for March 19 , Finance Minister Bill Morneau will reject that holistic solution. He will instead announce narrowly targeted partial coverage of selected patient groups.

A government that has already broken its promise to balance the books by now understandably blanches at the estimated $20.4 billion annual cost of universal pharmacare. But the country’s total drug bill would actually drop by an annual $4.2 billion, according to the federal budget watchdog, due to volume buying by a single provider.

Putting private-sector insurers ahead of the people doesn’t sound like an effective means of winning a tight election contest in October.

The Alberta election campaign hasn’t officially started yet, and already the man poised to win it has effectively declared war on the rest of the country.

As premier, after a provincial election that must be held by May 31, Jason Kenney will demand that Ottawa sunder the federation by withholding transfer payments from provinces that don’t do Alberta’s bidding (that would be B.C., Quebec and to a lesser extent Ontario) by deep-sixing their misgivings about new heavy-oil pipelines in their backyards.

If those pipelines don’t rapidly materialize, Kenney will hold a nationally divisive Alberta referendum on the equalization-payments system. And he wants Ottawa to debauch the Federal Court of Appeal, which ordered a halt to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, by using a Constitutional provision to overturn that decision.

At home, Kenney will set Indigenous communities against each other, favouring pro-pipeline communities with subsidies (that sure sounds like a bribe), and withholding the same from pipeline opponents.

He’ll throw Alberta teachers into confusion over elements of the curriculum that strike him as an NDP socialist plot. And he’ll strip farm workers of recently won means of redress for workplace injuries, on the untested theory that a safe farm is an unprofitable one.

Premier Rachel Notley has already blamed Canada for Alberta’s self-inflicted woes. Expect four more years of the same, only ramped up to firebrand level.

But understand that the next spell of Wildrose Country vitriol is coming from a good place. Kenney says he is simply “moving Alberta from an apologetic or defensive posture to an assertive posture.”

Apologetic? We await with interest a list from Kenney of Alberta’s apologies.

No rush, our patience is infinite.

Tariff-bully Trump: First Canada, now Germany

Canada may soon have an ally in Germany in our mutual despair over the U.S. as a threat to our economies.

Germany is bracing for the same 25 per cent tariffs on U.S. auto imports that U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Canada with in pressuring Ottawa for a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that neither Ottawa nor Canada’s business community much likes.

The looming tariffs on the German auto sector threaten to pitch Europe’s biggest economy into recession.

Recall that Trump justifies America’s continued 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian steel on the specious grounds that imported Canadian steel girders somehow threaten U.S. national security.

A long-awaited report by Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, a former steel baron, is expected to make the same bogus assertion about imports from Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG.

Likely the best way this turns out is a compromise that imposes quotas on German auto imports, but that would be damaging in reducing the revenues of a key German economic sector.

A more productive outcome would be a German commitment to make more vehicles in the U.S. The Germans already do so, of course.

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said recently she doesn’t understand how the BMWs built in South Carolina are a threat to U.S. national security. She might be wiser to put ironies aside and accurately broadcast Trump’s tariffs as an attack on Europe, given that the German auto sector assembles vehicles and sources parts widely across that continent.

None of this would be an issue, of course, if only Detroit made cars as well as the Germans, who perfected the internal-combustion engine in the 19th century and have never looked back.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is embroiled in his first major scandal since taking office.

His former Justice Minister and attorney general accused him in a recent hearing of improperly pressuring his officials to drop a major investigation into an influential construction company.

Officials said that Trudeau tried to block them from bringing bribery and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin because of its economic importance.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing scrutiny after former Justice Minister and member of parliament Jody Wilson-Raybould publicly accused him of trying a squash a corruption and fraud investigation into an influential Canadian construction company.

Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his aides of improperly pressuring her to seek a financial settlement with SNC-Lavalin,The Globe and Mail first reported in early February. The construction and engineering giant holds multiple contracts with the Canadian government and employees approximately 9,000 Canadians.

In her Wednesday testimony before the House of Commons’ Justice Committee, Wilson-Raybould said the government pressured the Justice Department to settle with SNC-Lavalin after prosecutors charged the company in 2015 with bribing the Libyan government during the reign of dictator Muammar al-Ghadaffi.

If found guilty of the charges, the company could be banned from doing business with the Canadian government for a decade, potentially leaving the 3,400 Quebec residents employed by SNC-Lavalin out of a job. One of Quebec’s pension funds is also one of the largest shareholders in SNC-Lavalin, owning a 20% stake in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Neil Hall/Getty Images Trudeau is embroiled in his first major scandal since taking office.

Wilson-Raybould and other officials said the possible economic implications of the indictment were fair considerations. François Legault, Quebec’s current premier, recommended a financial settlement over concerns that the indictment would push the company to leave Canada altogether, according to the Journal.

But some Justice officials suggested that Trudeau also had political motivations to interfere with prosecutorial proceedings in order to save jobs in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Trudeau and his Liberal Party to carry in order to maintain control over the government in this October’s federal elections.

Wilson-Raybould testified that she “experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion” over the course of several meetings and conversations with Trudeau himself and his advisors, including top aide Michael Wernick.

Both Trudeau and Wernick have forcefully denied putting political pressure to drop the charges on Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from her position in Trudeau’s cabinet after she was moved to a lower-level role in the veterans affairs’ department amid the fallout of the scandal.

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of these events,” Trudeau said of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.

Wernick also disputed Wilson-Raybould’s testimony that he also applied pressure on her to drop the charges, but said that he communicated to her that “a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.”

While Canada’s ethics commissioner is investigating the matter to formally determine whether Trudeau improperly interfered in the probe, the scandal may already be hurting his electoral prospects.

A recent Ipsos poll found Trudeau’s approval rating declining, and the Conservative party pulling ahead of the Liberals on the generic ballot.

Pollster Darrell Bricker told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the scandal “hits at what gives the Liberal Party its appeal: the prime minister,” and could be devastating if Trudeau doesn’t re-claim control over the narrative soon.

515,Empty,2019-03-01T22:03:38Z,Kevin Carmichael: Statistics Canada’s new tally of gross domestic product should prompt gut checks all over Ottawa,"Thank goodness the Trudeau government abandoned its promise to balance the budget in 2019: We’d be looking at a recession if it hadn’t.

Statistics Canada’s new tally of economic output should prompt gut checks all over Ottawa, from the central bank to the Prime Minister’s Office to the opposition benches. Everyone appears to have overestimated Canada’s ability to generate economic growth without the nitrous boost of zero interest rates. The world beating economy of 2017 wilted in the face of Donald Trump’s trade wars, weaker oil prices, and somewhat higher borrowing costs.

In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau boasted about leading the strongest economy in the Group of Seven. For now, he oversees one of the weakest

Gross domestic product slowed to an annual rate of 0.4 per cent over the final three months of 2018, compared with two per cent in the third quarter, StatCan reported on Friday.

Government spending, an unusually large accumulation of inventories, and household expenditures barely outweighed a big drop in investment, avoiding a contraction. Overall, GDP expanded 1.8 per cent last year, compared with three per cent in 2017, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau boasted about leading the strongest economy in the Group of Seven. For now, he oversees one of the weakest.

Not good. The Bank of Canada warned last month that we had slid into a soft patch. However, the central bank’s idea of a weaker fourth quarter was an annual growth rate of 1.3 per cent, the estimate from its latest outlook, published last month.

The miss suggests the economy isn’t running as hot as policy makers thought, which could prompt them to slow, or even stop, their march to higher interest rates. We won’t have to wait long to find out, as the central bank’s next policy announcement is set for Wednesday. Lynn Patterson, a deputy governor, is scheduled to deliver an update on the central bank’s thinking at an event in Hamilton the following day.

“The GDP report in unambiguously weak,” said Sébastien Lavoie, a former Bank of Canada economist who now works at Laurentian Bank in Montreal. “It clearly increases the risk that the BoC might not be able to increase its policy rate during 2019.”

Some already are saying that Stephen Poloz, the Bank of Canada governor, erred in orchestrating five interest-rate increases between July, 2017 and October, 2018. (Policy makers left the benchmark rate unchanged at meetings in December and January.) Maybe only a few hikes would have sufficed to keep a lid on inflation? Consumer spending grew at the weakest rate in a decade and output related to housing plunged at an annual rate of almost 15 per cent, the most since the financial crisis.

Before you blame the central bank for the slowdown, keep in mind that the policy rate was a ridiculously low 0.5 per cent in early 2017, and the current rate is only 1.75 per cent. Poloz is no John Crow, the former Bank of Canada governor known for putting low inflation ahead of economic growth. The current head of the central bank said all along that he knew households would be sensitive to higher interest rates, if only because borrowing costs had been so low for so long. There were good arguments for raising interest rates even higher, yet Poloz resisted. He knew the economy wasn’t ready.

But central bankers have sensitivities of their own. They internalized the lessons of the financial crisis and were determined not to repeat their mistakes. Canadian households were borrowing at rates that could only end in disaster. They had to end that mania or risk a wave of personal defaults. The policy rate remains below the neutral rate, the setting at which the Bank of Canada estimates that monetary policy is neither encouraging or discouraging borrowing. In other words, money still is on sale, so interest rates aren’t the problem.

If you feel the need to blame an authority for this slump, you might take a look around the PMO or the finance minister’s office.

Ahead of last year’s budget, virtually every industry association called on the government to do something about competitiveness. The uncertain future of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the country’s inability to build pipelines was hurting business sentiment, and U.S. tax cuts had erased an advantage that Canada had enjoyed for years. The Bank of Canada acknowledged this by cutting its outlook to reflect the likelihood that business investment would be diverted to North America’s largest economy.

Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau did nothing. The 2018 budget had little to say about competitiveness. They made up for it in the fall economic statement, cutting taxes on investment and promising to cut regulation. But the damage was done: Investment in machinery and equipment dropped almost five per cent in the fourth quarter, the second consecutive quarterly decline.

Monetary policy needed more help from fiscal policy at the start of last year, but the government didn’t provide any. The Opposition might seek to exploit that failure, but if it does, it would have to explain how its constant nagging about budget deficits is helping matters: The latest GDP figures show that austerity would only hurt the economy now.

The recovery from the Great Recession, and then the recovery from the oil shock, were fuelled by household debt. During that time, neither the Conservatives nor the Liberals did enough to nurture an economy that would be capable of powering through turbulence. Now, as the stimulants wear off, we are getting a look at the true state of Canada’s economy. It’s no world beater, that’s for sure.

“True Confessions of Texas Vote Harvesters” [RealClearPolitics]. “The most prevalent practice of harvesting begins with obtaining voter lists, which are public records. These lists help ballot harvesters identify the elderly and the sick in their communities. The ballot harvesters encourage these neighbors to request mail-in ballots — or may even request them on behalf of unaware voters. Often, a harvester shows up at a voter’s home with an offer of help around the time the ballot arrives in the mail. Sitting with the voter, the harvester might advise who would be the best candidate for a race that most voters are unfamiliar with. Sometimes the harvester will help fill out the ballot. She – since vote harvesters are usually female — might offer to mail the ballot for the voter.” • The numbers seem penny ante, but local elections are often low-turnout and decided by just a few votes.

Stats Watch

Factory Orders, December 2018: “Factory orders have significantly missed Econoday’s consensus for a second straight month, inching… higher:” [Econoday]. “A glaring weakness in December and November orders are sharp 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent declines for core capital goods orders (nondefense ex-aircraft). This is telling evidence that business investment is down which in turn may well betray a downturn in business confidence…. Manufacturing is disproportionately exposed to global demand and the sector’s slump is a convincing reflection of general slowing in foreign economies, something that the Federal Reserve underscored as a key reason for its January downshift to neutral monetary policy.”

MBA Mortgage Applications, week of February 22, 2019: “Lower mortgage rates this year are giving a lift to home buying” [Econoday]. “Based in part on rising mortgage demand, forecasters are looking for a strong 1.0 percent gain for the pending homes index later this morning that would end three straight declines.”

“Pending Home Sales Index, January 2019: “There is hope after all for the housing sector which, before today’s pending home sales report, had been suffering through a nearly uninterrupted series of below consensus results. But not the January pending home sales index which, likely reflecting rising demand tied to lower mortgage rates, surged” [Econoday]. “[T]oday’s report does point at better results ahead.”

International Trade in Goods, December 2018: “The effects of cross-border trade actions have been difficult to pinpoint in the national economic data but outlines may be appearing in goods trade” [Econoday]. “The nation’s goods deficit swelled to a much larger-than-expected [level].”

Retail Inventories [Advance], December 2018: Rose, “roughly match[ing] the profile of wholesale trade and points squarely at a sudden overhang for inventories” [Econoday]. “Rising inventories are a fixed plus in the GDP calculation but are a minus for future production and employment if they significantly exceed underlying sales.”

Wholesale Inventories [Advance], December 2018: “As far as inventories go, they look heavy especially relative to sales which fell” [Econoday].

Tech: “AAP Reports E-Books Sales Fall, Audiobooks Rise” [Forbes]. “The Association of American Publishers released their recent report of 2018 stats on revenue for consumer book publishers…. The most noticeable increase was in audiobook sales, jumping by 37.1%, an additional $127.1 million since 2017. The AAP notes that downloaded audio (as opposed to physical audiobook formats) has been the format with the most growth since 2013. “This is the third consecutive year that audiobooks saw double-digit growth (+37.1%) and eBook revenue declined (-3.6%),” the AAP report says. The AAP says that in 2017, e-books sales totaled over 1 billion in sales, but the sales in 2018 still fell.” • Completely different mediums. I love listening to podcasts, especially since I can multitask; the ebook experience is completely different and a lot less pleasant than a real book. Also, I find it hard to imagine that audiobooks can track you, though doubtless somebody’s working on that.

Musk has until March 11 to tell the court why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.” • “Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that is entirely ir-elephant to what I was talking about.”

This detail: “Mike Ferner, [Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie (ACLE)] founder, was not at the watch party because he underwent emergency surgery Tuesday night for a bleeding ulcer. … Hours before his medical procedure, Mr. Ferner told The Blade that efforts such as the Lake Erie Bill of Rights show ‘why people need to start relying on our democracy to hold polluters accountable.'” • I would bet that ulcer is what a friend of mine in the landfill fight called “the cost of citienship,” which is far too high.

“Grasslands More Reliable Carbon Sink Than Trees” [UC Davis]. “A study from the University of California, Davis, found that grasslands and rangelands are more resilient carbon sinks than forests in 21st century California. As such, the study indicates they should be given opportunities in the state’s cap-and-and trade market, which is designed to reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030…. Unlike forests, grasslands sequester most of their carbon underground, while forests store it mostly in woody biomass and leaves. When wildfires cause trees to go up in flames, the burned carbon they formerly stored is released back to the atmosphere. When fire burns grasslands, however, the carbon fixed underground tends to stay in the roots and soil, making them more adaptive to climate change.” • I recall some readers are grassland fans. And now I suppose I have to understand what California’s cap-and-trade market is actually doing, in detail MR SUBLIMINAL Everything is like CalPERS —

“Think Locally, Act Globally” [Eschaton]. “The reverse of that was the slogan in some environmentalist circles for decades. Environmentalism is personal virtue. Buy the right products, recycle, minimize your carbon footprint in certain ways, etc…. Environmentalism-as-personal-virtue was a bad route. It isn’t a substitute for collective action. … And the virtues of many in the environmental movement are, well, wrong (#notallenvironmentalists). Dense cities are green.* The way to save nature is to stay the hell away from it…. The entire country doesn’t have to look like Manhattan, but people should get that we’d get a lot closer to saving the world if it did.”

“America landed a man on the moon. Climate change calls for the same bold, can-do spirit.” [Sean Patrick Maloney, USA Today]. “I have tried to pass along that same can-do Americanism to my kids. That’s why I am so disappointed by the melodrama surrounding the Green New Deal resolution. Meekness in the face of crisis isn’t what America is all about. My concern isn’t with the bad-faith arguments from Republican climate change deniers…. What worries me more are those who believe in climate change but offer no real solutions. From fretful hand-wringing to derisive sniggering to outright dismissal, folks who say climate change is an existential crisis have also cherry-picked or distorted elements of the Green New Deal to reduce the whole idea to pie-in-the-sky fantasy. This undermines the seriousness of the threat, downplays the scale of an adequate response, and sticks us with an untenable status quo.” • Maloney represents NY-18, which Trump won by two points, and his caucus memberships include the horrid No Labels “coalition,” so he wouldn’t be my first pick to write such an Op-Ed. I find this encouraging.

“Meet the 16-year-old who went viral after asking Dianne Feinstein to support a Green New Deal” [Grist]. Isha Clarke is the activist Feinstein offered an internship to. Clarke: “After the whole interaction, we were leaving and I wanted to bring it back to the purpose [of the meeting], and thank her for her time, because I recognize that she’s a busy lady. She said, ‘Thank you and I really want you to have an internship here so you can understand what it’s like and understand all of the nuance and things like that.’… The reason why I would take the internship is because I think it’s an incredible opportunity. To be blunt, you have to learn how to play the game to change it…. And I think that it’s also important to have my voice be in the room [like Elizabeth Warren –lambert]. But I wouldn’t take it for a couple of reasons. No. 1: I don’t know what the internship actually entails. Sometimes high school students just do paperwork, and that’s not what I’m interested in. But mostly it’s because I don’t want my having an internship with her to turn into a justification for the whole situation. It’s already kind of being used like that. People are saying, ‘There was a happy ending, and Senator Feinstein offered a girl an internship and whoopdeedoo.’ And I don’t want me having a position there to be a way to cover up everything that just happened.” • Since today is my day to kick puppies, let me say I’m sure elites are hoping this youth movement ends up just like the last one; we don’t hear much about the Parkland Kids now, do we? On the bright side, I thought Clarke was pretty level-headed.

“Overcoming the Ideology of Climate Inaction” [Project Syndicate]. “Climate wonks regularly warn that ‘business as usual’ cannot avert climate change. But, while that is true, the phrase itself betrays a neoliberal obsession with making “business” fit for purpose – a tweak here, a nudge there – as if citizens were merely passive subjects of larger economic forces. We all have an active role to play in shaping the economy. But to do so requires that we first shake off the constraints that neoliberal thinking has placed on the public imagination…. The policies that have resulted from this mindset – defunding or otherwise curtailing public investment, deregulating the economy, and decentralizing democracy – have prevented the US from weaning itself off fossil fuels.” • See, e.g. “Obama takes credit for U.S. oil-and-gas boom: ‘That was me, people'” [Washington Times].

“The ‘Green New Deal’ Out West” [Power]. “California’s cap-and-trade program (a cornerstone of the California carbon reduction program) was extended last year through 2030, with deepened regulatory targets reducing emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030…. Based on 2016 GHG reporting, California has already met its 2020 GHG reduction target. From 2001 to 2016, the carbon intensity of California’s economy decreased by 38 percent, while the state gross domestic product grew 41 percent…. More than a decade ago, California initiated the nation’s market-based efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Oregon and Washington are poised to expand that effort, linking carbon credits and offset programs into California and Canada.” • It sounds good (but let’s remember that biosphere collapse is not driven by greenhouse gas alone; the best explanation so far for insect population collapse is habitat destruction). Let’s also remember, as Yves points out today, that cap-and-trade is a trade, i.e., has traders, therefore speculation, therefore volatility.

“State cap-and-trade systems offer evidence that carbon pricing can work” [The Conversation]. “I led a Fletcher School Climate Policy Lab team that reviewed carbon pricing policies in 15 jurisdictions to see how they work in the real world, not just in theory. We found that in all cases carbon pricing seems to be a cost-effective method to cut carbon pollution.” • “Cost effective” makes my spidey sense — my priors, in fact — twitch. “We certainly don’t want preventing the ocean from boiling to be expensive MR SUBLIMINAL Here, have another F-35 .

“Want a Green New Deal? Here’s a better one.” [Washington Post]. The conventional wisdom: “If the market can redirect spending most efficiently, money should not be misallocated on vast new government spending or mandates… Want a Green New Deal? Here’s a better one.” • I ran this link on the 25th, but here it is again, just as a discussion starter. One obvious objection is that since the State structures the market, the state-level cap-and-trade programs we above would not have to account for, say, the Defense Department, an enormous greenhouse gas producer. (Is there a short, pithy word for “greenhouse gas producer”? Other than “cow”? And hopefully pejorative?) One can well imagine a DoD examption being carved out in any Federal cap-and-trade program (which would, presumably, over-ride state programs). The same objection applies to Federal policy decisions driven (presumably) by geopolitical concerns, like Obama’s insane boost to fracking. Price or not price, we should have left it in the ground, surely?

Health Care

UPDATE “House Democrats unveil a sweeping ‘Medicare-for-all’ bill — here’s what’s in it” [CNBC]. “Jayapal highlighted support from various labor unions and public interest groups on Wednesday. She also disputed the notion that House members from ideologically balanced districts would not support the plan. One congressman who won a swing district last year — Rep. Josh Harder of California — appeared with Jayapal to back her plan Wednesday.” • Good for Harder: “Josh Harder [DCCC; e][M]” (from my pre-election worksheet). “e” is for education, so it looks like he’s not a CIA Democrat, at least.

UPDATE “Medicare-for-all: Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s new bill, explained” [Sarah Kliff, Vox]. “Eventually, though, everyone would all end up in the same plan, which includes an especially robust set of benefits…. The plan is also significantly more generous than the single-payer plans run by America’s peer countries. The Canadian health care system, for example, does not cover vision or dental care, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, or home health services…. What’s more, the Jayapal plan does not require consumers pay any out-of-pocket spending on health aside from prescription drugs. This means there would be no charge when you go to the doctor, no copayments when you visit the emergency room. All those services would be covered fully by the universal Medicare plan. This too is not in line with international single-payer systems, which often require some payment for seeking most services.” • I like Kliff, but wow, liberals really love those co-pays, don’t they? Free at the point of care is essential; complex eligibility systems will always serve as vectors for neoliberal infestations.

Class Warfare

“U.S. Wage Growth Is ‘Higher Than We Think,’ Fed Researchers Say” [Industry Week]. “U.S. workers are experiencing larger wage growth than you’ve been reading in the news. That’s according to a new study by a group of researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Cleveland. The researchers conclude that average hourly earnings — or AHE —reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics understates real wage growth by ‘a notable amount.'” • “Notable” being, as I read it, between 2.1% and 2.5%. I’ve been waiting for an explanation of why auto loan defaults are increasing; this looks like it.

“Group of New York Lawmakers Calls for Legalization of Prostitution” [NBC News]. “Senators Jessica Ramos, Julia Salazar and Brad Hoylman, as well as Assemblyman Richard Gottfried are working with Decrim NY to introduce a bill to rewrite the state’s penal code to decriminalize sex trades in the state of New York. Decrim NY is a coalition to “decriminalize, decarcerate and destigmatize the sex trade in New York City and state.” In a Daily News op-ed, Ramos and Salazar urged for the end of criminalization of sex work while Gottfried and Hoylman spoke out about the Decrim NY in a series of tweets where they expressed their support.” • Courageous! Does this mean Eliot Spitzer can return to public life? He was certainly a better Attorney General than the flaccid Schneiderman!

“Want to Know If Someone Is Manipulating Data?” [MedPage Today]. “Deception of the audience in presenting a clinical trial is based on the same strategy of misdirection that magicians use to make their performances work. Believe it or not, there are dozens of possible forms of misdirection that are possible when presenting the results of a clinical trial…. First and most important is the trick of missingness. The best way to make data look better is to take out data that you do not like or not bother to collect it at all. If the presentation does not account for missing data, all sorts of mischief are possible. Let us say that you have randomized 600 patients in a trial. According to the intention-to-treat principle that governs the integrity of clinical trials, you need to show data on 600 patients. But often, investigators will show you data on 550 patients, having taken 50 patients out of the analysis. Clinical investigators can provide all sorts of reasons why the 50 patients are missing…. The truth: Missingness is never random, and if it is large enough, it is always a source of bias…. When is missingness important? When the amount of missing data is a meaningful proportion of the size of the treatment effect. Example: if the treatment group had 25 fewer deaths than the control group, missing data in 15 patients is meaningful. If the treatment group had 200 fewer deaths than the control group, missing data in five patients is very unlikely to be relevant.” • The data is quicker than the eye…..

“Cross-cultural evidence does not support universal acceleration of puberty in father-absent households” [The Royal Society]. “Father absence in early life has been shown to be associated with accelerated reproductive development in girls. Evolutionary social scientists have proposed several adaptive hypotheses for this finding…. Empirical evidence to support these hypotheses, however, has been derived from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) populations…. We find that relationships between father absence and age at puberty are more varied in contexts beyond WEIRD societies, and when relationships beyond the father–daughter dyad are considered. This has implications for our understanding of how early-life environment is linked to life-history strategies, and for our understanding of pathways to adult health outcomes, given that early reproductive development may be linked to negative health outcomes in later life.” • The section on “4. WEIRD populations are weird” is also well worth a read; reminds me of Piltdown Man, “the earliest Englishman.”

517,Empty,2019-03-02T00:44:02Z,He is the fifth person to hold the portfolio in less than four years under the Liberals,"OTTAWA — When he was named Friday as Canada’s latest minister of veterans affairs, Lawrence MacAulay was given the difficult task of sweetening the Trudeau government’s relations with embittered veterans and selling the Liberals’ controversial pension plan for those injured in uniform.

MacAulay’s move to veterans affairs from the Agriculture Department, where he had been for the past three years, was part of a mini-cabinet shuffle prompted by Jody Wilson-Raybould’s sudden resignation from the portfolio after only a few weeks in the job.

The move comes at a critical time for veterans and the Liberals, who enjoyed strong support from former service members in the last election but are now facing widespread anger and frustration from the community ahead of this year’s vote.

That frustration is fed by the fact MacAulay is the fifth person to hold the veterans-affairs portfolio in less than four years under the Liberals, counting Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan’s temporary assignment after Wilson-Raybould’s resignation.

He's going to have a lot of relationships to mend and fix due to the constant turnover that we've seen in the minister's role

“What it has sent as a message is that the veterans portfolio hasn’t been a priority, that our veterans themselves have not been a priority to the government,” said Virginia Vaillancourt, national president of the Union of Veterans’ Affairs Employees. “And he’s going to have a lot of relationships to mend and fix due to the constant turnover that we’ve seen in the minister’s role.”

MacAulay’s appointment Friday was met with some extremely cautious optimism given his past role in the 1990s as secretary of state for veterans affairs under Jean Chretien and the fact the longtime MP is from P.E.I., where Veterans Affairs Canada is headquartered.

Yet there were also questions about whether he is simply a placeholder given that the next election is only a few months away — and whether he will actually be able to address the veteran community’s numerous concerns and grievances.

In an interview with The Canadian Press before he flew to P.E.I. Friday, MacAulay said his plan is to sit down and take a close look at “what’s there, what’s been done and what can be done better for veterans.”

Yet he also defended the Trudeau government’s record, saying “it’s kind of a shame” if veterans feel the Liberals have been ignoring them or have broken promises to the community since taking office.

“My understanding is that what we indicated we would do we are doing or in the process of doing,” MacAulay said, citing the re-opening of several Veterans Affairs offices closed by the Conservatives and the introduction of a new pension plan as examples.

“I think you’d find there’s a lot of veterans who are quite pleased with what’s taken place.”

Yet that pension plan, in particular, has been anything but well received — as MacAulay is likely to find out.

The federal Liberals promised during the last election to reinstate a lifelong disability pension after many veterans complained the lump-sum payment and other benefits that replaced it in 2006 were far less generous.

While the pledge was widely interpreted as a promise to bring back the pre-2006 pension system, the Trudeau government instead introduced its own version that will come into effect on April 1, which many veterans have described as a betrayal.

An analysis by the parliamentary budget office last week found the Liberals’ so-called Pension for Life plan is not only less generous than the pre-2006 pension, but will provide less financial compensation to the most severely injured veterans than even the current system does.

“(MacAulay) has to do more than just verbiage. He has to come back with some specific proposals to address the inequity,” said Brian Forbes, chairman of the National Council of Veteran Associations, which represents more than 60 veteran groups across Canada.

“I truly believe that if he doesn’t do something along those lines, then the election has to be impacted at least to some extent by the fact that many veterans will either stay home or vote into another party. They’re not going to get that grandiose support they got in 2015.”

There have also been concerns about the long delays and obstacles many veterans continue to face getting services and benefits, which Royal Canadian Legion national executive director Brad White said “has to be cleaned up.”

One of the key questions, however, is how much room — and money — MacAulay will have to manoeuvre before the writ is dropped given that the federal budget will be unveiled in less than three weeks and many of its measures have already been nailed down.

“So things are pretty well set,” White said. “I’m not going to say in stone. But I think it’s pretty well set for the rollout of the budget.”","Lawrence MacAulay, Canada’s latest minister of veterans affairs, faces embittered community",Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/macaulay-faces-tough-task-repairing-relations-with-angry-veterans-community-2

""She talked very powerfully and stood her ground and let everyone know that this wasn't for herself or personal gain,"" said Alannah McKay, president of the University of Manitoba Indigenous Students' Association, from Berens River First Nation, Man., and Muskrat Dam First Nation, Ont.

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould, a member of the We Wai Kai Nation in B.C., gave her side of the SNC-Lavalin affair in hours-long testimony before the House of Commons.

Among many claims, she alleged she faced pressure and ""veiled threats"" from senior officials with the Prime Minister's Office to reach an agreement to help the engineering firm dodge criminal prosecution.

Jody Wilson-Raybould appears at the House of Commons justice committee on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)

SNC-Lavalin is alleged to have used bribery to secure government contracts with Libya. While minister of justice, Wilson-Raybould says there was a calculated campaign to push her to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with the company so it could avoid going to trial.

She says it was on the heels of that campaign and her refusal to budge on the issue that she was demoted to minister of veterans affairs, followed shortly by her resignation from cabinet. She remains a Member of Parliament for the Liberals.

'Role model to me'

Native studies major Ashley Daniels, youth chief for the Southern Chiefs' Organization, said Wilson-Raybould sent a message.

She's calling out that hypocrisy. - Alyssa Bird

""I grew up in Brandon so there was a lot of non-Indigenous people, so when I see an Indigenous woman empowered and being strong and resilient … that's a role model to me personally,"" said Daniels, who is from Swan Lake First Nation

""That means we can be there, we can break barriers, we can sit in that position and even leave that position and publicly announce it and the reasons why.""

Systems 'not made for us'

For criminology and native studies major Kayla Lariviere, seeing Wilson-Raybould reach the heights she has in the Canadian government is encouraging.

""For Indigenous people, we know that these systems — whether it's university or politics — were not made for us,"" said Lariviere, who is Métis and Filipino. ""So to see an Indigenous person hold such a high position like Jody had, and to walk away from that, is very empowering.""

Alyssa Bird, whose family is from Peguis First Nation, echoed Lariviere's point about feeling at odds with a government and legal system she says don't always represent the interests of Indigenous communities.

'Code of ethics'

""The rule of law has been used negatively towards Indigenous people for years and still continues to be, and has a negative impact on Indigenous peoples,"" said the third-year U of M law student.

""One of the things I find most striking and most courageous about Jody Wilson-Raybould's statements is that she's calling out that hypocrisy of the rule of law. When the narrative is flipped and that rule of law is no longer working for a certain political party, that there was encouragement to try and find loopholes around that.""

Bird is immersed in the world of law daily through her school work, and she said it was nice to see a First Nation woman remind the government the law applies to them, too.

""One of the things that we're taught here in law school is how important your professional responsibility is and how important it is for people in the legal profession to follow their code of ethics,"" she said.

Bird said having Wilson-Raybould in the highest justice position in Canada was already a major step for Indigenous women. She, Lariviere, McKay, Daniels and other future leaders will be watching closely to see what steps Wilson-Raybould takes next.","Wilson-Raybould's testimony empowering to young Indigenous women, students say",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/wilson-raybould-manitoba-first-nation-women-1.5038447

Following Wednesday's damning test…","As the backlash from the biggest scandal of his political career intensified, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has seen his standing in the polls slip, losing his lead in the October race for the first time since June. Following Wednesday's damning testimony from his former justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, who accused Trudeau and his staff of a months long campaign of veiled threats and political pressure to try and coerce her into offering a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering firm facing years old financial fraud charges.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould created an image of Trudeau that was strikingly at odds with the public's perception: The cheerful liberal crusader was cast as conniving and paranoid about his electoral prospects. Intensely worried that the SNC-Lavalin case could harm his reelection prospects by moving out of Quebec and killing thousands of jobs in his district, Trudeau was willing to unduly use his office to try and influence a criminal prosecution, and, when he didn't get his way, unceremoniously demoted the cabinet member who stood in his way.

Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould

Now, as his political opponents demand an official investigation, Trudeau's liberals are circling the wagons. And with the conservatives already leading in the polls - one recent poll showed Trudeau's team with 33.9% of the vote, below the conservatives with 35.8% - the Liberals worry that any break in their ranks could be fatal. So far, almost no members of Trudeau's party have spoken out against the PM (other than Wilson-Raybould, that is, who remains a Liberal MP after resigning from Trudeau's cabinet).

The goal now, according to one pollster, is to convince the public that Trudeau did nothing wrong. Though, the fact that one of the government's most high-ranking members has emerged as Trudeau's biggest critic could seriously complicate that narrative.

Any divisions within his government on the matter could be fatal for efforts to convince voters the Liberals have done nothing wrong, said Nik Nanos, a pollster with Nanos Research Group. Trudeau, at the center of the crisis and with his own popularity waning, will also need a more team-oriented campaign in the next election to win voters who may blame him for the current crisis. ""If a narrative emerges that the caucus is divided on this, that will be lethal for Justin Trudeau,"" Nanos said in a telephone interview. ""I can’t remember any party leader winning an election with his caucus divided. If the caucus can’t even agree, how is it that they can govern?""

Still, no current members of the cabinet have broken ranks, and some of the government's most visible members have publicly declared their support for Trudeau, and their confidence in his judgment.

Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the CBC she couldn’t imagine Trudeau applying inappropriate pressure, and signaled frustration that Wilson-Raybould was now taking aim at cabinet. ""At the end of the day, when you leave the room, you have to play as a united team,"" Freeland said. Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the ""box of what’s legal"" with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions. ""We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses."" Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff. “I remain very confident in the work of this government,” Blair said. Parliament adjourns on Friday for a two-week break, due to return in time for Morneau’s March 19 budget. The path of the scandal could also depend on what Liberal lawmakers hear while away from Ottawa, in their home districts scattered across Canada. ""They’re going to get earfuls,"" Collenette said. ""If the truth is really two perceptions, then voters will make up their minds. But they need facts."" [...] Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he believes Trudeau was within the ""box of what’s legal"" with his actions, and that no one should jump to conclusions. ""We should take the time to listen to the other witnesses."" Champagne and another minister, border security chief Bill Blair, each brushed aside a question on whether Trudeau should replace key staff. ""I remain very confident in the work of this government,"" Blair said.

Meanwhile, Trudeau's finance minister and one of his former top aides - who resigned after Wilson-Raybould exposed his role in the scandal - are doing everything they can to push their version of what transpired between them and the former justice minister.

Among those Wilson-Raybould accused of improper pressure is Bill Morneau, who she said she spoke to in the House of Commons. The finance minister said Thursday it was Wilson-Raybould who approached him, and defended the actions of his chief of staff, Ben Chin, in stressing the magnitude of potential job losses at the company. ""My role is, and continues to be, to think about how protect Canadian jobs,"" Morneau told reporters in Toronto. ""I will continue do that. I think that’s critically important for us to understand in every decision we take as a government."" Wilson-Raybould also took aim at Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who on Thursday asked to be allowed to speak to a committee of lawmakers to tell his version of events. The former attorney general - whose absence from cabinet will be filled in a shuffle Friday, according to CBC - may also end up testifying again.

So far, Trudeau has told reporters that he has no plans to resign, even as the opposition and members of the press demand that he resign. Still, if MPs return from a two-week break that begins Friday having lost faith in Trudeau's ability to win in October, we could see the party adopt a very different strategy - perhaps one that doesn't involve Trudeau retaining his position as leader.",Canada's Liberals Circle The Wagons As Rivals Demand Trudeau Face Corruption Probe,Zerohedge.com,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-03-01/canadas-liberals-circle-wagons-rivals-demand-trudeau-face-corruption-probe

Hollywoods Stunt Industry Grapples With Issues of Race and Skin Color

Variety ^ | March 1, 2019 | Todd Longwell

Posted on by EdnaMode

In August, a photo surfaced of a boy in an Afro wig with makeup-darkened skin standing in for 11-year-old African-American actor Keith L. Williams on the Vancouver set of Good Boys, a comedy about three sixth-graders who ditch school and wind up on a road trip. The image sparked online outrage, and Seth Rogen, one of the films producers, quickly apologized, declaring that on all future projects his team would take every precaution to make sure something similar does not take place again.

It turned out that the boy in the makeup, reportedly the son of a stuntman, was African-American but had a lighter skin tone than Williams.

The revelation doesnt change the disturbing nature of the visual  which summons the racist specter of blackface. But it speaks to challenges facing the stunt community as it grapples to provide minority representation in a charged sociopolitical atmosphere where a job can be lost over an inappropriate tweet.

The producers of Good Boys merely needed someone to sit there while the cinematographer lit the scene, so its hard to argue that a child matching Williams pigmentation couldnt have been easily found. But when it comes to choosing a stunt double for an actor, matching the skin tone isnt nearly as important as finding proper skills and a similar facial and body structure, which means that sometimes black stunt workers end up shading their complexions with makeup.

Black people come in so many colors, says African-American stuntwoman Jwaundace Candece, founder of Stunt POC, an online directory for stunt people of color. I dont think its blackface to paint them the same skin tone as the actor or to go lighter. Ive done lighter; Ive done darker. Its not a racist thing.

Yves Giroux’s report will be a fiscal analysis of the government’s acquisition of the 25 aircraft.

Eighteen of the Australian F-18 aircraft will eventually be flying for the Canadian Forces, while another seven will be used for testing and spare parts.

The Royal Canadian Air Force are using the jets as interim fighters to boost the capability of the current fleet of CF-18s until a new generation aircraft can be bought.

The Royal Canadian Air Force recently received its first two used Australian fighter jets at 4 Wing Cold Lake in Alberta. The first two aircraft were F/A-18A models, which means they are single seat aircraft. The aircraft were flown to Cold Lake, Alberta, from Nellis, Nevada, where they were participating in Exercise RED FLAG. The aircraft will be employed at 3 Wing Bagotville and 4 Wing Cold Lake, according to the RCAF.

Deliveries of the Australian jets will continue at regular intervals for the next three years, and aircraft will be integrated into the CF-18 fleet as modifications are completed, according to the RCAF. The final aircraft are expected to arrive by the end of 2021.

A second group of planes are expected to arrive later this year.

Canada is paying Australia $90 million for the aircraft. The federal government originally estimated the purchase of the Australian jets would cost around $500 million, but the Department of National Defence’s procurement chief, Pat Finn, said that price reflected every aspect of the associated deal, not just the cost of purchasing the jets. Canada is also acquiring extra spare parts, the Australian jets will have to be outfitted with specific Canadian equipment and software and testing will be needed.

The $500-million project estimate also included $50 million in contingency funds to cover any problems and another $35 million for the salaries of all civilian and military personnel involved over the life of the project. An additional $30 million will be spent on new infrastructure over the years needed to accommodate the aircraft.

Those costs add up to $360 million, Finn said. But DND also plans to upgrade its existing fleet of CF-18s with new communications gear and equipment required to meet regulations to operate in civilian airspace, improvements which the Australian jets will also eventually receive at a cost of around $110 million, an amount that brought the original estimate to nearly $500 million.

The Liberal government had planned to buy 18 new Super Hornet fighter jets from U.S. aerospace giant Boeing to augment the Royal Canadian Air Force’s CF-18s until new aircraft can be purchased in the coming years.

But in 2017 Boeing complained to the U.S. Commerce Department that Canadian subsidies for Quebec-based Bombardier allowed it to sell its C-series civilian passenger aircraft in the U.S. at cut-rate prices. As a result, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump enacted a tariff of almost 300 per cent against the Bombardier aircraft sold in the U.S. In retaliation, Canada cancelled the deal to buy the 18 Super Hornets, which would have cost more than US$5 billion.

Instead of buying the new Super Hornets, the Liberals decided to acquire the used Australian jets.",Budget Officer’s analysis of used Australian F-18 deal to be released Thursday,Ottawacitizen.com,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/budget-officers-analysis-of-used-australian-f-18-deal-to-be-released-thursday
522,Empty,2019-02-26T19:57:18Z,Ches Crosbie claims Newfoundland and Labrador will lose the principal beneficiary status of the Atlantic Accord under Dwight Ball.,"PC Leader Ches Crosbie says Liberal Premier Dwight Ball will lose Newfoundland and Labrador's benefits under the Atlantic Accord. (Sherry Vivian/CBC)

Ches Crosbie is offering a warning for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador that the province will lose the principal beneficiary status of the Atlantic Accord under Premier Dwight Ball.

""Something suspicious is occurring. I am very much concerned that this present government under Mr. Ball is engaged in a project to give up our principal beneficiary rights under the Atlantic Accord, in return for some short-term cash to get them through the election,"" the leader of the Opposition said during a news conference Tuesday morning, evoking former premier Danny Williams' fight with Ottawa, which ended with a $2-billion cheque from the federal government.

Crosbie says there has been a change in language used by the provincial Liberals over the last several months. According to Crosbie, members of the Liberal party have begun referring to the province's deal in the Atlantic Accord as ""primary"" beneficiary, not ""principal"" beneficiary, he said, suggesting ""primary"" is a lesser term and the province is giving away its benefits.

""Why the change in language, to use a term that is found nowhere in the agreements that are being negotiated? Something very worrisome is occurring,"" Crosbie said.

""'Primary' beneficiary is not found in any of these fundamental documents, the Atlantic Accord being our most important piece of legislation since the terms of the union in 1949.""

However, when pressed by reporters for evidence there's something more out of line from the Liberal camp than a supposed word change, Crosbie simply gave vague answers.

Language interchangeable

In response, Ball said the words ""principal"" and ""primary"" have been used interchangeably over the past decades — and in the present.

""There's never been any discussion that we've had about changing the word 'principal' to 'primary.' That hasn't happened and it won't happen,"" Ball told the media Tuesday afternoon.

Ball says the words 'principal' and 'primary' beneficiaries have been interchangeable for decades and that nothing will change. (Katie Breen/CBC)

Ball said Crosbie is nervous the provincial Liberals will receive a positive outcome from discussions about the Atlantic Accord.

""That would be a good day for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, but in Ches's world it would be a bad day for Ches Crosbie,"" Ball said.

""The last thing that Ches Crosbie wants is to see a successful discussion with the federal government. See, that doesn't fit his doom and gloom agenda.""

What happened?

The Atlantic Accord was signed in 1985 to give 100 per cent of the revenue from the province's offshore resources back to Newfoundland and Labrador. But in 2003 the Royal Commission on Renewing and Strengthening our Place in Canada revealed Newfoundland and Labrador was receiving only 15 to 20 per cent of the benefits.

The resulting renegotiation with the federal government lasted months and saw Williams order Canadian flags from provincial buildings.

""It is that agreement, the 2005 Accord fiscal arrangement, that contains the clause that Mr. Ball is utilizing to write a letter to the prime minister last year requesting that we revisit and review the provisions of that arrangement, and of the accord, to ensure that they are working as intended,"" said Crosbie.

""Mr. Ball would have you think that the negotiation must be complete by the end of March this year. Well, that's not so, when you look at the actual wording of the provision in the 2005 arrangement.""

Crosbie said the negotiations just have to begin by the end of March and can run until there is a ""just result.""

Ball argues the commitment was made in the letter he wrote to the prime minister, and March. 31 will be the end date.

Expecting the worst

Ball leaves for Ottawa Thursday to continue Atlantic Accord discussions, which Crosbie criticized as happening in ""complete secrecy.""

""We don't know what the objectives of the province are, we don't know what's at stake, we don't know whether they're talking about hundreds of millions, possibly of tens of billions. We don't have a clue,"" Crosbie said.

Ball said he will keep Newfoundlanders and Labradorians updated on the discussions with Ottawa as they draw closer to end of the negotiations on the Accord, and is not ruling out the possibility of going for equalization or offset payments.

523,Empty,2019-03-01T21:21:21Z,Mountain ranges aren’t the only breathtaking sights in the wilds of Western Canada.,"From glacial lakes to beautiful mountains, see all that Western Canada and the Canadian Rockies has to offer. (Photo: Rocky Mountaineer)

When you're planning a trip to Western Canada and the Canadian Rockies, scenic mountain ranges are probably the first things that come to mind and for good reason—they’re stunningly beautiful and impossible to ignore. But with so much nature and wildlife tucked within them, there’s much more to see if you travel through British Columbia and Alberta. Here are seven must-see wonders you won’t want to miss—plus a way to see them all. And don’t worry: Mountains will be on full display while you enjoy the other spectacular scenery.

1. Technicolor glacial lakes

Seeing lakes on a trip to the Rockies isn’t surprising, but the glacial-fed lakes found there are awe-inspiring because of their shockingly milky turquoise, iridescent blue and emerald hues. “Rock flour” (super-fine crushed sediment) is produced when rocks slide under the weight of glaciers, then it’s transported to rivers and lake as the glaciers melt, producing otherworldly water colors. For excellent examples of this natural phenomenon, explore Lake Louise and nearby Moraine Lake, Emerald, Peyto and Bow Lakes along the Icefields Parkway and Maligne Lake near Jasper. For a more intimate lake experience, stay at The Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, which is located right on Lac Beauvert (which means “beautiful green” in French). When the light hits it just right, the lake has a gorgeous emerald hue. ​

2. Stargazing in Jasper

Dazzling night skies abound in the wilds of Canada, but stargazers are practically guaranteed a memorable experience in Alberta’s Jasper National Park. It’s the second-largest and most accessible designated dark sky preserve in the world, which means there’s little artificial light pollution to obscure the stellar night views. While glowing planets, the Milky Way and shooting stars are visible year-round, the best time to witness the mesmerizing purples, yellows, greens and reds of the aurora borealis (or Northern Lights) is from September through mid-May, especially on colder nights. To experience local astronomy events, visit during the Jasper Dark Sky Festival, held in October. No matter when you wander, brace yourself for awe-inspiring views.

3. 360-degree aerial views in Banff

Jaw-dropping scenery is a signature of Alberta, thanks to the majesty of the Canadian Rockies, but seeing them from above is a next-level experience on its own. Hop aboard the Banff Gondola and you’ll be treated to 360-degree skyline and forest views on the eight-minute ride up the side of Sulphur Mountain. The enclosed glass gondolas only hold four people, so you and three of your closest friends can enjoy views of the town, the Spray and Bow Valleys and yes, six spectacular Canadian Rocky Mountain ranges, as you climb to 7,486 feet above sea level. At the top of the peak, stretch your legs along the mountaintop boardwalk and trails, and explore the Above Banff interpretive center, which provides interactive educational exhibits.

4. Remarkable Western Canadian wildlife

Wildlife viewing might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you’re planning a trip to Western Canada, but the biodiversity here is enough to wow any animal lover. Keep your eyes open and you’ll likely spy soaring bald eagles, massive bighorn sheep, ospreys (sometimes called “sea hawks” or “fish eagles” with as much as a six-foot wingspan), nimble blacktail deer, elk, and even the occasional black and grizzly bears. Though less common, lucky wildlife watchers may spot moose (the largest member of the deer family), wolves and coyotes. Who knows? You could even be the first to snap a verified photo of the elusive Sasquatch, the mythic creature of North American folklore.

5. Mighty Pyramid Falls

Pyramid Creek Falls, a 300-foot tall waterfall, is one of the most-photographed sights along Rocky Mountaineer’s Journey through the Clouds train route. (Photo: Rocky Mountaineer)

British Columbia is home to some of the world’s most exciting waterfalls, thanks to forceful glacial melt. One such example, Pyramid Creek Falls, cascades in two dramatic drops totaling 300 feet, the lower of which fans out in the shape of a pyramid, hence the name. The falls (within the small Pyramid Creek Falls Provincial Park) aren’t accessible by car, and a hike should only be attempted by proficient and adventurous hikers. However, thanks to railroad tracks that exist near the base, rail passengers get an up-close view of the drama of the falls flowing under the tracks before joining the rushing North Thompson River.

6. Walk on the Athabasca Glacier

You can walk on ancient history, literally, with a visit to the Athabasca Glacier, part of the Columbia Icefield, the largest body of ice in the Canadian Rockies. Along the Icefields Parkway in the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site, stop at the ancient Athabasca Glacier, North America’s most accessible and most visited glacier. From there, hop aboard the Ice Explorer, an all-terrain vehicle designed to drive on the 10,000-year-old glacier. And if you’re brave enough, venture out on the Glacier Skywalk, where a glass-floored walkway more than a half-mile long reveals views of waterfalls, fossils and a bird’s eye view from 918 feet above the magnificent Sunwapta Valley. Plan your trip for the warmer months, since the Icefield Interpretive Centre is closed in the winter.

7. Experience the mystery of the Hoodoos

The Hoodoos, near the village of Pritchard, are striking rock and clay formations formed after the end of the last ice age. (Photo: ronniechua, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

It’s probably no mistake that “hoodoo” rhymes with “voodoo” and serves to conjure up all sorts of mysterious tales about the unique rock and clay deposits formed after the end of the last ice age. Science tells us that these unusual geological wonders are formed by erosion caused by water, wind and frost, so all that remains of ancient rocks and sediment are the spire-like hoodoos. However, the Cree and Blackfoot traditionally believe that the spooky formations are fossilized giants who awaken at night to protect the land from invaders, while another piece of folklore holds that the “fairy chimneys” were naughty humans until a witch turned them to stone. Regardless, these beautiful, unusual natural formations that can range from several feet to several meters high (and in some cases much higher) are a sight to behold. They are visible from an accessible trail just a few minutes from downtown Banff, also near Kamloops, B.C., and within Alberta’s Drumheller Valley.

Getting there: A way to see them all

Seeing some of these breathtaking natural wonders can come with serious effort—to the tune of vigorous hikes, expert gear and meticulous planning. Fortunately, those who appreciate nature but prefer traveling in comfort and style can have the best of both worlds with the iconic Rocky Mountaineer passenger train. Three of the routes, including Journey through the Clouds, Rainforest to Gold Rush and First Passage to the West, wind through the Canadian Rockies by day and overnight at hotels, so you can see sights up close from the comfort of single-level SilverLeaf Service coaches that have oversized windows, or bi-level, glass-dome-enclosed GoldLeaf Service coaches. These coaches include an outdoor viewing platform and a separate dining room on the lower level where you’ll feast on gourmet meals. Onboard, hosts share local history throughout the journey and ensure guests don’t miss any key highlights.

All of the sights listed here are easy to experience when traveling with Rocky Mountaineer. For instance, on the Journey through the Clouds route, the train decelerates from its average 30-mile-per-hour speed so guests can get terrific photos of Pyramid Falls. Trains also pass by small hoodoos near Kamloops in British Columbia, and it’s typical to spot some of the West’s best wildlife from the comfort of your seat. The Banff Gondola can be accessed easily from town, while Banff’s impressive hoodoos are just a short drive away (if you add a rental car to your trip). Similarly, for an up-close view of the Athabasca Glacier, book a comfortable motorcoach and Ice Explorer tour of the Icefields Parkway. If you’re eager to witness the stars in Jasper, simply look up.

Are you ready to see it all? Start planning your Rocky Mountaineer adventure today, and get ready to experience all of Western Canada’s wonders with the ease and leisure of train travel.

With milky bluish eyes and luxurious dark gray fur, this kitty looks like a plush toy. Merlin rose to internet fame thanks to his human parents Nathanial Green and Elliot Green, two visual artists that curated a visually stunning Instagram page dedicated to their beautiful pet, which has amassed 28k followers.

More Info: Instagram | Twitter | Website

The Greens first laid eyes on Merlin in 2017 at the Lynchburg Humane Society on their “Free Cat Friday.” And while it was love at first sight, Elliot admitted to Bored Panda Merlin hadn’t been his first choice. “It actually was my coworker that convinced me to go in–she had just adopted a beautiful kitten from there. Browsing through the site, Nathanial and I had our hearts set on a Siamese kitten, but by the time I got off work, they were all either on hold or already adopted.”

Image credits: merlin.griffith

Not to be discouraged the couple continued their search. “The lady who had shown us around eventually noticed us indecisively meandering; she stopped to tell us that she had a favorite, but that he had some issues and was sick. She took us to the medical wing to show us this little kitten who was recovering from a head cold. When I was first told that he was blind, I was a bit worried. As a full-time student also working two jobs, I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to provide Merlin with the attention he needed. As soon as I got to hold him, I think it was pretty obvious that he was perfect.”

The Greens couldn’t be happier that they found Merlin, “He’s an affectionate cat that loves being acknowledged and held. He’s never destructive or petty, either,” said Elliot, “Because he was born blind, he really has no concept of fear and so he’ll attempt to jump off of pretty high places. He doesn’t hide or avoid people–he’ll run up to the door to meet us and climb all over guests sitting on the couch. His preferred place is on someone’s lap.”

That’s right this loving ball of fur can’t get enough of his human dads. “Anytime we sit on the couch or the bed, he jumps up and is ready to be cuddled. He loves having his face and ears scratched; we aren’t quite sure why, but he loves having the areas around his eyes massaged. If someone puts their hands up to his eyes or nose, he’ll usually awkwardly press into it as if he’s trying to push them away, but it’s his way of feeling loved,” said his other dad Nathanial

Image credits: merlin.griffith

Looking at Merlin you can’t help but notice his unique features, that’s because he is a rare mixed breed of a Munchkin and a Persian cat, called a Napoleon. “It’s a pretty new breed–by new I mean 20 to 22 years,” explained his owner, “Napoleons are pretty small, but they’re able to move around as easily as normal sized cats. For the most part, they inherit the Persian’s physical characteristics.”

Merlin’s milky white-walker style eyes, however, are not a characteristic of his breed but due to his blindness. But even with his poor vision, his dad said this handsome guy still lives a full life. “Honestly, we forget that he has trouble seeing. When we first moved to our apartment, he definitely had trouble navigating, but he learns quickly and really knows how to own the space. His greatest recurring struggle is from our coffee table’s glass edges: Every now and then, he’ll jump or walk into it, but we think he’s learned. All he really cares about is where the food is and how far away it is from his dads.”

While his blindness hasn’t been an issue, Merlin did suffer from some other health issues, “For a while, he was having seizures, and we really couldn’t figure out why,” recalled Elliot, “Through some research and trying out alternatives, we learned that his food was causing it. We removed wheat from his diet, and he’s been perfectly content since then.”

As a snuggly, social kitty, Merlin loves all living things, but sadly the feeling is not always mutual, “We’ve also learned–the hard way–that he’s easily dominated by other animals. Cats, in particular, tend to bully him. He never fights back, but we have seen him hiss a time or two. We have to keep a close eye on him around other animals. Other than that, he really is perfect!”

“Merlin loves watermelon, and since it’s Elliot’s favorite food, he gets it often”

It’s easy to see why Merlin has become an internet sensation, but the Greens say it was never their intention. “We just started accumulating a lot of pictures on our phones and decided to share them with the world. It wasn’t an account we were regularly posting on, but when we did we made sure that it looked good. Honestly, Elliot was proud of the way his apartment looked at the time and thought Merlin was a good subject to help show it off,” said Nathanial.

Still, the response has been surprising, “Yea! Friends keep telling us that they see Merlin’s pictures all over–it’s just mind-blowing.”

525,Empty,2019-02-28T23:42:43Z,Jhonattan Vegas shot a bogey-free 6-under 64 to take a two-stroke lead after the first round of The Honda Classic,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — A year ago at The Honda Classic, Jhonattan Vegas made seven birdies all week.

He’s off to a much better start this time.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys Thursday, shooting a 6-under 64 to open a two-stroke lead after the first round. Lucas Glover bogeyed his finishing hole for a 66, leaving him tied with Zach Johnson, Ernie Els and Ben Silverman — who went to college at nearby Florida Atlantic.

“Hit my irons the best I’ve hit them all year and I’ve always liked this golf course,” Vegas said. “It’s kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.”

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

“To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2-under par on this golf course, it’s great,” Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed “Bear Trap” stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par 4 is sandwiched by a pair of par 3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple, wound up beating only one of the 74 finishers and wrapped up the week with a final-round 78. He sprayed irons everywhere, missed half of the fairways, more than half of the greens.

But Thursday, he was dialed in — missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

“I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,” Vegas said.

The 34-year-old Venezuelan has three PGA Tour victories, winning the 2011 Bob Hope Classic and the RBC Canadian Open in 2016 and 2017.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that’s not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson — whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph — was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

“We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,” Johnson said. “The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. … It was not Honda wind. I don’t think we’re going to get Honda wind until Sunday.”

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour — the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

“Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,” Els said. “It’s late in my career, but I’ll take any win now.”

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4-under.

That’s when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn’t believe it’ll impact him Friday.

“Just more of a shock than anything,” Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap — making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

“It’s a great round, at the end of the day,” Garcia said.

LPGA — No. 1-ranked Ariya Jutanugarn’s 10-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole gave her a 4-under 68 and a five-way share of the first-round lead at the HSBC Women’s World Championship in Singapore.

Tied with Jutanugarn were No. 3 Minjee Lee, Amy Olson, Yu Liu, and Celine Boutier, who won her first LPGA tournament three weeks ago at the Vic Open in Australia.

No. 2 Sun Hyun Park bogeyed 18 after hitting her approach into a bunker for a 69 to drop into a seven-way tie for sixth, one stroke behind the leaders.

After an eagle on the eighth, her second-last hole, Olson just missed a 30-foot birdie putt on the ninth hole.

‘‘I made a nice shot in, just perfect,’’ the American said of her second shot into the eighth.

Scoring conditions on Sentosa Golf Club’s Tanjong layout were difficult most of the day Thursday due to gusty winds and slick greens.

Former No. 1 Lydia Ko shot 72, as did Lexi Thompson and Cristie Kerr. Nelly Korda, who won the Women’s Australian Open two weeks ago, had 74. Brooke Henderson dropped four shots in two holes on the eighth and ninth and had a 75.

Defending champion Michelle Wie was forced to withdraw with a recurrence of a right hand injury.

Wie, making her second start of the season after surgery on her right hand earlier this month, was 10-over after 14 holes when she withdrew while playing the 15th. She was holding her right wrist and hand as she walked up the fairway.

Wie fractured her hand and sustained extensive neck injuries in a car accident two years ago.

The 29-year-old Wie played in last week’s LPGA Thailand tournament, where she finished tied for 23rd.

European — Kurt Kitayama kept up his impressive first season on the European Tour by shooting a 6-under 66 at the Oman Open in Muscat to take a one-stroke lead after the first round. After coming through all three stages of Q-School in November to earn a place on tour, Kitayama won the Mauritius Open on just his third start of the season.

He holed a 15-foot putt for eagle at the par-5 12th hole and rolled in four birdies in a bogey-free round at Al Mouj Golf Club.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game's biggest names from the tournament.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present - Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler - making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Honda began sponsoring the south Florida tournament in 1982 but this year, it comes coming directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August, instead of late September.

The scheduling, however, appeared of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

""I was able to drive... really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,"" said the 34-year-old from Venezuela.

""I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.

""Hitting those irons well to some of these tough pins makes the day a little bit easier. Wind wasn't that hard so you could be a little more aggressive than usual.""

Vegas, ranked 131st in the world, is a three-times PGA Tour winner.

He led by two strokes from South African Ernie Els, American Zach Johnson and Canadian Ben Silverman with half the field back in the clubhouse.

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card a bogey-free six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens in south Florida.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its making.

Honda, which began sponsoring the tournament in 1982, comes directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship, a run that is too much golf for many on the tour.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August instead of late September.

The scheduling was of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

“I was able to drive … really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,” said 34-year-old Vegas, who is ranked 131st in the world.

“I only missed three greens and of those, I left two within 15 feet of the hole.”

Veteran Els compiled six birdies for a share of second place with a round marred only by a double-bogey at the par-three 15th, where his eight-iron came up short and found the water.

The four-times major champion, now ranked 398th in the twilight of his career at age 49, said he enjoyed playing on a course with firm greens.

“They are not very receptive, even this morning, so going to get even firmer but I like that,” he said.

“It means you’ve got to hit it on the fairways. (The ball is) not going to stop out of the rough so I’m trying to hit fairways and then you’ve got to hit it properly to stay on the greens.”

Koepka and Fowler also started well, carding three-under 67, while defending champion Thomas shot 68.

German Alex Cejka was disqualified during his round for using greens reading material that did not fit the new scale.

In the book Poking a Dead Frog, Adam McKay talks about the types of characters he and Will Ferrell have been most often drawn to over the last 20 years: “They have no skills whatsoever, yet they’re completely entitled. Will and I are endlessly fascinated by this cockiness; it’s all just completely unearned. It’s not connected to any reality whatsoever. It’s free-floating. They’re not getting anywhere. They’re stuck and impotent. I find this to be one of the most fascinating things about America right now.”

It makes sense then why the comedy duo was immediately drawn to Fred Simmons, the overconfident Tae Kwon Do instructor played by Danny McBride in 2006’s Foot Fist Way, a self-made movie by college friends and film majors McBride, Jody Hill, and Ben Best.

McKay and Ferrell wanted to help the trio get their next project into production, and three years later the world met Kenny Powers, the brash relief pitcher turned gym teacher who was the central focus of Eastbound & Down.

February marked the ten-year anniversary of Eastbound’s debut, and while Powers was certainly a version of that unearned, Ferrell-esque American bravado, they found an unexpected better half to Powers. Many actors auditioned for the role of Stevie Janowski, a fellow teacher who becomes enamored with Powers in the pilot episode, but they also weren’t sure what to make of the character quite yet, and nobody who came in had inspired them enough to move forward. Then Steve Little, a former main company member at the Groundlings whose most extensive television work at that point had been as a voice on the Cartoon Network’s Camp Lazlo, came in and defined the character in a big way. Little’s presence was so key that Stevie would turn into much more than the small, two-scene role the pilot afforded him. He grew into something that would become as vital to the success of Eastbound as Powers would be.

“It was just those two scenes,” says Little, who figured that if they knew Stevie was going to be this important to the show, he would have had to audition a third time. “Then when we shot the pilot and Danny said, ‘You’re our secret weapon.’” In fact, Little says that Hill told him that they actually forgot to put a wedding ring on him in the pilot and that Stevie was supposed to have been married. “If they had made that choice, then everything would have changed. They had some story lines, like I was going to be in a Christian rock band, but it turned out differently.”

McBride once referred to Stevie as “a filthy, disgusting Don Knotts.” Seeing the pair play off of each other for four seasons — with the benefit of being on HBO, where Stevie can say things like “My dick’s all pruney from being up in that sweet punnany,” and give us moments like him shooting off his prosthetic chin or having Ferrell play a car-dealership owner-slash-racist plantation owner who sexually assaults Stevie while he’s dressed as a geisha — made Eastbound a unique addition to TV history. It’s been five years since the series finale, and Eastbound still projects an air of confidence in the bold choices it made; it feels as dangerous a comedy today as it was from 2009–2013. To mark the anniversary, we asked Little to walk us through his five favorite episodes of Eastbound & Down and the memories that came with doing pretty much any insane thing that was asked of him.

“Chapter 6” (Season 1, Episode 6)

In its simplest terms, the premise for Eastbound and its pilot episode would seem clear: An overly abrasive and vulgar former World Series hero washes out of Major League Baseball and must go back to his hometown to take a job as a P.E. teacher. But over the course of its first season, and culminating in the finale with a cliffhanger of an ending, it became clear that Eastbound was anything but predictable. “This show is a show about a guy who is teaching high school, but then it just becomes not that at all,” says Little. By the end of season one, Little’s character Stevie, a fellow teacher at the school, is revealed to be a guy who would do anything to be Kenny’s friend, including quitting his job to join him on his journey back to the big leagues — which Kenny reneges on, leaving Stevie jobless. Still, this does not deter Stevie from showing his allegiance by running through the school hallways tripping fire alarms to draw everyone into the parking lot.

“I remember reading the script and it said, ‘Stevie runs down the hallway setting off the fire alarms, reminiscent of Jules and Jim running through the Louvre,’” says Little, referring to the 1962 Truffaut film. “I’d never seen Jules and Jim, but I do remember feeling when I was reading it that they want something iconic. That was inspiring to read. I love that scene of running through the hallways.”

“Chapter 8” (Season 2, Episode 2)

Photo: HBO

If you didn’t realize how critical to the series Stevie was by the end of season one, it was immediately apparent in season two: Powers has moved to Mexico, but Stevie has tracked him down and become further obsessed with him. That includes having sex with a prostitute who Kenny also had sex with just to know what it was like, a moment that gave Little considerable anxiety while shooting because it was his first-ever sex scene. “It was nerve-racking to see how that would go,” says Little. “I don’t know what the acting approach is when you’re pretending to have doggy-style sex with a prostitute.”

After Kenny shoots Stevie in the leg because he mistakes him for a burglar — somehow maybe not the worst thing that Kenny has ever done to him — they spend most of the episode together. Stevie one-liners like “I didn’t know you hoes took credit cards until recently” and “You can see straight into the butthole and right into the pussy” stand out. Little notes that he’s often asked by people about how much is improvised. “It’s a mix,” he confirms. “I think that first one, ‘I didn’t know you hoes took credit cards,’ I think that Jody told me to say that. Then I think it might have been Jody or me who suggested the ‘butthole’ line.” He adds that the show would still be great with just the scripts themselves, but improv helped elevate it even more — especially considering the fact that he was improvising with the person who made the show. “I think that’s a key of improv maybe, to have the creator be in the scene.”

“Chapter 15” (Season 3, Episode 2)

McBride, Hill, and Best could not have known this when they were making the series because they had never planned on having a season four, but “Chapter 15” ends up serving as a wonderful midpoint to the 29-episode Eastbound. In a show famous for its moments of harmonious insanity, this episode ends with Kenny and Stevie, who is dressed as a geisha, running from cannonballs being fired by Will Ferrell’s Ashley Schaeffer at an 1800s-style plantation while Korean car salesmen watch in horror and drink Fanta. Schaeffer is attempting to murder Kenny and Stevie, and he’s already killed one person to show he’s serious. But the person who played that murder victim was in fact not an actor and apparently wasn’t afraid to tell Ferrell to slow down.

“In one of the early scenes, there’s two guys at the Kia dealership, Joey [Brinkley] and Jeff Seibenick, who was the editor, and they’re teasing me as I’m waxing the tires,” says Little. Seibenick was one of Eastbound’s lead editors and had been given a role, but had just quit smoking, which added to his nerves, says Little — so they switched and gave his lines to Brinkley, who was the husband of David Gordon Green’s nanny. “He was a real southern dude, shooting guns and stuff. David liked Joey so much that he put him in the scene with all the Korean car salesman.” Little says that despite his lack of experience, Brinkley was pretty bold on set. “Joey a couple times told Will Ferrell to wait and not step on his lines. So you’ve got this guy who has never acted before, he has no lines then has some lines, the next day he’s acting with Will Ferrell. And then at brunch the next day, Danny and David decided that he needs to die from the cannonball to raise the stakes for Stevie and Kenny. A nonactor. You would think that anybody would let Will Ferrell go and do your thing, but Joey wasn’t like that.” (In a deleted scene, you can see Brinkley tell a story about duck hunting to Ferrell and the Korean car salesmen at dinner.)

“Chapter 20” (Season 3, Episode 7)

Photo: HBO

Building toward the end of season three, tensions are heightened when Stevie’s wife, Maria, leaves him after he cheats on her, which prompts him to go to the extreme length of shaving off all the hair on his head as a way to punish himself. But Hill was considering an even bigger conclusion to that scene. “From what I remember, Jody asked if I’d do a nude scene where they wanted me to come out after shaving my head,” says Little, “and I’m completely naked and completely shaved and I make myself a drink or something. Jody wanted me to say ‘What’s going on?’ to Kenny and then vomit on my dick. And then Kenny Powers says, ‘Nothing, just watching you vomit on your dick.’ But I didn’t do that.”

In “Chapter 20,” Stevie decides to wear a wig and fake eyebrows while attempting to win back Maria, but the wig is ripped off of his head and he freaks out, a moment inspired by the cult classic Canadian kids’ movie The Peanut Butter Solution, says Little. “I remember shooting that scene, and we were worried about the light and trying to go fast and just putting marshmallow goo on my head to make sure that it registers on camera. Looking back, it’s just such an absurd moment: that we have to make sure there’s enough marshmallow on this man’s head, that the audience knows why this man’s screaming. And why did Stevie use so much wig glue anyway?”

“Chapter 29” (Season 4, Episode 8)

Photo: HBO

As far as series finales go, Eastbound & Down did what it was always best at: showing fantastical, heightened versions of TV, which in this case meant borrowing from the Six Feet Under method of flash-forwarding ahead to its characters’ lives. Kenny and April get married and have two kids; the kids grow up and are portrayed by Lindsay Lohan and Alexander Skarsgård. April is shot in the chest and murdered by muggers; Kenny shoots them both dead. Kenny rides a hoverbike into an African village, where he marries a woman and has a bunch of kids and then dies of a heart attack. An older, futuristic Stevie, alongside Lohan and Skarsgård, go there for his Viking funeral. But the show found a way to have its fun while staying grounded in reality, revealing that Kenny is just writing the ending to his screenplay..

“I picked this episode because it’s so insane and such a bold leap,” Little says. “I auditioned for this part where there’s two scenes on the show, and here I am five years later and I’m wearing this space outfit, with those LeVar Burton glasses across my eyes, with Lindsay Lohan and Alexander Skarsgård. Just looking at that journey, it’s really kind of insane.”",Steve Little Walks Us Through His Top 5 Eastbound & Down Episodes,Vulture.com,http://www.vulture.com/article/steve-little-best-eastbound-and-down-episodes.html

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card a bogey-free six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens in south Florida.

The Venezuelan had a two-shot advantage over a trio of major champions in Ernie Els, Zach Johnson and Lucas Glover, along with Canadian Ben Silverman.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game’s biggest names.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present — Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler — making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its making.

Honda, which began sponsoring the tournament in 1982, comes directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship, a run that is too much golf for many on the tour.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August instead of late September.

The scheduling was of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

“I was able to drive... really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,” said 34-year-old Vegas, who is ranked 131st in the world.

“I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.”

Veteran Els compiled six birdies for a share of second place with a round marred only by a double-bogey at the par-three 15th, where his eight-iron came up short and found the water.

The four-times major champion, now ranked 398th in the twilight of his career at age 49, said he enjoyed playing on a course with firm greens.

“They are not very receptive, even this morning, so going to get even firmer but I like that,” he said.

“It means you’ve got to hit it on the fairways. (The ball is) not going to stop out of the rough so I’m trying to hit fairways and then you’ve got to hit it properly to stay on the greens.”

Koepka and Fowler also started well, carding three-under 67, while defending champion Thomas shot 68.

German Alex Cejka was disqualified during his round for using greens reading material that did not fit the new scale.",Golf: Vegas leads as big names steer clear of Honda Classic,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-honda-idUSKCN1QH2S4

There are the athletes that train the hardest, seven days a week. The musicians that don't stop touring or recording or writing songs. Or the bestselling products on Amazon that are the greatest of all time because they consistently rain in five-star reviews and do exactly what they say.

It's not random that these products are consistently at the top of the best-seller lists. Not only do many of these items boast hundreds (if not thousands) of nearly-perfect reviews, but they're all incredibly practical as well. Have you ever sliced yourself while preparing food? There's a pair of gloves that keep your fingers safe from accident cuts and slices. And who can deny that a bleach-free teeth whitening powder made with activated charcoal is an easy, natural way to get a bright smile?

So instead of scrolling around the Internet looking for your next impulse purchase, try out the handmade wine decanter, or even the salt scrub made with real pink salt from the Himalayas. Who knows? With so many bestselling products available on Amazon, the sky is the limit when it comes to quality products at affordable prices.

1. The Cleansing Face Mask Made From Bentonite Clay Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay $11 Amazon See on Amazon Whether you have clogged pores, breakouts, or simply want to give your skin an intense deep clean, the Aztec Secret Indian healing clay is right up your alley. This face mask is made with 100 percent calcium bentonite clay that doesn't include any additives or artificial fragrances, and all it takes is 10 minutes for this mask to work its magic. Safe for sensitive skin, this mask can even be mixed with apple cider vinegar to help magnify its cleansing effects.

2. A Travel Pillow With A Built-In Neck Support Trtl Travel Pillow $30 Amazon See on Amazon Unlike other travel pillows, this travel pillow has flexible, built-in neck support that prevents your head from flopping around as you sleep upright (like in the middle seat of a plane, for instance). The fabric is made from soft fleece so that it feels comfortable wrapped around your neck, and you can also adjust the tightness if it ever becomes a little too loose. And because this pillow can easily be attached to your carry-on, you won't have to worry about it taking up any precious storage space.

Vegas teed off on the 10th and played the tough back nine in four-under.

He rolled in three birdie putts from 14 feet or more, drilling a 16-footer at the par-three seventh.

But he said his iron play was the real key to his round, which put him two strokes in front of a quartet of players on 66 that included three major champions in Ernie Els, Zach Johnson and Lucas Glover along with Canadian Ben Silverman.

World number four Brooks Koepka headed a group of 13 players on 67 that also included Spain's Sergio Garcia, American Rickie Fowler, South African Charl Schwartzel and South Korean Lee Kyoung-hoon.

Defending champion Justin Thomas was in another big group on 68.

""Every time I come around this place and don't make a bogey it's pretty good,"" Vegas said of the Jack Nicklaus-designed course.

""I was able to drive the ball really well today. I hit my irons incredibly well.

""I only missed three greens and out of those three I left two within 15 feet of the hole.""

Els, 49, and seeking to take his tally of PGA Tour titles to a round 20, overcame a double-bogey five on the par-three 15th, where he was in the water off the tee.

""That freaking 15th hole is no good at all on this golf course,"" quipped Els, who countered with six birdies. That included a birdie at his penultimate hole, the eighth, where he stuck his approach less than three feet from the pin.

""I've really been swinging it better lately and this is a golf course where you get it anywhere under par and you're really happy, even in benign conditions like this morning,"" Els said.

Els, who claimed his 19th and most recent PGA Tour title with his victory in the 2012 Open Championship, admitted the idea of No 20 was appealing, but said he wouldn't get ahead of himself.

""Obviously 20 is a great number,"" he said.

""It's late in my career, but I'll take any win now. I'm not thinking about it. I'm just thinking about tomorrow's round and so forth. But it would be magic.""

He was tied atop the leaderboard with Mitchell, who posted a 66, with 2009 US Open champion Lucas Glover a shot back on 135 after a 69.

Im, who won twice and led the money list all season in dominating the developmental Web.com tour last season, birdied three of his first four holes and three of his final six on the way, his six-under effort tied for best round of the day.

""All the shots that I wanted to hit turned out the way I wanted,"" said Im, who hit five approach shots to within 12 feet of the pin.

""So it led to a lot of birdies, and I was able to convert a lot of my birdie opportunities. I think that's what led to a successful round today.""

Canadian Adam Svensson also posted a 64 to land on 136, sharing fourth place with eight other players in a group that included 2018 PGA Tour Player of the Year Brooks Koepka (69), New Zealand's Danny Lee (67) and Sweden's Freddie Jacobson (67).

A total of 42 players were within five shots of the lead.

Defending champion Justin Thomas made the cut on the number with a four-over par 74 for a two-over total.

Im, the youngest of the US tour's rookies this season, went off in the first group of the day at 6:45 a.m. and made a quick move with birdies at the second third and fourth holes.

He would add three more before his lone bogey of the day at 16, and he drilled a 25-foot birdie putt at the 18th to cap his round.

Mitchell had five birdies and a bogey in his four-under effort, and after three missed cuts on the tour's West Coast Swing was delighted to be playing on the Bermuda grass greens of Florida.

""I grew up on Bermuda. I know how to putt it,"" he said. ""I know how to read it. It's definitely helped a lot.""

Thomas's hopes of a repeat title on the Jack Nicklaus-designed course faded with his four-over effort, during which he struggled with a ""dead arm"" as well as his concentration.

Thomas, who felt a stinging sensation in his right arm when his nine-iron scraped a tree on a shot on Thursday, said the arm still didn't feel right.

""Just feels like it kind of needs to get popped,"" he said. ""Just doesn't have a lot of strength.""

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

It’s Not Real; It’s Puccini: People often suspend realism. In the movie “Spiderman” the hero swings through the canyons of Manhattan using threads of “spider silk” he attaches from building to building as he travels down the street. In Puccini’s La Boheme, the leading lady sings a beautiful aria on her death bed, in the last stages of consumption, tuberculous filling her lungs will bodily fluids. The realist may say that is not possible. The opera buff may respond it’s not real; it’s Puccini.

Human imagination is boundless.

Unfortunately, many scientists, commentators and politicians expect other physicists and commentators to suspend realism when examining climate science produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and other reports from similar organizations. Critical thinking is not welcome.

For example, 40 years of calculations from comprehensive satellite data show that the atmosphere is warming modestly, but not over the Antarctic. The calculations are verified using temperature measurements by different instruments in weather balloons, taken over a part of the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect occurs in the atmosphere. The temperature trends in the atmosphere include effects of all greenhouse gases, such as changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor occurring from natural El Niño events.

The IPCC, etc. use surface temperatures, which are not comprehensive and include many other influences such as urbanization and change in land use. Surface temperature trends show a far greater warming rate than atmospheric trends. The IPCC, etc. claim that the primary cause of surface warming is carbon dioxide and that it is dangerous for humans. The advocates of dangerous warming have not produced a substantiated foundation, a tested hypothesis that demonstrates how a minor warming of the atmosphere causes a far greater warming of the surface. Further, the models they use predict a pronounced warming of the upper troposphere above the tropics, a “tropical hot spot.” Observations by balloons, and satellites show that it’s simply not there. It is as if the Climate Establishment is saying about their work: it’s not physics, it’s climate science!

********************

Will Happer – Realist: President Trump did the unthinkable for many. He appointed a distinguished physicist, William Happer, to a committee being formed to review the security risks to the nation from climate change. Readers may recall that TWTW has suggested that the threat assessments are dubious at best. They lack critical thinking. Fort Eustis, VA, on the James River, is listed as one of the military facilities most at risk from sea level rise caused by global warming. The tidal gages in the area show that sea levels are not rising by an unusual extent.

But, the entire area of Norfolk / Newport News, which is on the low coastal plane, is sinking. Land subsidence is occurring, primarily from ground water extraction from two major wells which are forming clear funnels that show subsiding land centered on these wells. One well is at West Point on the York River about 30 miles northeast of Fort Eustis. The other well is in Franklin, Virginia, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Eustis. A cost-effective alternative for water may be to replace these wells with one or two desalination plants similar to that employed in Carlsbad, CA, using prefiltration technology developed in Israel.

When the appointment of Happer was announced, the global warming chorus roared – how dare the president appoint a physicist who may question the threat assessments by experts. The noise may be reminiscent of the uproar the occurred when President Reagan dared question the assessments of the experts who considered that the Soviet economy was comparable to that of the US, including the first US Nobel laureate in economics. After the Soviet economy collapsed, the critics of Reagan forgot their previous economic assessments.

A sample of the response to Happer can be found in an editorial in Science Magazine written by a journalist for an environmental news service, E & E News.

“William Happer, a prominent opponent of climate science in the Trump administration, is heading a new White House effort to downplay the national security risks posed by climate change.”

“Happer, who is not a climate scientist, has rejected mainstream climate science for years. He routinely says that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and that the world could burn more fossil fuels without harm. Happer heads a group called the CO2 Coalition, which advocates for a rejection of climate science, and he has said the world is in a ‘CO2 drought.’”

“’Frankly, it’s insulting to those in the intelligence community and those who are in our science agencies,’ [Francesco] Femia [co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security] said. ‘Within the Pentagon and within the intelligence community, there are a lot of people who are evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots, and they see a risk and they begin to put that into their analysis because they know if you don’t do so, you’re going to have a blind spot on security. And that’s never a good thing.’”

Such comments prompt a response such as, “Why do these evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots ignore atmospheric temperature trends, where the greenhouse gas effect occurs?” And “What is fact-based about claims of exponential sea level rise, increasing sea levels by an ever-increasing rate?”

But, perhaps the most pointed response came from physicist Luboš Motl in his blog, The Reference Frame, when addressing political comments by former mayor Michael Bloomberg and Senator Chuck Schumer:

“Can’t they see that Happer clearly knows more about these matters – especially the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect is an example) and the relative CO2 famine in the present – than they and their Senate clubs and aides combined? Bullying of a scientist by a politician is the right word here.”

This goes to the core. The enormous benefits of carbon dioxide fertilization are well-documented, substantiated by experiments and real-world observations, but ignored by the IPCC and the climate chorus. Worse, the IPCC, etc. have produced a distorted version of the absorption and reemission of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Defending the Orthodoxy, Changing Seas, and Other Scientific News.

********************

The Greenhouse Effect: this is the first in a series on the greenhouse effect as it is being measured in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases are nearly transparent to sunlight but partially opaque to thermal radiation from Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is a predicted warming of the surface and lower atmosphere and a cooling of the stratosphere and upper atmosphere as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, H2O. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is of lesser importance. Nitrous oxide, N2O, and methane, CH4, make only minor contributions to greenhouse warming. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen, N2, and oxygen, O2, are not greenhouse gases since they are nearly transparent to both sunlight and thermal radiation. There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect exists, but there is considerable uncertainty about how large it is.

Many economic models show that small warming of any kind will benefit the Earth, for example, by lengthening growing seasons and by lessening human mortality due to extreme cold. Separately, increasing concentrations of CO2 have enormously positive effects on the growth of crops and forests. Greening of the Earth from more CO2 is already being observed from satellites. It is important to resolve whether the greenhouse effect from credible increases in CO2 concentrations will be modest and beneficial or large and harmful. Theoretical uncertainties in science have traditionally been resolved by comparing theoretical predictions with observations. Comparing predicted and observed temperature changes of the surface and lower atmosphere is an incisive way to resolve theoretical uncertainties about the magnitude of the greenhouse effect.

Surface and lower-atmospheric temperatures are expected to warm in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. But surface temperatures, and their global averages, are influenced by other factors, like land-use changes, suburban and urban development. Surface temperatures are measured by thermometers here and there—sometimes in very bad locations—, and effort is made to interpolate between sites, often poorly. In contrast, satellites can measure atmospheric temperatures with nearly full sampling of the globe and with few of the systematic errors that plague surface measurements.

Instruments on satellites measure the intensity of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere. Temperatures are deduced from these intensities by methods analogous to those used in scanning temporal thermometers, available in most pharmacies. Atmospheric temperatures determined from satellite observations have been confirmed by direct measurements of temperature from weather balloons, many hundreds of which are launched every day.

Another reason to use atmospheric rather than surface temperatures as the touchstone for testing climate models is that climate models predict maximum warming at altitudes of 5 to 10 km in the tropical atmosphere. Lesser warmings are predicted for the surface, where it is harder to make reliable measurements.

Using atmospheric temperature data, John Christy et al. have repeatedly shown that the global climate models, in general, greatly overestimate the warming of the bulk atmosphere. Using 60 years of weather balloon data, Ross McKitrick and Christy have shown that an assumed pronounced warming centered over the tropics at about 30,000 to 35,000 feet (9 to 11 km, 300 to 200 millibars) is not found. The McKitrick and Christy study reinforces a 2007 study by Douglas, Christy, Pearson and Singer. This “hot spot” may be logically derived from a warming of the surface, whatever the cause. Its failure to appear after 60 years of observations is significant. There is something wrong with the theory. methodology, and/or procedure used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers such as the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the models on which they rely.

TWTW addressed this lack of a pronounced warming in the context of the widely accepted Global Annual Energy Budget by Kiehl and Trenberth on January 26 and February 2. The vicinity of center of the graphic depicts the concepts at issue “Thermals and Evapotranspiration” at the surface absorbing heat then rising in the atmosphere then releasing latent heat in the atmosphere. Based on the evidence presented by McKitrick and Christy, these processes are not intensifying. Thus, assumptions that storms, floods, droughts, etc. are intensifying are not justified by observational evidence.

Using observed evidence, Christy et al. have shown that the divergence between climate models and actual nature is increasing. The divergence is likely to continue unless the theory and methodology used by the IPCC, et al., are changed substantially. This is the first of several TWTWs that will address our understanding of the actual greenhouse gas effect and why the efforts of the IPCC, et al. are faulty.

Although not comprehensive and not embodied in a coherent theory, significant observational data of the atmosphere are being collected. These data suggest the IPCC has significantly overestimated the total greenhouse gas effect, especially that of carbon dioxide. These data bring into question the right side of what is depicted in the Kiehl and Trenberth diagram, the outgoing surface radiation resulting in far less outgoing longwave radiation. Unfortunately, outgoing longwave radiation, which is in the infrared range, cannot be observed from the surface.

The 1979 Charney report assumed that the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide, which had been measured by laboratory experiments, would be greatly amplified by increased water vapor. Since there were no comprehensive measurements of outgoing longwave radiation, there was no hard evidence supporting or refuting this concept. Thus, the 1979 Charney report embodied speculation concerning the impact of greenhouse gases that may have been appropriate at that time; but, as with atmospheric temperature trends, this speculation has been superseded by observational data.

To better express the effects of greenhouse gases on outgoing infrared radiation, it is useful to think of placing thin layers of slightly smoky glass over a bright light shining through a window with each layer of glass being less smoky, clearer. As more layers are placed on, the total effect increases, but effect of the last layer is less noticeable than the previous one. In terminology that will follow in future TWTWs, if there is no interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere (the window), it is said to be transparent. If there is considerable interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere, it is said to be opaque. Different greenhouse gases interfere with different wavelengths of outbound infrared energy. At a particular wavelength, carbon dioxide may be transparent to infrared energy, yet at a different wavelength, opaque to infrared energy. The ability of greenhouse gases to absorb, then re-emit energy varies with the wavelength of the energy.

Since the advent of the satellite era, several countries have been compiling data on the atmosphere. For example, with what is called the A-Train of multiple satellites, and a similar, lower orbiting, C-Train, satellites from the US, France, and Japan collect a wide variety of data, including visible, infrared and microwave energy, phases of water, studies of vegetation, atmospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, aerosols, clouds, water levels on land areas, snow depths, etc. The information is shared among international partners.

Future installments in TWTW will discussed how these data, and other data, are compiled and developed into databases that are available to the public and can be downloaded onto personal computers. Further discussions will include how these calculations based on observations contradict the findings of the IPCC, etc., and their models. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues – Atmosphere.

********************

Hurricanes and Climate Change: On her web site, Climate Etc., Judith Curry has posted two installments on a series about Hurricanes & Climate Change. The first is on detection, going back about 5,000 years. The second is on attribution which she states must be based on observations, not models. See links under Models v. Observations.

********************

Additions and Corrections: A reader on WUWT wrote that TWTW linked to the headline of comments on a paper changing ocean pH with changing wind patterns. The link created the impression that the paper contradicted recent lowering of pH claimed by many. Actually, the paper showed 159-year reconstruction of pH based on a set of coral collected in the northern South China Sea. TWTW should have made such a comment under the link.

********************

Number of the Week: Not €1.57 billion, but closer to €7 billion. An EU energy study claimed that annual levies on UK consumers in 2016 for subsidies to renewable electricity were €1.57 billion, whereas the correct figure is closer to €7 billion. It seems that subsidies for green energy are experiencing more exponential growth than increases in sea level. See link under Problems in the Orthodoxy.

Climate change science pioneer Wallace Smith Broecker dies

US professor raised early alarms about climate change and popularised term ‘global warming’

By Jonathan Watts, The Guardian, Feb 19, 2019

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/19/climate-change-science-pioneer-wallace-smith-broecker-dies

“Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the ‘Achilles heel of the climate system’ and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt.

“In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company.

“His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience.”

Hurricanes & Climate Change: Detection

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 17, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/17/hurricanes-climate-change-detection/#more-24723

“I am preparing a new Special Report on Hurricanes and Climate Change.

“There has not been a timeline or synthesis of these results for the past five thousand years, either regionally or for the entire coastal region. However, it is clear from these analyses that significant variability of landfall probabilities occurs on century to millennial time scales. There appears to have been a broad ‘hyperactive period’ from 3400 to 1000 years B.P. High activity persisted in the Gulf of Mexico until 1400 AD, with a shift to more frequent severe hurricane strikes from the Bahamas to New England occurring between 1400 and 1675 AD. Since 1760, there was a gradual decline in activity until the 1990’s.”

Hurricanes and Climate Change: Attribution

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 20, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/20/24737/#more-24737

“Models and theory suggest that hurricane intensity and rainfall should increase in a warming climate. There is no theory that predicts a change in the number of hurricanes or a change in hurricane tracks with warmer temperatures.

“Convincing attribution of any changes requires that a change in hurricane characteristics be identified from observations, with the change exceeding natural variability.”

“The IEA WEO 2018 supports a worldwide energy transition and forecasts capacity additions in power generation, by type, by 2020.

“There is no need to delve into levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and all the minutia associated with LCOE calculations. The cost and output of units being installed worldwide establishes, unequivocally, that wind and PV Solar are more expensive.”

“In the case of the 1976 Swine Flu episode, President Ford, acting on the advice from the country’s best medical advisors, authorized dramatic action — aggressive intervention, in the form of a national immunization campaign — which turned out badly. Many of the advisors that had originally convinced President Ford to act almost immediately had second thoughts, long before the adverse effects started to turn up. Historians have been critical of Ford but the blame stems from the difficulty of decision making under deep uncertainty.”

1. The Green New Deal’s Impossible Electric Grid

Renewable energy can’t consistently balance power supply with demand.

By Robert Blohm, WSJ, Feb 20, 2019

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-green-new-deals-impossible-electric-grid-11550705997

“Mr. Blohm is an elected member of the Operating Committee and the Standards Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the continental bulk electric system’s reliability regulator designated by the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and by all the Canadian provinces’ energy regulators.”

In expressing a critical concern Mr Blohm writes:

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal calls for a fully renewable electric power grid. Regardless of the economic or political challenges of bringing this about, it is likely technologically impossible.

“An electric power grid involves second-by-second balancing between generated supply and consumer demand. In the case of a sudden imbalance—such as from the loss of a generator’s output—all the remaining generators on the grid instantaneously pool together. Each one pitches in a small part of the required power to make up for the lost generator fast enough to keep supply and demand balanced.

“This doesn’t work for wind and solar because you can’t spontaneously increase wind or sunshine. Hydro power is limited and unevenly distributed around the country. And for safety reasons, nuclear power—even if the Green New Dealers accepted it—can’t be cranked up to neutralize imbalances. Nor can consumer demand be suddenly reduced enough.

“Fossil-fuel turbines, by contrast, very naturally compensate for sudden supply outages. The inertia of the spinning mass of rotors provides the extra energy needed to compensate for the loss for the first few seconds. (Wind-rotor inertia is too short-lived.) Meanwhile the generators’ on-line reserve capacity kicks in, giving a rapid boost in power output to prevent the turbines from slowing down. That substitute power, called “governor response,” lasts as long as 15 minutes. During that time a single replacement generator ramps up to compensate entirely for the loss. All the turbines on the grid are thereby restored to their original speed, and the governor response is rearmed for the next disturbance.

An all-renewables grid would require prohibitively expensive battery storage to compensate for sudden power losses. Even with batteries, the lost power would have to be fed through “inverters”—a technology that converts variable-wind-speed alternating current, solar-power direct current, and battery-power direct-current into alternating current—to allow for synthetic inertia and governor response in the case of a disruption.

“But according to a 2017 report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, if a large enough share of the power grid flows through inverters, the grid itself may collapse. Existing inverter technologies have faced serious software problems and prompted outages where they have been deployed. The IEEE is trying to create a global standard for inverter design—though heavy input by Chinese suppliers bent on commandeering the technology may pose a national-security risk if the U.S. were to incorporate the standard.

“How could the market price in the cost of providing rapid replacement energy that renewable sources can’t provide reliably? The entity that caused the outage should need to pay. Yet the power industry—to say nothing of the Green New Dealers—hasn’t given this much thought. An all-renewables power grid is destined to collapse.”

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — A year ago at The Honda Classic, Jhonattan Vegas made seven birdies all week.

He’s off to a much better start this time.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys Thursday, shooting a 6-under 64 to open a two-stroke lead after the first round. Lucas Glover bogeyed his finishing hole for a 66, leaving him tied with Zach Johnson, Ernie Els and Ben Silverman — who went to college at nearby Florida Atlantic.

“Hit my irons the best I’ve hit them all year and I’ve always liked this golf course,” Vegas said. “It’s kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.”

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

“To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2-under par on this golf course, it’s great,” Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed “Bear Trap” stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par 4 is sandwiched by a pair of par 3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple, wound up beating only one of the 74 finishers and wrapped up the week with a final-round 78. He sprayed irons everywhere, missed half of the fairways, more than half of the greens.

But Thursday, he was dialed in — missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

“I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,” Vegas said.

The 34-year-old Venezuelan has three PGA Tour victories, winning the 2011 Bob Hope Classic and the RBC Canadian Open in 2016 and 2017.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that’s not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson — whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph — was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

“We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,” Johnson said. “The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. ... It was not Honda wind. I don’t think we’re going to get Honda wind until Sunday.”

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour — the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

“Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,” Els said. “It’s late in my career, but I’ll take any win now.”

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4-under.

That’s when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn’t believe it’ll impact him Friday.

“Just more of a shock than anything,” Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap — making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

“It’s a great round, at the end of the day,” Garcia said.

DIVOTS: Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National. In his last four rounds at the Honda, he’s 7 over on that hole. ...

541,Empty,2019-02-28T21:49:44Z,Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present in Palm Beach Gardens,"Jhonattan Vegas took the early first-round lead on Thursday at the Honda Classic, a tournament that has recently attracted a stellar field but has fallen victim this year of the PGA Tour’s new condensed schedule.

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game’s biggest names from the tournament.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present - Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler - making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its own making.

Honda began sponsoring the south Florida tournament in 1982 but this year, it comes coming directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August, instead of late September.

The scheduling, however, appeared of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

“I was able to drive really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,” said the 34-year-old from Venezuela.

“I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.

“Hitting those irons well to some of these tough pins makes the day a little bit easier. Wind wasn’t that hard so you could be a little more aggressive than usual.”

Vegas, ranked 131st in the world, is a three-times PGA Tour winner.

He led by two strokes from South African Ernie Els, American Zach Johnson and Canadian Ben Silverman with half the field back in the clubhouse.

542,Empty,2019-02-25T08:01:47Z,"Southern Utah wasn't always a riding paradise, but as they say, if you build it, they will come. The post 2019 Bible Feature Story: Slow Roll appeared first on BIKE Magazine.","As I climbed out of a truck in Utah's Gooseberry Mesa parking lot, toothy, redrock peaks filled the view to the north and east, highlighted by the world-famous skyline of Zion National Park. I'd been told to expect a two- to three-hour ride that was rugged and technical. But perusing our flat surroundings made me skeptical.

Perhaps sensing my apprehension, Jake Weber, a retired Army combat engineer-turned guide with Utah Mountain Biking Adventures, offered a measure of reassurance. ""We get a lot of people who show up and say they want to ride 30 miles every day of their trip,"" he told me. ""But after about 15 miles on their first day, they're like, 'Yeah, we're good,' and they're ready for a beer at the trailhead.""

Welcome to the land of ""mesa miles."" Maybe you've heard of them. In short—no pun intended—they're harder than standard miles which makes them feel longer. The more you ride them, the more comfortable you get disclosing that you ""only"" rode 10 miles today and it still took two hours.

I had never ridden a mesa mile when I got to Washington County, Utah, which is well known to desert aficionados as a singletrack oasis and has hosted the world's premier freeride competition, Red Bull Rampage, off and on since 2001. Still, it remains something of a hidden gem to the rest of the riding world, in part because it's remote: four hours from Salt Lake City, six hours from Phoenix, nine hours from Denver.

St. George, the county seat and a city of roughly 90,000 people, spent decades as a retirement community for golfers and still attracts celebrities like Michael Jordan to its greens come winter. But starting around the mid 2000s, adventure took a bite out of golf's place as the area's top attraction. The number of local outfitters swelled from a dozen to more than 50. Mountain biking overtook road biking as the most popular two-wheeled pursuit. With an almost 90-percent population jump since 2000, Washington County ranks as the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America. It also has a warmer climate than its sometimes-rival, Moab, five hours to the northeast, and offers legitimate riding and 60-degree temps in the belly of winter.

On this beaming morning in early October, photographer Margus Riga and I had joined a local crew for a spin along the South Rim and through Hidden Canyon. Gooseberry, the original mesa ride and still a lot of locals' favorite mesa of the five with trails, carries an almost-mythical reputation among those who know about it. Mostly that is due to Goose's sandstone features and their surprising, albeit intimidating, ridability.

""They're like giant rock biscuits that you can just roll up onto,"" said 54-year-old Kenny Jones, who owns Gooseberry Yurts and once finished 14 straight Leadville 100s back-to-back. ""A lot of the bottom sections of the rocks have a nice, roll-y out. So they look really steep but then the tranny grabs your front wheel and gets you out of the vertical position.""

We followed Quentin Morisette, owner of Over the Edge Sports in nearby Hurricane, as he weaved between puddles in the rock—and the brine shrimp they hold, making it a no-no to ride through them—and abided by the local code not to leave tracks in the dirt. He led us to a playground that he called the Skatepark: two deep, connected bowls that mimic the flow of a purpose-built concrete bowl. From there we swooped between stands of juniper, piñon and cedar trees, as well as the mesa's namesake gooseberry bushes. After 15 minutes of wrestling our bikes up, down and over the sandstone landscape—a full-body workout that longtime local Bill Bergeron compares to ""being stuck in a cage with a gorilla""—we came upon a 20-foot-tall biscuit that looked like a soft-serve ice-cream tower. It was steep and layered, with a small drop at the entry over significant exposure. Morisette hiked to the top for the second time in his life and prepared to drop in.

The line, my riding partners explained, was not to be confused with the Wall of Considerable Consequences, which we'd pass later, or the Wall of Death, which we'd skip. Morisette rolled in, landed the initial drop and rocketed out the bottom as the rest of us filmed it with our phones. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" shouted Weber, who served two tours in Iraq and left the military after a pair of traumatic brain injuries saddled him with PTSD. Now he coaches a local high school team and rarely sees someone test the sharp end, hence his incredulous response.

Morisette let out a sly grin. ""I've been riding here for 23 years, and it just gets better,"" he said. ""When you're on the rock, the sky's the limit.""

As we continued toward Gooseberry's high point, I realized why locals pay attention to their tires' side knobs here: You need a lof of support to grip the off-camber sandstone. It helps that the trail is marked by white dots on the rock, too; otherwise it's easy to wander off track.

We pedaled over a 4-foot-wide plank to the Point, an airy perch overlooking the valley and Zion. The trail only gains 300 vertical feet from the White Trailhead (elevation: 5,100 feet above sea level) to here, but the entire ride includes about 900 feet of gain. ""It's all 10 feet at a time,"" Morisette quipped.

We ogled the old Rampage venue to the north, which includes the notorious King Kong descent, as well as Flying Monkey, a mesa across the valley where the government, legend has it, used to send furry primates down a rail propelled by a rocket at supersonic speeds to test military ejector seats.

Then we returned the way we came, back to the trailhead. Slightly under the weather, I collapsed in the gravelly shade, feeling like I'd ridden 20 miles if not more. Someone informed me it was actually less than 10. I sighed, chalked it up to the mesa effect and closed my eyes for a nap, while the others tipped back beers in the sun.

According to Washington County's GIS department, the local mountain biking scene encompasses 296 miles of mapped trails to go with a gnarliness spectrum ranging from sublime cross-country favorites like Hurricane Rim, J.E.M. and Dead Ringer, to the five local mesas and their sandstone playgrounds, to big-boy gravity lines that attract the world's best freeriders every October.

The area's rise to prominence happened neither quickly nor due to a mass movement. On the contrary, it started in late 1993 when a pair of native sons took up the sport at age 49. Twin brothers Morgan and Mike Harris had grown up in Rockville, a tiny town on the Virgin River at the mouth of Zion Canyon, but because their father forbade them from riding dirt bikes, they didn't start until they were 26. As Morgan tells it, they rode motos for 20 years, then performance ATVs for three, at which point they grew wary of the danger and turned to mountain bikes.

In the early days, Morgan rode a primitive bike with a shoddy fork. ""Boy, I went home bloody a lot,"" he chuckles. A few other locals were riding at the time, but they mainly stuck to the mellow Green Valley Loop. ""There wasn't any real anchor trail to draw people to the area,"" Harris recalls.

He and Mike used to hunt deer, coyotes and rabbits on Gooseberry Mesa, and they often heard visitors talk about slickrock riding in Moab. They knew Gooseberry contained similar features and started poking around, starting with the slab that parallels the White Road. They built a short trail through one of the mesa's mini-canyons, then found out they needed a permit. So they met with the BLM in 1994 to talk about expanding their work to the north and south rims and Hidden Canyon. ""Originally they wanted 15 cents a foot, per year, for the use of the land,"" Harris says. Then the agency softened its stance. ""They said if you can have everything completed by Trail Days of 1996, we'll do a trail dedication. We had it done, but it took them until '98 to dedicate it.""

With Gooseberry complete, the Harris brothers turned their attention to Little Creek Mountain, which they'd been staring at for years from Gooseberry. They started exploring its slabs, ancient petroglyphs and fossils (there's actually a dinosaur bone embedded in the sandstone in one spot) and potential trail corridors that didn't require slaughtering flora. After a year-and-a-half of building there—with unofficial permission from a BLM official, Harris says—the agency changed its mind and asked them to stop. So they did, again shifting to where they thought the next destination could be. In this case it was a long redrock spine that would come to be known as Church Rocks.

Mike Harris quit riding after Little Creek, leaving Morgan to continue alone. Luckily others picked up the slack, and soon enough a growing community of riders had built Guacamole, which fostered its own mini-network on the mesa including The Whole Guacamole, Holy Guacamole and Salt on the Rim.

Harris left to build trails in Nevada after constructing Holy Guacamole, and now, at age 73, he just maintains existing routes. But the foundation he and Mike laid continues to anchor the network. If you ask 20 locals to name their favorite trail, like I did, you could get 15 different answers. The scene now includes a 100-mile race—True Grit, held every March in St. George—and a respected advocacy organization, the Dixie Mountain Bike Trails Association (DMBTA), which was launched in 2010 by True Grit founder Cimarron Chacon. ('Dixie' is a common moniker in Washington County because the early settlers grew cotton, which led to the area being known as 'Utah's Dixie.')

DMBTA only counts about 75 official members, but more than 2,000 people follow the organization on social media, ""and a lot of them come out to our volunteer days,"" says club president Kevin Christopherson. Others hand him money on the trails, even if they're not from the area. In addition, the Rampage organizers have donated about $14,000 to DMBTA each of the past two years.

The roots and robust support keep the area on the broader map, attracting riders from around the world—with a healthy dose of freeriders each spring, an influx that Morisette affectionately calls the Canadian Invasion. The key to providing such a reliable product when so many other destinations in the region cannot, he says, is the geography. Just north of Hurricane, Interstate 15 goes from 3,500 feet in elevation to above 5,000 and stays there, which places Zion on the northern edge of viable winter and early spring riding.

Although a lot of local rides, particularly the mesas, require driving a fair distance to park at a trailhead, not everywhere does. One of the guys we rode Gooseberry with, a diehard XC fanatic named Josh Wolfe, lives in St. George and doesn't own a car. We bumped into him the next morning in the nondescript parking lot for Zen and Barrel Ride, just over a dirt mound from St. George's subdivisions and commercial sprawl. We had just finished up an ambitious combo ride in a group of eight.

Wolfe was on his way out for a midday loop, and after our morning figure-eight on Zen and Barrel, I understood why he lives so close to these trails. Zen features the kind of ledgy, technical terrain that makes your forearms cramp. Kenny Jones called it a ""rim-basher trail,"" and halfway through our descent it delivered. Jake Miller, a Red Rock ambassador and standout local rider, buckled an $1,800 carbon wheel in two places without crashing. Despite its ride-from-home proximity to a city of 90,000, you still feel like you're away from the hectic rush of civilization when you reach the top. Then the real fun begins. Both Riga, who lives in Vancouver and calls the North Shore home, and I deemed it our favorite trail of the week.

We continued on to the freeride-friendly Barrel from there, led by longtime St. George rider Bryce Pratt, who built it 15 years ago, and Mitchell Curwen, who recently refurbished it and added some features. ""If you want to see what a bike can do, this is a great place to take it,"" Curwen said as we pedaled up a wash toward the top. Pratt designed the trail to snake through a series of barrel cactuses, which look like stunted pony kegs with 3-inch-long thorns.

I followed a mother of three named Angie Anderson down the Waterfall, an aptly named chunky section that serves as Barrel's crux, if you don't count the jumps below. Some of those jumps dropped blindly off of giant boulders into perfectly sculpted transitions. Others were gaps, including one over a creek. Everything seemed to flow just as it should until we were back at the parking lot.

""Doing Zen and Barrel in the same day is a big day. They're probably our two most technical trails in St. George City,"" Curwen said. ""If you can get out of here without a broken bike part or broken body part, that's a win.""

Victorious, Riga and I returned to St. George later that afternoon to check out the Snake Hollow St. George Bike Park—the newest addition to the area's stable of radness. Built on 80 acres of city-owned land through a collaboration between DMBTA, the Southern Utah Bicycle Alliance and the Washington County Tourism Office, the facility was funded by $1.6 million in tax dollars and was slated to open the month after our visit. But there were already dozens of kids testing it out after school. This winter, city workers and volunteers are planning to add a 5.5-mile NICA racecourse through the lava field on the lot's southern end. According to county tourism director Kevin Lewis, it will be the only year-round bike park in Utah.

The most recent addition to Washington County's singletrack menu arrived two years ago when DMBTA finished a 7-mile intermediate loop on Wire Mesa. In its first year of existence, trail counters recorded 16,000 visitors—or an average of 44 a day. It's close to Gooseberry and Grafton mesas, so you'd expect it to see traffic, but the number still quantified the area's growing renown. (In total, 178,000 people rode BLM trails around Washington County last year, including 30,000 on Gooseberry.)

The numbers are a far cry from when Morgan Harris broached the idea of a Gooseberry trail to the BLM 25 years ago. ""At that first meeting, they said, 'Being that remote, 7-and-a-half miles off the highway, you're probably only going to see 36 riders a month, at most,'"" Harris recalled. Within three years of Gooseberry's trails being open, the local bike shop owners told Harris they'd seen a 60-percent increase in sales. Five years later, when Harris' fork fell apart, Zion Cycles founder Fred Pagles gave him a new Trek Remedy and free service and parts for life. When Harris protested, Pagles said: ""If you hadn't done what you did, I wouldn't have a business.""

There is still a touch of uncertainty about what will happen to unofficial trails on BLM land that have become wildly popular and mapped, like Little Creek and Dig It on Grafton Mesa. A long-in-the-works travel management plan is nearing completion, and locals are optimistic the BLM will bring them into the fold and declare them legal, since closing them would be more complicated and potentially hurt the area's economic growth.

But whatever happens, the local scene is plenty healthy, as evidenced by a recent show of support for Harris after he was diagnosed with gum cancer. In mid-May, Harris underwent surgery to remove a tumor, and doctors removed his fibula from his lower right leg and used it to rebuild his jaw. Locals held a fundraiser to help cover his medical bills, bringing in nearly $25,000. Over the Edge built a new Ibis Mojo HD for Harris to ride into his 80s. At a post-ride barbecue in October, Harris said he still didn't have the leg power to ride technical terrain, as much as he wanted to.

Instead, he had been maintaining trails he built a generation ago. ""I get out there at daylight and get done before it gets too hot,"" he said. ""Me and the dog, Hazel."" His tools were hidden in the bushes as he spoke.

I asked Harris what he thinks of the community that he and his brother helped to create. ""It amazes me what's happened here,"" he said. ""When I was building trail, I never expected any payback. Payback was people having a smile on their face, loving what you built. I can't believe this came out of us wanting to ride a trail on Gooseberry.""

Gerry Butts, Trudeau's close friend and former principal secretary, wrote to the committee chair, Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, stating that after watching the testimony of Jody Wilson-Raybould, he believes his evidence would be of assistance as the committee considers alleged interference into the decision to prosecute the Quebec-based engineering and construction company.

I just made the following request of the Justice Committee Chair. <a href=""https://t.co/MUCJwnldui"">pic.twitter.com/MUCJwnldui</a> —@gmbutts

""I need a short period of time to receive legal advice concerning my evidence and to be able to produce relevant documents to the committee,"" the wrote in the letter.

The committee agreed to hear from Butts and will invite him to appear next Wednesday. MPs will also call on Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick and Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of justice, back to testify.

Wernick and Drouin appeared last week.

Butts resigned from the PMO on Feb. 18 amid allegations he and others exerted political interference on Wilson-Raybould to override the Public Prosecution Service director's decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin.

""At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians,"" Butts said in a statement at the time.

Need for 'solution'

He said the swirling accusations were distracting from the ""vital work"" the prime minister and his staff were doing for Canadians.

""My reputation is my responsibility, and that is for me to defend. It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away,"" he said.

Trudeau was asked about his recent dealings with Butts today, and he confirmed that the last time the pair spoke was last Wednesday.

In her testimony to committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould detailed a meeting with Butts on Dec. 5, 2018. She said she wanted to speak about several things, including the barrage of people ""hounding"" her and her staff about the impact of prosecuting SNC-Lavalin.

""Towards the end of the meeting I raised how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate,"" she testified. ""Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff — he said I needed to find a solution.""

Jody Wilson-Raybould’s bombshell testimony prompted calls from the Conservative Party and the NDP to resign. 2:14

Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed by 11 PMO and other government officials, who continued to remind her of the economic and political consequences after she had made her independent decision as attorney general to proceed with the prosecution.

Liberal MP and justice committee chair Anthony Housefather issued a statement saying the committee needs more clarification after reviewing Wilson-Raybould's testimony.

""We believe that it is important that Mr. Butts respond to the account of the meeting of the 18th provided by Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould, in addition to the other allegations about him and PMO colleagues mentioned in her testimony,"" the statement reads.

Given that Wernick and Drouin appeared prior to cabinet confidence, and solicitor client privilege on the SNC file was waived for testimony before the Committee, and the fact they were mentioned by Wilson-Raybould in relation to the December 19 phone call and subsequent events, the committee wants to hear their recollection of events and conversations, Housefather wrote.

""We will consider next steps following hearing from these witnesses,"" he said.

Conservative MP Michael Cooper tweeted that he wants to call Trudeau to testify for two hours. He also wants Wilson-Raybould to return to testify, without any constraints due to solicitor-client privilege or cabinet confidence.

The government tabled a broad waiver, but Wilson-Raybould said it still limited what she could say about her resignation from cabinet, as well as her time as veterans affairs minister.

While before MPs, the following eight questions are likely to come up in one form or another as the committee tries to determine whether the Prime Minister's Office improperly pressured the former minister.

1. Was Wilson-Raybould threatened with personal or professional consequences by the Prime Minister's Office?

From testimony to the committee last week by Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick it is clear that Wilson-Raybould met with Trudeau and members of his staff to talk about SNC-Lavalin on a number of occasions. Understanding what was said in those meetings is crucial because it could shed light on whether or not Wilson-Raybould was gently nudged toward a decision, or threatened with consequences if she did not make one favourable to the PMO.

Wernick testified Feb. 21 that he did not inappropriately influence Wilson-Raybould to pressure the director of public prosecutions to sign a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerry Butts — who resigned last week in response to the allegations — have also denied any wrongdoing.

It is expected that Wilson-Raybould's version of events will help shed light on whether or not the Shawcross Doctrine was violated. According to the doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick told the justice committee last week that Trudeau did not try to direct Wilson-Raybould to make a decision in favour of a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin. ​ (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

2. Did Wilson-Raybould tell Trudeau she felt the Shawcross Doctrine had been crossed? If yes, when? If not, why not?

Since the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt pressured to decide in favour of a DPA for SNC-Lavalin, Trudeau has not only denied the allegations but also the very idea that such pressure, if and when it occurred, was brought to his attention.

Speaking to reporters in Winnipeg the day after Wilson-Raybould resigned from the federal cabinet on Feb. 12, Trudeau said that he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by Wilson-Raybould's decision to step down.

""In regards to the matter of SNC-Lavalin, let me be direct: the government of Canada did its job and to the clear public standards expected of it. If anybody felt differently, they had an obligation to raise that with me. No one, including Jody, did that.""

If Wilson-Raybould says she told Trudeau she felt improperly pressured, that would directly contradict the prime minister's words.

3. Why did Wilson-Raybould accept the move to Veterans Affairs in the January cabinet shuffle if she felt the PMO's conduct was improper?

On the day of the Jan. 14 cabinet shuffle, when Wilson-Raybould was moved into Veterans Affairs and made associate defence minister, she issued a long statement outlining her legislative and non-legislative achievements on the Justice file.

""Moving forward, I am very proud to be the minister of veterans affairs and associate minister of national defence. Any opportunity to serve and support Canada's veterans is a great honour, and I look forward to meeting with veterans across the country, engaging with the crucial matters that must be addressed, and continuing our government's progress to support and honour Canada's veterans,"" she said in a statement at the time.

CBC News coverage of today's testimony

Power & Politics with Vassy Kapelos will have special coverage of today's committee appearance by Jody Wilson-Raybould starting at 2 p.m. ET on CBC News Network. You can also watch P&P's special coverage starting at 3:30 p.m. ET on cbcnews.ca, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and follow our live blog and updated stories at cbc.ca/politics.

And tune in to World at 6 on Radio One and The National tonight at 10 p.m. on CBC Television for more news and analysis on today's events.

Wernick told the committee last week that Wilson-Raybould did not want to take on either of the two Indigenous cabinet positions. Turning down an Indigenous position in favour of another cabinet post suggests there was some horse-trading when it came to her new position.

If that's the case, explaining why she made the effort to negotiate for her cabinet post with a prime minister that may have acted improperly will shed light on the legal ethics the minister was weighing at the time.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says that PM Justin Trudeau is obviously hiding something by not allowing Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell her ""truth"" at committee today. 1:37

4. Why did Wilson-Raybould quit the federal cabinet and why did she wait until Feb. 12 to do so?

On Feb. 11, Trudeau took reporters' questions about the SNC-Lavalin affair, dismissing the accusations in the Globe and Mail as false. As partial proof of his argument Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould's ongoing ""presence in cabinet should speak for itself."" The next day Wilson-Raybould resigned.

If Wilson-Raybould tells the committee she felt the Shawcross Doctrine was crossed in the fall of 2018 and she was, in fact, threatened with personal or professional consequences by the PMO, her explanation as to why she decided to remain in cabinet despite that pressure will be key.

5. What was said in the Sept. 17 meeting between Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould and Wernick?

Wernick told the justice committee that the meeting was called by Trudeau to discuss the slow pace of legislation central to the government's Indigenous reconciliation agenda. When Wilson-Raybould asked Trudeau about SNC-Lavalin, Wernick said that Trudeau assured his then-attorney general that any decision in the case was hers to make.



​""He indicated that it was entirely her call to make, that she was the decider,"" Wernick testified. ""And that is a message the PM conveyed to the minister on every situation that I'm aware of that came up.""

6. What happened in the Dec. 5 meeting between Wilson-Raybould and Butts at the Chateau Laurier hotel in Ottawa?

Wernick told the justice committee that he did not know anything about the substance of the meeting, first reported in the Globe and Mail, between Butts and Wilson-Raybould.

According to a source that spoke to CBC News, when a staffer, the clerk or the prime minister himself speaks to a cabinet minister on an issue that will be discussed at cabinet, those conversations are considered a cabinet confidence.

The PMO has given Wilson-Raybould permission to discuss those conversations when she appears before the committee. Learning her version of events from that meeting will help the public understand whether or not Butts was involved in crossing the Shawcross Doctrine.

7. What was said in the Dec. 18 meeting between Wilson-Raybould's former chief of staff Jessica Prince, Gerry Butts and Katie Telford?

While there were no politicians present at the meeting, it stands to reason that whatever Prince heard in that meeting would have been relayed back to Wilson-Raybould. There has been no public account of this meeting, but a source tells CBC News that whatever transpired is crucial to Wilson-Raybould's argument that she was improperly pressured. Shedding some light on that conversation will help verify or discredit facts in the case.

8. What was said during the Dec. 19 phone call between Wilson-Raybould and Wernick?

Wernick told the committee last week that he ""conveyed to [Wilson-Raybould] that a lot of her colleagues, and the prime minister, were quite anxious.

""There were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences — not for her, the consequences for the [SNC-Lavalin] workers and the communities and the suppliers.""

Determining the substance of that conversation will help to inform the committee as to whether or not Wernick applied any improper pressure on Wilson-Raybould.",8 questions the justice committee is likely to ask Jody Wilson-Raybould today,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-wilson-raybould-snc-lavalin-questions-1.5034730

The Compton–Stanstead MP will be the first female agriculture minister in Canadian history.

Minister for Women and Gender Equality Maryam Monsef will take on international development as part of her duties.

Wilson-Raybould resigned as minister of Veterans Affairs, a position she was moved to after first entering cabinet as justice minister, on Feb. 12.

Ministers questioned on Wilson-Raybould

Despite not physically being at Rideau Hall, Wilson-Raybould cast a shadow over the proceedings.

The former justice minister told a parliamentary committee earlier this week she believes she was shuffled out of that department because she refused to bend to pressure from 11 officials — including from the Prime Minister's Office — who wanted her to give SNC-Lavalin a way out of bribery and corruption charges.

She had held the Veterans Affairs post for a month, moved there Jan. 14 after Scott Brison, former president of the Treasury Board, retired from federal politics. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan had been acting minister of Veterans Affairs since Wilson-Raybould's resignation.

While no longer a member of cabinet, she remains a Liberal MP — at least for now. Trudeau has said he is considering whether Wilson-Raybould can remain in the Liberal caucus.

""I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

Newly-minted Minister of Agriculture Marie-Claude Bibeau comments on the role of government in protecting jobs. 0:40

MacAulay, Bibeau and Monsef all said they would support Trudeau's decision on whether their former cabinet colleague can stay in caucus.

""I can live with any decision,"" said MacAulay.

The Quebec-based engineering and infrastructure company was seeking a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, that would allow the firm to avoid criminal prosecution, providing it met a number of conditions. Under the DPA, if those conditions aren't met, criminal prosecution could be pursued.

Trudeau has maintained she would still be justice minister if Brison had not stepped down.

MacAulay becomes the fourth official Veterans Affairs minister since the Liberal government came into power in 2015.

Kent Hehr held the role for just under two years before Seamus O'Regan took the reins. He was sent to Indigenous Services in the January cabinet shuffle.

""To represent veterans is a distinct honour,"" said MacAulay, who served as secretary of state for veterans back in the late 1990s.

As early as Tuesday, Canadians could hear directly from Jody Wilson-Raybould on whether she was inappropriately pressured as attorney general to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

But beyond the political scandal, consider the failures of the RCMP and federal prosecutors in the case. Since 2012, the RCMP have charged eight people tied to allegations SNC engaged in bribery of foreign officials. Seven of those accused have had their cases tossed out of court due to delays or problems with evidence. RCMP and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada have yet to convict anyone from the company.

Many are asking whether they are really up to the job.

""Canada has a very poor record of enforcement,"" says James Cohen, head of the watchdog group Transparency International Canada. ""Canadian companies who engage in corruption have sadly been playing the odds that they will not get caught.""

The RCMP and PPSC's umbrella case against the company itself, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc and its subsidiaries, could be prosecutors' last hope.

To put it bluntly — they desperately need a win.

Bribing a dictator

SNC-Lavalin's troubles began in 2011, and unravelled like a spy novel.

The company, whose top construction executive for years paid bribes in Libya to win billions in contracts, moved out of the country temporarily when its patron, dictator Moammar Gadhafi, was ousted and killed.

One month later, as Libya burned, authorities in Mexico arrested a group of alleged plotters accused of trying to smuggle one of Gadhafi's sons to a life in hiding. Among those detained — but released — was an SNC money man, Stéphane Roy.

A month after that, a senior SNC-Lavalin employee invited a CBC reporter to a remote ski hill in Quebec. He whispered news of an internal revolt at SNC-Lavalin over allegations the top construction exec for years paid bribes and laundered money for the Gadhafi regime through Swiss banks, all to keep contracts flowing to SNC-Lavalin.

Those stories made headlines, sparked firings, police investigations, and eventually criminal charges.

In April 2012, that executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, was arrested in Switzerland where he was held for two and a half years. He pleaded guilty in Switzerland to bribery and laundering millions to win SNC-Lavalin contracts in Libya.

'We've done nothing wrong'

The company has long maintained that any bribes or kickbacks were the work of rogue employees.

The company's latest CEO Neil Bruce told investors on Friday the company will vigorously defend itself against the charge its international construction arm paid bribes.

""We've done nothing wrong as a company and none of our current employees have done anything wrong,"" Bruce said.

To date, the only conviction of anyone at SNC-Lavalin related to foreign bribery was the guilty plea from Ben Aïssa secured by Switzerland.

In Canada, so far every single charge the RCMP has laid has either not stuck — or not yet been to trial.

This month, a charge of obstruction of justice was thrown out against Sami Bebawi due to court delays.

Bebawi was SNC-Lavalin's top construction executive in the years before Riadh Ben Aïssa. RCMP charged Bebawi in 2014, accusing him of sending a lawyer to visit Ben Aïssa in a Swiss prison to offer $10 million if he covered up Bebawi's involvement in Libya. What Bebawi didn't know is that he'd walked into a sting operation. Ben Aïssa has become a vital co-operating witness for the RCMP.

Bebawi still awaits trial in Montreal on fraud and bribery charges tied to SNC-Lavalin's Libya operations..

Roy, the SNC-Lavalin money man detained briefly in Mexico in 2011, also walked out of court free this month. As vice-president of finance under Ben Aïssa, Roy was charged with fraud and bribery tied to Libya. But last week a judge tossed all charges due to ""unreasonable"" delays by the prosecution.

Bangladesh boondoggle

The RCMP and PPSC suffered similar defeats in its case against employees of SNC-Lavalin International in Bangladesh over the company's failed bid to win a $1.3-billion contract to build the Padma Bridge.

The World Bank eventually debarred SNC-Lavalin from bidding on projects for 10 years.

However, Canada's prosecution of five people over the Bangladesh bridge project, including a low level engineer and two executives, eventually failed.

Watch: SNC and a bridge for Bangladesh

A joint CBC News investigation shows the bribery scandal surrounding Canada’s SNC-Lavalin is even more extensive than first reported, with its own special code involving several foreign countries. 14:55

Charges were dropped against engineer Mohammad Ismail who became a witness, turning over evidence of a widespread system of secret payments used by the SNC-Lavalin division.

The four others were acquitted, after a judge ruled that RCMP wiretap evidence collected by bugging an executive's office was inadmissible.

Complex investigations, changing priorities

Canada has a sparse record of convicting anyone in foreign bribery cases.

To date, the RCMP and PPSC have only ever secured six convictions under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act since its adoption two decades ago.

The RCMP superintendent who led these international investigations says those convictions nonetheless sent a message to corporate Canada.

""The early cases in Canada which resulted in fines to corporations led to compliance regimes being established country-wide by Canadian firms operating globally,"" says Biagio Carrese, a 29-year veteran anti-money laundering investigator with the RCMP.

Notably, he says, the three-year prison term handed down to Nazir Karagar of CryptoMetrics Canada for attempting to bribe government officials in India put Canadian executives on notice.

""The impact was immediate. It set a precedent,"" said Carrese, who has left the RCMP and now works in the private sector.

He declined to comment on the SNC-Lavalin case, but acknowledges foreign bribery cases can fail — or struggle — due to their international scope, legal and technical complexity, and the need for an intense amount of time, resources and special expertise.

RCMP's National Division had 115 dedicated investigators by 2013. A year later, after the Parliament Hill shootings, and the rise of homegrown ISIS sympathizers, many investigators were reassigned to anti-terrorism, depleting resources in the fight against foreign bribery.

""In a world of ever-changing priorities, this can be difficult. I believe this to be true of police and prosecutors,"" Carrese said.

Watch: SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds in front of the Justice Committee

Canada's top civil servant shared some strong words with the Justice Committee regarding the ever-growing SNC-Lavalin scandal. So what should we make of his testimony? And are we any closer to understanding what actually happened? The At Issue panel is back looking for the answers. 12:57

Transparency International, in its 2018 report Exporting Corruption, noted a recent deterioration in enforcement in Canada, noting no new major cases launched in recent years.

Convictions in Canada

While no SNC-Lavalin employee has been convicted of foreign bribery, the company has faced humiliating headlines over corruption here at home.

Sûreté du Québec and provincial prosecutors won convictions against former CEO Pierre Duhaime and his executive vice-president of construction Ben Aïssa over bribes paid to win the $1.3-billion contract to build the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) superhospital.

RCMP is also still investigating SNC-Lavalin over $2.3 million in kickbacks paid to the head of the Federal Bridge Corp. Appointee Michel Fournier (former chief of staff to Jean Chrétien) is serving a five-and-a-half year prison term for accepting payments to Swiss bank accounts coded named ""Zorro"" while doling out bridge contracts.

Today, as politicians and the public debate the fate of SNC-Lavalin, and whether it ought to be offered an out of court deal to resolve the foreign bribery case, the police and prosecutors who toiled for years no doubt have a thirst to see their work put before the courts.

Beyond the law, the politics, the potential impact on this giant company — our public guardians have spent untold millions building a case and to date have little to show for it.","What's at stake for RCMP, prosecutors in the SNC-Lavalin case",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-bribery-snc-lavalin-case-1.5031712

Today is the day that Jody Wilson-Raybould finally speaks about what transpired between her, the prime minister, and his senior-most staffers over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

A win for the U.S. at the summit with North Korea may not be a win for America's allies in the region.

Michael Cohen's testimony in Washington today is clearly top of mind for President Trump at his summit in Hanoi.

D-Day for JWR

It's fairly rare that politicians become well-known enough to be referred to only by their initials.

Like FDR, or PET, DSK, or just plain-old W.

But Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former federal justice minister and attorney general, may already have joined those ranks.

Today is the day that JWR finally speaks (out loud in public, at least) about what transpired between her, the prime minister, and his senior-most staffers over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

It has been just 20 days since the Globe and Mail published its anonymously sourced article suggesting that Wilson-Raybould felt she had been improperly pressured to intervene in the prosecution of the Quebec engineering and construction giant, and subsequently demoted to a lesser cabinet portfolio after she refused.

Over that period, Wilson-Raybould has spoken mostly through her silence, first refusing to answer questions on the basis of solicitor-client privilege, and then resigning from cabinet ""with a heavy heart,"" but no additional details.

Justin Trudeau has spent the past three weeks trying to put out the flames.

He has denied any wrongdoing, as has Gerald Butts, his closest friend and advisor, who resigned from the PMO in the ""best interests of the office and its important work.""

Since then, Wilson-Raybould has addressed a closed-door meeting of her former cabinet colleagues, and has told the House of Commons of her desire for an opportunity to ""speak my truth"" about the allegations.

She has sought legal advice from a former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, and obtained a waiver, via a special order in council, that expressly allows her to share all cabinet ""confidences"" regarding her discussions about the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

However, the authority does not extend to her communications with Kathleen Roussel, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the woman who made the call to forge ahead with the SNC-Lavalin case last October, rejecting the company's bid to avoid possible criminal sanction via a remediation agreement.

Wilson-Raybould will open her testimony to the House of Commons Justice Committee late this afternoon with an extra-long, half-hour opening statement to offer her ""best recollection of all the relevant communications,"" and will stick around as long as there are questions.

But it surely won't be enough to extinguish the controversy, given her claims that she still can't speak fully and freely about her demotion, resignation, or what she said to her former cabinet colleagues during the private Feb. 19 meeting.

The three weeks of wall-to-wall coverage of the affair is clearly weighing down the Trudeau government.

Five of the six opinion surveys that have been taken since the news broke show that the Liberals have slipped to second place in voter intentions.

And CBC's aggregated Poll Tracker now has the federal Conservatives sitting almost two points up on the Liberals, with 35.8 per cent support compared to 33.9 per cent.

The fall 2019 election is still 235 days away, sufficient time for the Liberals to put the affair behind them.

But that all depends on what JWR plans to say.

North Korea's upper hand

A win for the U.S. at the summit with North Korea may not be a win for America's allies in the region, producer Anand Ram writes.

Between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, there are nine years of experience leading a country. Seven of those are Kim's.

While Trump hopes the meetings that kicked off today in Vietnam will be ""equal or greater than the first"" summit last June, some who have been watching North Korea's closed-off dictatorship for decades say the dealmaker-in-chief might not have the upper hand going in.

That's more than a little concerning to North Korea's neighbours, since what Trump may want to negotiate may not make them any safer from a North Korean attack, nuclear or otherwise.

The National recently spoke to Naoko Aoki, the Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Rand Corporation and a former journalist with Japan's Kyodo News agency, about the regional dynamics at play in Hanoi. Here are excerpts from the interview:

President Trump famously tweeted after the first summit in Singapore that there is ""no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea"" — is that true?

Naoko Aoki: I do not think that the North Korean nuclear threat has been reduced in any significant way.

When you think about the North Korean nuclear threat, I think it's useful to think about three elements. One, the North Koreans' ability to make fuel for nuclear weapons. The second is existing nuclear weapons, the ones that they've already built. And the third is their delivery systems — so these are missiles.

North Korea said in April, before the [first] summit, that it will no longer test nuclear weapons and missiles. And it has kept to this promise. But [all it] does is it prevents them from improving their existing missiles and nuclear weapons. It does nothing to reduce the number they already have.

In fact, they are not under explicit obligation to stop producing fuel for nuclear weapons.

Naoko Aoki is a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the RAND Corporation whose research includes security issues in the Asia-Paciic region with a focus on North Korea. (CBC)

Does the threat differ depending on where you live?

Aoki: Yes, I think so. The threat looks very different in Asia.

[Regarding] the United States, the North Koreans tested their most powerful missile in late 2017 and then declared that it could hit anywhere in the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. But there's some question as to whether they can really do that reliably.

Whereas in Asia, there are many places in the region they can hit — including U.S. allies South Korea, Japan and U.S. bases in the region — with nuclear-tipped missiles.

One of those allies is Japan. What are some of its concerns going into the summit, and what would a good outcome look like?

Aoki: Japan has two major policy goals for North Korea.

One is to solve a dispute with North Korea over the kidnapping of Japanese nationals in the 1970s and 1980s. This is a very emotional issue for Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said repeatedly that this is a policy priority.

The second issue is the nuclear threat. Japan wants a solution to the nuclear problem, too. So for this summit, anything that promotes a solution — or rather, moves a step closer to the solution — to either of those or preferably both of those policy goals will be a good outcome for Japan.

What would a bad outcome look like?

Aoki: This North Korea/U.S. process is probably going to be a step-by-step process. So that means you cannot, or probably can't, solve everything all at once. Something has to be prioritized.

And if the United States prioritizes, for example, the dismantlement of the long-range missiles that would reach the United States and capping the production of fuel for nuclear weapons, that would not really reduce the nuclear threat to Japan, because North Korea would still be able to hit Japan with nuclear-tipped missiles.

What would you like to see come out of this summit?

Aoki: I think a positive outcome would involve two elements, in my mind. One is an agreement on a longer-term workable framework toward denuclearization, and the narrowing of the gap between the two countries over the term 'denuclearization.' They mean different things [to both sides].

The second element includes concrete steps. The June summit produced a joint statement that was very vague and aspirational, but that did not lead to substantive denuclearization steps by North Korea. So I will be looking at whether this summit — the summit in Hanoi — will produce more tangible steps.

Watch as Adrienne Arsenault tackles the question ""Is the North Korea threat over?"" on The National:

North Korea has not conducted a single nuclear test in well over a year. After the first summit Trump tweeted: ""There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea."" But is he right? 2:04

Political panel

President Trump is in Hanoi, but Michael Cohen's testimony in Washington today is clearly top of mind for him, writes producer Tarannum Kamlani.

Con Man. Cheat. Racist.

These words are how many of Donald J. Trump's enemies have described him since he began his rise to the Presidency. But these epithets also formed part of the highly anticipated testimony by the President's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen before the U.S. Congress today.

Cohen's opening remarks were leaked to the media overnight and set the stage for some fireworks on Capitol Hill.

Cohen is set to go to prison in a couple of months for lying to Congress. Republicans have used this to try and discredit him, dismissing his testimony as part of a grudge against Trump.

Central logical problem for Rep Jordan <a href=""https://t.co/r9KTdHfaOP"">https://t.co/r9KTdHfaOP</a> —@davidfrum

Cohen's testimony is clearly on the President's mind as he engages in some international diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Hanoi.

He was reportedly up all night tweeting, among them this one: ""Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked's lawyer!""

In Hanoi, meanwhile, Trump's attempted charm offensive was on full display. The President told Kim, ""I think your country has tremendous economic potential, unbelievable, unlimited. I think that you will have a tremendous future for your country, you're a great leader, and I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen.""

Stakes are high for both leaders as the summit gets underway. Kim wants the U.S. to ease sanctions and build up his country's devastated economy. For his part, Trump has tried to win over Kim by stating that there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea, contradicting his own top diplomats.

Making sense of it all is The National's U.S. political panel tonight with Adrienne Arsenault. She's joined by Jai Chabria, Republican strategist and former chief of staff to ex-Ohio Governor John Kasich, and Stefanie Brown-James, co-founder of Collective PAC and member of President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, who will offer a view from the Democrats. The CBC's Keith Boag will also weigh in from Washington, D.C. Hope you'll join us!

551,Empty,2019-03-01T22:48:36Z,"The cartoon depicts former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould in a boxing ring, clad in leather fringe and feathers while wielding a tomahawk.","For the second time in two weeks, a political cartoonist is apologizing for his depiction of former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould in newspaper commentary on the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Yannick Lemay, who draws under the name Ygreck in the Journal de Que​bec, published a cartoon on March 1 portraying Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a boxing ring.

While the prime minister is in boxing attire, Wilson-Raybould is clad in leather fringe, moccasins and feathers and is wielding a tomahawk. The cartoon also appeared in the Journal de Montreal.

​""I'm very sorry,"" said Lemay, after receiving many comments on Twitter in reaction to the cartoon.

The purpose of the caricature is not to offend someone. If I offended someone with this drawing, obviously I'm sorry. I apologize. - Yannick Lemay, political cartoonist

""The purpose of the caricature is not to offend someone. If I offended someone with this drawing, obviously I'm sorry. I apologize.""

The cartoon was in response to Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday at the House of Commons justice committee about SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould recounted what she described as a well-orchestrated campaign by senior members of the Prime Minister's Office to pressure her to reach an agreement with SNC-Lavalin to help the Montreal-based engineering firm avoid criminal prosecution.

Earlier in February, an image by a Halifax political cartoonist, also set in a boxing ring, showed Wilson-Raybould in one corner with tape over her mouth, tied up and sitting on a stool. It was criticized for its insensitivity to violence against women, especially Indigenous women.

""When I get up in the morning my goal is not to insult someone,"" said Lemay.

""I've learned a lot today. The next time I have to draw an Indigenous person, I will have to ask myself what are the appropriate ways to imagine someone of Indigenous ancestry now. I admit that I have not found it for the moment but it will come.""

'They're blissfully ignorant'

Ellen Gabriel, a Mohawk activist and artist from Kanesatake, Que., called Lemay's depiction racist, irresponsible and demeaning.

""They're blissfully ignorant,"" said Gabriel.

""There's so many opportunities today for them to really understand the realities we're facing. There's reports. There's all kinds of studies. There are all kinds of people who are speaking out about how colonization has impacted us.""

She said bringing Wilson-Raybould's identity as an Indigenous woman into the issue was racist.

""It is not a part of the issue,"" said Gabriel. ""The issue is her role as the minister and attorney general, and what happened to her.""

​Harmful to Indigenous identities

Megan Kanerahtenhá:wi Whyte, a Mohawk artist and art therapist, said when non-Indigenous cartoonists stereotype Indigenous people, it is harmful for Indigenous people to reclaim their identity.

""Drawing a First Nations person in that way one-dimensionalizes First Nations people,"" said Whyte.

Megan Whyte has been the Eastern Door's editorial cartoonist for the past decade. (Megan Whyte/Eastern Door)

""It makes it that harder for people to reconnect with themselves because they don't look like that. It creates a lot of challenges, and stimulates that identity trauma that all communities face.""

Whyte has been an editorial cartoonist at the Eastern Door newspaper in Kahnawake, Que., for a decade. She draws Mohawk people ""just as people"" in her cartoons almost every week the paper is published.

""Images are really powerful, and they can be very dangerous,"" Whyte said.

552,Empty,2019-02-27T01:44:23Z,"The former attorney general will testify before the Commons justice committee Wednesday, responding to allegations she was pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in criminal proceedings against SNC-Lavalin.","In the face of Wilson-Raybould’s claim on the eve of her testimony that she still cannot talk freely because of restrictions Trudeau has kept in place, the prime minister defended the waiver his government granted to allow her to speak.

OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted Wednesday Jody Wilson-Raybould can tell her story in a way that settles once and for all whether or not anyone in his office pressured her to drop criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin.

For many Liberal MPs and cabinet ministers who have heard her concerns in private, it won’t change their minds and they hope it won’t change much for Canadians.

Wilson-Raybould, his former attorney-general, has got a story to tell. That much we know.

“The approach that we are taking both in the Ethics Committee and the Justice Committee is looking into the issue of whether or not the Attorney General underwent pressure or inappropriate pressure and she will be able to speak fully.”

This is a sacrosanct principle in Canada’s legal system. It means prosecutors make decisions on who to prosecute and how to apply the law free from partisan or political influence. It ensures everyone is equal under the law, and the criminal law will be applied equally to accused persons or corporations, no matter how much money or influence they have.

But to tease out answers that will tell a fuller picture — one that will be judged by legal, not just political standards — MPs will have to bear in mind some big principles at play when Wilson-Raybould finally takes a seat, and ask her probing questions even though she still complains she is not fully free to, as she put it, “speak (her) truth.”

As all eyes turn to the Commons justice committee Wednesday afternoon, the biggest questions are simple: was Wilson-Raybould pressed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or his officials to drop charges against SNC-Lavalin and cut a deal? Did she feel unduly pressured? If so, why didn’t she resign in protest as attorney general at any point? If not, why then did she resign from cabinet as veterans affairs minister on Feb. 11?

“What Canadians want is information and perspectives,” said International Trade Minister Jim Carr. “Canadians ultimately will be the judge of the issue and I’m satisfied and confident that that will be good for the government and our party.”

The questions here for Wilson-Raybould boil down to what was her view of the prosecution underway? Did she have a preferred course, or did she leave the decision entirely to Kathleen Roussel, her deputy attorney general and the independent director of public prosecutions? And did Wilson-Raybould regard Roussel’s decision — conveyed on Sept. 4 to the company — not to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin as final?

Yet even before Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, academics suggested there was a “troubling” pattern of PMO meetings with Wilson-Raybould under the guise that “robust” and “vigorous” discussions were permissible.

Deferred Prosecution Agreements

Also called remediation agreements, the government introduced these as tool to prosecute white-collar crime to the Canadian justice system in 2018 after public consultations. Subject to a court’s approval, a deferred prosecution agreement spares an accused company a formal criminal conviction that could see it debarred from future contracts in exchange for paying heavy fines, and being required to comply with ethical reforms and independent oversight.

But Wilson-Raybould as justice minister did not sponsor the change to the criminal code. Why was it instead stuffed into an omnibus budget implementation bill?

Was Wilson-Raybould aware of the SNC-Lavalin lobbying blitz to persuade Ottawa to make it the first test case, and grant it a deferred prosecution on bribery and fraud charges?

Did she fear it would set a bad precedent to give a deal to a company that has broken political financing rules and saw former executives plead guilty to bribery in a Montreal hospital construction project? When did she first communicate the DPP’s prosecution decision to the PMO or cabinet and what was the PMO’s reaction?

And a key question for the former justice minister is whether she agrees with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, who said the prosecution decision was Wilson-Raybould’s and that decision was “still open” for her to intervene and possibly overrule months afterward, despite the fact the preliminary inquiry on bribery and fraud charges began Oct. 29? Does she agree with Wernick that the decision is still an option “open” to her successor, Justice Minister David Lametti? Does that amount to intervening to stop a criminal trial?

Jody Wilson-Raybould set to speak about SNC-Lavalin affair

Opinion | Susan Delacourt: Justin Trudeau is following instead of leading on SNC-Lavalin

Discussions with attorney general about SNC-Lavalin were ‘troubling,’ legal expert says

The Meetings

We know of four times that Trudeau or his aides met with Wilson-Raybould or her staff, first in September and then a flurry of meetings in December. We don’t know if they were the only times it was raised with her, the tenor of the discussions, or even why SNC-Lavalin was raised.

Now it will be important for MPs to drill down to the purpose of the meetings and their tone.

Does Wilson-Raybould view these meetings as inappropriate? And if Wilson-Raybould felt she was being pressured on the file, did she view it as “undue” or “inappropriate” and why? Did Wilson-Raybould ever advise the prime minister or any of his officials that they were either dangerously close to or had crossed a line in talking to her about the SNC-Lavalin charges? If not, why not?

This is a critical question at the heart of these allegations.

One of those participants, Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned last week although he insists there was nothing wrong with his or the PMO’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould. But Michael Wernick and Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford remain in their posts.

Wilson-Raybould’s recollections of all these meetings could raise uncomfortable questions for those two.

Cabinet solidarity

Trudeau said publicly that if anyone including his former justice minister had felt “undue pressure or felt that we were not living up to our own high standards of defence of the rule of law and our judicial system and judicial independence, it was their responsibility to come forward and at no time in the fall did the former attorney general come forward to me.”

Mary-Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge, law professor and now practising lawyer, testified in fact that Wilson-Raybould in her role as chief prosecutor of Canada had a legal obligation to stand her ground, face those who would pressure her and not resign — if indeed she was pressured.

Other legal experts such as UBC assistant law professor Andrew Flavelle Martin have argued if Wilson-Raybould was pressured she had a duty to step down and publicly expose the reason why.

This too is a key question. Why didn’t Wilson-Raybould resign at any point prior to February to protest any interference or attempted interference at all in a criminal prosecution?

Wilson-Raybould remained in cabinet even after Trudeau shuffled her out of her job as attorney general and justice minister. We don’t know what Trudeau told her as the reason she was being moved, whether she bought his explanation, or viewed it as a demotion. We do know she appeared to do a slow burn at the cabinet shuffle, and later that day released a 2,000-word statement touting her achievements as justice minister and underlining the need for “our system of justice be free from even the perception of political interference.”

So what reason did Wilson-Raybould give the prime minister when she finally resigned on Feb. 11 after the prime minister touted her continued presence in cabinet as evidence that the cabinet was united?

Was it principle or petulance that lay behind her decisions?

Government’s version of events, Shawcross doctrine and caucus solidarity

From the first day the allegations broke on Feb. 7 in the Globe and Mail, Trudeau branded them as “false” and said there was no undue influence exerted on Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau and his cabinet ministers have tried to continue that narrative since then, but explanations have evolved as details of meetings emerged.

Wernick called all discussions with Wilson-Raybould “lawful advocacy.” So just what does Wilson-Raybould think of the Liberal government’s reliance on the so-called “Shawcross doctrine” to pursue what it admits were “vigorous” discussions with her? That is a concept imported from the U.K. which suggests that cabinet members can have robust discussions about what constitutes the public interest in a prosecution without crossing any lines.

A final key question — and one that could influence whether Wilson-Raybould remains in Liberal caucus as she has done to now — is how Wilson-Raybould’s recollections mesh with the government’s line.

The requirement to continually assess the strength of the prosecution case, evidence, witnesses, and changing circumstances are “an ongoing obligation” within the DPA (deferred prosecution agreement) regime, as in any prosecution, she said. Qualtrough, a lawyer, is the minister for federal procurement and shares responsibility for the government’s corporate integrity reforms. She underlined that she is not the attorney general and the definitive opinion would have to come from David Lametti, Jody Wilson-Raybould’s successor and a Quebec MP, but said her understanding is that it is remains open to the attorney general to intervene.

Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of the job as attorney general, she says, after she resisted political pressure from the prime minister and others to revisit the decision made by Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions, not to negotiate a deal with SNC-Lavalin. Roussel rejected a so-called “deferred prosecution agreement” for SNC-Lavalin on Sept. 4.

Wilson-Raybould says she did her own review of Roussel’s refusal and backed her move completely. The former attorney general refused when challenged by Liberal MPs to say what the lead prosecutor’s reasons, or hers, were. She cited the preliminary inquiry now underway in which SNC-Lavalin faces bribery and fraud charges, and the company’s court challenge of the prosecutor’s decision not to negotiate a deal. Wilson-Raybould says she told the prime minister she would not intervene, and that he should refrain from pressuring her to do so. “These are not cabinet decisions,” she told the justice committee on Wednesday. Lametti’s office refused to say whether Lametti feels the option is still on the table. “It would be inappropriate for Minister Lametti to comment on this as two court proceedings relative to this issue are pending before the courts,” said spokesperson Celia Canon in an email. But Qualtrough’s comments reflect a sentiment expressed by Liberal MPs who challenged Wilson-Raybould at the justice committee. Randy Boissonnault asked the former attorney general to agree that prosecutors must assess reasonable prospects for conviction as well as the public interest, and “the AG should have an open mind to new information coming in all the time. And really, the decision is never final because it’s still active?” Wilson-Raybould refused to discuss “any of the situations, scenarios, conversations about the national interest with respect to SNC-Lavalin” citing the ongoing two court cases. Qualtrough pointed to safeguards built into the regime that ensure fairness and transparency if a DPA were to be offered. If an attorney general decides to intervene, the decision or “directive” must be published in the Canada Gazette, the government’s official record of decisions. Qualtrough said that is really important because if the reasons are public-interest-based “from a fairness point of view you would have to substantiate why you were doing this.” Wilson-Raybould left little doubt Wednesday she suspects the government might still move to intervene in the prosecution. SNC-Lavalin has pleaded not guilty to charges of making illicit payments to the Ghaddaffi regime in Libya between 2001 and 2011. The preliminary inquiry into the charges started Oct. 29 and will resume April 1. SNC-Lavalin is trying to avoid the prospect of being debarred or banned from bidding on federal contracts for a 10-year period as is currently the policy.

Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the members of the justice committee for providing me the opportunity for extended testimony today. I very much appreciate it. Starting off I would like to acknowledge the territory, the ancestral lands, of the Algonquin people. For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people, excluding myself and my political staff, from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office and the office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC and I and/or my staff were a part of these meetings. Within these conversations there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC. These conversations culminated on December 19 of 2018 with a conversation I had with the Clerk of the Privy Council, a conversation that I will provide some significant detail on.

A few weeks later, on January 7, 2019, I was informed by the Prime Minister that I was being shuffled out of the role of Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. For most of these conversations I made contemporaneous notes, detailed notes, in addition to my clear memory, which I am relying on today, among other documentation.

Article Continued Below

My goal in my testimony is to outline the details of these communications for the committee and indeed all Canadians, however before doing that let me make a couple of comments. First, I want to thank Canadians for their patience since the February 7 story which broke in The Globe and Mail. Thank you as well specifically to those who have reached out to me across the country. I appreciate the messages and I have read all of them.

With that said, the remainder of my testimony will be a detailed and factual delineation of approximately 10 phone calls, 10 in-person meetings and emails and text messages that were part of an effort to politically interfere regarding the SNC matter for purposes of securing a deferred prosecution. The story begins on September 4, 2008 [sic]. My chief of staff and I were overseas when I was sent a Memorandum for the Attorney General pursuant to section 13 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, which was entitled, quote, “Whether to issue an invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin”, end quote, which was prepared by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel. The only parts of this note that I will disclose are as follows, quote, “The DPP is of the view that an invitation to negotiate will not be made in this case and that no announcement will be made by the PPSC”, end quote. As with all section 13 notices, the director provides the information so the Attorney General can take such course of action as they deem appropriate. In other words, the director had made her decision to not negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. I subsequently spoke to my minister’s office staff about the decision, and I did the standard practice of undertaking further internal work and due diligence in relation to this note, a practice that I have had for many of the section 13 notices that I received when I was the Attorney General. In other words, I immediately put in motion with my department and minister’s office, a careful consideration and study of the matter. Two days later, on September 6th, one of the first communications about the DPA was received from outside of my department.

This same day, my chief of staff exchanged some emails with my minister’s office staff about this, who advised her that the deputy attorney general, Nathalie Drouin was working on something and that my staff were drafting a memo about the role of the Attorney General vis-à-vis the PPSC. It was on or about this day that I requested a one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister on another matter of urgency, and as soon as possible after I got back into the country. This request would ultimately become the meeting on September 17th between myself and the Prime Minister that has widely been reported in the media. On September 7th, my chief of staff spoke by phone to my then-deputy minister about the call she had received from Ben Chin, and the deputy stated that the department is working on this. The deputy gave my chief a quick rundown of what she thought some options would be. On the same day, I received a note from my staff on the role of the Attorney General, a note that I also shared or that my office also shared with Elder Marques and Amy Archer at the PMO. The same day, staff in my office met with the deputy minister. Some excerpts of the section 13 note were read to the deputy minister, but the deputy minister did not want to be provided with a copy of the section 13 note. On September 8th, my deputy shared the draft note on the role of the Attorney General with my chief of staff who subsequently shared it with me, and over the next day, clarity was sought by my staff with the deputy on aspects of the options that were laid out in her note. A followup conversation between Ben Chin and a member of my staff, François Giroux occurred on September 11th. Mr. Chin said that SNC had been informed by the PPSC that it cannot enter into a DPA. Ben, again, detailed the reasons why they were told that they were not getting a DPA. Mr. Chin also noted that SNC’s legal counsel, Frank Iacobucci and further detailed what the terms were that SNC was prepared to agree to, stating that they viewed this as part of a negotiation. To be clear, up to this point I had not been directly contacted by the Prime Minister, officials in the Prime Minister’s office, or the Privy Council office about this matter. With the exception of Mr. Chin’s discussions, the focus of communications had been internal to the Department of Justice. This changes on September 16th. My chief of staff had a phone call with Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques from the Prime Minister’s office. They wanted to discuss SNC. They told her that SNC had made further submissions to the Crown and that there is some softening but not much. They said that they understood that the individual Crown prosecutor wants to negotiate an agreement but the director does not. They said that they understand that there are limits on what can be done and that they can’t direct, but that they hear that our deputy of justice thinks we can get the PPSC to say we think that we should get some outside advice on this. They said that they think we should be able to find a more reasonable resolution here. They told her that SNC’s next board meeting is on Thursday, which was September 20th. They also mentioned the Quebec election context. They asked my chief if someone had suggested the outside idea to the PPSC and asked whether or not we were open to this suggestion. They wanted to know if my deputy could do it. In response, my chief of staff stressed to them prosecutorial independence and potential concerns about the interference in the independence of the prosecutorial functions. Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Marques kept telling her that they didn’t want to cross any lines but they asked my chief of staff to follow up with me directly on this matter.

In the course of reaching this view, I discussed the matter on a number of occasions with my then deputy so that she was aware of my view, raised concerns on a number of occasions with my deputy minister about the appropriateness of communications we were receiving from outside the department, and also raised concerns about some of the options that she had been suggesting. On September 17th the deputy minister said that Finance had told her that they wanted to make sure that Kathleen understands the impact if we do nothing in this case. Given the potential concerns raised by this conversation, I discussed this later with my deputy. This same day, September 17th, I had my one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister that I requested a couple of weeks ago. . When I walked in, the clerk of the Privy Council was in attendance as well. While the meeting was not about the issue of SNC and DPAs, the Prime Minister raised the issue immediately. The Prime Minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC, citing that if there is no DPA, there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal. In response I explained to him the law and what I have the ability to do and not do under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act around issuing directives or assuming the conduct of prosecutions. I told him that I had done my due diligence and had made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the director. In response, the Prime Minister reiterated his concerns. I then explained how this came about and that I had received a section 13 note from the DPP early in September and that I had considered the matter very closely. I further stated that I was very clear on my role as the attorney-general and that I was not prepared to issue a directive in this case, that it would not be appropriate.

The clerk then said that he spoke to my deputy and she said that I could speak to the director. I responded by saying no, I would not, that that would be inappropriate. I further explained to the clerk and the Prime Minister that I had had a conversation with my deputy about options and what my position was on the matter. As a result, I agreed to, and undertook to the Prime Minister that I would have a conversation with my deputy and the clerk, but that these conversations would not change my mind. I also said that my staff and my officials are not authorized to speak to the PPSC, and then we finally discussed the issue that I had asked for the meeting for in the first place. I left the meeting and immediately debriefed with my staff about what was said with respect to SNC and DPAs. On September 19th, I met with the Clerk, as I had undertaken to the Prime Minister. The meeting was one-on-one in my office. The Clerk brought up job losses and that this is not about the Quebec election, or the Prime Minister being a Montreal MP. He said that he has not seen the section 13 note.

I told the Clerk again that I instructed that my deputy is not to get in touch with the director, and that given my review of the matter I would not speak to her directly regarding a DPA. I offered to the Clerk that if SNC were to send me a letter expressing their concerns, their public interest argument, it would be permissible and I would appropriately forward it directly to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Later that day, my chief of staff had a phone call with Elder Marques and Mathieu Bouchard from the Prime Minister’s Office. They wanted an update on what was going on regarding the DPAs, since “we don’t have a ton of time.” She relayed my summary of the meeting with the Clerk and the Prime Minister.

They asked whether that was true, if it wasn’t the Attorney General herself, but it was her staff or the deputy minister. My chief of staff said, “yes it would”, and offered a call with me directly. They said that they “will regroup and get back to you on that”. Still, on September the 19th I spoke to Minister Morneau on this matter, when we were in the House. He again stressed the need to save jobs. I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop, that they were inappropriate. They did not stop. On September the 20th, my chief of staff had phone calls with Mr. Chin and Justin Tao, both members of the Minister of Finance’s office about DPAs and SNC.

The next day, as well, SNC filed a federal court application, seeking to quash the DPP’s decision to not enter into remediation agreement with them. In my view, this necessarily put to rest any notion that I might speak to or intervene with the DPP, or that external review could take place. The matter was now before the courts and a judge was being asked to look at the DPP’s discretion. However, on October the 26th, 2018, when my chief of staff spoke to Mathieu Bouchard and communicated to him that given that SNC has now filed in federal court seeking to review the DPP’s decision, surely we had moved passed the idea of the Attorney General intervening, or getting an opinion on the same question. Mathieu replied that he was still interested in an external legal opinion idea. “Could she not get an external legal opinion on whether the DPP had exercised their discretion properly?” Then, on the application itself, the Attorney General could intervene, “seek to stay the proceedings, given that she was awaiting a legal opinion.”

He said that everybody knows that this is the Attorney General’s decision but that he wants to make sure that all options are being canvassed. Matthew said that if “at the end of the day, the Attorney General is not comfortable, that is fine”. He just doesn’t want any doors to be closed. Jessica, my Chief of Staff said “that I was always happy to speak to him should he wish. In mid-November, the PMO requested that I meet with Matthew Bouchard and [inaudible] to discuss the matter which I did on November 22nd. This meeting was quite long. I would say about an hour and a half. I was irritated by having to have the meeting as I had already told the Prime Minister, etc. that a DPA on SNC was not going to happen and that I was not going to issue a directive. Matthew in this meeting did most of the talking. He was trying to tell me that there were options and that I needed to find a solution. I took him through the DPP Act, section 15, section 10 and talked about the prosecutorial independence as a constitutional principle and that they were interfering. I talked about the section 13 note which they said that they had never received but I reminded them that we sent it to them in September. Matthew and [inaudible] continued to plead their case talking about if I’m not sure in my decision, that we could hire an eminent person to advise me. They were kicking the tires. I said no. My mind had been made up and they needed to stop. This was enough. I will briefly pause at this moment to comment on my own state of mind. In my role as Attorney General, I had received the decision of the DPP in September. I reviewed the matter, made a decision on what was appropriate given the DPA and communicated that to the Prime Minister.

On December 5th, 2018, I met with Gerry Butts. We had both sought out this meeting. I wanted to speak about a number of things including bringing up SNC and the barrage of people hounding me and my staff. Towards the end of our meeting which was in the Chateau Laurier, I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind any engagements were inappropriate.

On December 7 I received a letter from the Prime Minister, dated December 6, attaching a letter from the CEO of SNC-Lavalin, dated October 15. I responded to the Prime Minister’s letter on December 6, noting that the matter is before the court so I cannot comment on it, and that the decision re: a DPA was one for the DPP, which is independent of my office. This brings me to the final events in the chronology, the ones that signal, in my experience, the final escalation in efforts by the Prime Minister’s office to interfere in this matter. On December 18 of 2018 my chief of staff was urgently summoned to a meeting with Gerry Butts and Katie Telford to discuss SNC. They wanted to know where I, me, am at in terms of finding a solution. The told her that they felt like the issue was getting worse, and that I was not doing anything. They referenced a possible call with the Prime Minister and the clerk the next day. I will now read to you a transcript of the most relevant sections of a text conversation between my chief of staff and I almost immediately after that meeting:

I texted: MoJAG: So where were things left? Jessica: So unclear. I said I would of course let you know about the conversation, and they said that they were going to kick the tires with a few people on this tonight. The clerk was waiting outside when I left, but they said that they want to set up a call between you and the Prime Minister and the clerk tomorrow. I said that of course you’d be happy to speak to your boss. They seem quite keen on the idea of you retaining an ex-Supreme Court of Canada judge to get advice on this. Katie Telford thinks it gives us cover in the business community and the legal community, and that it would allow the Prime Minister to say we were doing something. She was like, “If Jody is nervous, we would of course line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper.” On December 19, 2018, I was asked to have a call with the clerk. It was a fairly lengthy call, and I took the call from him and I was on my own, by myself. Given what occurred the previous day with my chief of staff I was determined to end all interference and conversations about this matter once and for all. Here is part of what the clerk and I discussed. The clerk said he was calling about DPAs, SNC. He said he wanted to pass on where the Prime Minister was at. He spoke about the company’s board and the possibility of their selling out to someone else, moving their headquarters, and job losses. He said that the Prime Minister wanted to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate tool box. The clerk said that the Prime Minister was quite determined, quite firm, but he wanted to know why the DPA route, which Parliament provided for, wasn’t being used. He said, “I think he is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another. He is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.” The clerk said he didn’t know if the Prime Minister was planning on calling me directly or, “if he is thinking about somebody else to give him some advice. You know, he does not want to do anything outside of the box of what is legal or proper.” He said that, “The Prime Minister wants to understand more, to give him advice on this or give you advice on this if you want to feel more comfortable you are not doing anything inappropriate or outside the frame.” I told the clerk that I was 100% confident that I was doing nothing inappropriate. I again reiterated my confidence in where I was, and my views on SNC and the DPA had not changed. I reiterated this as a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. I warned the Clerk in this call that we were treading on dangerous ground here. I also issued a stern warning because, as the Attorney General, I cannot act in a manner, and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent. I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. This all screams of that. The Clerk wondered whether anyone could speak to the director about the context around this, or get her to explain her reasoning. The Clerk told me that he was going to have to report back to the Prime Minister before he leaves. He said again that the Prime Minister was in a pretty firm frame of mind about this, and that he was a bit worried. I asked what he was worried about. The Clerk then made the comment about how it is not good for the Prime Minister and his Attorney General to be at loggerheads. I told the Clerk that I was giving him my best advice and that if he did not accept that advice, then it is the Prime Minister’s prerogative to do what he wants, but I am trying to protect the Prime Minister from political interference or perceived political interference, or otherwise. The Clerk acknowledged that, but said that the Prime Minister does not have the power to do what he wants. All the tools are in my hands, he said. I said that I was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre, but that I was confidant that I had given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. The Clerk said that he was worried about a collision because the Prime Minister is pretty firm about this. He told me that he had seen the Prime Minister a few hours ago and that this is really important to him. That was essentially where the conversation ended, and I did not hear from the Prime Minister the next day. The Chair: I am just letting everybody know that as chair I choose to give you more than 30 minutes. You have exceeded it. I’d like you to be able to finish your statement. Is there anybody who has any objection to that? Some hon. members: Agreed. Hon. Lisa Raitt (Milton, CPC): No, and I don’t think anyone in the audience does either. The Chair: Okay. Please continue. Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould: Thank you, Mr. Chair. On January 7 I received a call from the Prime Minister and was informed I was being shuffled out of my role as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. I will not go into details of this call or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case.

My narrative stops here. I must reiterate to the committee my concern outlined in the letter to the Chair yesterday. That is Order in Council No. 2019-0105 addresses only my time as the Attorney General of Canada and therefore does nothing to release me from my restrictions that applied to communications while I proudly served as the Minister of Veterans Affairs and in relation to my resignation from that post or my presentation to cabinet after I resigned. This time period includes communications on topics that some members of the committee have explored with other witnesses and about which there have been public statements by others. The Order in Council leaves in place the various constraints, in particular cabinet confidences that there are on my ability to speak freely on matters that occurred after I left my post as Attorney General. Even with those constraints, I hope that through my narrative today the committee and everyone across the country who is listening has a clear idea of what I experienced and what I know of who did what, and what was communicated. I hope and expect the facts speak for themselves. I imagine Canadians now fully understand that in my view these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure or political interference to intervene was not appropriate. However, Canadians can judge this for themselves as we now have the same frame of information.

In saying this, I was reflecting what I understood to be the vital importance of the rule of law and prosecutorial independence in our democracy. My understanding of this has been shaped by some lived experiences. I am, of course, a lawyer. I was a prosecutor in the Downtown East Side of Vancouver, so I come to this view as a trained professional and committed to certain values as key to our system of order. My understanding of the rule of law has also been shaped by my experiences as an indigenous person and as an indigenous leader. The history of Crown-indigenous relations in this country includes a history of the rule of law not being respected. Indeed, one of the main reasons for the urgent need for justice and reconciliation today is that in the history of our country we have not always upheld foundational values such as the rule of law in relation to indigenous peoples. I have seen the negative impacts for freedom, equality and a just society this can have first-hand, so when I pledged to serve Canadians as your Minister of Justice and Attorney General, I came to it with a deeply ingrained commitment to the rule of law and the importance of acting independently of partisan political and narrow interests in all matters. When we do not do that, I firmly believe and know we do worse as a society. I will conclude by saying this: I was taught to always be careful what you say because you cannot take it back. I was taught to always hold true to your core values and principles, and to act with integrity. These are the teachings of my parents, my grandparents, and my community. I come from a long line of matriarchs, and I’m a truth teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our big house. This is who I am, and this is who I always will be. Gila’kasla. Thank you.

Prof. Donald Savoie, one of Canada’s preeminent scholars on the public service, said that following reforms initiated in 1989, the role of the Privy Council clerk — the nation’s top bureaucrat — has changed and he or she now walks a delicate line between public service neutrality and responsibility to the government of the day, whatever its stripe.

Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick — who has faced allegations of partisanship and opposition calls for his resignation over his testimony and role in the SNC-Lavalin affair — should tell Canadians how he manages to strike that balance, Savoie said. “I think he owes it to the public service to explain how he squares the … roles,” Savoie, who teaches public administration at the Université of Moncton, told the Star on Thursday. “I would be careful, however, to say that Wernick became partisan. I don’t think we can accuse Wernick of being partisan … but I would say, though, I’m sure he has an explanation,” Savoie added.

Wernick will have a chance to publicly do just that. On Thursday, the House of Commons’ justice committee summoned him to testify on the SNC-Lavalin affair for a second time. His testimony was a shocking development in the crisis facing the Liberal government, with Wernick firmly denying that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould faced any “inappropriate” pressure to give SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid criminal fraud and bribery charges.

Because his testimony largely matched the Liberal government’s version of events at the time, and because he suggested a Conservative senator should be condemned for using violent political imagery in a speech, pundits accused him of partisan support for the Trudeau government. But the modern position of clerk actually combines three roles, Savoie said: the secretary of cabinet, the head of the non-partisan public service, and the deputy minister — or top bureaucrat — to the prime minister. The three roles were combined into one position in the Public Service 2000 under reforms initiated by then-prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1989 — part of a reimaging of the role and function of the public service that took place in the United States and the United Kingdom around the same time. It was a monumental shift that public governance researchers are still writing about today. One of the criticisms of the reforms was it encouraged senior public servants to engage in “promiscuous partisanship” in the words of the late scholar Peter Aucoin — a blurring of the line between the rough-and-tumble of politics and the dispassionate execution of the government’s vision. Savoie said he didn’t agree with the changes in 1989 and he doesn’t agree with them now. “I’m not sure it was ever tenable” for the three responsibilities to rest with one person, Savoie said. Wernick’s next appearance at the justice committee is scheduled for Wednesday. He will likely face a kind of cross-examination in the light of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, which filled in more details about Wernick’s role in the still-unfolding scandal. A spokesperson for the Privy Council Office said Thursday that Wernick, who was present at Trudeau’s mini-cabinet shuffle at Rideau Hall Friday morning, will not be speaking with the media. “The clerk has provided testimony to the justice committee and has indicated that he will co-operate with the ethics commissioner,” wrote Stephane Shank in an email to the Star. “The clerk has no further comment to provide at this time.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

(“SNC”) (TSX: SNC) and some of the company’s officers and directors.

The proposed class action has been filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of all persons, excluding certain persons associated with the defendants, who acquired securities of SNC during the period from September 4, 2018 to October 10, 2018.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to disclose in a timely manner the decision of the Director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada that it was not appropriate to invite SNC to negotiate a remediation agreement. Once this information was revealed, the price of SNC securities dropped significantly, causing substantial damages to holders of SNC securities.

“Disclosure is the cornerstone of the Canadian capital markets,” according to Jay Strosberg, a managing partner at Strosberg Sasso Sutts LLP. “We look forward to SNC’s explanation as to why it delayed disclosure until October 10, 2018.”

The plaintiff seeks $75 million in damages for negligent misrepresentation and liability for secondary market disclosure pursuant to Ontario’s Securities Act.
